  nobody really cares about them . 
  even jobbik has better shit to do usually, 
  was n't he killed ? 
  ` trust ' , as in , they will do their job without complaining, 
   a la turkey i do n't think that 's the best example, 
  you could squirt bornholm and r\u00fcgen . 
  that 's not much if you ask me . 
  you should probably see a doctor . 
  even florida managed a cuba, 
  it 's not that they ca n't become europeans . 
  european is more of a cultural concept i think , it 's mostly about upholding western values , and i know many of these `` towelheads '' who do that . 
  hell , one of the best people i know in person is a lebanese immigrant, 
  that depends on the children , not me . 
  being french = / = being accepted in france if i went there as a hungarian i would most likely accepted there , even though i would never become french ( and would n't want to either ) stop putting nationality behind everything , you can be a valuable and accepted part of a community without being of the same nationality, 
  integrating = / = being french, 
  i used to know someone who flied those things . 
  they 're pretty cool , yeah , though i 'm not much of an expert in warplanes, 
  clearly gta 5 is haram if the glorious sultan still uses gta 4 . 
  i read 20 aks at first and i was like ` yeah that sounds like hungarian military strength ' and then i saw the `` k '' . 
  lol, 
  yeah totally not because we helped you out and supported you during the war, 
   thorlacius  thor fucking hell iceland is still norse ? 
  jelasic is a traitor, 
  so basically that means it 's hungarian then , okay . 
   goulash is slovak or romanian you are now banned from / r/hungary, 
  jesus christ dude , nsfl that shit, 
  that 's gta 5 not 4, 
  no , look at a map please . 
  i think he means all the german ones combined are roughly the same as the habsburg occupation zone, 
  stabbing in the back would imply that we were allies or trused each other in some way , which is clearly not true . 
  well idk i never lived in germany , here in hungary just in my town i know of multiple people who are 2nd generation immigrant and neither parent was born here , and nobody ever even questioned them if they 're hungarian . 
  idk how they identify and honestly could n't care less . 
  they 're here and they blend in perfectly , they do n't need to become hungarian by identity if they want to live here . 
  for example a high school here is led by a croatian and no one gives a shit . 
  ( not sure if he was born here though ) . 
  of course if they were assholes and did n't blend in well or behaved terribly then everybody would hate them ( like it is true for many gypsies ) , but those that do n't do bullshit like that get into the community easily . 
   well , they they were your neighbours ... france and germany were neighbors too , so ? 
  i mean seriously what did they do , other than being hostile all the time ? 
   geocache goddammit , are you that teacher of mine ? 
  i ca n't get a break from this shit , can i ? 
  because in america this is unavoidable . 
  you ca n't not become american , it 's forced on you against your choice . 
  if i had a kid there , for them it would be almost impossible to escape the label `` american '' , even if he does n't want it . 
  the best he could get is `` x-american '' , which is fucking ridiculous . 
  in america they take whatever unique identity you would or could and put you in this disgusting huge blob named `` americans '' and there 's nothing you can do to escape . 
  i take the european model over this at any time , which is that we leave your culture alone and let you be yourself . 
  and if you want , and only if you want , you can become part of this nationality , but it takes work and shit . 
  yay , let 's shittalk millions of people , most of which you did n't meet . 
   you will never be german aaaand ? 
  you realize that ethnicity is n't inclusive , right ? 
  that does n't mean you ca n't integrate into their society , that means that you will never be german . 
  this is n't nazi germany , you can live in germany and be respected without having to be german . 
    turks are different from europeans though  european is not an ethnicity . 
  what ? 
  so you can only be different by having a different ethnicity ? 
  that 's the most american thing i 've heard in a while, 
  the fuck does he mean we stabbed them in the back ? 
  we never meant to be friendly to them , and there 's no scenario where they would deserve it either edit : seriously , downvotes ? 
  he asked , i only wanted to laugh it out on my own, 
   hungary have stabbed czechs in the back lol . 
  yeah , but elected representatives actually have responsibility . 
  in a direct democracy you have a bunch of people with no responsibility whatsoever . 
  they will never be punished for a bad decision , even if they would deserve it . 
  secondly , elected people are better because they are people who are agreed and trusted to be capable of decision making . 
  your fellow citizens are n't agreed or trusted in such matters and never will be . 
  and thirdly , in any given area there will be some sort of differences regionally/ethnically/religiously and that will inevitably lead to riots after every single controversial vote . 
  and most of the time it 's better to have elected members from all sides have an agreement themselves rather than get the citizens to fight it out . 
  that 's different though , working for the local council , versus to work for a company, 
  what ? 
  no , trying to appeal to voters that would otherwise not vote for you is populism, 
  populism is hell of a drug for politicians, 
  you realize that politicians always look for new ways to make themselves more popular , right ? 
  no , i 'm not saying that . 
  i 'm saying that majority language is a completely disjoint thing from state language and it is harmful to everyone if you start merging the two terms . 
  just do n't , please . 
  you are saying that using anything other than the official language to refer to a city has irredentist connotations , unless said city has a unique name in english ( like the hague , copenhagen or naples ) . 
  for some reason this also does n't apply to kiev according to you . 
  but that has nothing to do with majority language . 
  take for example odorheiu , romania . 
  a whopping 2,5 % of the population speaks romanian there . 
  obviously you use the romanian name because it 's in romania , but can we stop pretending that it 's the majority somehow because it 's in that country ? 
  that 's not how things work, 
   papist oh yeah the youth festival . 
  anything centered at young people and made by politicians is a brainwash festival and sane people do n't attend it in my opinion . 
   in the pronunciation of the current native language in the area now this is really really bad . 
  first off there 's no such thing as native language of the area , that is in itself an incredibly ignorant thing to believe . 
  many places are multilingual , and there are places that are monolingual * in the language of the irredentists * . 
  majority language was not the wisest thing to bring up here , this tradition has nothing to do with majority language nd it never will , it has to do with state language . 
  a leftist definitely is looking for nationalist votes - looking to attract voters from outside his voterbase, 
  destruction of a 5000yo thing can be labeled many things , including a tragedy for the entire human race , as such labeling it only national is clearly shortsigted and almost certainly for political gain . 
  probably to gain nationalist supporters . 
  you can express genuine bad feelings without putting anything about any nation ( which is itself something created for political reasons , and beneficial almost exclusively for political purposes ) . 
  english is one of the few languages without an official written standard , there 's hardly much to ` know ' here . 
  there 's tradition and that 's it . 
  well i guess i can understand because there 's volcanoes there and the kurils , and i also like cold places ...  coming back from krakow i see :p / s i have no idea what you mean by that, 
  is the ap stylebook the bible of english spelling or what ? 
  are n't they the ones who did n't allow the spelling ` today ' until very recently ? 
  oh , well that makes more sense . 
  you mean petropavlovsk kamchatskiy ? 
  i 'm guessing it 's a lot of soviet infrastructure on the inside and a lot of woods outside .

  if we protect our own border we are shit , but if austria does it , that 's okay . 
  you ca n't just invite people to your country and then say they have to stay at your neighbor 's place . 
  [ video - chaos and protest in front of keleti station ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ac-zezdirm ) he says they have to sleep on the ground ... no , you choose to camp in the area in front of the train station and refuse to go to the refugee camp in bicske , 30 km from budapest . 
  obviously , since all these people came with the plan of going to germany . 
  if they were told they must stay in hungary , they would n't have set their feet on hungarian soil . 
  and now refugees blame hungarian authorities for enforcing the law and blocking their way to germany . 
  if austria closes the border and does n't let trains through and now checks every truck on the m1/a1 motorway , causing hours of waiting time and kilometers upon kilometers of traffic jams , then why are n't we allowed to control our border to serbia ? 
  why is our fence inhumane , but austria wo n't let the trains in ? 
  people ca n't seem to realize this is not about petty internal politics any more . 
  this huge flood of people is a real issue that needs to be solved . 
  pointing fingers at the other political side may be useful when discussing party-politics , but this is not that kind of issue . 
  germans and swedes seem to be okay with lowering their standard of living a bit . 
  maybe two weeks skiing instead of three . 
   must have heard something about germany germans protest with signs saying `` refugees welcome '' , merkel says they take all syrians ` without upper limit ' , 400 euro welfare + rent + food . 
  according to reports , when they arrived to munich they were ecstatic and euphoric ; i think they may expect more than the reality of germany , but it 's hard for them to know as germany really looks like paradise compared to the current situation in syria . 
  they heard all these fairy tale stories so when they arrive to the balkans or hungary they are disappointed . 
  western european media signals to them that the whole europe will receive them with open arms , with lots of free money , house and a great life . 
  and if we do , we get criticized by the media , like in this [ cnn video ] ( http://edition.cnn.com/videos/world/2015/09/01/budapest-train-station-closed-migrants-chant-damon-bpr.cnn ) . 
  if we do n't let them on the train it 's inhumane , if we do , we violate international law . 
  no wonder everyone is confused , even authorities , especially when austria , germany and sweden are all enthusiastic and do this `` refugees welcome '' demonstrations , merkel says there 's ` no limit ' for accepting syrians , etc. 
  in this atmosphere , how are hungarian authorities expected to keep them away from germany ?? 
  if we build a fence we are inhumane , if we give them place in the shitty overcrowded poor camps that we have , it 's inhumane , if we let them board trains , it 's against eu law , if we do n't let them , we are inhumane . 
  fuck this , really . 
  yeah and if we do n't let them on the trains we get criticized in cnn videos with disgusting voiceovers [ like this ] ( http://edition.cnn.com/videos/world/2015/09/01/budapest-train-station-closed-migrants-chant-damon-bpr.cnn ) , saying we are cruel to them for making them stay in the streets around the train station , when in fact they have no intention of going to the refugee camps outside budapest throughout the country , they want to go to welfare germany . 
  we will never be able to provide the same standard of living . 
  there 's no money for it . 
  we have our own poor people . 
  they do n't want to live in eastern europe . 
  you ca n't force them , unless you imprison them or build walls on the borders . 
  they will just go back to germany . 
  we do n't have enough money even for our poor people . 
  there 's no way eastern european societies would accept taking up more problematic people . 
  hungary registers over 90 % of them . 
  even merkel commended this . 
  but some try to escape the registration camps ( where they are not allowed to leave for 24 hours ) , then police have to chase them ( also they are entering all over the border , but if we build a fence to keep track of where they are , we are again bad guys ) , then they do n't go to the voluntary refugee camps ( where they are free to leave ) , instead they camp at the railway station , and demand to be cared for there , instead of the designated camps , thousands want to board trains , police stops them , we get [ warnings from geneva from the international organization of migration ] ( https://news.yahoo.com/ap-interview-migration-group-ready-help-influx-134711443.html ) that blocking their way to the trains just sends them to the arms of smugglers who will put them in inhumane trucks like the one where 71 died in austria , then yesterday we let them board the trains , more than 3000 reached munich , now merkel says germany has no responsibility to accept refugees from hungary , now today we closed the largest railway station , thousands chanting `` un , un '' `` germany , germany '' `` why ? , why ? '', 
  in front of the station . 
  what do you expect us to do ? 
  pull money straight out of our rectum and give them germany-level welfare ? 
  how ? 
  western europe has surplus wealth to host these people , we do n't . 
  merkel is playing a double game . 
  she says [ germany has no responsibility ] ( https://youtu.be/yaqwn0h1cps?t=36m26s ) ( video in german ) about the migrants who entered hungary and are now demanding to be let on the trains . 
  on the other hand she plays the tolerant , welcoming rhetoric , encouraging more and more people to embark on the journey or if they are already on the way then to get more excited . 
  i mean , is it our responsibility then ? 
  we can point to serbia . 
  why are * they * letting the migrants into hungary ? 
  we are just geographically on the way , otherwise we have nothing to do with this whole thing at all . 
  [ video - hungary closes main railway station amid influx of migrants ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2015/sep/01/hungary-closes-main-train-station-amid-influx-of-migrants-video ), 
  excluding ww1/2 : * fall of communism * revolution of 1956 with ww1/2 : * treaty of trianon * holocaust * german occupation * soviet occupation, 
  clearly you are a greater expert than those who made the official estimate of 800.000 . 
  okay , if we accept your 55 % rejection figure , that means 360 000 people will be let in this year . 
  what about 2016 , 2017 , etc ? 
  you think the problems in the middle east will be suddenly solved ? 
  yeah and if we force the people off the trains [ we get criticized ] ( https://news.yahoo.com/ap-interview-migration-group-ready-help-influx-134711443.html ) , too . 
   geneva ( ap ) -- countries like hungary that have blocked desperate migrants from traveling by train in europe `` push them right into the hands of smugglers , '' with potentially deadly consequences , the head of the international organization for migration said monday . 
   `` if you -- as they have just done in hungary -- if you deny them , although they have a paid ticket and you do n't let them to get on board , you push them right into the hands of smugglers , '' swing said , alluding to the migrants found dead in austria . 
  `` so they get into vans and into trucks and they die . '', 
  hungary closely respects eu law , catching almost all migrants on the southern border ( the fence makes it easier ) , our registration rate is 90 % + , which was also commended by merkel . 
  but then what ? 
  they do n't want to stay !, 
  should we put them in prison ? 
  in order to apply , you have to * get * into germany . 
  then a long long legal process starts while all people must be given accommodation . 
  even if germany denies asylum , the people are there . 
  how do you deport them ? 
  they will go back again , unless you physically close the border . 
  it 's chaos again . 
  keleti railway station was closed by the police and no trains have left for hours at this point . 
  [ thousands of migrants ] ( https://imgur.com/a/qo9sd ) outside the station , chanting `` germany , germany '' . 
  what can we do , really ? 
  [ some screenshots from live tv ] ( https://imgur.com/a/qo9sd ) police closed the station and no trains have left for hours at this point . 
  thousands of people outside , chanting `` germany , germany '' . 
  nobody knows what 's up . 
  they are not `` moved there '' , they camped there unofficially all over the place , filling the underpasses and the whole station . 
  the city administration put up these temporary things where they can stay instead of thousands of people blocking the pedestrian underpasses of the train station . 
  officially , they should leave budapest and go to a refugee camp such as in bicske , 30 km from budapest . 
  but they do n't want to do it as we can see . 
  the mayor said he set these up because he thought they would quickly move on by train instead of camping in these `` transit zones '' . 
  he probably did n't know that they do n't have their registration done yet and the government will not let them board the trains . 
  it 's a lot of legal chaos and nobody really knows what should be done . 
  police did let them through yesterday evening , probably violating international law , but austria accepted the trains , although they stopped some due to overcrowdedness ( you can imagine ) , but i do n't know how that was resolved . 
  the train was also let forward into germany to munich . 
  in hungary the average is around 490 $ . 
  germans know nothing about the situation in the east and assume that we only lack the `` good will '' . 
  no , there 's no money to solve our own problems either . 
  there 's no way people would accept importing more people who need welfare , while the north-east of hungary looks like it does today . 
  they also get it in hungary . 
  there are so called temporary `` transit zones '' in the train station , where there are things [ like this ] ( http://budapestbeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/screen-shot-2015-08-21-at-6.42.39-am-e1440132270598.png ) and of course they get it in the refugee camps as well . 
  this is why the government wants germany to make it clear that they legally allow us to let people through . 
  if we go according to international law and fingerprint them and keep them in hungary , we get things like  countries like hungary that have blocked desperate migrants from traveling by train in europe `` push them right into the hands of smugglers , '' with potentially deadly consequences , the head of the international organization for migration said monday . 
  https://news.yahoo.com/ap-interview-migration-group-ready-help-influx-134711443.html then if we let them through , we are violating the law and are bad guys for pushing the problem further into the eu . 
  there 's no solution here , but to organize ** direct airplane transport from around syria to germany ** . 
  skip all this bullshit in the intermediate countries and the smugglers . 
  i ca n't comment on the austria-czech republic comparison as i do n't know the prices there . 
  but the 10 % difference seems believable . 
  you still have to consider that while groceries may be 10 % more , you make 3 times as much money ( or up to 10x in certain professions ) . 
  and of course prices also vary on a store-by-store basis ( smaller , central ones are more expensive ) and on a city-by-city basis . 
  i have much experience in the prices in western germany ( both around cologne and stuttgart ) and in budapest . 
  germany is really cheap . 
  if you buy store-brand ( e.g.

  mobile companies work with * ridiculous * profit margins . 
  the difference between the eu and the proposed usga ( which would probably turn into the use , especially if some countries joined ) is that the eu is a lot looser . 
  the usga would have been a single state with a single head of state . 
  the criteria for a state is a common money , military and foreign policy . 
  the eu fulfills 1.2 of these criteria ( 0.7 or so of the eu has common money and there is some kind of a common foreign policy , for which i would give 0.5 ) . 
  the usga would have fulfilled all three and a common foreign policy ( and a common army to back it up ) means that it could protect its interests better . 
  this is part of the reason why i advocate further integration of the eu : we house 4 of the 10 largest economies in the world ( 4. : germany , 5. : france , 7. : uk , 9. : italy ) , the eu together would be the second , overtaking both china and japan ( the economies of the four countries in the top 10 are larger than china ) but without a common foreign policy we ca n't utilize it . 
  had this plan been realized , it would have been the core of a more federated united states of europe . 
  today we would probably have the eu on the west and the use on the east , probably with a bunch of treaties ( free trade ) between them . 
  or the use would be a member of the eu . 
  i do n't support this initiative because of the economic and political repercussions ( it would floor the competitiveness of european companies against companies in other first-world countries and a huge part of the population would be completely dependent on state-supplied money , which could - and would - be used to buy their votes ) . 
  but the charter is n't really useful here . 
  one could claim that having to work for shelter and food is forced labor and thus it 's against article 5 . 
  and one could claim that any tax is against article 17 . 
  \\* looks up \\* shortage solved . 
  ( i 'm living in maastricht ), 
  honestly , those guys are pretty much harmless . 
  besides , shooting composite bows is fun as hell . 
  and at least your parties have actual ideologies . 
  more than what could be said about ours ... 
  that 's what i meant , autocorrect would mangle my name like that . 
  i agree , and we should be on the streets . 
  but to understand it , you have to look at the historical context . 
  mszp ( hungarian socialist party ) governed the country between 2002 and 2010 in coalition with szdsz ( alliance of free democrats - `` liberals '' ) until 2007 and in a minority government afterwards . 
  they fucked up . 
  not a bit , but a lot . 
  ( words of ferenc gyurcs\u00e1ny said at a party congress in 2006 , prime minister between 2005 ( or was it 2004 ? ), 
  and 2009 ) . 
  people wanted change . 
  that 's why fidesz ( alliance of `` young '' `` democrats '' ) won with a landslide . 
  they had the power to fix things . 
  they had the power to get rid of the corruption , push through reforms that should have been done 20 years earlier , etc. . . and they managed to continue fucking up the country . 
  the turks are lucky , they have plenty of kemalists and secularists and they have parties they could support . 
  what do we have ? 
  we have the aforementioned mszp . 
  they fucked up the country . 
  we have dk ( `` democratic coalition '' ) , the party of ferenc gyurcs\u00e1ny . 
  he led the fucking up . 
  we have the lmp ( `` politics can be different '' , liberal ... ish ) . 
  after they got into the parliament , their revolutionary rhethorics became much more moderate . 
  and in moderate , i mean they are only opposing symbolic measures of the government . 
  we have jobbik , legitimate fascists who are pretty much the lackeys of fidesz . 
  fidesz has already worn down a far-right party during an election , this time it wo n't be different . 
  and we have the party of gordon bajnai ; they could at least try to unfuck the economy , but their rhetorics are too cerebral and to govern they would have to ally themselves with the mszp , the lmp or the dk . 
  fact is , we just lost hope and pray that the fidesz is n't altering the deal any further . 
  you 're from mobile and meant to link me , i presume . 
  yes , i am in opposition to the current government . 
  not like i liked the previous one , but at least they tried to conceal their corruption . 
  and they wo n't condemn erdogan either , they do n't want to legitimize any anti-government protest ( except the ones they did ) . 
  yes . 
  the turkish government is blatantly violating human and civil rights . 
  at the very least , our governments should condemn the police brutality in official statements . 
  if a full-blown civil war breaks out ( which is not impossible ) we should send at least humanitarian aid . 
  it 's about time for europe to stick by its values . 
  developed , cold as fuck , they like their alcohol and estonian is one of the few finno-ugric languages . 
  well , * officially * we ought to use `` az '' for animals ( that 's the same `` it '' as for objects , kind of the same as the `` se '' you mentioned , also the same as the definite pronoun for words starting with a vowel and the word for `` that '' ) but no one corrects you if you use '' \u0151 '' ( especially for pets with personalities ; in that case we use '' \u0151 '' as well - it 's the same as the finnish h\u00e4n ) . 
  also known as `` szalonna '' in hungary and `` salo '' in ~ ~ romania ~ ~ ukraine ( i knew it was one of our neighbors ... ), 
  you have 21 \u00b0 c. 
  it 's 9 \u00b0 c here right now . 
  on the 29th of fucking may . 
  i just * had * to move to western europe last fall ... 
  that 's a bad idea . 
  i do n't smoke , but i would buy a coffin-shaped box just for the box itself . 
  we have already screwed up by not starting with albania , but why do n't we go alphabetically ? 
  * tall , busty blonde girls . 
  * pretty good football team . 
  * volvo and saab . 
  * death metal from g\u00f6teborg and the surroundings . 
  | . . | , * cold as fuck . 
  * produces furniture that have funny names and you have to assemble it yourself * language close enough to german that i could read it , though i would n't be able to understand it when spoken . 
  sk\u00e5l !, 
  because the government can claim that they gave something without actually giving something . 
  hell , if they were actual balls where you could rent period clothes and dance waltzer , i would consider going . 
  exactly . 
  for example , residents are complaining that there 's pee and vomit on the streets after a party . 
  that 's a completely legitimate complaint . 
  proper reaction : put out public toilets and more trash cans . 
  local governments ' reaction : harass the pubs and limit opening times . 
  you know what would also prop up the birthrate ? 
  having an actually working economy that 's not choked up by the billions of different taxes . 
  in hungary it 's not exactly hard to find people of your preferred sex , especially near universities . 
  there are a lot of things that suck about hungarian cities , but the nightlife is n't one of them ( despite the local governments ' continuous attempts to drive out the famous `` ruin pubs '' in order to appease the pensioner voters ) . 
  hungary : * extra tax on advertisements , biggest commercial tv channels consider leaving the country . 
  * the pension bonus of 109 former agents of the socialist system was taken away . 
  meanwhile , the governing party voted `` no '' for the bill that would reveal the list of agents ( they are full of former agents themselves ) . 
  * social burial became free ... if the family prepares the body , digs the grave , lowers the coffin and reburies the grave . 
  * i do n't know how to write this to sound less absurd , so here it goes : yesterday was the first national matchmaking dance . 
  yeah , that 's an event , organized from government money , aimed at university and college students to help them find their future husband / wife . 
  yeah , the college and university students are reeeeeeeeealy interested . 
  then maybe they wo n't burn hungarian flags in athens . 
  ( rule-bending is pretty standard with our politicians too , i do n't think he would lose a night 's sleep over it ), 
  yup , we know we ca n't win . 
  i think next time we should send some grindcore band . 
  i do n't know either . 
  we ca n't really rely on the diplomatic bonus ( there was [ an analysis on reddit recently ] ( http://www.student.dtu.dk/~s093020/dataanalysiswebsite/ ) showing the `` friendship graph '' , hungary has absolutely no friends ) . 
  well , at least it was n't the same cheesy bs as the other productions ( it was a different kind of cheesy bs , the people i was watching it with laughed their asses off as i translated the lyrics ) . 
  i still think that at least germany 's 12 points was a diplomatic move - hungary is a fairly important economic partner and with merkel 's criticism towards the hungarian government , they wanted to show that they have no problem with the country itself . 
  they most definitely ca n't get married . 
  i do n't know about civil unions , maybe that 's still allowed , but even if it is , civil unions have much less rights ( for example , they do n't even count as a family in the eyes of the law , that 's one of the other new things in the constitution - family = siblings , children and spouses ; life partners and life partners ' children are n't family members anymore ) . 
  my guess : is sexual orientation and gender identity protected in the constitution the same way as , for example , race ?

i came here to watch norwegian sailors returning home , and you are talking about how isreal is the military superior of europe . 
  what ? 
  why ? 
  how ? 
  it is n't stockholm either , but here we are . 
   trump thing you mean saudi-arabia ? 
  they have money and influence in the us sadly , nobody can ignore or deny that . 
  sad !, 
   former admins you mean obama , the nobel peace prize winner , who droned half the world and then stressed just how important an ally saudi-arabia is to the us . 
   islam ca n't believe i 'm saying this , but not all of them are like that , only 70 % or so :d . france takes in anybody from the former colonies who can speak french . 
  algerians are swarming there , industrial leaders are all too happy with this because , hey cheap work force . 
  germany wants to show the world how nett und tolerant they are , because merkel fears bad press . 
  no , what angers me is there was no `` filtration '' in regards with immigration , islamic or otherwise . 
  this continent just continues to self-flagellate because muh colonialism and past ebil empires . 
  they just took in a lot of people from vastly different background and in such numbers that the creation of ethnic ghettos were inevitable , not to mention there was no plan to integrate them , `` they will go home eventually '' . 
  migration is increasing due to rising population and global warming . 
  and there will come a time when europe will have enough , and then ... you can have three guess what happens next . 
  edit : formatting, 
  diversity-san and multiculti-kun . 
  i do n't hate islam tbh famalam , because it has few peaceful branches . 
  what is cancerous is wahhabi sect , which is heavily mixes it with arab tribal culture , and is propped up by the rich saudis because the politicians sure love them oil monies . 
  i have zero issues with my doctor from iran , or the turkish owner of the kebab restaurant . 
  they also do n't beat their wives , let their daughters dress however they want . 
  an increasing minority nowadays . 
  but hey , saudi-arabia is a trusted western ally , believe me !, 
  edit : word, 
  nothing like that happened in budapest so far , but i just ca n't figure out why ... must be the ghoulash . 
  wait , you do n't ? 
  :d i 'll even donate them money if they fuck off for good . 
  i grew in the poorest , most agrarian part of hungary . 
  my town has a 20 % gypsy minority . 
  i love it when western europeans get smug about how eastern europeans treat the gypsies . 
  i want to offer you a challenge : i invite you to my town 's gypsy ghetto . 
  based on how long you can survive , the more left i 'll vote . 
  care to try that , mate ? 
  he was just french . 
  * do n't bully pl0x *, 
  agreed . 
  rest in peace . 
  most of them already hate europeans , they are only here for the gibsmedats . 
  poor frenchmen ca n't catch a break ... 
  the gypsies never integrated and never will despite living here since the 15th century . 
  because someone has to clean their toilets and work on the fields for shit money . 
  communism has never been tried properly !, 
  * something something holodomor *, 
  remember , no zoroastrianism . 
  being smart is very relative . 
   who said it , you ? 
  yes , i am the real-life frank underwood . 
  fear me !, 
  trying to apply logic to human behaviour fails from time to time . 
  our ability to hold conflicting opinion is interesting , scary and ultimately resulted in countless atrocities and unholy unions . 
  i wish i was kidding . 
  you would n't be able to tell her sexual orientation because she is `` girly '' . 
  she is an avid commenter on kurucinfo , and a jobbik fan . 
  the irony is apperently lost on her . 
  edit : clarification, 
  i had a lesbian schoolmate who worshipped hitler . 
  such is life in eastern europe . 
  thanks for the greek myths , epics , philosophy and history . 
  perseus was my childhood hero . 
   and honestly , whenever somebody from eastern europe screams at germans not being particulary fazed about the refugee situation , it feels like they are just mad germany didnt spend those billions on them . 
  you are not our rich uncle , you do n't owe us or have to give us anything . 
  the cohesion funds are just little more than barganing chips . 
  i am just displeased and irritated that you blow away 20bn euro on an ultimately useless endeavour . 
   germany can spend 20b a year for people that arent worth anything to us and it doesnt hurt us in any way . 
  instead of investing it in artificial intelligence , infrastucture , affordable housing , renewable energy , medical technology , military research , you blow away money because `` oh well , what can you do '' . 
  if a mosquito sucks your blood , instead of swating it , you let it even though it will itch like hell later . 
  flawless fucking logic you got there . 
   should we go back to the otomam empire , send newborns to be trained in the turkish military , so they can come back and murder us from time to time ? 
  or should we join the glorious putin 's federation ? 
  i love bulgarian posters :d, 
  if the crisis of 2015 taught me one thing it was that countries shitted on each other and the general sentiment was : `` screw everybody but me '' . 
  if hungary , with a population of 10 million and with a marginal economy was able to play germany , the world 's fourth largest economy with 80 million people during the refugee crisis , well then it says a lot about the german goverment . 
  edit : grammar correction, 
   just to become vassals of the soviet union the gall ... 78 years ago your nation started a war which devastated eastern europe , millions of citizens died , you sucked the land dry , and enabled a system that affected us to this very day . 
  do n't misunderstand , i bear no hatred towards the germans of now , but it is part your history and it shaped both you and us in very different ways . 
  patriotism is one of the things that remained for us , if you want to throw it away that is your decision , but do n't expect us to blindly follow . 
  i do n't know , my soul feels breddy gud . 
   white privilige you know , there is an entire continent filled with people rich in melanin . 
  if you move there , you do n't have to suffer from dem rayciss whitey opresshun . 
  top notch bait . 
  honour killings , acid attacks , forced to wear the nazg\u00fbl clothing , ca n't go out to the street without supervision , women ca n't drive in saudi arabia ... 
  i 've encountered arab students from oil rich countries at the university . 
  i have never seen a more moronic , lazy , arrogant , hypocritical and hedonistic people before or after . 
  they treat women like a piece of meat , with all that implies . 
  sad !, 
  there is a wonderful saying : speech is silver , but silence is golden . 
  he only got to the first part yet . 
  also as i understand , he is trying to tip the incoming turkish referendum to his favor , because currently he is losing . 
  you are completely right . 
  i slap and choke my girlfriend daily , but only if she asks . 
  i do . 
  will do !, 
  you watched logan too many times dude . 
  :d edit : a word, 
  on a side note : your language , culture , art , history and country seems really interesting to me . 
  a small nation , yet the second biggest agricultural exporter , rotterdam was rebuilt from nothing and became the largest port in europe and the tenth largest in the world . 
  you reclaim and lose land to the see ; `` god made the world , but the dutch made the netherlands '' indeed . 
  fascinating .

  they do n't have to be hungarian for that . 
  for example pretty sure everyone knows that damjanich was serbian , yet no one cares . 
  `` you 're not allowed to criticize anything because your country does x '' ... 
  by inside the country i think they mean the traditional borders . 
  i mean i do n't think most people think of the same thing when someone is born in kom\u00e1rno or in shanghai . 
  okay i ran out of latin phrases . 
  nice chain though, 
  ratio educationis, 
  not british english though . 
  i do the second one all the time, 
  i think it accurately represents that dutch people do n't really know where that blob is and/or do n't care, 
  do n't need to know latin , just the specific words, 
   comparing the slovenian and croatian version of the description on the air freshener i always tried to find the words i recognize from hungarian and always found out that the slavic variants are fucking unpronounceable . 
  also , american english usually does n't merge `` got '' and `` gotten '' , unlike most british variants, 
  tfw nobody will ever understand your language, 
  it 's always like in german `` gro ** \u00df ** '' . 
  never like '' ** s ** auer '' . 
  the latter sound is written with a simple ` z ', 
  hogy means `` that '' , and gondol means `` to think '' :p give up , you 'll never just look at it and understand . 
  we wo n't let you be able to do that :p, 
  i highly doubt that they would be common enough to imply that it was the thing that replaced traditional religion there . 
  the sz is just a normal / s / sound . 
  what we spell `` s '' is pronounced like an `` sch '' in german, 
  they do n't in hungary , and i 'm pretty sure that hungary is culturally way closer to czechia than sweden . 
  nice . 
  always nice to see religion going away, 
  pretty sure they do n't, 
  that 's the coast of california your picture is showing, 
  so is this what western europe is like ? 
  people are worried about the poor poor state 's feelings ? 
   no budapest jesus christ guys , do something . 
  budapest 's protest scene is really going down the shitter these days, 
  is that the area where the island of great britain will be transferred when it leaves the eu ? 
  yeah since like what , 70 years ? 
  in what way does an eu referendum give away sovereignty ? 
  the eu constitution restricts the eu and refers to the eu , not any of the member states, 
  doesnt matter . 
  its the eus constitution , not the member states ' . 
  if they would like to continue with a constitutionless eu , then they can at any time leave and make their own unconstitutional eu, 
  holy crap we actually managed to grow compared to budapest . 
  damn, 
  i do n't really understand the whole country-based thinking . 
  fidesz and orban should lose their right yes , hungary shouldnt, 
   europe is n't a country and then what ? 
  you can make it a country in a day at this point . 
  just write that eu constitution already, 
  well , any ultras , not just the football ones, 
  hungary is definitely way more . 
  losses are often cited as 1 million , which would be more than 10 % . 
  does this count with the 1939 ( or 1941 ) area of hungary as a starting point ? 
   well centralisation does n't mean thart the power is close to you . 
  you seem to imply that decentralization would mean that though . 
  it does n't , it 's just that you 're governed from a different distant place . 
  so basically , no difference, 
  that 's just not the same, 
  well that makes no sense . 
  most people will be governed from far away anyway, 
  no , its where protests are held, 
  pls do it quick, 
  oh yeah , like , the parliament `` elects '' the president . 
  that counts as an election these days ? 
  hungary , presidential elections ? 
  what ? 
  thats the eurozone not the eu, 
  who told you that ? 
   did they have much support from rural areas too probably . 
  the thing is , you do n't protest in rural areas . 
  it 's absolutely useless . 
  if you want change , you have to go to budapest to protest an help the locals . 
  this is pretty fucked up , but that 's how fucking budapest-centered this country is . 
  and of course the budapest-centered political elite is n't exactly in a rush to change that . 
  so in short : probably rural voters were there in budapest, 
   and 170k is a lot for a country that is hungary 's size so like ... what is he thinking ? 
  that was a different guy , gyurcs\u00e1ny . 
  he was just as bad though , less authoritarian but he compensated with other things . 
  there were protests with 150k-ish people under orb\u00e1n as well though , so the point stands . 
  for comparison , the 1956 revolution topped at about 200k protesters , although at the time hungarys population was lower . 
  you learn something everyday :p, 
  eh , you can get used to it , 
   odessa oblast i think you just mean the budjak . . 
  yeah , we had protests way bigger than that against orban as well . 
  he just does n't give up this easy . 
  there are some people who just look at the flair and judge by that . . 
  i have him tagged as a nationalist as well , and it seems like i was n't wrong when i did that, 
  i ca n't change that , i do n't live in budapest, 
  why would you give the area to slovakia , who clearly do n't have any idea how to treat minorities ? 
   last sunday we had the biggest protest ever it was still pretty small compared to what usually goes on in hungary . 
  in 2006 there were * those * protests against a similarly shitty guy as orban , 170k people , literally sieged the state tv 's building and some drunk protester stole a tank as well . 
  nothing happened . 
  does n't even sound bad at all . 
  last time they were in power we were a world power , sooo ... 
  if you removed zakarpattia ( for totally no reason at all ) it would look even better, 
  why the fuck would we do that ? 
  where would we get cheap prostitutes from then ? 
  and cigarettes ? 
  huh ? 
  well did n't he work in zagreb and budapest a lot ? 
   slovakia count as separate state ( created in 1 january 1993 ) there was a slovakia around 1939-1945 too ( sort of ), 
  or europe, 
   nazism will inevitably be automated one day and this is how bender from futurama was born,

  do you have a source on that ? 
  eurostat will release data for q4 in march . 
  also i know that at least on the the asylum request is judged on the spot and in 99 % of cases denied so most of them will not enter hungary . 
  slightly related , there was a story today about more and more german parents move their kids away to less multi kulti schools - the article was wandering will there be something akin white flight in us . 
  do n't know where you get your info from . 
  this link shows daily illegal border crossing : http://police.hu/hirek-es-informaciok/hatarinfo/elfogott-migransok-szama, 
   even hungary still had hundreds arriving every day after they build up their fance err , this is incorrect . 
  more like a few tens which landed promptly in jail . 
  or research on public safety perception, 
  look at the bright side . 
  soon you will be a millionaire , 
  governments want to get elected . 
  they get elected if people have money - i.e. 
  jobs . 
  you ( i think ) mentioned japan as a bad example since the gdp was not increasing . 
  imo the middle class japanese has a better standard of living than the middle class ( shrinking ) american . 
  so no , gdp is not everything , there are many other factors . 
  no , but they do n't come necessarily together . 
  so if what you consider is gdp/capita you might need a decreasing population ( considering gdp stays stable ) . 
  we do n't have anymore extreme left around here , but they killed more than 200 ... from what i take from media the extreme left will also kick the asses ( and heads ) of people who disagree with them - something along the line of `` kill all extremists '', 
  could someone please tell me again why extreme right is worse than extreme left ? 
  i dislike both extremes ) . 
  tl ; dr : dublin is bad because some migrants are stuck in hungary & co instead dreamland ( i.e. 
  finland ) . 
  key statistic used :  nearly 71,000 asylum seekers were moved from one eu country to another between 2010 and 2014 , according to the most recent europe-wide data if we compare the 71k with the 1.1 million which are only in germany i 'd say the premise of the article is overly click bait . 
  also as many articles on the topic this also fails to make a decent proposal on what to do . 
  sorry , bad wording - i meant why the government is n't investing more - i remember reading complaints that germany had it 's own austerity package as well with spending being reduced across the board . 
   apparently it 's better to sit outside the market in cold or rainy weather also my advice is to never give money to woman begging with their toddlers - please call social protection instead immediately . 
  ( and give money to any charity ) . 
  did you noticed how the toddlers are always sleepy ? 
  a crying baby will bring public wrath on the `` mother '' . 
  there are chances the babies are drugged so that they sleep . 
   in order for the gdp to continue growth so should the goal of a country be to increase their gdp or to have prosperous citizens ? 
  care to explain ? 
  i mean nothing is destroyed here . 
  ok , but then why does n't the government also invests in infrastructure , education , hospitals , elder care etc ? 
  ( this are all money granted to stay in the country - except maybe for imported medicine ) . 
  not to speak that this is exactly what schlaube did not allowed greece to do . 
   this is why the vehement free speech advocates are laughable idiots i am a free speech ~ ~ advocate ~ ~ idiot then . 
  it 's my choice weather i get offended or not by your insult but at the same time i do n't think your comment should be censored by anyone . 
  what 's a ct ? 
   i did n't downovote the post btw . 
  sorry , i miss your point - what is that you want ? 
  should the mods here auto-ban all users who post also there ? 
  i think this answer was meant to someone else , 
  well , you answer to your own question here : whatever proposal there is there 'll always be someone saying it 's not good for them - and i fully agree it would be better to have a common asylum policy . 
  also that would probably mean moving a very sensitive topic ( immigration ) more to the commission which will be a tough sell . 
  unfortunately , currently not even the repatriation treaties are not at eu level ( each country has to negotiate separately ) . 
  the only common thing so far which seems to be working is that if a person has a interdiction from any schengen state he can not enter into any of those . 
  chill dude - i think the forced redistribution is off the table for the time being . 
  why , everybody will magically become prosperous ? 
  that 's one of the reasons i do n't like the quota system ( unless we have a common eu wide asylum granting system ) - otherwise i want only those gaining refugee status under hungarian laws . 
  are you sure the word to be used is racism and not xenophobia ? 
  in my understanding racism is considering some color skin to be superior . 
  xenophobia is irrational fear of foreigners . 
  ... or with a bazooka ( for self defense against people with concealed weapons ) . 
  well , we had basically two between ' 45 - ' 89 . 
  ( rakosi and kadar ) . 
  in the ' 89-today period the viktator has cummulated 10 years and counting followed by gyurcsany with 4.5 years, 
  ca n't agree more , apparently people fond of russia do n't understand the difference between being nice to a bully ( to save your skin ) and being nice to a partner ( for mutual benefit ) . 
  misleading title . 
  austria is still letting in majority of migrants . 
  edit : seriously , this source is not auto-banned ? 
   you should probably stop using those two words synonymously then , as they 're completely irrelevant to each other . 
  you are right , mea maxima culpa - got rekt a bit below . 
   what does `` subtle news '' mean ? 
  you gave an example of subtle influencing - i tried to say that the us involvement in afganistan was not subtle at all . 
   us , unlike russia , did n't invade afghanistan i ran out of tinfoil hats - errrr , after 9/11 what did us did ? 
  if you are talking about the `` old '' war you are right but then russia did n't invaded vietnam either ( same thing ) - it 's called proxy war . 
   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etxmccsmod0 thanks for making me laugh  - and you are obviously right to certain extent - however , bosnia did n't receive any significant amount of money from eu so far . 
  ( heck , even pre-joining funds are small ) . 
  at a basic level , bosnians ( see , i learnt  ) want to join because they want to live better . 
  however , a key difference between eu and russia-ee is that one one hand you have a union , on another you have a master-servant relationship . 
  sadly , you are right - although i think this `` projecting influence '' is sometimes as meaningless as the reddit karma points . 
  geopolitical pissing contest between superpowers . 
  ouch , me bad . 
  sorry - editing my threads . 
   what about the croat and serb populations ? 
  by ~ ~ bosniak ~ ~ bosnian i mean citizen of bosnia !, 
  croatians will probably support it for obvious reasons and serbia applied in 2009 . 
   eu and nato work in subtle ways . 
  their kind of controlling is not as open and confrontative as the kind you find in russia . 
  anyway , we were talking about eu - how exactly did eu convinced in ( a subtle ) manner the whole ex-communist block to want to join - whereas it is known staying as russia 's puppets would had been the best thing for those countries ? 
  edit : learnt bosniak ! = bosnian ; also , hey , why only your second answer has flair ? 
  by ~ ~ bosniak ~ ~ bosnian i mean citizens of bosnia - or do you have a better name ? 
  you know , eu and nato never forced anyone to join them as opposed to russia/cccp . 
   it 's not furthering the other blocks ' interests yes , i know - if i look at georgia , moldova and ukraine , russia prefers to keep whole buffer countries in misery rather than losing some influence . 
  so to answer your question : i do n't give a flying fuck on what russia wants . 
  it 's what ~ ~ bosniak ~ ~ bosnian people want that 's important . 
  edit : as pointed out citizens of bosnia are bosnians not bosniaks !, 
  russia to express concerns about eu meddling in its affairs feb 16 : putin, 
  i apologize for misunderstanding , i was referring to the context and not directly to your reply . 
  are you talking about poland 's 4000 ? 
  ( because the rest of v4 did n't promise a thing ) . 
  or are you talking about the 24 member states who promised they 'll take 160 000 and managed to distribute 300 ? 
  you are correct . 
  but at the same time you are barking at the wrong tree . 
  before bashing v4 please have a talk with the 24 countries who promised they 'll take migrants then did n't do shit . 
  so in your opinion ee should just swallow whatever west says because of money ? 
  geez , that 's certainly a cheap way to annex other countries - definitely cheaper than ww2 .

  muh nation has to be unified , even to the detriment of others . 
  muh nation did everything right , it 's always those evil others '' you 're a textbook chauvinist . 
  as i said before , in hungary you 'd most likely be first in the line to shitmouth romania and join jobbik , with this mentality . 
   transylvania is rightful romanian territory omfg are people this ultranationalistic , * unironically * ? 
  bet if you were hungarian you 'd be a jobbik member trying to blow shit up yourself . 
   the downvote buttons are n't for when you disagree with someone . 
  no , it 's for when people push their shitty nationalist agenda like yourself, 
   celebrating 2nd viena award as your national day would n't make sense and it would be just fascist dick waving . 
  no , it would be the same as romanias national day , celebrating a day when the nation was truly unified , when finally all hungarians were again inside hungary . 
  nothing fascist about it , it did n't even happen during the fascist era . 
   when romania as we know it was `` born '' . 
  even though it existed for 60 years at that point , but `` we ca n't be a real good nation until we invade some place ai n't that right guys ? '', 
  dude wtf . 
  if hungary celebrated the 2nd vienna award each year , would you have romania 's diplomats participate or not ? 
  let 's be fucking honest , an aggressive invasion of the country is not something anyone should be forced to celebrate, 
   you cant declare independance and be a country . 
  does that mean that serbia is in fact part of turkey ? 
  kaposv\u00e1r to croatia would suck , i would resent not being in schengen . 
  to austria though , i 'd love it, 
  yeah yeah but when you are with others then it 's the driver 's safety at stake . 
  so they wo n't risk that shit, 
  jobbik pages on facebook regularly share antisemitic content , stormfront-style genocide support stuff . 
  their leader now did move to a more populist thing , but the core denounced him for this . 
  they * are * a neonazi party, 
  that guy who was a member of jobbik ( essentially a neonazi party ) and then he found he was a jew . 
  yeah it is . 
  since hungary is landlocked we consider that lake our sea , 
  lake balaton has some awesome beaches , especially on the southern side . 
  cs : go , hoi4 , ck2 , rocket league, 
  it is most likely the greatest game of all time . 
   nobody mentioned romania i was gon na mention romania , because transylvania ... although i suspect hungarians are the least welcome tourists there, 
  idk , hungary 's usually good at making otherwise horror-system `` sort-of-bearable '' , like k\u00e1d\u00e1rism and the ausgleich/kiegyez \u00e9s . 
  this was the only time when it did n't work out ideally . 
  sz\u00e1lasi was a hitler , but let 's not gloss over the fact that he only came to power in late 1944 . 
  in other parts of europe that whole thing started way earlier . 
  humanism , secularism and democracy, 
  too bad it 's become a jobbik fetish now . 
  damn nationalists always ruin everything, 
  i would get literature the fuck out of the curriculum , and especially the maternity exams . 
  it is 100 % useless shit . 
  cut back on the amount of sports classes and make them unisex where they are n't already - or at least make them somewhat optional . 
   yes , we have a school only 2 pupils attend . 
  in hungary we a school with 9 kids . 
  it gets a free pass though , because it 's the only school for the rusyn minority ( they 're not exactly keen on getting their kids into that school it looks like ), 
   non-millionaires  house is more than a million does not compute, 
   hitchhike together well from what i heard , people are way less likely to pick you up when you 're not alone, 
  well i think the primary meaning is the ethnic one . 
  it 's largely useless . 
  autonomous cars achieve the same thing as human drivers , so nothing is gained from it . 
  that 's what estonian means, 
  probably in hungary 's rural areas . 
  government 's been pushing it so hard that it 's ridiculous . 
  almost makes me vomit at this point, 
  we also do n't mr or mrs , however we have lots of other titles , also 4 levels of politeness in language . 
  nope , never heard of him before, 
  this question is most likely bait/a troll , but whatever , europe has its exact definition , look it up please, 
  yeah sure i like that . 
  they should be able to join if they want to, 
   this suggests that we had a choice in the matter . 
  no it does n't  if the people of moldova and romania want it , the two could unite the people are tools , it 's not how that works . 
  international politics thankfully does n't really have to consider what people want, 
  the combination of all the three sounds in there . 
  i have no problems pronouncing ` girl ' or ` whirl ' . 
  but ` world ' is harder . 
  i can only do something like `` wor-uh-ld '', 
  i only find the - rld ending hard , so * world * , * hurled * , * curled * , etc. 
  the others are n't difficult at all, 
  no it should n't , because it was not an illegal annexation . 
  romania traded it for north transylvania . 
  as such , no . 
  ca n't have your cake and eat it too . 
  what ? 
  i never saw you give an opinion on this particular issue, 
   you should know that by now well idk , should i have ? 
  i mean it 's not that far-fetched an idea for an international/supranational state like a european federation to include colonies , of course only when the people there are also treated the same way the rest is and get the same rights etc. 
  if you took it through the 4 ( ? ), 
  years of high school then you can get it back pretty quick especially in a native environment, 
   we have now , we should reclaim that again . 
  would certainly be better for the world . 
  you mean like neocolonialism ? 
  well , at the time when the us adopted those values , they were very progressive , but as time marched on they basically did n't change whatsoever so now those are the conservative or even reactionary values compared to europe . 
  but unfortunately they managed to get most of the world in their sphere of influence , soo yeeah . 
  you can sneakily omit the ` th ' and no one will notice , just make the 's ' longer : siksss . 
  this is something i hear a lot from actual english speakers as well , and [ wiktionary lists it as the primary pronunciation as well ] ( https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/sixths ), 
  great britain and especially england is where america has the most cultural influence . 
  maybe sweden as well , but gb is by far the worst in this regard, 
  `` yeah he was a thing '', 
  colonialism, 
   mom mum * ya feckin colonial, 
  same in hungarian - maced\u00f3nia or maked\u00f3nia, 
  yup . 
  though `` maced\u00f3nia volt jugoszl\u00e1v k\u00f6zt\u00e1rsas\u00e1g '' also exists , because we have to adapt international controversies now ... great . 
  yeah ... i mean really who cares about epiphany . 
  it 's literally called the day of the ** water cross ** ( v\u00edzkereszt ) ... lamest name ever as well, 
  us states never had their own diplomatic relations , or armies , or border controls between them , or monarchies for individual ones . 
  it 's not comparable, 
   occitan is my favourite romance language ( along with italian ) !, 
  same :d i also speak italian and can understand a lot of occitan because of that . 
  shame that there 's so few speakers left, 
  it 's when you traditionally disassemble your christmas tree,

discrimination , deportation and forced labor if ethnic hungarians after the war in czechoslovakia . 
  http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/bene\u0161_decrees refusing to apologise for ethnic cleansing . 
  comes from s\u00f6rf\u0151zde ` brewery ' , but there is a food show going on parallel too . 
  well , it 's also a street food show . 
  i 'm hoping for some cevapi . 
  unrelated , but have you heard about f\u0151zdefeszt ? 
  the whole andr\u00e1ssy avenue is closed down and full of craft beer stands . 
  yea that 's all nice , but without sources it 's just a badly written fantasy . 
  i actually worked in a hospital and lunch was always soup and a main course with some kind of `` dessert '' . 
  the hungarian health system is in an abysmal state , but this kind of food is everyhwere from kindergarten to schools . 
  the whole cheap catering industry that supplies these institutions is stuck in socialism . 
  the first permanent bridge was opened in 1849 but the city was n't unified until 1873 . 
  budapest still runs 400 of that model according to bkv.hu . 
  i hate that they 're wasting money on stadia and football academies , especially after the huge flop of the u19 team instead of supporting waterpolo , handball or the countless other sports hungarians are still relevant in . 
  i do n't like orban and fidesz one bit , but there are some things they 're doing right and there 's definitely no dictatorship in hungary . 
   from 2008-2010 the left handled the crisis pretty good actually . 
  if barely avoiding bankruptcy by getting hige loans is good handling of crises then greece is doing hell of a job too . 
   corruption was done by individuals , not allowed by state , as it is now . 
  wild claims like this are the reason why i ca n't take anything you say seriously . 
  i do n't even know how many mszp politicians were convicted for their dealings . 
  even gyurcs\u00e1ny was under investigation for corruption . 
  the big hungarian reality is that money always flows to the friends of politicians , that 's just how it 's done . 
  it 's sad but i do n't see who would do things differently . 
  in the socialist era , it was taught as `` the glorious 133 days '' but it was a time of terror and fear . 
  luckily it was overthrown pretty quickly , but not before murdering some 600 people . 
  slovakia is anything but liberal , http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/language_law_of_slovakia, 
  yes , yes hungary is a dictatorship with no free press and oppression . 
  it 's been said countless times for years , yet i have n't noticed anything actually happening . 
  the incompetent liberal opposition had this mantra for years but they provide no alternative , while also being racist and beating up politicians on their gatherings . 
  i do n't even know how a shitpost like this gets upvoted with that horribly misleading title , and as a student i do n't like orban either . 
  so bums do n't get free money , they actually have to do some work . 
  it 's not a bad thing at all . 
  it 's actually rare to find a subtitled movie here , most are dubbed at release . 
  dubbing is n't that expensive . 
  do n't hate . 
  the elections were n't less democratic than any other , however they are somewhat disproportional . 
  in the uk there are only regional mps so in theory it 's even more `` undemocratic '' . 
  a lot of people like to bash the fidesz government , but they managed to consolidate the economy that was left in shambles after 8 years of mszp rule . 
  as someone who voted for lmp i obviously disagree with a lot of what they 've done , but they 've proven themselves more capable in 4 years than mszp in 8 . 
  same here , shit sucks . 
  get out . 
  is this sarcasm or can someone actually be this retarded ? 
  wow , so many retards saying vatican city is their least favourite country . 
  guess they 've never been there . 
  may i refer you to / r/teenagers ? 
  obvious corruption ? 
  the case was most likely politically motivated and not obvious at all , unlike changing laws before getting into the eu so croatia does n't have to extradite people . 
  or spy , i do n't really give a fuck . 
  it is flawed though ... http://www.foxnews.com/world/2013/09/16/eu-preparing-sanctions-for-new-member-croatia-over-refusal-to-extradite/, 
  after croatia refused to extradite a war criminal they should n't expect things go their way especially in a shady politically motivated case . 
  the ottomans were held back by hungary for the most part . 
  meanwhile the eu did jack shit about this guy who killed 2 children . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ciaran_tobin_extradition_case fucking ridiculous pretentious pieces of shit . 
  still it 's no grounds for attacking a country and turning it to total shit all the while causing 100,000 + casualties . 
  yes it was bad , but still better than what happened after the coalition attacked . 
  so was uae attacked after sentencing women to prison for `` having sex outside marriage '' when raped ? 
  iraq was attacked for having wmds and in the end they had jack shit . 
  it 's time us and co. stopped acting as world police . 
  at the time of the 2003 invasion it was , i also suggest checking some of the recent cia documents where it 's stated that the they helped saddam 's chemical attack on iran . 
  i would n't be surprised if they were involved in this by helping the rebels fake the attack as to justify attacking syria . 
  this is obviously speculation , but given the history of us and its agencies it would n't come as a surprise . 
  look at what happened to iraq , and that was a relatively peaceful country before the invasion . 
  invading syria wo n't help anyone , the solution is to help assad win since he 's already close to that to avoid more bloodshed . 
  the goal should be to restore peace and end the war , not to make a puppet government at the cost of lives to fuck with iran . 
  [ no weapons right ? 
  you can cry racism and stormfront all you want , the fact is that unsurprisingly the public opinion shifted against migrants who exploit the hospitality of eu . 
  just sprinkle some crack on them . 
  and that 's why croatia is n't in the schengen area . 
  on another note , we should have jailed the croat police who crossed the border . 
  maybe shoot the ones who have weapons , just for old times ' sake . 
  and how do you decide who 's syrian and who is n't ? 
  these people have no papers or at best fake ones . 
  germany should be grateful hungary abides by the dublin agreement . 
  we could put 2000 refugees on trains to munich daily . 
  of course , they have the same culture , religion and similar language . 
  they 'd rather focus on dam building right ? 
  used to live here . 
  beautiful building . 
  acidosis causes hyperventilation though , as the body tries to get rid of excess co2 . 
  / r/european pls go, 
  more information on why the austrians were n't particularly fond of us in the early 18th century . 
  since rape culture is a stupid concept , he probably does . 
  how many of their employees are irish though ? 
  yea the 1800s are terrible . 
  growth is gradual . 
  the industrial revolution would n't have been possible without the contribution of romans , greek , chinese , egyptians and every other great empire . 
  to disregard the advancements our ancestors made in agriculture , mathematics , architecture , art and so on just because they were n't the first to start burning coal is very ignorant . 
  it 's not hard to start an industrial revolution when you 're exploiting half the world . 
  it 's not about looks . 
  in bf games the soldiers are constantly shouting , i 'll be very disappointed if austria-hungary will have the same voices as germans , as in you know , no hungarian . 
  dice is swedish . 
  also france lost ww2 before 1942 . 
  inb4 austro-hungarian will just mean reskinned germans . 
  too bad most of it is wasted and stolen by our corrupt politicians . 
  we pay with university graduates and provide a big market for western companies as the local industry was bought out or dismantled . 
  it 's very naive to think western eu pays out of the goodness of their hearts . 
  they 're developing their markets . 
   i 'm 66 and my generation was/is more european than today 's youth . 
  by what metric ? 
  younger generations are more pro eu .

  you see ? 
  you look away for a few hours and this happens !, 
  that is straight up a crime against humanity and of course a war crime . 
  they dont have a fair chance of dying in turkey or greece . 
  the article mentions that 3000 are arriving every day , could this be still correct with the balkan route almost completely sealed off ? 
  where are they coming from ? 
  italy maybe ? 
  nice try , greece, 
  she specifically said that she opposes all limits on numbers , and `` hopes '' that the total amount of migrants will stay under 1 million in 2016 . 
  sounds like a real powerful plan . 
  did merkel or sigmar gabriel condemn macedonia already for actually doing something to stop the refugee flow ? 
  or is it on tomorrow 's agenda ? 
  as a poor non-londoner , i find these posts hilarious, 
  ahh , its clear now , thanks !, 
  what i do n't understand about this whole thing is that why are we sure that the old woman 's submitted question is just a ruse ? 
  it is basically the same with other wording . 
  are we expecting her to withdraw it later just to win time to delay the referendum ? 
  or why does it matter so much that it was not mszp 's question that got submitted ? 
  obviously there is something that i am missing , otherwise there would not have been skinheads guarding the way to the stamping machine , but i just do n't know what . 
  sorry if its a dumb question . 
  edit : as it was explained by another user , the wording that was submitted would not be sufficient to completely abolish the mandatory closure on sundays , the government could go `` fuck you , okay , then shops can only be open until 10:00 , jokes on you democracy '' . 
  noted , apologies for breaching the guidelines . 
  i thought that the `` russia is only in syria to create more chaos and drive out more refugees to destabilize the eu further '' is only a conspiracy theory . 
  after seeing the last two month 's results , i now fully believe this . 
  unbelievable and shameful . 
  why on earth is a taliban supporter being let into european countries ? 
  it just blows my mind . 
  europe is so progressive that we are happily hand out free housing or shelter to possible mass killers and terrorists . 
  huge problem in hungary as well . 
  i 'm not exaggerating a bit when i say that it is now nearly impossible to find a reliable repairman , electrician , mason , etc. 
  whoever had the chance already emigrated ( temporarily or permanently ) to germany or to the uk and in the last 2-3 years it can be felt really remarkably . 
  people in the service industry are complaining as well saying that all the skilled cooks and waiters are now working in austria and the aforementioned countries . 
  however , i am not sure if this is a bad thing . 
  in the long run it will definitely lead to considerable wage rises in these sectors as it happens with all the less-than-abundant professions - and maybe this is eastern europe 's chance to close the eastern-western wage gap at least a little . 
  building the `` jungle '' was not `` unlawful assembly '' it seems . 
  im guessing a huntsman spider under the toliet seat, 
  why is that ? 
  from here he was always regarded as a positive figure . 
  or maybe that 's why ? 
  well , if they were going to intentionally censor the speech , there were `` harsher '' parts that they could have chosen to cut out . 
  i believe this was just a technical problem . 
  exactly . 
  i see this current refugee crisis as a much-needed wake-up call for the future . 
  this influx will highlight the need for effective schengen border control and the need of increasing the foreign aid - and maybe , just maybe can also put the humanitarian dangers of global warming into focus . 
  the danish ( and even the german ) government is doing the same with its own citizens for decades . 
  what is the problem here exactly ? 
  that asylum seekers do n't get special treatment and positive discrimination ? 
  that they are not being handled as superior beings than the native danish people ? 
  ridiculous . 
  seek refuge in sweden , kill the person helping you and essentially protecting you . 
  he would be a very productive and contributing member of the swedish society i 'm sure . 
  refugees are protesting against being put in tent camps again , they want normal ( free ) apartments handed out to them - this is exactly why they are not satisfied in turkey or lebanon and are embarking on the journey to germany and scandinavia . 
  no access to education and to the job market also plays a role , but i 'm not sure how big ... 
   `` i 'm not afraid . 
  my life continues as it was . 
  i had no problems in iran , `` he said . 
  this is infuriating and this should be punished . 
  piggybacking the actual refugees who need protection or are fleeing from a war zone `` just for fun '' , because `` you would get a free house '' . 
  well , everyone is going to germany anyway ... and the safe country-stuff does not work neither because they can always claim that they lost their ids and they are from syria . 
  another non-solution . 
  oh god , no . 
  please do n't think orban is a hero of any sorts . 
  he might have handled the refugee situation correctly ( at least in my opinion ) , but he is still an anti-democratic megalomaniac who is running a not-so-greatly hidden dictatorship . 
  noone needs him . 
  it really seems like sweden is governed by some tumblr-sjws . 
  if someone poses with an isis flag , he or she should be automatically and instantly deported or jailed . 
  it 's completely unacceptable that he was just `` under surveillance '' for this . 
  merkel 's recommendation to `` deport people faster '' is doing nothing to prevent these type of attacks in the future . 
  i want prevention , not the promise of harsh punishment . 
  if my girlfriend gets abused by somebody , the damage is already done and no punishment can reverse it . 
  germany 's ( and europe 's ) streets should be as safe as they were in april or may of the last year . 
  it was not perfect by any means , but my feeling is that it was much better than now . 
  poor pension systems . 
  i changed my downvote ( which i gave since the numbers seemed absurdly exaggerated ) to an upvote after i read your source . 
  it really is unbelievable , i never thought sexual violence is so common in relationships . 
  very sad . 
  savage, 
  it 's about the 1956 uprising against the soviets that was brutally supressed in the end . 
  sorry for the spoiler . 
  can confirm . 
  we have such a great country that we always have something to swear about , thus the proficiency . 
  oh okay , so that 's how you meant it . 
  apologies . 
  bouillon for hungary ... ? 
  that 's weird . 
  the ode to joy is the anthem for the eu , he did not mean it for hungary . 
  i do n't really undestrand why romania is considered as the `` home for all roma people '' . 
  maybe the `` roma - romania '' similarity ? 
  hungary has a huge roma population as well , yet its only romania who takes the blame for their behaviour regardless where those people are coming from . 
  nurses and teachers earn 400 euros per month if they are lucky , and for that they usually work at least 12-14 hours per day , mostly without paid overtime . 
  doctors do n't have it much better unfortunately . 
  it 's a damn shame that the people who are devoting themselves to help and educate others are getting shat on by our governments and nobody does anything against it for decades , no matter which political side gets into power . 
  i love this . 
  almost a million came in just 4 months and they immediately expect to have everything provided for them - from great quality free food to luxury housing . 
  how could one not see or understand that no country was prepared for this many refugees in such short time frame ? 
  at least they should have some patience towards their new `` protector country '' ... 
  orban is a goddamn idiot who is pumping the money out to his and his friends ' pockets and ruining our economy , running it to the ground slowly and gradually . 
  he is also responsible for driving a lot of people away from hungary ( including myself ) who are disillusioned by the political climate and the hopelessness for our future because of their mindless , money-pumping reign . 
  but he is not a fascist . 
  he just realized the opportunity to gain more followers from the far-right by playing some far-right tunes .

  and second , your examples are nothing like the thing we 're talking about . 
  some pity swimming competition , which is basically worthless in every sense , versus peoples ' livelyhood and in the worst cases , survival ? 
  are you serious ? 
  the `` gy\u0151zz\u00f6n a jobbik '' principle works fine when there 's nothing serious at stake : money is not like that and should n't be treated like that, 
  well jobbik is now running a more populist campaign but this is basically what their average supporter looks like ( or at least looked like until this populist shit came around ), 
  because rich people already have better opportunities than poor people , without the extra taxation . 
  a flat income tax just takes out the equalizing factor . 
  there 's this thing called the golden dawn , who i 've been told are more extreme than jobbik is in hungary , so most likely yes, 
  we should n't though . 
  username relevant, 
  yes , the maltese love service handing out food to the poor and homeless is clearly evil, 
  when did you do your \u00e9retts\u00e9gi / whatever you guys do in romania ? 
  wait , two years ? 
  i though you graduated in like 2012-ish , no ? 
   must be a 17yolds boys thingy i did n't see while in high . 
   could be , though things probably changed quite a bit since you 've been in high school ... ( not to make you feel old or anything ), 
  girls have different priorities i guess, 
  well , okay ... i never thought my situation was rare, 
   all of them ?!?!, 
  ( 0 . o ) well ( naturally ) most of them are within sexual interest , but not romantic interest . 
  and i do n't feel like grinding through months of that crap again  well , i guess you wo n't like a girl who look like a wrestler and behave like a chav either . 
   well no , but those types of girls are often cunts anyways, 
  ee meaning what ? 
  you should probably edit this comment once you get to 6th grade and learn how percentages work, 
  yeah, 
  finland . 
  we could easily maintain the image of antisocial , grumpy weirdos , plus the weather is less crappy, 
  i do n't think there were more than 3 , and strangely enough i did get a notification for slopeclimber 's post , later . 
  so i assume it depends on the spelling , since this one starts with a small i , and his one with a capital i, 
  the entire paragraph of under the ottoman rule has no sources . 
  i also remember reading something in a hungarian source , but yeah  hungarians moved en mass out during turkish invasions in the banat there was also a bit of a genocide against hungarians in the 1600s because transylvania tried something funny to get out of vassalage and did n't manage to succeed, 
  look ma , i 'm famous ... but for some reason i did n't get notified of the username mention . 
  weird, 
  yeah , at the time , there was no majority . 
  like , it 's completely impossible . 
  way too many nations there for there to be a majority . 
  `` multiculturalism only came when the austrias conquered '' is simply a lie . 
  besides the obvious presence of hungarians , the area had croats , romanians , slovaks , rusyns , gypsies , bulgarians , and most likely turks too . 
  i would accept if you said that germans ( who also became quite numerous , too ) were not there yet , but that would still not be true , most likely , given that timis\u0327oara was a german-majority town, 
  no , not really . 
  the banat and vojvodina was hungarian majority for a long time , the serbs became the majority there when serbia was part of turkey and came as refugees . 
  it was never part of any serbian state either until 1920, 
  hungarian , english , italian ( using italian basically any romance language ) , and german . 
  i also know the grammar of esperanto but honestly i do n't find it worth studying any more than that , and i am trying to learn japanese in my free time, 
   a1 : can interact in a simple way provided the other person talks slowly and clearly and is prepared to help . 
  now excuse me , but that is pretty much possible using only your hands , gestures and talking in your own language hoping the addressee understands . 
  you are not even an eu citizen , stop telling us what to do with our internal affairs . 
  in public . 
  do n't play the game in public and you 'll be fine . 
   in my ignorant westerner ears , slavic language is slavic . 
  nah , it 's that way actually . 
  i am also brown-haired and have blue eyes . 
  but it 's really fucking stupid to base your identity around those is n't it ? 
  i * could * call myself one of those , but there 's no point . 
  skin color is the exact same thing , it 's just hugely overromanticized in america . 
  plus , it makes no fucking sense in my context . 
  where i live , the main two people groups are hungarians and gypsies . 
  and while it is * generally * true that hungarians are more white and gypsies are somewhat brown , but you can easily find white gypsies and hungarians with fairly dark skin ( both locals and descendants of immigrants ) . 
  so `` white '' as identifier means nothing culturally in the end . 
  agreed, 
  here the gypsy-sounding ones are `` ors\u00f3s '' `` bogd\u00e1n '' and `` kal\u00e1nyos '', 
  nagy ( big , great ) 2 . 
  kov\u00e1cs ( smith ) 3 . 
  varga ( shoemaker ) 7 . 
  kiss ( small ) 8 . 
  n\u00e9meth ( german ) 10 . 
  balog ( left-handed ) 12 . 
  papp ( priest ) most names are nationality names , professions , or referring to physical characteristics , occasionally they 're given names, 
  i 'm really bothered that europeans now use `` white '' and other `` racial '' terms that are normally exclusive to america , unironically . 
  i mean , i get that you are influenced by america a lot but seriously . 
  try to implement the positive and the meaningful parts of their culture, 
  i do n't think we do, 
  maybe i 'm not in the right social circles , but most people i know are fairly sexually repressed . 
  thanks christianity . 
  was she from budapest or something ? 
   goulash true  csardas nowadays we usually do mulat\u00f3s , not cs\u00e1rd\u00e1s . 
   gypsies depends on the region , but there 's not many gypsies all around  horny women definitely not true . 
  unless you mean prostitutes , who are paid to pretend to be horny , so idk if that counts, 
  i do n't know . 
  you can swear [ quite delicately ] ( http://i.imgur.com/oz0npco.jpg ) in hungarian , there 's just too much to choose from, 
   i have heard italians are also using horse dick for swear/insult too . 
  :d i 'm pretty sure they do n't . 
  i know quite a few italians and they were are amazed that we use that so often . 
  budapest has the house of terror , but the inner city is mostly austro-hungarian architecture . 
  you 'd have to venture farther for soviet architecture afaik, 
  hey , we also use * l\u00f3fasz * = horse dick, 
  i do n't know any stereotypes about hungary, 
  hungary , austria , slovakia , italy , germany , france , spain , uk . . that 's 7 . 
  also went through slovenia like 3 times , but that does n't matter, 
  i basically only follow english-speaking youtube channels ... are there even good non-english ones ? 
   the host is super knowledgeable having seen the hungary one , lolno he is n't, 
  i overwhelmingly prefer american accents , mainly west coast . 
  since the accent i speak myself as well, 
   from what i can see only the academics/intellectuals call themselves roma . 
  oh lol , i 've heard a gypsy phd student refer to himself as a cig\u00e1ny . 
  idk about where you live , but most gypsies actually use the term gypsy to refer to themselves, 
  some type of anal perhaps ? 
  no idea, 
  i was expecting [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zviymtmpbxe&amp;ab_channel=newvavegermany80 ), 
  idk , but it 's definitely among the more common ones,

  edit : btw , none of the opposition parties support it in this form and the governing parties do n't have the required 2/3 majority in parliament any more . 
  jobbik ( far-right ) and lmp ( green-liberal ) support the idea in general , but not like this . 
  they want more controls in place . 
  the socialists did n't even participate in the discussion ( they are pretty confused and clueless in this whole migration/terrorism topic ) . 
  in hungary we do n't have any limit like that . 
  it 's legal to drink it at any age ( you ca n't even be convicted for basically anything before you 're 14 ) , the only illegal thing with alcohol is to sell it to under-18s . 
  i guess when we think of 14 year olds , we remember the time when we were around 14 as well . 
  and obviously we thought we were mature , we remember being attracted to them at the time , so the memory does n't seem weird . 
  but i 'd say even 17 or 18-year-old girls are often rather immature in their attitude and actions . 
  and obviously not all 14-year-olds are equal . 
  we all mature at different times . 
  but what i find really weird is that an 18-year-old can have sex with a 12-year-old in hungary . 
  that means someone at the end of secondary school , doing their \u00e9retts\u00e9gi , perhaps applying for university and someone in 7th grade primary school . 
  wrong . 
  it 's so easy to look up in the age of google , but people rather spend time to type speculative comments . 
  probably not , but i 'm not a lawyer , this is n't legal advice , just speculation . 
  the hungarian law says `` abusing an existing relationship of authority or influence '' , and i think that typically refers to a caretaker , teacher , relatives , a friend of the family etc. 
  someone who the minor `` ca n't shake off '' , ca n't get away from easily , someone who has the authority over whether they meet or not , controls access to resources like shelter , food , education etc. 
  also , according to my own sense of justice , your description is n't something that should get the guy imprisoned for 3 years ( unless there is some pre-existing authority kind of power relationship ) . 
  it might be morally objectionable if a 20 year old guy seduces naive 15 year old girls with his car and coolness , but i do n't think it 's a crime ( at least in hungary ) . 
  exactly . 
  it just shows when it 's not a * crime * anymore * in itself * . 
  it can still be stigmatized socially , parents may still get angry etc. 
  it 's just that the police wo n't automatically take you . 
   there are some limitations on possible combinatiosn of age . 
  nope . 
  the limitations are about abuse . 
  in hungary for example it is a crime to abuse your power to have sex with someone aged 14-18 . 
  but otherwise it 's allowed . 
   the age of consent in germany is 14 , as long as a person over the age of 21 does not exploit a 14 - to 15-year-old person 's lack of capacity for sexual self-determination , in which case a conviction of an individual over the age of 21 requires a complaint from the younger individual ; being over 21 and engaging in sexual relations with a minor of that age does not constitute an offense by itself . 
  otherwise the age of consent is 16 , although provisions protecting minors against abuse apply until the age of 18 ( under section 182 ( 1 ) , it is illegal to engage in sexual activity with a person under 18 `` by taking advantage of an exploitative situation '' [ 30 ] ) . 
   the age of consent should be that anyone 15-18 ( assuming 15 to be the age of consent ) should only be allowed to have sex within that age group . 
  in hungary we have a similar thing ( besides the unlimited age of consent at 14 ) , which says that above 12 year olds can have sex with under 18 year olds . 
  i find that pretty weird , i 'd have it rather as 12 and 16 , but i 'm no expert . 
  in hungary it 's 12 if the other party is younger than 18 . 
  also , their experience with other cultures is mostly on campus or other ` higher circles ' , which only gives them a look into the minds of the richest , most ` westernized ' people . 
  sure in university-educated circles it really does n't matter if one is from iraq , syria , iran or nigeria or anywhere , you share a common cultural foundation with them , even if they keep some of their ( usually superficial ) traditions , like food or music preferences . 
  [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/41zkgk/interview_with_a_german_woman_working_with/cz6gzjv ) 's an essay by a german volunteer woman ( not anarchist , just a decent and a bit naive woman ) who happily went to help at a refugee camp but got hugely disappointed and will probably quit . 
  they think culture means foods , music , dances , colorful clothing etc. 
  actually culture goes way deeper than that , it 's your whole attitude towards the world and society , your and other people 's roles etc. 
  many hungarian dubs used to be high quality . 
  sure there is some nostalgia factor in it , but for example columbo and bud spencer movies were really well dubbed . 
  i 'd never watch them subtitled . 
  also as you said , often the same actor got dubbed by the same voice actor , so people got used to it . 
  it 's not bad if done well . 
  sometimes you do n't want to learn , you just want to `` lean back and enjoy the movie / tv show '' . 
  ( i watch a lot of english and german stuff to practice my language skills , but sometimes i do n't want to pay my undivided and full attention ) . 
  it 's for those who * ca n't speak the original language * do n't want to read subs at the bottom of the screen instead of looking at the eyes of actors , scanning the background etc. 
  * do n't want to pay constant attention for some reason , if you do n't look at the screen for 20 seconds , you can still know what they are saying if it 's dubbed * are too tired/lazy to read so much * have bad eyes ( e.g. 
  old people ) , ca n't read the subs * got used to it , tradition in hungarian cinemas there are both subtitled and dubbed versions of the bigger movies . 
  with downloaded movies , i prefer original sound with english subs ( hungarian sub translations are often made by amateurs , poorly ) . 
  laziness and perceived status . 
  if you have your own `` slave '' who does the dirty work , you can feel better . 
  it 's like owning a bigger house , bigger car etc. 
  however , the actual difficulty of house chores has decreased a lot since a few decades ago , with the invention of affordable household machines . 
  at those times my grandma had to spend * the entire day * on washing clothes . 
  it was designated a `` washing day '' and it literally took the whole day to just do that . 
  bring the water from the well , boil the water , cook the clothes , manually clean everything , sometimes a second cleaning was needed etc. 
  there was no vacuum cleaner , definitely no dish washer . 
  no microwave , no supermarkets that sold all sorts of ingredients all the time , no prepared sauces , no prepared instant powders , etc. 
  it was more difficult to manage the heating with coal or wood , more difficult to manage the oven , people often made `` difficult '' things like bread themselves , etc. 
  in those times it was a full time job to do these chores . 
  nowadays a single guy like me can get it done very quickly . 
  there are cheap canteens , there are supermarkets with loads of stuff , we have washing machines , etc. 
  there is no reason to hire someone outside of wanting to feel superior ( or in case someone is * really * busy , like a high profile politician ) . 
  i never understood what 's so hard about washing clothes . 
  i do n't separate anything , i just wash them at 40 \u00b0 c and never had any problems at all . 
  ( but i also do n't wear snow white elegant shirts , etc. , i guess it would be different if i cared more about fashion and elegance . ) . 
  also cooking is not like this big mystery . 
  you buy rice , pasta , meat , fish , vegetables , the only rule is to cook the meat through for health reasons . 
  add salt and pepper as required ( can also try random other seasonings when you want ) . 
  it 's really bullshit when someone says they `` ca n't cook '' . 
  there is no skill involved on the level of preparing something edible . 
  ingredients taste pretty well already , you do n't have to work too hard to make something tasty . 
  obviously there is a high art of cooking , too , but it 's not about a wednesday dinner at home . 
  well , if you want me to defend rmdsz , you 'll be disappointed because i know they do n't do shit . 
  they like to talk a lot , but do n't do much for the hungarians . 
  they are in government , but have n't achieved anything . 
  as to segregation : i guess that 's what non-assimilation looks like from that point of view . 
   why do you think is this autonomy so much needed ? 
  i do n't know , i do n't live there , it 's not my competence to decide . 
  let the people who live there decide it . 
  let them hold a referendum . 
  [ gombfoci ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqkzd4cpwiu ) or `` button-football '' . 
  there is a [ professional version ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gnuqpfljty ) of it too . 
  it was invented in the 1920s independently in hungary and brazil ( with slight differences ) . 
   there is no solid reason why there should be an ethnic enclave in the center of romania . 
  there already is , just look at a map of ethnicities . 
  those people should be listened to , they are citizens of romania and if they want an autonomous region modeled after south tyrol , why forbid that ? 
  which brings us to :  does not mean they can have their autonomy or country inside a country yep , this is the romanian propaganda . 
  `` country inside a country '' . 
  is south tyrol a country inside italy ? 
  do you really think sz\u00e9kely land could be fully independent , self-reliant state and economy ? 
  it makes no sense . 
  it 's mostly just a bunch of poor villages . 
  or do you think hungary will want an exclave ? 
  this is some serious paranoia . 
  or do you fear that hungary wants to annex transylvania and then get millions of romanians into the country ? 
  it 's just absurd . 
  the only difference is that in hungary these things are fringe opinions , while in romania the extremities are the official and popular ideas .

i hope our society will survive this . 
  i would really hate if my children had to fight crusades instead of struggling with first world problems . 
  and some people still claim here we are not relatives ... getting drunk , knifing people , committing suicide , these were the very cornerstones of being hungarian as well . 
  the first and the are last still very important part of national identity , however knifing is not really a thing anymore . 
  it barely occurs nowadays , and even then it is mostly committed by gypsies . 
  we got really soft in the last 50 years . 
  well you ca n't really compare those three . 
  your muslims actually built a quite cool culture , and that time we , europeans , were on the same level with them in literacy , hygiene or religious tolerance . 
  the ottomans were a quite tolerant empire , they did n't want to make everybody muslim - except these [ poor devils ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dev%c5%9firme ) . 
  they just wanted you to pay taxes and mind your business . 
  the suffering of the christian subjects mostly came from the high rate of corruption and the frequent wars . 
  if i had to choose which of the three waves of intruders was the most repelling , i would definitely say the current one . 
  well for normal european people yes , but i thought you canucks are runnning naked on the shore in 10 degree celsius , and jump into the ocean to cool you down a little bit . 
  one of my canadian acquintances was complaining about the summer in switzerland recently . 
  it was like 30 grades and he told it was too hot , 
  that is actually a very good idea . 
  as long as our politicians go in the first rank , it would be a very profitable war for us , there is no doubt of that . 
  on the other hand , if they only * send * us ... we can remove all the kebabs , take their sweet-sweet deserts ( they are not all deserts yet , but give some time to global warning and they will be ) and found a new hungary without our current politicians . 
  crusade-time !, 
  well , they temporarily attached themselves to romania ( and stupid romans did n't realize it is just part of their master plan ) . 
  i am talking about [ sz\u00e9kelys ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sz%c3%a9kelys ) , of course . 
  well , they are not 100 % hungarian florida , more like 50 % badass texas , 25 % funny florida and the rest 25 % are made up by mountains from montana . 
  but that is the closest thing we got to florida . 
   i have n't even mentioned any kind of fence . 
  my bad . 
   that 's constantinople , not rome eastern roman empire , best roman empire . 
  everybody knows it . 
   but anyways i know the empire fell , but its heritage never will . 
  well said . 
  in that point we agree . 
  however i wanted to piss you off with claiming that there are/were worthier heirs of the empire than italy . 
   for example these guys from the late unholy non-roman absolutly-not-empire , 
  sort of . 
  it wo n't keep out , who really wants to get through , but it makes easier the job of the police and the army . 
  and hopefully a lot of people will choose to enter hungary through the crossing points and registrate , instead of just wandering around and not giving a fuck about laws and rules . 
  you surely meant the other way around , did n't you ? 
  i did n't feel lately the urge to emigrate to the me , that much i can tell , 
  look old chap , this fence is to keep out immigrants , the other was meant to keep in emigrants . 
  quite a difference , do n't you think ? 
  and rome [ * did * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fall_of_constantinople ) fall , 
  if poland would leave v4 , that would make me really sad :( however , i guess , you are right , that we were n't as reliable ally as you , so it would make sense from your point of view . 
   i think that financing stuff like this through what is effectively robbery , especially when taking into account that he also took away pension savings , has more to do with the general oligarchic , putin-like corruption meant only for personal enrichment , than with genuine communism . 
  yeah , you got the point there . 
   yeah , i mean , that would be really stupid . 
  straight out threatening annexation , even putin know he would n't get away with that , which is why he had to fake a referendum and then declared the invasion force to just offer protection for the poor russians on the crimea . 
  if even you think that it would be ridiculous to think that orb\u00e1n would openly speak about revision , then why claim it ? 
  citation from you :  and babbling about restoring the old borders of hungary as i said , you do n't need to make up things . 
  the truth is already sad enough . 
   yet it ca n't be denied that with his rhetoric and politics he 's effectively catering the people who want him to do that . 
  we are agreeing in this point again . 
   multiple independent observers have confirmed mistreatment and various shortcomings in the hungarian asylum system . 
  i can only say it again and again , it 's not surprising that people do n't want to stay in those countries . 
  well , those shortcomings and mistreatments pretty much came from the overwhelmed infrastructure ( and in small part from orb\u00e1n 's malevolence ) . 
  but let 's not pretend that german asylum system would perform so much better . 
  in gie\u00dfen , women and children were regularly raped in the refugee camp - you failed to protect the people who were in the biggest need . 
  the handling of the applications is painfully slow - which i can totally understand , since you want to make sure , that only those people will get asylum , who really need it , and the migrants do not help with throwing away all their passports and id-s . 
  however , and that is the biggest problem of the whole system , the 2/3 of the asylum seekers will not get asylum . 
  which means they risked their lives and sacrificed their life savings for nothing . 
  that is pretty cruel if you think about it . 
  and the poor bastards cost a bunch of money in the meantime which could have been spent on helping them in their own country . 
  if you look at the fact you have to come to the conclusion that the german asylum system , however it is relatively more efficient , than say , the hungarian one , kills much more people just by the fact that it encourages them to risk their lives for a dream , which will never come true . 
  if you want good for the migrants , you close eu-borders , and do what the uk does : spend the money to create better circumstances in the countries where these people live ( first of all in turkey ) , and take the most miserable ones directly from the refugee camps . 
  good to hear  i guess i had a false picture because of 2009 language law modification . 
   but still , he gets his votes with hardcore nationalist policies , so hardcore nationalism is the problem here , whether he actually believes in it or not . 
  the policies would n't be any less dangerous if done by someone genuinely convinced of the ideology behind them . 
  he clearly gets his votes for his policies . 
  in 2013 he already had his nationalist rhetoric , but his support only started raising when he announced his cheap energy policy . 
  however , i agree that his nationalist rhetoric is extremely harmful . 
  but in your first comment your point was that he * is * a nationalist and bigoted . 
  well , he is not  the only thing he believes in and cares about is the welfare of his family and friends . 
   i also think that how you label his previous policies is oversimplified . 
  i do n't think that `` lowering energy prices '' is automatically catering to the communists . 
  nationalists like cheap energy too . 
  there is such a thing as general populism appreciated by everyone . 
  but surely nationalists and conservatives do not take the money for the cheap energy from the banks and multinational companies in the form of extra taxes introduced solely for this purpose ? 
  and he even took the people 's pension savings for that reason ... not a very conservative thing to do , if you ask me . 
  edit : to make this part clear - he they did n't actually spent the money taken this way for getting the people cheap energy , since the market prices were falling anyway . 
  but if i remember correctly they announced those extra taxes with the reasoning , that the state needs money for cheap energy . 
  however i am too tired to search for a source - so i maybe do it tomorrow . 
   the liberal background is also somewhat questionable . 
  well , the first free elected government of hungary was a conservative one , and he was always ranting against them . 
  that time , at the annual of trianon the parliament was asked to remember it with one moment silence . 
  he stood up , and left . 
   once he was asked about revisionism , and he labelled it as `` obsolete '' and `` irresponsible '' . 
  true opportunist , as you see - but that time disguised as liberal . 
   see the other comment chain . 
  well , okay . 
  but it is not necessarily revisionism to commemorate our losses . 
  trianon was a huge trauma for all hungarians , lots of leftist people commemorate it as well . 
  and he still did n't speak about restoring borders according to the article you linked . 
  however , i have no doubt he would speak about it , if he would think he can get away with it , and it raises his popularity - but that would n't be because he is a nationalist , that would be cheap popularism again . 
   i agree that generally , people should have that right to choose which nation they want to belong to ; but seeing hungaries current political climate and the fact that fidesz gets major support from those people , you might not be surprised to hear that i 'd rather not see them having that referendum . 
  those people can already vote if they want , because orb\u00e1n gives citizenship every one of them , who applies for it . 
  sadly they do n't know his true colours - just like most of the hungarians in hungary . 
  and according to revision - as i said , i would be content if these hungarians would get minority rights like the swedes have in finland . 
  that would be a more simpler but still sufficient solution . 
   on the border fence , i obviously disagree . 
  well orb\u00e1n was malevolent to the migrants all the time , that is true . 
  however the fact that they did n't want to registrate as the law requires , left us no choice but to close the borders , to enforce registration . 
  the crossing points are still open , and if you are willing to register you can still get through .

  yeah , it 's like christianity and supporting capitalism, 
  which means that it was n't me who brought it up, 
  no , that 's not how that works . 
  i 'd still be hungarian if my place happened to be part of some other country . 
  that 's not how it works, 
  turkey can house the 3 million refugees . 
  our job is to make coming to europe unappealing for them . 
   i do n't want a single government where a guy like orban could have a significant influence over my life . 
  but , there still would be guys like him anyway . . in fact even in germany right now there are people who support him . 
  there is no way that you can avoid people adhering to certain ideologies, 
  but the divided europe will have a shittier overall military than a united one, 
  much the same as on the country level , it makes no difference ... 
  independence is extremely overrated . 
  hungary was going great while not independent , then went to shit once it became independent and never recovered from it , right until the eu started going , arguably by losing a bit of its independence by joining it . 
  in response to the guy that brought up south korea, 
  i didnt bring up south korea , do you even read the thread, 
  yeah , exactly what i 'm proposing a solution to . 
  make a transit zone on the border between greece and turkey , and ship the seafaring refugees there too, 
  i stated it elsewhere in the thread already that i would prefer it that way though, 
  i do n't think it would be that much of a problem . 
  the eu is a neutral entity when it comes to the conflicts between hungarians and romanians, 
  obviously none of the countries * need * it , but also every country would lose a fuckton by not being a part of it . 
  yeah , i do n't think that too offensive tbh either . 
  people use weird ass phrases with nationalities in them all the time, 
  82 million . 
  but who gives a shit , `` friendorino '' ? 
  i do n't live there , and never claimed that germany could n't keep itself at a reasonable level, 
  sk is relatively huge , 50 million people, 
  to have a good quality of life , you need a good economy . 
  to have a good economy , you need to have a large market . 
  now to have a large market , we need the common market . 
  now , for the common market to be stable , we need a relatively strong state to care for it . 
  yeah google translate hungarian is really bad . 
  they do n't really have a good reason to improve it , and the language is way too different to make it work without some sort of special attention to it . 
  like , once i put some military term in it because i was not exactly sure what exactly it meant and it translated it to * cumi * ... which means pacifier . . so i guess that 's what those military vehicles were lol, 
  he 's frequent , yeah , but i always assumed he was american , because no flair and never mentioned his nationality, 
   they were born in romania . 
  they are romanians ... no , that 's your typical bigoted , nationalist , demagogue bullshit i 've had this conversation enough times with retarded nationalists of many countries , and i 'm fairly bored of it . 
  such a shame though , you seemed like a reasonable person at first, 
   tell me how do hungarians live under romanian rule ? 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hungarians_in_romania you can not be fucking serious , to not know about this, 
   i thought you wanted a federation where everybody is equal ? 
  is this the one you want me to answer ? 
  i do n't even understand how this could be a question , dude, 
  sorry , 1.22 million , according to the latest census in romania, 
   what solution would you like to implement ? 
  as for libya , just put boots on the ground for fuck 's sake . 
  the entire country is in anarchy , even a foreign occupying force is better than what they 're going through . 
  as for the guys coming through turkey , well , build a fence , and a really fucking strict policy on who can get through . 
  the people who come though the aegean should be collected and shipped to the same general area as the people arriving overland from turkey . 
  should n't be that hard to collect them , since they 're arriving to the islands , not mainland greece, 
   no offense , but how would you really feel to be part of a federation with your neighbors ? 
  yes  same ruler , same pm , same parliament , yeah  sometime we spend the night over to the one that is closest because it 's too far to go home . 
  but , we do n't want to sleep under the same roof for more than it 's necessary ... jesus christ , that 's one stupid metaphor . 
  the country does n't get smaller or more cramped  how would you like to have a romanian pm for 4 years ? 
  1.3 million hungarians live under romanian rule * right now * . 
  i 'm sure i could manage if they can too . 
  plus , in an insanely mixed country you ca n't really do the whole ` oppression ' the same way antonescu or ceausescu did . 
  you ca n't rely on the ambivalence of the majority population in a country where there 's no real `` majority population '' , like the eu . 
  plus the eu pm would probably better stuff to do than to oppress people for fun and in my opinion , local autonomy should be very strong , like on a municipality/town level . 
  so if the pm is a huge retard , at least the local guy can make it somewhat less unbearable , who would obviously be a local , too, 
   the eu is not a direct democracy . 
  no , neither should it be one . 
   you could only imagine imho what would happen after the federation of europe . 
  the eu could act as a unified entity that can protect its own interests ? 
  you are basically saying that `` eu federalization would make us into germany '' , that 's just not true . 
  * if every single german decided to allow refugees * , they 're still just 1/5th of the country . 
  but not even germans want that homogeneously . 
  if the eu voted as a unified whole , the overall result would definitely be some sort of restrictions on refugees, 
  yeah i do n't want the federation tbqh , not unified enough . 
  there 's no need for powerful internal forces like germany or france, 
   yes , why ? 
  because your username and the way i remember you acting made me think you 're american , especially with the lack of a flair no , nothing is wrong with being closer militarily, 
   the us was first formed , then people from different backgrounds started to move there . 
  so , a federation like that could be possible not really . 
  the us always defined itself as a melting pot , so kind of like `` the place where cultures go to die '' , to assimilate and become part of the american , unified culture . 
  this worked very well to inflate their population and make them a world power without becoming in any meaningful way diverse ( except afro-americans , who are somehow paradoxically not assimilated the same way , and probably never will ), 
   to be ruled by somewhere out of your nation . 
  i am already ruled `` from outside '' , so fuck do i care . 
  but neither will germany , or any other individual country . 
  the entirety of germany will never vote one way ( and even if it , it would be like 20 % of the vote at best ) ... the biggest divide in terms of voting is the generational gap , and maybe class divides, 
   the neonazi supporters of the 4th reich oh boy , i love me a `` debate '' where both sides call each other neonazi ... totally accurate and definitely not simple name-calling, 
  are you even european ? 
   then the only country that will be able to govern the whole federalised eu is germany . 
  but then there would n't be countries ... that 's the whole point ... 
   catholic-majority  hungary that is factually not true . 
  37 % of the country is catholic . 
  even if you only count the religious , catholicism is barely 50 %, 
  what do you mean `` slight chance '' ? 
  with google translate , there is a slight chance that some words are comprehensible at best, 
  eh , english speakers give notoriously stupid names to their kids . 
  i would n't be surprised by that , honestly, 
   i could be wrong , i used google translate for this . 
  if you used google translate then it 's gibberish, 
  yeah , i could n't honestly tell , so just assumed she was a male by default, 
  does n't really matter tbh, 
  well if that 's the point then even their antarctic territory would do, 
  the face of the third guy in the bottom row , lol, 
   why do neonazis always use red , black and white , regardless of their nationality ? 
  maybe to resemble the actual nazi flag , which is red , white and black ?

  it has n't really occurred to them that lowering prices might lead to more people actually buying passes and tickets . 
  also , there 's no student / pensioner ticket , day pass or weekly pass . 
  if you 're a student , you either pay full prices or buy at least monthly passes ( there are also quarter-year , half-year and full-year passes and semester-passes for students ) . 
  if a student wants to visit for a day or two , they either buys a monthly pass or just says `` fuck it '' and do n't buy tickets . 
  that 's the gross minimal wage , the workers get half of that . 
  hungary : * minimal wage : 47,000 huf ( 170 $ ) * average wage : ~ 140,000 huf ( 504 $ ) * 1-month pass ( budapest , adult ) : 9,800 huf ( 35 $ , 20 % of the minimal wage ) * 1-month pass ( budapest , student ) : 3.850 huf ( 14 $ , 8 % of the minimal wage ) * single ticket : 320 huf / 1.15 $ ( bought before boarding ) / 400 huf / 1.44 $ ( bought at the station / on the vehicle ) and it is also the same for children over 6 years . 
  cry me a river , madrid . 
  yay , we made it to another top 10 list !, 
  hungary : 1 . 
  two during the 12 years are mandatory plus whatever you learn in college . 
  you must have an intermediate language exam to get your bsc , two to get your msc . 
  varies , i started english and german in kindergarten but other people may only start later ( 1st grade , 5th grade or 7th grade ) 3 . 
  english and german are universally preferred for their usefulness . 
  spanish , italian and french are gaining popularity . 
  foreign language education in schools is more of an alibi , actually . 
  yes , there are some schools that actually teach the languages well but in most schools one can get graduate knowing only present simple , present continuous and past simple with a very limited vocabulary . 
  most people who actually want to learn the languages attend to private courses or educate themselves from cartoon network and the internet . 
  yes , i 'm hungarian and lunch is usually the main meal of the day with two or three courses ( soup + main course is the usual and sometimes dessert ) . 
  and riding a bike in a suit is n't exactly * weird * , but usually only bike activists do it . 
  i 've never done it mostly because i only wore suits on special occasions before . 
  i 'm moving to maastricht in september though , so this might change . 
  inside the extremist politicians are just that - politicians . 
  they know that in times of crisis larger parts of the population are receptive to nationalistic-extremist rhetoric and adjusted their image accordingly to get into the national parliament and get a chance to steal as much as they can . 
  so a politician lied . 
  in other breaking news : the earth is round . 
  2-3 cm ^ 3 of lead , applied to the forehead with a supersonic speed . 
  you know what ? 
  we should work together to build a huge rocket , tie victor and viktor on the top and launch them into the sun . 
  what is it with victors and power ? 
  and of course there are the people who think that hungarians came from sirius ... 
  i fucking wish i was making this up . 
  aaaand that 's part of the reason why they should n't be taken seriously . 
  they just filled the far-right niche to get into the parliament . 
  fortunately . 
  just look at us . 
  large population . 
  dunno , they should have at least a greenish color : [ metal visage ] ( http://www.bhutanobserver.bt/metal-visage-mark/ ) . 
  hungary here , yup , i agree . 
  anything that takes away power from the corrupt and incompetent bunch that is our `` political elite '' is good . 
  i know that eu politicians are corrupt too , but at least they have a sense of subtlety . 
  * no , but they are similar enough * well , you can push the pedal to the metal on german highways unless there 's an explicit speed limit . 
  and the uk has left-hand traffic . 
  * usually no unless explicitly allowed by a light or something . 
  * [ wikipedia has you covered . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/comparison_of_european_traffic_laws ) they also have a page with [ comparison of traffic signs . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/comparison_of_european_traffic_signs ), 
  true . 
  winner-takes-it-all systems , however , tend to ignore a sizable amount of voters or might even result in the victory of someone who had fewer votes . 
  hungary has a mixed system and it has happened before . 
  fidesz is actively moving the system towards the us-system , in the end they could achieve supermajority ( 2/3 of the seats ) with only 1/3 of the votes thanks to the fractured opposition . 
  condorcet is turning in his grave . 
  extremist rise to power when moderates do n't offer solutions . 
  i 'm more worried about our utterly incompetent government and similarly incompetent moderate opposition . 
  hungary was n't on the `` most corrupt '' list ? 
  it must have cost us a fortune ... 
  what 's on p9 ? 
  i hate them because 1 . ), 
  they are n't honest . 
  from the chart , you would draw the conclusion that hungary has a low tax rate . 
  well , false . 
  we have huge taxes , they just are n't called taxes . 
  death of a thousand cuts . 
  yes , our main taxes are n't * that * high ( except vat , yay , i do n't think there 's a higher vat in the world ) . 
  but we have a bunch of other taxes that are n't included in the chart . 
  the government enacts a new law about a new tax every two weeks or so . 
  these taxes are 1-2 % each , but they add up . 
  they are stolen . 
  we are probably the most corrupt country in the eu ( or at least we are in the top 3 ) . 
  why should i pay taxes if it ends up in the pockets of simicska and the likes ? 
  we do n't see the benefits . 
  yeah , healthcare is * theoretically * free . 
  practically , you should pay 200-300 .000 huf ( ~ 1000 $ ) to the doctor as `` gratitude '' or your child and wife might not survive the birth or you might not wake up after the surgery . 
  yeah , the cops are out there ... giving you tickets , while you are afraid to go out after dark . 
  yeah , the bureaucracy is working ... except it 's fucking slow , expensive and inefficient . 
  yeah , our school system is great ... at training functional analphabets . 
  i could go on , but the thing is , with the 50 + % redistribution , the public services should work like a wonder . 
  they do n't . 
  meaning that the money gets stolen . 
  period . 
  edit : also , there is a hungarian joke that 's very fitting here : on a global conference about taxation , obama , merkel and orb\u00e1n are talking about their taxes . 
  obama says : `` well , people on average earn $ 4000 a month ^ * , they can live comfortably on $ 2000 , we take $ 1000 and do n't care about how they spend the remaining $ 1000 . '', 
  merkel says : `` well , people on average earn 3000 $ / month , they can live comfortably on 1500 $ / month , we take 1000 $ and do n't care about how they spend the remaining 500 $ . '', 
  orb\u00e1n : `` well , people on average earn 240.000 ft/month , they can survive on 160.000 ft/month , we take 140.000 and do n't care about how they are going to get the remaining 60.000 ft. '' * : numbers are made up , it 's a joke . 
  i wonder who will orb\u00e1n sit in our necks next . 
  anyone with a tiniest bit of a spine might rebel against him . 
  he might just fucking rewrite the ~ ~ constitution ~ ~ basic law to make hungary a presidential ~ ~ republic ~ ~ country . 
  he is not exactly popular , but still has a very devoted fanbase , making him probably the most popular politician . 
  the opposition is very fractured and their leaders are either relatively unknown ( lmp ) , hated ( dk , mszp ) or are even more divisive than orb\u00e1n ( jobbik ) . 
  meanwhile , the number of unsure people is an all-time high . 
  though this is all according to their plans , with the changes in the election process , they could get a majority or even supermajority with only 35 % of the votes . 
  the lower the turnout rate in 2014 , the better they 'll fare . 
  yes . 
  anything that takes away the power of hungarian politicians is good . 
  yup , i know . 
  also , the depiction of hungarians by early european historians matches with that of the mongolians . 
  however , modern hungarians are genetically mixed people . 
  ancient hungarians were n't xenophobic , they have assimilated a bunch of non-asian tribes during their journey . 
  also , due to [ `` magyarization '' ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/magyarization ) in the 19th century , most of the white population calls themselves hungarian , even though they have different ancestry . 
  you would n't be able to tell that a modern hungarian might have had mongol-looking ancestors - in fact , the most common mongoloid-looking trait , the high cheekbones comes from the jassic ethnic group ( cheekbones are commonly called `` jassic bones '' in hungarian ) . 
  i , personally , have at least italian , slovakian , germanic and jassic ancestry and such a mixed ancestry is n't uncommon at all , it 's rather the norm .

  romania more so than hungary , you have got to be kidding me . 
  budapest for sure is westernized along with some of the bigger cities . 
  that said in the countryside it is central europe . 
  this east/west divide is much to clean of a division . 
  there are different parts of europe . 
   political liberty and democracy i would argue are spiritual goods , that said you are right he did say the west is spiritually empty . 
  i wish this true and it was posted to r/nottheonion ... perhaps he could stay there then . . 
  direct democracy . 
  i think it is a very legitimate reason to fight and i am thankful for it . 
  yes and no . 
  they do n't have china , china has them and also that pipeline to china has n't been built yet . 
  false , we can stop trading and engaging with russia . 
  that would cause massive changes in russian society . 
  that is the particular reason the us is sending us troops to those countries because if russia attacks those soldiers will be involved in combat and die thus galvanizing the entire american public into war . 
  do not misunderstand the american people 's ability to be maneuvered into war especially if troops died defending allies in europe . 
  i dig the music . 
  have n't had a song that i disliked truly yet . 
  at this point i do n't think it is just patience , i think because it is a war between russia and ukraine that resistance to rejoining russia will be pretty deep ... 
  did n't call him a shill , but i did call him an apologist . 
  an apologist is a defender of someone or something . 
  that is what he is doing ; defending russia 's actions by attempting to draw the conversation to a currently irrelevant topic , the us doing bad stuff . 
  no kidding they do , but irrelevant for this topic . 
  my point is that we are not talking about the us . 
  the us is n't currently attacking ukraine for no apparent reason . 
  i also am tired or reading apologists claiming that the `` west '' does it is credible reason for russia 's current actions . 
  this is a deflection of the issue at hand . 
  regarding butt hurt i still have n't heard a credible definitive reason . 
  thus my statement about putin has butt hurt . 
  the only reason i can see is that putin ordered it , because well putin ordered it i.e. 
  putin butt hurt . 
  the point is `` the west '' is n't monolithic , because your presupposition is that it is a monolith you are a russian apologist . 
  that said we call out crimes individual in a case by case basis and that case happens to be russia currently waging war on ukraine because ... putin has butt hurt . 
  the french , and the usa as well ... probably china too ... 
  sounds like someone is getting desperate ... 
  difference is that ukraine was n't joining nato , they were getting a trade deal with eu and were going to have to become moderately less corrupt . 
  russia can not let ukraine become a successful democracy , because that will make the common russian ask `` why ca n't we have nice things like democracy and rights and freedom from the kleptomaniac oligarchy . '', 
  russia wanted to send nukes to cuba , which is the most strategic point to control the mississippi river outside of the us , which happens to be where the majority of the us international trade goes out from . 
  lastly , nukes are much more objectionable than trade deal . 
  tell me again which was the more provocative action , cuban missle crisis or the eu offering a trade deal and ukrainians leading an uprising because they want it ? 
  g. w. bush claimed immunity on behalf of the executive to avoid disclosing a lot in the us and for good measure pardoned himself before he left office ... 
  sorry about that , i was writing on my mobile on the metro so i clicked the wrong reply button . 
  actually there are some forms of information warfare at work in europe on behalf of the west namely bbc and radio free europe ( all i can think of off the top of my head ) ... of course there should be western sources in other languages to help form consensus/moderating sources of information ... 
  this is pretty big news . 
  when this and the pipelines from this to other eu countries perhaps we will see less reliance of hungary , slovakia , and austria on russian energy sources . 
  this plus the pipeline from turkmenistan is pretty big news for the eu . 
  i was actually going to say i think many many americans agree . 
  the chicken-hawk attitude that is occurring in the us is because an increasingly smaller group of people actually serve in the military . . that smaller group becomes much more expendable by politicians than if you needed to draft ( conscript ) the general population ... 
  this has led to a large extent the bellicosity of various politicians ... think mccain . 
  buried in the bottom of this article about ukraine and russia is the part that is relevant about the geopolitics of greece which are still relevant today . 
  not just energy , also geopolitics in general . 
  control of greece is why churchill bargained eastern europe to stalin after ww2 ... greece can controll russian access to the middle east or so went the logic . 
  i will look for the source on that , but yeah eu needs to recognize geopolitics in a bad way ... 
  this is relevant for many reasons not limited to the recent talks between [ nuland and tsiparis ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/mar/17/deadlock-over-greek-debt-crisis-could-play-into-russias-hands ) ( spelling ? ), 
  this is really big news , and good for all involved to the exclusion of russia . 
  perhaps with less reliance on russian gas our relations with russia will get back to what they should be with aggressor states . 
  point is that it is not working now . 
  also , it isnt what they can muster now it 's what they can do when we muster ... 
  followed by what they can actually hold onto after we attack ... 
  she was also a rhodes scholar . 
  she 's more qualified gw bush ever was . 
  you did much better than google translate !, 
  thank you !, 
  true , but i am not sure whether that means i should buy popcorn or flee ... 
  i agree with you generally , but with the timing of the showdown between ssb and kadyrov / missing the annexation of territory ... 
  i dunno ... thus i posted . 
  at this point it is n't just western media . 
  this is being reported in russia as well . 
  edit : if this is n't the case that is being reported in russia , then please correct me . 
  also this is the blog that is [ quoted ] ( http://aillarionov.livejournal.com/802959.html ) ... perhaps if someone could translate it would be clearer , that said i did google translate and it gives a very rough translation . 
  they also did n't release any details of the project to the hungarian people ... not for 30 years . 
  i am glad this got cancelled . 
  that 's assuming that their will be a someone and not a civil war ... 
  so , what 's your point ? 
  the us should continue to defend us even if we disagree with their wars ? 
  pretty much ... :(, 
  good question , it is n't for sure that it wo n't happen . 
  the millitary is to make sure there wo n't be a threat . 
  having a military keeps the peace . 
  peace is n't kept through people in the streets protesting showing their displeasure or writing ` furious ' letters . 
  the eu if it had a millitary would have for example 6 aircraft carriers and would have the second highest spending of defense was integrated . 
  there are real threats to our ideals , rights , and vision for the future . 
  being able to defend those things is necessary for our future for the lack of a better word ... nation ? 
  no , i am talking about a historical fact . 
  freedom is n't freely given in europe or anywhere . 
  we need to be able and willing to defend our freedoms . 
  also at this point i am not so sure what russia is and is n't willing to do . 
  freedom is n't something that is a given it is a hard fought right . 
  how many generations have lived through hell to get to this point here in europe . 
  we should be willing to defend our rights and our freedoms , not this bullshit ` mercia will come save us . 
  we got ta do better than this . 
  there obviously are those that would impose their will by force ... 
  frankly , it should n't be the us ' responsibility to maintain our collective freedoms . 
  that oligarch was an insider into the orban regime . 
  pretty sure he has dirt on orban . 
  not sure about that , it seems the tide is slowly turning away from fiedesz and orban . 
  sorry , i disagree fundamentally . 
  there are truly evil acts just as i would argue there are truly good acts . 
  no , that depends on your perspective of morals and whether you take seriously the idea that there is n't a good nor evil period . 
  nietszche was of your perspective , schelling and kant were not ... 
  not stupid , but evil ... yeah i am willing to go there .

  many who honestly could n't care less what 's going on , and to live their lives . 
  for example my grandma . 
  she lived through the revolution of 1956 - when i asked her about it , what she said was that she did n't want to leave home because she was scared . 
  that 's all she knew about the revolution . 
  and trust me , there 's a fuckton of people like this . 
  just do n't go in the large cities and find that most people are like this . 
   the unholy combination of totalitarians and the concept of a nation oh come off this . 
  this was inherently going to happen . 
  loads of uneducated masses , easily brainwashable to nationalism because of the already mentioned biological intuitions . 
  the only thing that saved the world from more bloodshed is the advance in technology ( the need to educate people a bit and the nuclear bomb )  these countries considered their citizens more than just pawns on a board they had a way to separate their population into two : desirables and undesirables . 
  this was a policy used in france , uk , germany ( imperial and nazi germany ) , fascist italy , yugoslavia , russia , ussr , even the us . 
  the undesirables were pawns , the desirables were brainwashed - that 's why they were desirable in the first place  completely full of themselves , divorced from reality you just described the parisian and londoner elite, 
  in one moment, 
   the reason you can have your hungarian flair is because of those nationalists . 
  otherwise you 'd speak perfect german like i do . 
  no , it 's because i have an identity . 
  nothing more . 
  i honestly could n't care less if there was no legal entity to back it up . 
   humans are not rational actors , so you try to do as many things in an intuitive way as possible . 
  sexism , racism and a bunch of others also come from evolutionary/biological reasons , why not also have those then , to make society as natural as possible ? 
  humans are not rational actors as a whole , but in politics , most humans are not actors at all , only those who are willing to are . 
  most people just need their basic needs fullfilled and want to live in peace , they could n't care less what is going on in politics , and in this regard , it absolutely does n't matter if a nationalistic or non-nationalistic entity governs them . 
   you can organize at a local level ? 
  national level is far higher than a local level . 
  a local level is a town , or a small group of nearby villages . 
  in that level the `` non-foreign ruling class '' is an actually accomplishable . 
  in a small town the mayor can keep in touch with most of the populace and understand them for real . 
  but in a nation , that has like a million or way way more people , the ruling class is never gon na be able to keep in touch with the population , and this is a huge problem . 
  this is btw why the capitals are always favored in * every single * issue in nationstates . 
  not to mention that the capital 's culture is usually idolized as fuck and everything else is viewed as low culture . 
  this is best seen in france for example : everything is centered around paris , nothing else has power to do what they want , only paris . 
   i will need a stat on the 99.9 % . 
  is there some conspiracy i 'm not yet aware of ? 
  lets say that the president knows 400 people . 
  ( that 's over double the average person btw ) . 
  in hungary that means that he is not a foreigner to 400 people , so a foreigner to 9 999 600 . 
   in a certain area there is a majority of people with certain ideas the same can be said about a bunch of things , for example religion . 
  there 's a bunch of places with catholic majority , why is there no catholic state then ? 
   i do n't know where you get that safe-space idea from , probably my username . 
  no , i think that 's a central point in usual nationalism . 
  the idea is that `` all ppl of my tribe are in my country , all of yours are in your country '' . 
  ofc nothing prevents them from visiting other places , but nationstates make it way harder and they actively discourage learning about other cultures ( school curriculums and such are heavily nation-centered )  they started because highly centralized and unaccountable entities with absolute power were in charge and thought they were invincible . 
  like , france ? 
  they also fit this description . 
  germany and ah too . 
  pretty sure the balkan states too , russia as well , turkey as well . 
  and it seems one side * was * invincible , yet both sides shared the same nationalistic values . 
  for ww1 . 
  and ww2 too . 
  both sides were unaccountable , centralized , nationalistic . 
  guess what they got around to do ? 
  kill , fight , conquer , destroy , because `` glory '' . 
  this is the true face of nationalism imho  i still need to know why we need an european dominated world . 
  maybe ask the guy who said that , these are not my words, 
  yeah it is a 19th century invention , but that 's where it comes from . 
  the essence of nationalism is to create a clear divide between `` my tribe '' and `` your tribe '' and to always favor yours over the other . 
  this is an intuitive , animal-like behavior and feeling , but it 's completely unreasonable . 
   the recognition that certain people share language , values and culture together and should organize themselves yeah . 
  sure . 
  cultural clubs are a thing . 
  there 's no reasonable argument why this should apply to actual political entities . 
   not be ruled by foreign rulers yet 99.9 % of the world is ruled by foreign rulers - why ? 
  because unless you know them personally , someone is a foreigner . 
  speaking the same language does n't matter . 
   why there was such an entity as austria-hungary i remember that it was because was because austria was tired of hungarian nationalists constantly fucking up their nationalists ' wet dreams of a `` united nation ''  why is that a bad thing again ? 
  why is it a good thing ? 
  you get to live in your nationalist safespace , isolated from outside influences . 
  the only people it 's actually good for is the people in charge . 
  they can live off your lack of cultural knowledge of outsiders , and very often will just incite hate to fuel their own interests or jingoistic fantasies ( like ww1 and 2 ), 
  wait , so it 's normal to be narcissistic and wrong to be critical of oneself ? 
  op should be careful , they might cut themself with that edge, 
  yeah but if your country is full of corruption , would you try to abolish the country altogether ? 
  no , you would try to reform it . 
  why the double standard with the eu ? 
  why is it different ? 
  nationalism is the reenactment of pre-society tribalism . 
  explain how it does make sense ? 
  this was like years ago, 
  live on the ground floor in a 3 story building . 
  so refreshing, 
  or you know , make proper housing that does n't let all the heat in . 
  it 's time to go back and post some more juicy memes to / r/operationstreisand . 
  hungary was off for like double of that ( 1690-1919 ) , yet hungary was fucked up beyond recognition, 
  so you 're against id cards in general because some idiot tried to make 1984-tier id cards ? 
  you have some sort of paranoia ? 
  you think everyone here is just rubbing their cocks on the demise of russia ? 
  most people couldnt care less, 
  how ? 
  here they protestant and catholic schools are exactly same in terms of religious indoctrination - the catholic one offers actually semi-good education as well though, 
  i remembered that the welshmen were allowed to kill the englishmen ... weird, 
  so , can the king name his son lenin ? 
  many people could ask czechs that, 
  it was culturally united enough that a clear victory for either of the 3 sides of ww2 would 've resulted in all of europe adopting the political system that won . 
  ( fascism , communism or democracy ), 
  til berbers have their own flag ( and flair ) . 
  nice to see you here, 
  why not both ? 
  let 's add slovakia , slovenia and czechia for old time 's sake and there you go , lets all root for the reunified kuk team, 
  actually , both could be called that . 
  the first one was about which country would influence europe the most ( though i would personally would just say that it was a feud between warlords , hiding behind `` muh nation '' to justify their jingoism ) .

  but to say that democracy is in any way under threat is just short-sighted political propaganda and malice . 
  i 'm no orb\u00e1n-fan . 
  he often says stupid things , and he 's really conservative , talking for example too much about `` christian values '' for my taste as a secularist and atheist . 
  or the way he handles the agricultural lands , where a few privileged families get to buy them instead of small farmer families . 
  it 's definitely not like northern europe , there is corruption etc. 
  but we have to make it clear that it is n't an oppressive regime and political left is competing for attention in the media and the more they exaggerate the more they think they can weaken the government . 
  it got out of hand and now anyone who 'd like to cool the debate a bit is seen as a traitor of this `` end justifies the means '' approach . 
  of course i ca n't convince you in a single comment . 
  you 'd need to immerse yourself in hungarian culture , history , everyday lives and realities . 
  it 's really difficult to understand and pass sensible judgement from afar . 
  i just translated the title to simple english . 
  if refugees were able to pick freely in which country they get asylum , then their dream-eu would disappear/collapse . 
  they are in jeans and t-shirt . 
  i wrote in another place : probably in syria , turkey , lebanon . 
  they and the young children and the injured people ca n't make the balkan route as easily . 
  they are left there in the middle east and nobody cares about them . 
  germany says `` if you can manage to come to germany by illegal means , i 'll welcome you will open arms and you 'll get to stay . 
  oh you ca n't make the journey crossing 8 countries illegally ? 
  tough luck !, 
  cant afford to pay the human smugglers ? 
  better find some money then ! '', 
   do men just leave their wives/families ? 
  temporarily , probably . 
  they hope to get to germany , get asylum and then bring their families in a simpler procedure instead of being smuggled across 8 countries . 
  i guess something like that is the plan . 
  but many of them may be bachelors , 18-20 year olds , who have no wife or kids . 
  germany considers them refugees . 
  i do n't think it 's strictly forbidden for them to travel around the country by train . 
  but police did n't let them in the station for some reason . 
   also why does hungary care so much about the documents if they know that they will leave the country anyway ? 
  international obligations and eu law . 
  we are a schengen and eu border country . 
  we have to abide by the treaties . 
  we have to register these people in refugee camps , but they do n't want it and escape , and some got aggressive , some went on a hunger strike and refused to get off the train to go to the camp ... 
  so now hungary ca n't do anything . 
  but the motorway needs to be cleared and the train lines must be restored in keleti as well . 
  the chaos ca n't go on forever . 
  so now they offer them the ride to the border and we 'll see . 
  the international media , especially the german media is extremely biased and manipulative about hungary ever since orb\u00e1n is the pm . 
  of course some of it is true , but it gets exaggerated and sensationalized quite a lot . 
  generally they are criticizing vague things like being too authoritarian , being too much against freedom etc , without concrete things to point out . 
  [ a german article about exaggerations ] ( http://www.welt.de/politik/ausland/article142320319/viktor-orban-liebt-die-provokation.html ), 
  livestream from keleti https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blbyxbomuhs, 
  hungary ca n't let them board international trains , because they 'd need valid documents for that . 
  this bus ride is not international , it 's just to the last village , to the border crossing . 
  refugees can move freely , and clearly they are walking on the motorway towards the border . 
  so hungary offers to help them make the trip to the border , but not any further . 
  hungary is currently sending more than 100 buses to offer a ride for the walking asylum seekers and all people at the budapest-keleti station to hegyeshalom , the last village in hungary before the austrian border . 
  there , asylum seekers get off the bus and do what they please and what austrian authorities suggest/allow . 
  the hungarian government says they are getting no help or communication from austria and germany and the people can not stay on the motorway for the night due to safety reasons , so they give them a ride . 
  update : austria and germany take them . 
  [ source ] ( http://index.hu/belfold/2015/09/04/lazar/ ) [ livestream from budapest keleti railway station ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blbyxbomuhs ), 
  hungary is currently sending more than 100 buses to offer a ride for the walking asylum seekers and all people at the budapest-keleti station to hegyeshalom , the last village in hungary before the austrian border .

  [ source ] ( http://index.hu/belfold/2015/09/04/lazar/ ), 
  what do you mean about using them as pressure ? 
  what is your concrete suggestion ? 
  put them in the camps with the riot police , tear gas and water cannons ? 
  they go on hunger strike at the train station near the refugee camp bicske and wo n't get off the train . 
  then if they have to wait a few days to get their registration done , they get impatient and escape the camps and go walking on the train tracks ( yes there is another crowd walking on tracks , besides those on the motorway ) . 
  meanwhile , nobody gives any concrete suggestions , just criticism . 
  german diplomats should speak to this crowd in arabic and tell them they can go to germany once they are registered in hungary as per eu regulations ( assuming that 's the case ) . 
  or something . 
  but right now hungary is totally left alone to do something with them , against their will . 
  every day 2000 more come in from the southern border but austria wo n't let them out , so they are crowding up . 
  they do n't want to hear about any camp or anything , just about going to germany . 
  so why is n't the ambassador there ? 
  in syria , turkey , lebanon . 
  they and the young children and the injured people ca n't make the balkan route . 
  they are left there and nobody cares about them . 
  germany says `` if you can manage to come to germany by illegal means , i 'll welcome you will open arms and you 'll get to stay . 
  oh you ca n't make the journey crossing 8 countries illegally ? 
  tough luck !, 
  cant afford to pay the human smugglers ? 
  better find some money then ! '', 
  just like the uk , germany should also take the refugees directly from syria , turkey and lebanon . 
  it is inhumane to make them go through the whole balkan route . 
  this is absolutely unacceptable . 
  it 's a hunger strike . 
  locals are bringing them supplies ( food , water , baby carriages ) . 
  the question is rather where they are going to sleep . 
  my guess is that they will go in the refugee camp nearby . 
  they are about 7 km from there , so about 2 more hours . 
  i do n't think that they will be allowed to walk there in the dark . 
  so they will be guided to the refugee camp . 
  maybe they 'll borrow the idea . 
  germany is prepared for 800,000 people this year . 
  i think it 's only been 200,000 till this day , so another 600,000 is still in their expectations , so yes , accommodation and monthly allowance . 
  it * is * madness , because germany says they are very welcoming and hospitable , but to whom ? 
  germany expects them to undertake the illegal and dangerous journey through the balkans and reward those who successfully make it . 
  what about the wounded ? 
  what about the elderly ? 
  the large families ? 
  now they are mostly men around 18-25 . 
  why not send some planes or trains directly to turkey and take them to germany directly to give all of them equal opportunity , not just those who will risk their lives ? 
  how * dare * merkel say anything about being humanitarian when she encourages this insane procedure of forcing people to cross through the balkans by whatever means , illegally , by smugglers who take 10,000 $ ... 
  this is barbaric . 
  i 'm pretty sure * something * will happen until that . 
  i ca n't really imagine that they will march on for more than a week ...

  this is actually part of [ reddiquette ] ( https://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette?v=08ebd986-6459-11e2-83d1-12313d182d8d ) and is routinely done by everybody . 
   put the file type at the end of the title if it is something other than html or text , like [ pdf ] or [ video ] . 
  what ? 
  pattern recognition ? 
  that 's embedded in the human brain . 
  what 's the point of having multinational companies , that do n't pay a dime in taxes , in your country if your people do n't benefit from it ? 
  i do n't want to compete . 
  no one does . 
  because it 's low . 
  we want you to stop the bullshit and man up . 
  that is talking about the total number of workers employed , not irish . 
  according to the article :  total employment with overseas companies now stands at 187,056 however , according to [ this article ] ( http://www.independent.ie/business/irish/number-of-new-foreign-workers-rises-50pc-in-two-years-31213878.html ) :  more than 40,000 foreign workers moved to ireland to take up jobs in 2014 so , how many of those `` hundreds of thousands '' are actually irish ? 
   there 's hundreds of thousands employed by these companies [ citation needed ], 
  you do n't learn pattern recognition if there is no pattern like in english . 
  thus they regularise it . 
  hungarian too . 
  to the extent that we do n't have proper dialects and accents anymore ( with the excpetion of the szekely and csango peoples ) . 
  in hungarian you can grab a handful of words season it with some suffixes and affixes , put it in a blender , pour it on the ground and it will form a sentence . 
  and we also have language nazis overlooking the evolution of the language . 
   one terror attack is nothing man . 
  i 'm sorry but this is just plain stupid . 
  i do n't even know how to respond . 
  and there were two or have you forgotten charlie hebdo ? 
  furthermore , daesh is keep threatening the west . 
  do n't for a moment think that it 's over . 
   parts of brazil or mexico are unsafe because of the crime rate . 
  yes , there are more dangerous countries but that does n't make france safe . 
  not by a long shot . 
  again . 
  you have no idea why they issued the warning . 
  they have intelligence agencies , you have an opinion . 
  you laughing at it does n't make it any less serious . 
  i 'm pretty sure you said the same thing before the paris attacks . 
  your ( non-existent ) spelling and pronunciation rules , probably . 
  not media , governments . 
  is it really that hard to understand ? 
  i do n't know how to say this differently , english is not my native language . 
  these are official warnings . 
  your perception of security has nothing to do with this . 
  i never said anything about being scared . 
  that 's not for you to decide . 
  you have no information about the possible threats whatsoever . 
  i do n't think governments make decisions based on your drinking habits . 
  yeah , i wrote that comment in a hurry . 
  i 'm not really concerned about it just saying that it 's not a far off idea that it could happen . 
  there are mosquitos in europe too . 
  and a virus mutating and infecting other species is not unheard of . 
  absolutely . 
  and some countries did just that after the attacks . 
  france is in a state of emergency . 
  and by the way , governments still warn citizens to take precautions when travelling to paris . 
   there is a high threat from terrorism . 
  attacks could be indiscriminate . 
  due to ongoing threats to france by islamist terrorist groups , and recent french military intervention against daesh ( formerly referred to as isil ) , the french government has warned the public to be extra vigilant and has reinforced its own domestic and overseas security measures . 
  you should be vigilant in public places and follow the advice of local french authorities . 
  well , it 's all good then . 
  is it ? 
  tunisia is bordering lybia which is in the middle of a bloody civil war . 
  plus , you know , a few dozen tourists died there last year . 
  at this point literally anybody would be better . 
  just elect one of those homelesses . 
  you see , over here we can focus on more than one issue . 
  one of them , the most urgent one , being the migrant crisis . 
  a close second is not to let this happen again . 
  although , i agree that this thread is not the place to discuss it . 
  what 's being done ? 
  in case you did n't understand he is saying we should seal the borders and not let these people in because it will destroy europe 's cultural heritage . 
  that 's a good argument . 
  europe will be better off without the uk as it seems . 
  a constructed language and we still do n't get to be called magyars . 
   however i feel like i personally have more control over the government in the uk than i do over the eu ... quite the opposite , actually . 
  that 's your government 's main concern . 
  they ca n't do whatever they want because they have to comply with the eu rules . 
   hundreds of ak47s seized every year . 
  is this true ? 
  if it is how did this happen and why has n't anybody done anything about it ? 
  it 's not an ultimate solution but it can be part of a bigger plan . 
  sending a message to the ruling class should be the first thing we do . 
  if we stop issuing visas it wo n't affect the inflow because they do n't apply for them now either . 
  but it will send a message for the people who do use visas and they 're usually the ruling classes . 
  so , do you see the flaw in your logic now ? 
  why would you get more inflow ? 
  the ones getting the visas are not the ones going on thousand kilometres journeys risking their lifes . 
  look around what has been happening . 
  european men ** are ** weak . 
  try to do the same thing in an arab country as a european . 
  yeah , okay . 
  `` literally every other sunni islamist group '' . 
  not big but 2 million people used to live there and strategically it was very important . 
  as soon as the saa/ndf finish encircling aleppo the rebels will have no supply route left . 
   well i meant that current plans obviously do n't involve connecting with iraqi border or retaking kurdish controlled territories . 
  yes , i think that 's a long term plan . 
  the russians first want to settle the internal issues and then take care of isil . 
  that 's why they were rushing the peace talks too . 
  but i do n't see this turning in favour of the rebels . 
  their days are numbered . 
  although , i 'm pretty sure they wo n't go down easy . 
  idlib is still fully under their control and they just introduced conscription . 
  we 're going to see some very gruesome battles in the coming weeks . 
   think of it as already in place non spoken agreement that might become official when time is fit to actually have official non agression pact that would be beneficial for both sides for forceable time in the future .

  despite this , we helped them in and after the balkan wars ( it was more of a humanitarian help , but after the war we also sent troops to preserve the peace ) , and the connections are now less tense than with the romanians for example . 
  also , our capital has a surprisingly big serbian community , which is really lovely , and contributed to serbian culture greatly . 
  in fact , we do . 
  it 's not an everyday topic , but there are many hatecrimes against hungarians in vojvodina . 
  i 'm not saying that every serb hates us ( the folks in belgrade are rather decent , for example ) , but there is a major hate going on . 
  on contrary , i have several friends among the hungarian serb minority , i attended a few cultural events , and they are really kind people . 
  is milk-cap some kind of shroom ? 
  we have many . 
  the most ridiculous is more of a comedic threat than an actual saying ( we do n't even use it seriously , because it is so much more funny than frightening ) : `` megtan\u00edtalak keszty\u0171be dud\u00e1lni ! '', 
  - `` i will teach you how to toot in a glove ! '', 
  so much this . 
  somehow it 's always a little bit different and more complicated here when it comes to these things . 
  historical and geological sights . 
  wehrabooism , my ass . 
  man , i literally just told you the story . 
  okay , it was n't the totenkopf ss after all , but still the german army . 
  i 'm trying to comprehend , but how does all this shit with the vienna award and orb\u00e1n come to the picture ? 
  you imply things which have no connection to the topic whatsoever . 
  consider also that these young men are mainly 2nd generation of immigrants . 
  their parents are really thankful that the country they live in let them make a living there , but they kept their original traditions , values , etc. 
  they pass these down to their children , who simply experience the exact opposite of these values every day in their life . 
  this duality combined with the hardships of being a young adult nowadays leads to them feeling outcasts in the sociality they were born into . 
  so we have a young adult , who is frustrated , lost and angry at everything , and is presented to an ideology , which 100 % matches his thoughts about the world . 
  i do n't think its their fault . 
  people just associate everything of our national heritage with radicalism . 
  it 's really a shame though . 
  corruption . 
  if there is even a doubtful evidence , that 's a big no-no . 
  corruption is like the achilles-heel of eastern europe , and we should get rid of it permanently . 
  honesty above all . 
   that 's because when they came to our country , we were allies , so the german soldiers treated romanians better than russian soldiers ( they are described by some as kinder than the russians and more educated ) this is the truth . 
  my grandma had a lot of stories about the war . 
  she and ehr friends got orange and even chocolate from the german soldiers , but they had to be hidden from the russians , because they would legitimately rape pre-teen girls . 
  the red army was a bunch of godforsaken animals . 
  the germans were just soldiers in a war . 
  we want the bruders back ( not as rulers , tho ) . 
  we even kept the german university in budapest and everything !, 
  thanks for mentioning old hungarian < 3, 
  die antwoord is the best . 
  they were performing in budapest last year , and god damn , they are some crazy motherfuckers , it was really amazing . 
  also , south africa gave the world charlize theron . 
  she 's one of the most beautiful women in the world . 
  this is really interesting question , the whole preww2 era is controversial . 
  we call it horthy-era , after the governor . 
  he himself was n't an all out fascist , he was just conservative imho , there was also democracy , election in every 4 years , etc. 
  some prime ministers were kind of fascistoid however , eventually they accepted anti-jew laws , and participated in the holocaust but horthy did n't like hitler at all , and the pressure coming from the reich was really big . 
  during the war , the germans eventually came and raised an all-out fascist party ( the nyilas party ) and got rid of the governor . 
  the nyilas goverment collaborated with the nazis , they took their part in the holocaust , gave the national treasury ( the gold of the national bank , and even the holy crown ) and they have really bad reputation since then . 
  horthy is another question , some ( like me ) praise him as the last true patriot and honest politician in the country , some spit when they hear his name , and call him a nazi-collaborant . 
  the truth may be somewhere in between . 
  eastern europe as whole turns slowly and surely to the far right . 
  all countries around here are pretty conservative , and since we were always bullied by bigger powers , also a little bit xenophobic . 
  remember that we all experienced communism , too , and do n't want that back ever , so the left is usually viewed as bunch if excommies in many countries ( which they sometimes are , indeed ) . 
  we have a promenade named after him in budapest !, 
  wow , i did n't know anything about the guy so far . 
  thanks !, 
  yeah , it was a major outrage in the 19th century . 
  they called you the `` fish lard relatives '' . 
  it 's mean , but i find the term funny . 
  all of our legends explicitly states , that we are the descendants of the huns , so it was sort of understandable back then . 
  but science proved it otherwise . 
  exactly . 
  almost all kinds of ducks are protected by law around here , big game is deer and boar , but pheasant and rabbit might be even more popular . 
  eminescu really sounds like the stage name of a rapper called marshall matherescu . 
  hungary as a state stands more than a 1000 years now , but we only have remote ideas about where we come from originally ( according to the current , academically accepted theory , we are related to finns , estonians , and small tribes around the ural ) . 
  the doubt birthes the wildest kinds of lunatics who spread their ideas on the internet . 
  i have heard so many bullshit theories that i can not even count . 
  we were `` supposedly related '' to : sumers , japanese , tibetians , aryans , etruscs , even south american ( ! ), 
  indians . 
  it 's usually kind of funny how serious these people are . 
  several friends/relatives of mine hunt , the most common hunting dogs around here are dachshunds , fox terriers and beagles . 
  ( the hunts here are rather big , organised events , the usage of dogs is limited , they are only there to get foxes and rabbits out of their holes . ), 
  labs are really common , but only as a pet . 
  edit : almost forgot [ vizslas ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vizsla ) . 
  common pet and hunting dog aswell . 
  good point , i do n't know what are they doing still in the counter . 
  nonetheless , they tasted bad even when we got them . 
  it 's so disgusting , my cousin brought home a bunch from the states like 10 years ago , and we still have them . 
  i have quite a few circles of friends i usually hang out with , and each is different . 
  the guys from my hometown like boardgames a lot , so usually we play , and we drink fine wines and occasionally p\u00e1linka . 
  the bros from the old dorm-room are weedheads and mememaster-shitlords , when we hang out we joke a lot , and usually end up blackout drunk in some underground club in budapest listening to techno , goa or something similar . 
  one of my best friends is a volleyball player , i attend their matches a lot , and sometimes go partying together with his teammates . 
  again , lots of drinks in their dorm and clubing after ( budapest aswell ) . 
  my current roommate and i have a bunch female friends from the highschool times , when we are out with the girls , we usually attend to cultural events , mainly theatre plays and concerts , or have a dinner together in the city . 
  in the capitol , there are a lot of ways to socialize , i go out once or twice a week , and try to maintain all of my friendships . 
  since i live in a country of alcoholics , drinking is literally always part of the evening , even after theatre play , we usually go to a bar to talk about what we watched . 
  in the rural region , the possibilities are much-much more limited , i would n't even go out if it were n't for the friends , possibly . 
  i 'd have went with szil\u00e1rd ( means ` solid ' , or ` hard ' , for those who do n't speak magyar ) , but attila is a bit better . 
  kinda agree , the present is dark . 
  but i believe we will recover . 
  we always did . 
  i wish for everyone to come home from abroad and help us build a better country . 
  last response from my side . 
  under atrocities i usually mean small , but meaningful things , like the romanian politician who voted against the traditional catholic festival of \u0218umuleu ciuc getting unesco world-heritage status or your ex-president stating romania ends at the tisa . 
  and there are the little personal things like when 5 years ago in a restaurant we were n't served , because we were speaking in hungarian to each other with my family , or 3 years ago , when me and my friend ( he 's local ) almost got jumped on by a bunch of guys , simply for telling a joke in hungarian on the street ( romania was n't involved . 
  but i spoke hungarian , and got spit on and told to watch my tongue ) . 
  you are basically calling me ( and my nation ) butthurt over things which happen a 100 years ago , yet come up with ah , and the state of the minorities there . 
  and how russia and the crimean annexion come to the picture ? 
  i do n't get it . 
  the video you linked neither makes sense to me , in fact i feel like it kinda even proves my point .

  if you are happy with the result the test is obviously accurate , other ways is rubbish !, 
  i did n't followed closely the momentum movement/party but what is their connection with ceu ? 
  facepalm !, 
  thanks , 
  i am 100 % sure i did n't understand it  so what was the 30 % easier about ? 
   with the hungarian goverment but a federal goverment has to too . 
  some comments actually say it might require a constitutional amendment in the us ... 
  in hungary ( movies are translated ) - some of the movies actually are better than the original . 
  for example bud spencer has a cult fallowing because the translated jokes were better than the original . 
  sorry , why is bizarre ? 
  again , any law needs a reason !, 
  reciprocating is not a good enough one - because the us side is not causing any damage to hungary . 
  the fact that ceu gives us recognized diplomas is an advantage - which we get for free !, 
  also ceu has ~ 20 % only hungarian students i.e. 
  ~ 300 people/year . 
  do you really think that 's a noticeable disadvantage for hungarian universities ? 
  ( not getting those 300 people ? ) . 
   yet , soros network minions never talk about that , it 's all about how hungary is ravelling into fascism . 
  does that make any sense to you ? 
  listen !, 
  if you go a bit down in my post history you will see that i strongly support orban 's stance on migrants . 
  i also defended him and his policies a million times in this sub . 
  and yes , i agree with you , lefties will exaggerate every fucking time to the point of `` literally hitler '' . 
  i am neutral wrt soros btw - because i care much more what orban does with my tax money than what soros does with his . 
  nevertheless , i strongly believe closing down one of the best universities in hungary ( on their field of study ) is just fucking wrong . 
  and dumb !, 
   why should hungary allow non-eu universities you are correct , but you are asking the wrong question . 
  hungary applies english law - everything which is not forbidden is permitted . 
  and for every law there needs to be a reason on why that law is needed ( we call that spirit of the law ) since every law is basically a restriction on freedom of people . 
  and whereas ceu is indeed linked to soros their academic performance is not !, 
  forbidding one of the best universities in hungary in their field of study is just plain dumb imo . 
  i completely fail to see what hungary might win from it . 
  oh , not to mention that ceu pays yearly ~ 30 million eur to the state budget as taxes . 
  after the election of 6 years ago the then ruling socialist party ( mszp ) imploded into 3 ( or 4 ) smaller parties . 
  the small factions are led by charismatic leaders but they wo n't ever get more than 5-7 % of the votes . 
  and due to egos they work together miserably . 
  for example , they proposed a laughable candidate as mayor candidate of budapest ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m928bri9orq ) - just to change him few weeks before the ellection . 
  ftr : budapest never had a fidesz mayor - even today 's one is independent , backed by fidesz . 
  also , the new election system has 106 ( out of 199 ) seats in parliament based on first past the post system . 
  this means that if any coalition wants to beat orban 's fidesz they will most probably need to ally with jobbik which is a hard to swallow thing for many people . 
  edit : majority of jobbik voters are not nazis ; jobbik has a strong anti corruption message and since they never governed they still have some credibility on the issue . 
  full disclosure : i did n't voted for jobbik , nor i intend to . 
  you mean like this ? 
   the bill proposes tightening regulations on non-eu universities issuing diplomas in hungary , forcing them to close if there 's no bilateral agreement with their home countries . 
  ceu , which is accredited both in the u.s. and in hungary , does n't have such an agreement . 
  another rule would require universities to have a campus in their `` home '' countries as well , a regulation which ceu alone does n't meet among 28 institutions reviewed , education ministry state secretary laszlo palkovics told reporters . 
  source : https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-03-29/soros-s-university-caught-in-orban-campaign-as-ceu-protests-law in hungarian media the gvnmt people claim the fact that ceu diplomas are recognized in us puts hungarian universities at a disadvantage . 
  shall i really explain you why this statement is dumb ? 
  and btw : the government could n't articulate on why this law is needed . 
  edit : also the ceu responds itself with what are the issues : http://www.ceu.edu/article/2017-03-28/ceu-responds-proposed-amendments-hungarian-higher-education-law, 
  their political thinking will influence their lectures . 
  an economically left professor will not praise the trickle down economy whereas a rightie will not preach on the virtues of communism , 
  why do english classes cost 30 % more ? 
  also , no offence , but i think english is a bit easier to learn - easier grammar ( no gender ) and no agglutination . 
  whatever a university teaches ( unless they teach something ** explicitly ** forbidden by law ) is not/should not be of any business to the government . 
  btw , you could call then any economics faculty not teaching matolcsy-sm as `` anti government '' ... 
   thus it would n't bear the name of that international criminal no offence , did you read the article ? 
  'cause the name of the university is `` central european university '' ... 
   do you guys not realise how disgustingly corrupt he is ? 
  we actually do - but as long as opposition ca n't agree on anything orban will stay . 
   i 'm pretty sure he talks about popper a lot soros 's philosophical system builds on popper 's , and he was his student , so yeah . 
  ceu did n't really got involved into hungarian politics though . 
  for the millionth time : american is lingua franca because of hollywood and music not because of uk being in eu or not . 
  german will become lingua franca when will be associated with things people think are cool . 
  i might be an unicorn but i am strongly against ** any ** form of censorship . 
  i do n't care so much about what what western countries do , i care about hungary . 
  banning of ** any ** ideas by ** any ** government is wrong imo . 
  edit : yes , even idiotic ones like flat earthers or holocaust deniers !, 
  and attempting of shutting down one of the highest ranking universities in hungary ( in their field of study ) is plain stupid !, 
  not to speak that we can build ~ 100km of fence yearly from their taxes !, 
  also i am less worried on what soros does with his money than what my government does with my tax money . 
  hungary closed well over 100 000 asylum requests from 2015 on the fact `` could not find applicant '' ... since they 're all in germany and sweden - asylum shopping happens since forever . 
  i 'm glad eu got the news 1.5 years later . 
   fantastic move by hungary !, 
  yup . 
  step 1 : ban universities step 2 : burn undesired books step 3 : inprison undesired people step 4 : ???? 
  step 5 : profit !!!, 
   if the law passes in the way it is proposed we both know that if orban really wants it , unless there is massive unrest ( like with the internet tax ) , it 'll pass . 
  true , it would n't be the first time the government proposes something ultragious only to back down to something less ultragious - which was probably what they wanted in the first place . 
   if ceu does not do anything about it opening a campus in new york because that 's our idiotic law ? 
  i would n't do it . 
   too many ` if 's for it to be presented as a fact that ce is facing closure agree , a better title could be `` ceu potentially facing closure '', 
  in hungary we do n't think though that soros works to give us transylvania  - i was told some romanians actually believe that . 
  if the law passes , ceu is facing closure . 
  what is fake ? 
  same here , it 's a sad day . 
  if it heats fast it 'll also cool fast at night . 
  construction workers routinely live in such containers when deployed on site and they do n't have ac either ; heck i had 32 degrees at 11 pm in my living room 2 years ago at 11 pm ... do n't get me wrong , i 'm not saying it 'll be pleasant - i am saying that parts of population live in similar conditions - considering this some form of abuse is ridiculous . 
  two things : 1 . 
  i doubt it 'll get much worse than the last floor of a commie block of flats ( which is under a tarred i.e. 
  black roof ) . 
  nobody seems to care that german shipping homes do n't have ac ( at least i do n't see it ) : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvapiy1vwyq, 
   these containers are obviously not suitable for migrants to be held the period of weeks and months . 
  ** they lack air conditioning ** you got to be kidding me . 
  i 'd say less than 30 % of households have ac here . 
  to me she sounded like any politician who does n't want to say yay or nay even before you clarified the translation . 
  hod do we know you are not one of them too ? 
  because if someone is perceived as nationalist or patriotic sooner or later they 'll get called nazis/alt-righters/etc . 
  of course its not their fault they just want the best for themselves ; it 's germanys `` fault '' for granting asylum for people coming via safe countries . 
   as we can hardly expect them to know the details of european asylum law .

  yeah , naturally . 
  i mean come on , hungary was n't independent for like half a millenium and the identity remained perfectly well , and that was under empires that specifically wanted it to go away ... 
  it 's because languages are a political term , not linguistic, 
   how bizarre it is to have both cases and articles excuse me ? 
  the orb\u00e1nistan meme is huge . 
  its common to refer to him as the `` vikt\u00e1tor '' , his hometown felcs\u00fat is a massive meme as well . 
  also the classic from b\u00f6d\u0151cs tibor where he calls him `` bonsai caesar '' and many others . 
  learned about the plc and after that they were just bundled with the other two baltic states and mostly we only talked about the three as a whole, 
  religious diversity would be another, 
  i do n't think that 's the only thing similar with germany and hungary tbh . 
  yeah same here , in the end what he does is nothing , because he does n't use any of the powers thankfully , nor does he interfere with anything, 
  oh , i see , we do n't often make a distinction between soviet and russian, 
  that 's such a dick move to send free shit you did n't want then make you feel guilty for not paying, 
  interesting , in hungary russian/soviet stuff is usually regarded as `` crappy , shit-looking , but extremely durable '' ... like seriously , my grandma still uses soviet christmas lighting from the early 1970s , and there 's not a single bulb that failed . 
  like holy fucking shit , how do you even, 
   it 's insulting to be lumped together with each othe sorry i guess , but then again you 're gon na have to expect it  to represent us fancy word for doing nothing , so they do n't matter either ? 
  no powers , right ? 
  stay . 
   it 's the most important thing to ever happen in europe . 
  what about the enlightenment ? 
  careful with that edge, 
   do n't give a flying fuck what they call themselves in their language also , there 's nothing positive about calling people by their native names . 
  i for one actually prefer `` hungarian '' over `` magyar '' any day of the week , heck i would find the latter more offensive in a foreign language context, 
  not every gypsy speaks romani , and most gypsies ( the ones i talked to anyway ) actually prefer the equivalent of gypsy rather than roma, 
  a president ? 
  til presidents actually do stuff in czechoslovakia, 
  yeah , it 's pretty much a necessity for people who were on the wrong side of history and been cut off from the rest of the nation . 
  wow i 'm sure lots of people will volunteer to learn serbian and walk around rural serbia and talk to some gypsies just to inform them that they actually have a day, 
  holy mother of christ , insane, 
   nationalism [ . . ] holds that a nation should govern itself , free from unwanted outside interference , and is linked to the concept of self-determination . 
  i would say a strong no, 
  not necessarily , they just like the eu maybe , they might have dual citizenship and nationality , etc. 
  fuck no, 
  do n't really see the point to making exact definitions . 
  in that case sure, 
  as long as you do everything with a healthy amount of cynicism , sure . 
  yeah , true, 
  we got fucked just as much , if not more, 
  probably they are n't either , they probably have communities of immigrants or something, 
  i would argue that it 's worse , because in other places like africa they do n't even try to pretend they 're connected by more than being colonized by the same guys , while here we have this weird culture of nationalism lingering which is honestly , stupid, 
  well mainly in the west they do follow ethnic lines , but in general i would n't say they do that much, 
  by goodly sized you mean minimal . 
  absolutely nothing more than a few villages, 
   5 black people we have in slovenia black people are n't `` diversity '' ... 
  you have a choice between `` shit '' and `` crap '' , or if you 're that type of person , you can even vote for the `` assholes '' or the `` cunts '' . 
  glorious , is n't it ? 
  he meant like for variables and unknowns, 
   losing world wars we lost two world wars too, 
   citiziens who talk shit about their own country definitely not the best at that lol, 
   kings would still be coronated in krak\u00f3w in hungary we also had this , kings would be coronated in sz\u00e9kesfeh\u00e9rv\u00e1r no matter where the capital was, 
  not ia\u015fi ? 
  seconded, 
  well physically speaking , portuguese people :p culturally i would say probably france or something , though most cultures in europe are very much foreign . 
  all the non-basque cultures in europe are, 
  yes it is, 
  well that said most towns have at least a bit of uniqueness in linguistic variation . 
  because i like to talk to people ? 
  well , not sure if this belongs here but in among my friends we use * maf * , which is sort is short for * m * i * a * * f * asz ( what the dick/what the fuck ) . 
  this also has the advantage of sounding nice , unlike the more anglicized variant * wtf * ( v-t-f ), 
  damn , you guys are missing out . 
  that 's like the main use of kurva here , to use it as an adjective , or even as an adverb, 
  really ? 
  you guys cant omit the copula ? 
  yes , its a sentence in hungarian, 
  yeah , it is a sentence , and since it contains one international word and one slavic word , it might also mean the same in some slavic language, 
  yeah sure but those are slavic languages , that 's not hard to do . 
  most of them are basically the same ( no offense slavic people btw , just my experience ), 
  i could imagine a phrase like '' * kurva politika * '' ( fucking politics ) to be the same in some slavic language . 
  otherwise , probably none exist, 
  that 's good . 
  schools are pretty much the most important tool for preserving a language, 
  they could get some honorary titles , like some cities have honorary citizens for certain , they could get some medal or something, 
  do you guys have schools that teach kids the language ? 
   castilian was n't that aragonian ? 
  i do n't think sardinia was part of castille, 
  what would a typical house name be ? 
  it was limited to a small area to begin with , i believe the town is called algu\u00e8r or something close to that ? 
  will look it up once im on the computer, 
  that is really cool  make sure to preserve your language and culture , its important, 
  which tribe/language ? 
  yeah , i guessed so . 
  its really cool that this came from latin aprilis, 
   prill this sounds really cool tbh, 
  it is ? 
   word stress estonian is like the absolute heretic among finno-ugric languages . 
  word stress ?? 
  too much indoeuropean4me m8, 
  though contrary to what the name suggests , it more like a / r/easterneurope _ irl, 
  their days are counted, 
   normally the head of state is a very dignified figure who always behaves up to standard i thought the head of state was basically a joke position , but suit yourself . 
  they do n't . 
  you 're thinking of the catalan community in sardinia, 
   he named his house in breton so , totally gon na gloss over the fact that you guys name your houses ? 
  sure , it had a massive impact on hungarian culture regardless . 
  and yeah , that 's literally what official language means . 
  we usually voice the / s / between vowels into / z / . 
  so , caesar / tse : za : r / for example . 
  we also often have / \u0283 / ( sh ) in place of s , especially at the ends of words like * praxis * / praksi\u0283 / or the suffix - it\u00e1s / - ita : \u0283 / , obviously from latin - itas , equivalent to english - ity . 
  same , except we pronounce `` ae '' the same as the long `` e '' , which is hungarian ' \u00e9 ' , while `` oe '' is a long ' \u0151 ' usually . 
  / g / in hungarian as well,

  got ta love that completely straight line from moscow ro stpetersburg, 
  and jt 's probably the worst picture i 've ever seen of the esztergom basilica . 
  it looks way better than that . 
  it 's fucking huge . 
  look at the bastion at the castle wall, 
  so you think it would be okay if greece would shoot down a turkish plane every day right ? 
  after all they illegally violated the greek borders thousands of times, 
  indeed . 
  that being said , i will hold to my belief that these shots were not meant to seriously damage anything or kill just to scare them away . 
  and i 'm glad noone was hurt . 
  i guess so . 
  i would have been sad that lives were lost unnecessarily , even if the turkish captain was n't behaving properly . 
  as i said , i wish confrontations like these would n't end up in opening fire . 
  what if one wishes none of these incidents have resulted in opening fire ? 
  that being said , there is a difference between opening fire at a ship to scare it away , and shooting down a plane and killing a pilot . 
  especially while knowing turkey 's hypocrisy with border violations, 
  well what else should tiny bullets do while penetrating thin metal ? 
  europeans, 
  i mean . . you just have to read the article ...  `` the greek coast guard immediately demanded the ship to anchor off the port of rhodes while we were passing around the island . 
  they said they would check the ship but we did not accept that . 
  they then said they would shoot if we did n't stop and they did what they said . 
  we have escaped a great danger , '' kalkavan said . 
   it 's no different than headlines saying `` man stabbed outside pub . 
  oh come on . 
  technically it 's no different , but we all know what people were thinking first, 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sfqz6akhjk even freddie wanted to buy it, 
  yep , and it 's generally considered as a good era, 
  it might be shocking to you but vatican is not just a country full of priests, 
  so for every other country it 's ok , but for russia it 's not ? 
  should n't be like this forever tho . 
  germans will eventuly free themselves from this stigma, 
  glad to see it, 
  well op basically said persecuting christians is not even possible , so what do you expect . . 
  and should have used private messages, 
  yes , i wonder which one of the two was the dominant and politically relevant . 
  english , motherfucker , do you speak it ? 
  cheap , safe ( you know what you get ) and has free wifi . 
  plenty of tourists visit mcdonalds . 
  that ` sjust retarded censorship, 
  it 's only weird if you make it out to be . 
  can anyone explain how did this not end up on the frontpage ? 
  it would n't generate such public outrage , media coverage if it would happen in eastern europe . 
  france , the uk and germany are lthe leaders of europe , they are `` more important '' and they are also the cornerstones of modern european culture . 
  k\u00f6cs\u00f6g means jar/jug , but it 's also used as an insult , meaning either fag ( not necessarily used as a gay slur ) or something like asshole ( but stronger than asshole , maybe dickhead would be a good translation ? ) . 
  it is n't really used on women though , so you probably would n't hear `` k\u00f6cs\u00f6g kurva '' on the street , but in hungarian you can basically combine any swearword with another one , so it 's possible . 
  either way , it 's pretty funny to hear it as a children 's song . 
  why, 
  yes , there was definitely a need to call them nazis, 
  are you for fucking real ? 
  we are not that racist . 
  but i guess being on the forefront of anti-immigration makes us somehow extremely racist ... 
  jesus christ what a terrible analogy, 
  i definitely agree . 
  started smoking after it was banned in bars in hungary , but of course i spent plenty of time in pubs with all of my friends smoking when it was still allowed and goddamn i miss that . 
  thinking about the smell and the slightly blurry vision due to smoke gets me nostalgic and i miss that from today 's pubs . 
  because that 's just what the soviets liked to do . 
  even with russians, 
  i though we are going to the uk, 
  on what grounds ? 
  i 'm sure they would have been already arrested , had the police had any evidence, 
  i dunno which country does n't have compulsory education in modern europe , so that 's either bullshit , or that it was their families who did n't `` let them '' go to school . 
  so then how can we talk about a specific ethnicity that very clearly has a problem / is a problem, 
   i mean if you see a gypsi in normal clothes in a normal situation ( not begging on the street or somehting like that ) than you would n't know that he is a gypsi . 
  lol what, 
  b-but i thought counter strike was training people to plant bombs and stuff, 
  well i did n't know that you on the other hand represent all europeans, 
  gangsta rap made me do it, 
  i thought we banned holocaust-denial too . 
  if it 's true , please , could you not paint the country as worse than it is ? 
  why would i hold a grudge against individual soldiers who were forced into a stupid war , especially when they are long dead ? 
  why is it so hard to honour their memory in peace ? 
  is that so ? 
  should i piss on the russian soldiers ' graves instead of lighting candles at all souls ' day ? 
   shoot your guns nope , no guns , thank you very much, 
  we love ireland , i think . 
  i mean , we never had any problem with ireland , hungarians sympathize with irishmen because we both had a shit history and we both love drinking . 
  no idea . 
  for finland i 'd have understood , because nokia , but all these other countries . . 
  i dunno , like steering the country to dictatorship, 
  :( ( this makes me even more depressed, 
  i 'm pretty sure we have more than that . 
  would you really ( well , your government ) cut ties like that due to brexit ? 
  i 'd imagine britain would still be on good terms with neighbouring and friendly countries, 
  that 's a good point . 
  i hope this piece was intended to serve that purpose , because well , as i said , one does not have to be religious to dislike offending people 's religion just to be a dick . 
  i did n't say one should believe . 
  although many theologians have made plenty of arguments in favour of a god , which , obviously noone has to believe . 
  but how is this even relevant right now ? 
  it has no connection to what you said earlier and my reply to that . 
  you make terrible arguments . 
  evolution is in no way able to disprove the existence of god and if a god would exists that would n't make evolution pointless either, 
   but of course i do n't agree with censorship never did i say it should be banned . 
  just that i understand it and to be honest , shit art like this borders hate speech in my opinion, 
  however , it tries to make a point . 
  well , or it 's just a terrible attempt at provoking christianity for shits and giggles . 
  all i 'm saying is that i can understand why it was banned or whatever , but of course i do n't agree with censorship . 
  i just find this work lazy and of poor taste . 
  in my opinion there can be such awful attempts at art , that are n't even worth considering to be art , and this falls into that category . 
  blasphemy laws are fucking stupid and i 'm an atheist . 
  but one has to wonder , what 's the point of this `` art '' ?

  is that sarcasm ? 
  the cluj napuca station was built way before the soviet era and it looks nice and clean based on the video . 
  if you knew what tourists see when they arrive to budapest , our god damn capital , now that 's some disgusting shit . 
  weather in hungary from september to march makes me want to slice my wrists , so anywhere nice and warm is okay . 
  good thing hungary sucks at everything , at least everyone 's shitty complaints are justified . 
  where ? 
  in grocery stores it 's like 120ft . 
  yeah , an other map confirming that hungary became the kid with the down syndrome in the v4 group . 
  in a few months we will be closer to the balkan states than to other v4 members , lol, 
  hungary : -0,8 % business as usual, 
  excessive hunting before the 20th century , now there are barely any forests where the population could recover, 
  `` better '' is just enough to consolidate our position as an underdeveloped balkan country, 
  `` higher growth compared to the eu average ? 
  hungarian reforms are working '', 
  seeing the poverty and neglect all over the country , there is nothing excessive about this, 
  incompetence and corruption, 
  nah , i want more billboards telling me that we are performing better . 
  hungary underperforming , as always nothing new here, 
  the sand was ... very evil . 
  dog : vau vau cat : miau cow : m\u00fa duck : h\u00e1p h\u00e1p pig : that noise you make in the back of your throat roaster : kukurik\u00fa i have no idea about the rest, 
  in addition to the airplane tickets i received 20 000 sheckels for today 's protest from master soros, 
  they can move to rich countries, 
  considering 4 out of 7 hungarian nuts 2 regions are among the eu 's top 10 poorest , `` right now '' is a safe bet, 
  also `` local hungarian producer '' is 50 % dutch, 
  i 'm not even mad . 
  average `` i 'm insecure about my penis size so i 'm going to lie '' in europe, 
  i would n't be surprised, 
  in hungary we are equally poor, 
  these towns are what i liked about germany the most . 
  unfortunately i did n't make it to rothenburg because it seemed to be impossible to go there with public transport ( from mannheim ) , but heidelberg , ladenburg , neustadt an der weinstra\u00dfe , bad wimpfen , bensheim , and all those beautiful places in the rhein-neckar region made up for it . 
  tfw hungary is closer to romania than to the czech republic when it comes to gdp/capita . 
  they did ? 
  sure , but it 's not like the hungarian political elite did n't have an influence on the ** common ** foreign policy, 
   hungary had no say in foreign policy what you realize the empire had 4 hungarian foreign ministers, 
  in hungary it 's one of the most popular tv shows since the late 90s, 
  lots of everyday products in germany are way cheaper than in hungary for example , can of tuna in german lidl : 1 $ ( 310huf ) same can of tuna in hungarian lidl : 450huf and do n't even get me started on the product selection ... 
  holding hands in public , existing, 
  it 's just some guy , his outfit looks way too modern for a hungarian soldier, 
  ah , good old fremdsch\u00e4men, 
  nice job cleaning that mess up . 
  many areas of budapest still look like the first pic . 
  because reasons although i do n't see anyone using roman numbers in dates anymore, 
  temirtau , kazakhstan ( the graffiti is based on `` la danse '' , by henri matisse ), 
  quality soil = / = quality agriculture . 
  hungarians always boast about how valuable our land is and we have to protect it from evil austrian farmers yet markets and stores are full of sub-par quality crap . 
  what about the martyrs or arad , many of whom were born outside the kingdom of hungary , to armenian/croatian/german / austrian/etc parents ? 
  or istv\u00e1n sz\u00e9chenyi for that matter , who was born in vienna , and struggled with the hungarian language ? 
  yet i do n't think anyone disputes the identity of these people . 
  this is hilarious considering many hungarian national heroes were born outside the country and/or barely spoke the language . 
  i lived in germany ... noticed more blondes and turks compared to hungary but that 's it ... 
  i 've been to other countries as well but i did n't spend enough time to judge the local female population lol . 
  idk . . maybe they 're not ? 
  you have attractive and less attractive women like in any other country . 
  imo what makes it unique to other historical cities on rivers is having a hill on one side with beautiful buildings overlooking the city , heidelberg altstadt comes to mind with a similar layout but that 's very tiny in comparison . 
  if people were proud the city would n't look so dirty and neglected in most areas, 
  [ relevant ] ( http://static.fjcdn.com/large/pictures/e0/70/e07016_1006357.jpg ), 
  do n't worry , we are joining in, 
  +1 i randomly signed up for a semester in germany ( i had low expectations because two of my friends were recently on erasmus and they hated it ) , it ended up redeeming the whole shitty college experience for me . 
  i still feel sad about coming back . 
  i ca n't recommend it enough , especially if you have no tuition at your home university , then you have nothing to lose . 
  it pisses me of that this was the first thing people asked me when i came back from erasmus , not which places i 've seen , what kind of people i 've met , what 's it like to live there , etc . . except my family , they know i 'm hopeless and my answer would be no . 
  hungary reporting in !, 
  [ i know right ] ( http://ocdn.eu/images/pulscms/ogi7mdmsmmu0ldasmswx/b23967b29ebffa5a3abe2c4ac44e58f0.jpeg ), 
  is it ? 
  alright communism was rough but nowadays you can enjoy the goodies from both sides . 
  ( live in hungary and work in austria ) no wonder employers have a hard time finding anybody to work for them in western-hungary . 
  i knew this was only a matter of time . 
  to put it in perspective : everyday products cost the same or even less compared hungary . 
  ( with an average income of 2300 $ vs 600 $ ) . 
  hungarians are poor as shit . 
  hungary fucking sucking at something compared to the rest of cee , nothing new . 
  germany, 
  neglect and decay everywhere , depressed people , toxic social atmosphere . 
  i hate the fact that i have to go back there after finishing my studies abroad . 
  what 's wrong with skyscrapers outside the historical city centre ? 
  yes . 
  hungarian voters who never set their feet abroad and only gain information from mass media . 
   improvised temporary pubs yeah . . `` temporary '' :(, 
  imo it blends in nicely , a great achievement for something built in the 1970s [ this ] ( http://media.funiq.hu/images/68/2a/14354_orig_art721.jpg ) on the other hand ... absolutely disgusting, 
  unpopular hungarian opinion : bland t\u00far\u00f3 rudi sucks , fruit fillings all the way, 
  wake up mr. freeman . . wake up and smell the asheees . 
  he confuses it with budapest / s, 
  i could n't give less shits about lte speeds when the coverage is so bad i 'm praying for at least a steady 2g connection while traveling in the countryside, 
  not surprised , regarding cellular data hungary is in the stone age, 
  `` but muh pure hungarian blood '', 
  do you even austria-hungary bro, 
  over 70 % of the populace is pro eu , there is no general defiance . 
  ( 90 % under the age of 30 ) and about 25 % of the eligible voters chose orban . 
  people just do n't think there is an alternative . 
  stop spreading shit . 
  of course it was against the ceu . 
  nobody cared about international schools and fake diplomas until soros became the boogeyman . 
  then , suddenly the state propaganda ( origo ) `` aquired '' a report that `` the soros university ( ! ), 
  is violating hungarian laws '' ( it did n't ) do you actually believe the crap you are saying ? 
   when you get to the public vote , we do n't actually see which country voted for which countries , which let 's face it , is half the fun in eurovision . 
   `` see , mom , those balkan jerks always vote for eachother !! '', 
  meanwhile the hungarian state funded media writing articles about how the leaders of the uk , france , germany , and italy have no children , while orb\u00e1n has 5 . 
  everyday i 'm surprised that the country can sink even lower . 
  because western populists can use it for `` muh eastern autocrats '' while eastern populists can use it for `` muh western liberals '', 
  db is expensive and unreliable .

  nah , people still do n't have any idea , they just get annoyed by the extra popup that they have to close . 
  people have been trained to click `` agree '' buttons without reading for decades now . 
  japan and south korea may be economically/financially in the same system since a few decades , but they are culturally and historically quite different . 
  i could perhaps summarize western nations as the european ones ( not geographically , but those based on the greco-roman and christian cultural legacy ) plus those founded by european powers minus those where a previous local population ( not the settlers ) gained independence from said european power since then . 
   the enlightenment , democracy , and free market economics and the constant need for modernization , is more in line with the view of westernization here , maby because its more inclusive ? 
  westernization is a different thing than becoming an actual western nation i think . 
  it 's more about becoming compatible with western economy and law . 
  such a country can become `` westernized '' but i would n't say it 's western . 
   the enlightenment , democracy , and free market economics and the constant need for modernization perhaps because americans focus more on recent history ( due to being founded `` recently '' in terms of history ) , while europe has a continuous unbroken chain of history from the foundational greco-roman tradition to this day . 
  -- edit : also your use of the word `` alliance '' suggest that you use `` western '' as a term for a political alliance or `` side '' in the major conflicts , which may be a legacy from the cold war ( first world , second world , third world ) , so you may be confounding/mixing first world and western culture . 
  i personally have no problem with it if for example in some eastern culture they never shake hands , but respectfully bow instead , i can accept that . 
  at least from tourists or people who are in europe for a few years . 
  whether i 'd give them * citizenship * is a bit more difficult question , because i think citizenship should be given to people who have actually integrated into the local culture and accepted the general customs and way of life in europe . 
  i do n't have a european identity , i have a western culture identity , which includes europe + us + latin america + australia etc. 
  i do n't feel much more connected to a portuguese person than a venezuelan . 
  or an english guy vs. an american . 
  these i consider familiar , as opposed to for example india , china , middle east and most of africa , which i consider markedly more foreign . 
  the basis of western culture is the historical legacy of ancient greece , the roman empire , christianity , the renaissance , the enlightenment , the age of national romanticism , also the latin alphabet ^ ( yeah , i 'm aware of cyrillic ) , the shared general broad customs etc. 
  but most of the pictures were not taken at school . 
  yeah , but you ca n't say `` a normal day of an at-school in spain '' . 
  in my english class at my school in hungary we were referred to as pupils only in grades 1-4 , and from 5th on ( ~ age 12 ) as students . 
  but in german they only call university students `` student '' , before that they are `` sch\u00fcler '' . 
  i do n't know what he means with that . 
  i do n't think it 's a realistic interpretation that all visitors should give fingerprints when entering the schengen zone , but who knows . 
  yeah they made a government mouthpiece of the state-owned media . 
  that 's true . 
  but ( 1 ) how many people watch it anyway , ( 2 ) it does n't mean there 's no press freedom , because the opposition media is pretty big , too . 
  tvs : atv , rtl klub ; newspapers : n\u00e9pszava , n\u00e9pszabads\u00e1g ( i do n't read paper news any more so i do n't know too many ) , online : index , 444 . 
  can * an animal be homosexual * though ? 
  has that been observed ? 
  i mean sure they have observed homosexual sex or courtship rituals , but that can be due to lots of things , like dominance assertion , momentary `` brain glitches '' etc. 
  to call an animal gay , it would have to be consistently , continuously gay for its lifetime ( or at least most of its lifetime ) . 
  so a gay male animal should n't become interested at all when it sniffs ovulating females . 
  does this exist ? 
  i do n't know . 
  perhaps in some apes ? 
  i never heard of it . 
  but in turtles ? 
  i 'm pretty skeptical about this until further evidence . 
  can you show me studies about life-long homosexual animals ? 
  ones that do n't care about the other sex , only about their own ? 
  i know that homosexual sex has been observed occasionally in animals , but that can be due to any number of things , including asserting dominance etc. 
  if an animal is continuously homosexual for its lifetime , that would be interesting to see . 
  did this comment really contribute to the quality of the discussion ? 
  somehow western europeans were not so concerned about press freedom and plurality when basically all media was in the hands of socialists/post-communists . 
  remember the times of nap-kelte etc. , all commercial channels siding with the socialist govt ( heti hetes etc. ) . 
  basically magyar nemzet was the only right-wing newspaper ( magyar h\u00edrlap was also leftist then ) . 
  so yeah , in the last 10-15 years they built a right-wing media and the state tv sides with the government , as it did when the socialists governed ( do n't tell me nap-kelte was n't disgusting ) . 
  yes , our media is polarized and all outlets are biased and there are propaganda ones , true . 
  i also do n't like this . 
  but these `` concerned '' western europeans make it look like there 's some huge alarming change going on and orb\u00e1n is silencing the opposition , which is just not true . 
  there are lots of critical articles . 
  for example online , the whole 444 . hu is nothing but bashing , mocking and ridiculing fidesz and the government . 
  in hungary they put sweets and small bottles of high % alcohol there . 
  ( cigarettes ca n't be sold in normal supermarkets ), 
  not that it 's too relevant , but what do you actually know about press freedom in hungary ? 
  concretely . 
  because i read hungarian media every day and it looks perfectly free . 
  the state tv is orb\u00e1n 's propaganda channel ( and it was that of the socialists ' when they governed ) , but there are tons of government-critical newspapers and channels exercising press freedom . 
  nothing too new . 
  my unofficial translation : * 1 . 
  borders practical enforcement of current eu and schengen laws about regular control of external borders and eu citizens ( schengen border control codex ) . 
  this should remain the task of member states , but if a member state can not fulfil these requirements the european border guard agency should intervene according to an agreement with the given member state . 
  if there is no such agreement , the schengen membership of the member state may be suspended . 
  identification further develop the external border protection via the eu border registration system and by mandatorily taking biometric identification data from people crossing the external schengen border . 
  * 3 . corrections correct the common european asylum system , including restoring the well-functioning dublin system and its full enforcement in greece . 
  there should be stronger sanctions on a member state level against abusing asylum laws . 
  outside the eu asylum procedures should be carried out outside eu territory , in closed and guarded hotspots , before entering the eu . 
  the eu should provide financial contributions to create safe hot spots and adequate conditions . 
  agreements make agreements with countries of origin and transit countries about the return of migrants and enforce them in cooperation with those countries . 
  return of people illegal migrants have to be sent back to safe countries of origin or transit countries . 
  conditionality the foreign policy and security , development and visa policy of the eu must ensure that the goals of the eu migration policy are achieved . 
  changes in eu policies have to depend on third countries ' willingness to cooperate . 
  aid efforts to implement the eu migration policy must be helped through financial and other support for the primary target countries and the western balkan countries . 
  safe countries a common european list of safe third countries must be created and this should be used when building hotspots . 
  it must be taken into consideration that asylum seekers are not under concrete threat after crossing several safe countries . 
  voluntariness answers to demographic and job market challenges must be sovereign member state decisions . 
  according to the eu treaty 's article 5 , paragraph 2 , it must stay a national competency to decide if a member state wants to answer challenges using national or eu-internal resources and policies or immigrants coming from outside the eu . 
  there should be no mandatory and automatic mechanism introduced . 
  due to the importance of the issue , the european council should provide guidance to the ongoing legislative process . 
   jews left in hungary , or barely any . 
  there are about 80-200 thousand jews in hungary , most in budapest . 
  and it 's not really against those everyday jews , but the abstract global idea of the world-controlling jews , usa+i srael , global finance , soros , the `` economic colonization '' of hungary etc. 
   european left western european . 
  around here the far-right still hates israel/jews and the left is still pro-israel/jews . 
  this is why today 's hungarian nationalism is such a strange mix . 
  the 1848 revolution against the habsburgs was a liberal , republican , humanist revolution , freeing the serfdom and ending feudalism and the oppression of the poor . 
  it was a time of poor but revolutionary poets , but also a time of great respect ( hero-worship ) of the original , ethnic hungarian kings of the 11th-15th centuries . 
  even today , there are nationalists who like the idea of a monarchy , who believe in the doctrine of the holy crown , the importance of the apostolic kingdom and land of mary etc. 
  then you have pagan-style nationalists who say christianity was forced onto hungary by western powers and king stephen i was a traitor who killed his own with foreign help ( while others see him as someone who saved the nation from perishing , by adopting western culture and allowed our integration into europe ) . 
  they rather like to dress in ancient hungarian-style , emphasize the imporance of our horse-riding nomadic origins , use the old hungarian ( runic-like ) alphabet etc. 
  then you have the republicans , who first and foremost side with the 1848-ians , mostly lajos kossuth . 
  of course these can all mix in a single person as well . 
  so someone may like kossuth and also respect the christian \u00c1rp\u00e1dian kings and also like the old hungarian alphabet and also like habsburg sissy and the times of peaceful dualism . 
  also just to add to the weirdness , many far-right nationalists used to like muslims , because they are enemies of the jews . 
  also , most people hate the ottoman turkish oppression era , but that is n't a clear good guy-bad guy issue either . 
  many famous and respected hungarians of those centuries made deals and pacts with the turks , since they equally or more hated the habsburg austrians . 
  many of them moved to turkey to exile and died there . 
  especially the hungarian princes of transylvania , like imre th\u00f6k\u00f6ly . 
  so when people try to give some concise verdict or summary of hungarian nationalism without understanding all these things and the complications of the 20th century ( like trianon and understanding the postitions of figures such as horthy or sz\u00e1lasi and how they were seen under communism , and understanding how 1956 is seen and the nostalgia for goulash communism ) , it usually comes out seeming pretty ignorant .

  are german courts based on precedent ? 
  a decision from a court becomes mandatory for similar cases or it 's a case by case ? 
  same here , kind of ; although i do n't know anymore who is left and who is right around here . 
   brain drain not like eu kidnaps them , just saying . 
   or maybe they were drunk bear cost in finland 6 eur . 
  in budapest , ( less than ) 2 eur . 
   this is more about taking them at all a signatory of geneva convention should take any asylum request from persons coming directly from a country where they are persecuted . 
   there is no international treaty that forces them to take them back at all true , unless there are readmission treaties . 
   some kind of permit my head is spinning . 
  how many types of permit do you guys have ? 
   the escape velocity of the food lmao , ok  i guess our stomach is so used to it we do n't feel it anymore . 
   once the levels are sufficiently reduced so that your food only burns when it goes in , and not also when it goes out , it 's actually darn good sir , you 'd been misinformed . 
  there are two types of paprika : sweet and hot . 
  the sweet one does n't burn ( not even on the input channel  it is also used more often - for example for a 10l of gulyas i put 3 spoons of sweet and one spoon of hot . 
  if you editorialize a title the mods will delete it . 
   but then the locals are disadvantaged . 
  and then the extreme right wing will benefit which scares me . 
  jobbik ( our right wing nuts ~ 20 % votes ) already propagated that `` migrants get more/better food than the sick in hospitals '' . 
   germany actually has every right to force all of these refugees back to hungary where they came from . 
  how would mr. orb\u00e1n like that ? 
  hungary so stronk that it borders now syria and afghanistan . 
  soon , hungary can into space as well . 
  take that poland brothers !, 
   that 's a win from germany 's standpoint . 
  hard to say . 
  assuming they do n't get the jobs of locals ( because the locals will be then on benefits ) and that some wo n't engage into criminal activity , yes can be a win . 
   germany never said `` come '' true , germany said `` you are welcome '' . 
  anyway , what germany said does n't really matter . 
  what the rest of the planet understood does  i filtered a g-search of `` refugees welcome germany '' for 08/25 - 09/15 , [ have a look ] ( https://www.google.com/search?q=refugees+welcome+germany&amp;safe=off&amp;source=lnt&amp;tbs=cdr%3a1%2ccd_min%3a8%2f25%2f2015%2ccd_max%3a9%2f15%2f2015&amp;tbm= ) i find it hard to believe that a politician of merkel 's caliber had no idea how the media will pass the message . 
   one thing to speak about : let 1000ppl . 
  sit in main station and basically just wait till they get hungry , tired or desperate is not my understanding of humane treatment . 
  could you please check the facts ? 
  the people at keleti were requested repeatedly to be relocated to refugee shelters where they had food & stuff . 
  guess what ? 
  they refused !, 
  apparently not so hungry and desperate . 
  the hungarian police could had forcibly remove them ( and send them to camps ) but then that would had been inhuman ... damned if we do and damn if we do n't . 
  also there are reports of people living on streets in germany , waiting to be registered so yeah ... 
  i doubt it 'll stop . 
  large number of migrants are from balkan area - they should know they have virtually no chance of asylum and still coming . 
  and yes , many people will prefer working illegally in germany than legally in hungary . 
  also there were the reports that only 14 % of people whom got their asylum rejected in germany actually left the country . 
  i am not sure i follow . 
  no one said `` no asylum for nobody '' ( at least not that i am aware of ) . 
  here is the current perception around here : - germany tells this people to come . 
  mind you big majority are coming from turkey and not directly fleeing is - germany gets full - germany is generous on other countries behalf - basically germany invited people into hungary & co viktor of house orban is crying about protecting the borders since june btw . 
   means that you wo n't have people illegally traveling through europe why would the inflow stop ? 
   so lets work out a european one . 
  agree . 
  but unfortunately , it looks more like a german one being imposed on the rest of eu . 
  i hope i am wrong . 
  imo we can/should speak about redistribution only after we agreed how to protect our borders . 
  if the uncontrolled inflow is not stopped redistribution is useless . 
   that 's exactly what the dublin convention does wrong . 
  the dublin convention says that the entry country is where the asylum request will be processed . 
  hungary can accept the request or not based on our own laws . 
  however , in the 160 000 redistribution we will receive refugees from elsewhere , their refugee status being decided by a 3 ` rd country . 
  this is not covered by dublin . 
   she 's now proposing a much more fair standard fair for who - germany ? 
  i agree !, 
   people are bitching about how tyrannical she 's being . 
  if the decision would be made the `` old way '' - i.e. 
  our leaders sit in a room and do n't get the fusk out until they all agree it 's fine . 
  if germany is muscling their power to fuck us then please do n't complain on why we do n't enjoy it . 
   this is exactly what is being proposed here . 
  what is the issue ? 
  except that title says `` germany to ** push ** ... '' , no issue . 
  yeah , i felt a shiver of patriotic pride when i learnt they do n't want to stay in austria either . 
  felt a lot better for no reason , 
  airlines have the obligation to return ( on their own money ) anyone denied entry in the destination country . 
   the fact that asylum is considered a human right ... asylum wherever i want is not though . 
  there are also many other issues : there is no agreed list of safe countries . 
  also the asylum procedures differ from country to country . 
  i do n't think it 's fair that a country to be imposed whom to receive based on other country'es laws . 
  do you ? 
  if we 'd have a unified asylum procedure , perfectly fine . 
  but we do n't !, 
  is keeping them under a roof ( with 3 sqm/person ) and food ( which they 'll hate ) humane ? 
   i 'd say they do have an obligation to take them back umm no ? 
  they have an interpretation of the geneva convention where they 'll take only european refugees . 
  and political concessions ... 
  depends on what `` absorb '' means . 
  house them and feed them macaron ? 
  doable . 
  giving every family an apartment and more money than a minimal wage worker does ? 
  not doable . 
  turkey has no obligation to take them back . 
  from my experience finland man very tokative wen drunk . 
  shady pseudo something ( not sure can be called science ) . 
  lem me give you two examples : 1 . 
  when the financial crisis hit , markets were haywire , we had to borrow money from imf ( with the strings attached ) . 
  our government did n't say `` look , if we do n't borrow this money we ca n't pay pensions anymore '' - instead `` we have to cut pensions because imf '' ( btw , this was the pre-orban government ) . 
  every year there is this discussion on `` we 'd love to raise wages for public workers ( doctors , teachers , etc ) '' but eu wo n't let us to go above 3 % budget deficit . 
  respect , germany !, 
  haha , thanks . 
  please remember that around here we are still learning this thing called democracy ( less than 30 years ) . 
  also politicians around here have the habit that whenever they introduce some unpopular measures , they typically blame it on eu/imf . 
  no un treaty saiz that all migrants on planet have to go to sweden and germany though . 
  germany + france + spain + italy are way bigger that ee so it 's normal to have more power . 
  relevant x-post from / r/polandball : http://i.imgur.com/blq7x2t.png,

  they have an alternative and are not stuck in a one-way street to nowhere . 
  how is this any better than denying them in the first place ? 
  it would save them time and all their money . 
  ** do you really want to scam them for 2 months of living costs ? 
  ** that 's ridiculous and totally helpful . 
   now imagine that : you have a lot of people who come here , take a look and see that it 's all shit . 
  they decide that it 's not really worth it . 
  now someone back home comes to them and tells them , `` dude , those guys are pure evil , i 'm gon na bomb them to shit '' . 
  but now the people would say : nah , forget it , they 're as fucked up as we are . 
  their lives are not better than ours . 
  it 's the same struggle everywhere . 
  but they treated us with respect and were not shitty humans . 
  do n't bomb the shit out of them , that 's stupid '' . 
  you are scarily naive . 
  those of them who want to `` bomb us to shit '' want to do so , because of our ideological , theological differences . 
  they do n't care about our living situation . 
  do you honestly believe [ isis commits genocide in iraq and syria ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jun/16/un-condemns-isis-genocide-against-yazidis-in-iraq-and-syria ) because those people live better than them ? 
   doing it your way , we get people who come here without any money who are literally without alternatives and perspectives and who are fully disappointed and full of hate when they eventually get back to where they came from . 
  my way ? 
  with my way they would n't even cross their own border . 
   i hope it 's simple enough for you . 
  my question was how is it in our interest , and you say if we scam them from the money they have , they will go back . 
  i 'm trying to imagine this work , but i ca n't . 
  what happens when there 's no where to go ? 
  by not giving them a reason to irresponsibly leave their homes and family behind and risk their lives on the way . 
   because it is in our own interest . 
  simple . 
  how exactly is it in our interest ? 
  if it 's simple , you can probably explain it in a way even i could understand . 
   `` i want back the good old times , when i did n't have to care about them , because they were n't here and i could simply ignore the problem '' i might have missed a lecture on this one . 
  why are we obliged to help anybody , again ? 
  also to fix that quote for you : `` i want back the good old times , when i did n't have to take responsibility for the irresponsibility of others . '', 
  rightly so , they should make their voices heard by officials , and ` force ' law enforcement to do their jobs . 
   20-30 people chased police out in two other cases what happens after 20-30 people chase police out of a neighbourhood ? 
  are they not arrested ? 
  here if a situation like that happened , operational police ( k\u00e9szenl\u00e9ti rend\u0151rs\u00e9g ) would be there immediately , arresting everyone . 
  i agree !, 
  fair enough , however my question still stands . 
  how can the people of sweden tolerate that such a place exists in their country ? 
  it should n't be an excuse for them to be dangerous . 
  they should respect law enforcement the same way every other citizen does . 
  my question stands . 
  how can the people tolerate this ? 
  do n't need a magnifying glass to see those cars burning , mate . 
  you 're saying a place with 90 % immigrants are not safe . 
  so , if by any way i find myself in a situation , where 90 % of the people are immigrants ( public transport , school , at work , etc ) i am in a not safe environment ? 
  how can the public tolerate this ? 
  how is it normal ? 
  if it 's normal , how are they not arrested ? 
  how come you are not protesting or rioting for them to be arrested ? 
   police fires a shot ( no one hit ) and the group disperses  shortly after this , reports came in of burning cars in the area https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwb07xh4jaa, 
   look for the incentives . 
  the incentive is to * tell * people ( who do n't really move around ) about how awesome my products are , then announce we open shop near them , and sell them cheaply made garbage . 
   can i get a source for that or is hyperbole the way to go now ? 
  i obviously exaggerate , but this is what i 'm talking about : https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2015/sep/01/migrants-stranded-in-hungary-train-station-chant-germany-germany-video, 
   because if , for whatever reason , a few million refugees show up at the serbian border and you have trouble handling it it would be an eu problem as well . 
  well , not a few million , but [ quite a lot more than we were used to , did arrive ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hungarian_border_barrier#impact_on_the_number_of_illegal_migrants_entering_hungary ) . 
  we managed to solve it on our own this time , but the help of our friends is still welcome . 
   it 's not reliable in the long run because suddenly small political shifts can impact policies that were meant to be reliable . 
  if countries like germany , france or other majors would shift politically , opt-out the same goes for a union that we are in voluntarily ( are we ? ) . 
  if public opinion changed , could we leave the union without restrictions ? 
  looking at the way politicians speak about the situation with the uk , i do n't think so . 
  do your values include centralized decision making in everything ? 
  what 's the point of purchasing the service of your hairdresser ? 
  you want a nice haircut , they want to get paid . 
  in the end , everyone is happy . 
  why ca n't a union be about trying to make everyone pleased with it ? 
  we are quite reluctant , when we see how this great union treats those who want to leave . 
  it 's not a time for us to leave . 
  right now , we ca n't . 
  i think ( generally speaking ) voluntarily support is better , than having the union forcing something on everyone . 
  hungary , poland , slovakia and the czech republic is working together on our serbian border . 
  why is it different for italy and greece ? 
  i believe the only reason he strengthened his anti soros rhetoric , is because he wants to be on good terms with the soon to be ( ? ), 
  us - russia friendship / cooperation . 
  okay , but how can the whole eu expected to help protecting italian and greek seas ? 
  i mean , there are some of us , who do n't have any borders on the water . 
  why does helping out italy need a whole eu solution ? 
  why ca n't italy or greece request the help of individual countries ? 
  how come they ca n't protect their borders on their own ? 
  orb\u00e1n started to talk against the strategies used by soros , he only started to name him in the last year i believe . 
  i guess i was missing ` too ' from your sentence . 
   but in the end every single refugee coming to germany is a polish problem ** too ** and every single illegal border crossing to italy is a hungarian problem ** too ** . 
  like this . 
  if this is what you mean , then i understand your point . 
   i get the feeling that op posted this unironically i do n't understand the use of the word ` unironically ' here . 
   but in the end every single refugee coming to germany is a polish problem and every single illegal border crossing to italy is a hungarian problem . 
  explain , please ? 
   that 's nice of course but it does n't help if italy , greece or any other country has issues they need help with . 
  is this the first time in history , when these countries had to defend their borders ? 
  how is it an eu problem , when every illegally entering `` refugee '' chants `` germoney '' in protest of them being upheld for security reasons ? 
   we can probably all agree that non-eu citizens moving around within the eu is much less of an issue if we control them properly at eu borders . 
  yes , we agree . 
  this is where our `` super anti refugee '' fence comes into play . 
  before the fence , these people were walking through fields and forests , entering our country . 
  now they have to go through the proper border entry points . 
  this made these so called refugees change route . 
  how is this not suspicious for others , is beyond me . 
   to me it 's just such a truly dumb issue in the first place . 
  we can probably all agree that any non-eu citizen that comes to the eu is an issue of everyone withing the union .

   that noisy minority 's one . 
  this means violence btw , incase anyone is not familiar with how eastern europe works, 
  that 's a highly inaccurate version of the immigration theory though . 
  it says that hungarians in 1490 constituted 80-90 % of the population of hungary proper , and that in transylvania mainly two areas were populated originally by romanians : fogarasf\u00f6ld / f\u0103g\u0103r\u0103\u015f and the area near h\u00e1tszeg / ha\u0163eg , this latter includes the rivers named ol\u00e1h-zsil and magyar-zsil ( vlach-jiu and hungarian-jiu ) for example , so there 's definitely basis of that, 
  jobbik ppl will deny the existence of romanians altogether ... 
  corsica and sardinia should be both / j / btw , and occitan has / dz / or / d\u0292 /, 
  well this one triggers us too . 
  suck it slovaks , everyone knows you 're just slavic hungarians, 
   you have  goulash triggered, 
  i 'm not sure if you can call snails cuisine, 
  that 's specific ... like , which towns ? 
  because there are literally 3000 people who identify as rusyn in the whole country , and even they are scattered, 
  they would take that even more offensively than hollandia , because it literally translates to `` german lowland '', 
  i always thought hungary was already at its very minimal size , what places would be part of ruthenia ? 
  i can understand poland , but hungary ? 
  what , why , how ? 
  yeah so ruthenia spans across the carpathians , right ? 
  or is it all in the carpathian basin but it has parts of slovakia ? 
  its a bit unclear, 
  ruthenia ? 
  is this a synonym for carpatho-ukraine ? 
  do n't you call us * hongri\u00eb * by default ? 
  it absolutely does n't matter, 
  you are no authority over how people call you . 
  furthermore , in hungarian you ca n't even say ` netherlands ', 
  this whole thread is just a big list of `` why we need an eu army asap '', 
  because the us is better exactly how ? 
  they are controlled by the oligarchy exactly as much as we are , the only difference is that they control two parties while here only 1 . 
  literally every country does that, 
  i would personally use 's \u0302i ' only and replace ` ili ' with ` li ' , once again getting rid of a 100 % useless extra syllable, 
  yeah , in certain cases you can do that even in hungarian . 
  the fundamental problem with it is that it 's just not practical , ` estas ' is two syllables , if anyone were to use it in non-formal speech it would shorten to something more suitable for such a grammatical function . 
  just compare the very word it was based off of : latin ` est ' , french ` est ' / e / , italian ` e\u0300 ' , spanish ` es ' etc. 
  it would never survive in a spoken language as ` estas ' . 
  another incredibly stupid thing that just blows my mind is that while zamenhof hated grammatical gender , he * still * uses ` li ' versus 's \u0302i ' ... like , that 's literally grammatical gender right there . 
  it 's pointless and nowadays even more so because all the transgender shit going on . 
  and these are just the easy to spot ones . 
  hungarize = to destroy and humiliate beyond repair, 
  and things like this is why i do n't understand people who think esperanto is so perfect . 
  it 's just not, 
  why not `` la \u0109ielo blua '' , leaving out the copula ? 
  it 's still 100 % unambiguous, 
  esperanto would only work in writing , it 's incredibly difficult to use in speaking because it 's not compact enough . 
  just think about it , `` estas '' for copula ? 
  at least if it was allowed to omit it , this way it 's just not good, 
  it 's more fun if you hear the ep members try and do that accent :p, 
  this would be glorious in the eu parliament . 
  i 'd love it, 
  i need this in my life, 
  proud of you finns :'), 
  `` hey , you guys are hungarian too '', 
  if there were other hungarian tourists there their first words would be `` j\u00e9 ti is magyarok vagytok ? '', 
  and instant friendship would ensue . 
  that 's just how it is , idk why, 
  hungarians too , but we are right about that :p, 
  it always comes in handy if ppl do n't understand anything of your language, 
  within army groups ( idk how you call them , divisions ? ), 
  you can communicate in your native language , only the higher command would have different native languages, 
   pro-russian politicians  in eastern europe topkek, 
  yeah ... 
  til nobody can speak a foreign language , especially not the leaders of well-trained army groups, 
  good, 
  a snickers costs less than 100ft, 
  we are not trying to do that . 
  we just ignore the international borders for every practical purpose and dont give a fuck, 
  theyre culturally european . 
  i have more problems with azerbaijan being in there tbh . 
  ahem, 
  nope , sorry : /, 
  edgy, 
   there does n't seem to be anything here uh , thanks ? 
   they 'd be easy prey anytime russia felt like grabbing some land most were already nato members you idiot , aka . 
  us defense would be here  millions upon millions of desperate , unemployed people . 
  made unemployed by western companies like tesco and lidl . 
  for reaping those disgusting profits here you can just well take in these hardworking people . 
  do you think you can just make your capitalists run down here and fuck us like that without consequences ? 
  i 'm so sad that that does n't exist, 
  i do n't either , but i 'm still white . 
  do n't forget these : [ 1 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxo9iex8w1c&amp;ab_channel=fuckyoupedophile4 ) , [ 2 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub7bxrnswo0&amp;ab_channel=islamicnasheedmusic ), 
  its because of dancs\u00f3 's video on it where he makes a detailed analysis, 
  it was mainly a reference to that romanians usually refer to everything pre-1920 as `` occupation '' , so i was just returning the favor :p, 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iumb9e_zsy#misshmusic the main line `` csak baszunk \u00e9s baszunk \u00e9s pont '' ( we will fuck and fuck and period ) is the best meme around the country these days ninjaedit : [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgbw8vs0iy8&amp;ab_channel=realtrillmusic ) is dec 2013 i hope it 's okay, 
  calm down man , it was just [ banter ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/transylvania ), 
  estonia is finno-ugric bros, 
  ahem, 
  same in hungarian , though it 's sorta outdated now , younger people would say `` it finally fell [ for you ] '', 
  yeah , the only uralic language to have articles is hungarian, 
  wait , so you being from augsburg makes all swabians bavarians ? 
  whaat, 
  yeah , hiberno-english speakers , not english english speakers . 
  you 're just jelly you do n't have such a unique language :p, 
   topkek you are literally laughing at something i did n't say . 
  if the brexit happens ( hopefully it wont , but i do n't think we 'd miss you all too much ) , then the eu will have * literally no * citizens who speak english english as native language . 
  that 's a fact . 
   eu is not a nation , and it likely will never be . 
  i really hope it never does . 
  nationalism is cancerous enough already , imagine it implemented on this level . 
  it should become a country though  you are probably thinking of europe . 
  no i was thinking of the eu , since that 's what you 're trying to leave , not europe, 
  ofcourse we do !,

  but not strong enough to do this , i think . 
  its not shit , its before the forming of the soviet union , and also before the official borders after ww1 . 
  even though they were strong enough to deal with the habsburgs , they could n't possibly get to iberia and start invading . 
  it would have needed huge amount of logistics , troops and ships - and the ottomans lacked 2 of these . 
  yes , they had ships , but the spanish armada with portugal could have easily take on them , and focusing enough power to have an even fight in the west would significantly weaken the east . 
  not possible with a rebellious hungary , a threatening russia and a backstabbing persia on your borders . 
  thats probably because of the inaccurate borders everywhere else , germany , poland , ukraine , just look at it . 
  the drawer already knew about the new states , but did n't know about full details , maybe these details were n't agreed yet . 
  for example [ k\u00e1rp\u00e1talja ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/zakarpattia_oblast ) is still under hungary , while it was taken by czechoslovakia aswell , and transylvania is also showed under hungary , and the most important one : ukraine . 
  in 1918 , the russian civil war just barely started , they maybe though ukraine could brake free . 
  and no , its not actually much smaller , they miss k\u00e1rp\u00e1talja but they got a little chunk of austria . 
  the czechoslovakian and the yugoslavian nation was already born in 1918 . 
  the `` diplomats '' you could say of these newborn nations have been in rome for a long long time before the end of ww1 , and they decided about freeing the ethnics of austro-hungary . 
  the successor states of the austro-hungarian monarchy has been invited to negotiate in the congress of rome . 
  two of the successor states however did not get an invitation . 
  all nations of the later officially formed little entente wanted as much territory , industry and wealth as possible , thats why the yugoslavian state is drawn in such way probably . 
  however , according to [ wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_raab ) , the battle of raab was the only napoleonic battle in the kingdom of hungary . 
  but at that time , it was n't the kingdom of hungary , nor the austro-hungarian empire . 
  it was the habsburg empire . 
  come on r/europe , stop teasing me . 
  i told you , i want to wait until the fcking dlc . 
  only if he knew that if you are staying out from the league war , you can conquer anyone . 
  i think it also has to do something with the level of development , as / u/kapkoz said . 
  its all really a big chunk of information , working together . 
  first , reformation had a big effect in the czech part ( moravia and bohemia ) of the empire ( habsburg empire ) . 
  also have to keep in mind that austria , as the emperor of the hre , had to fight against reformed and protestant states and had to defend the holiness of the empire and catholicism . 
  when somebody wants to `` force '' something on you , you will hate it , right ? 
  also , moravia and bohemia were the most developed provinces of the empire , and development also means less religion , as op said before , bratislava and its area is not as religious as the rural areas of slovakia . 
  its the same really in every nation , but in cz its even bigger . 
  my problem is that he is n't considering him as a half german half polish guy , but fully german . 
  his fathers side and his mothers side are both coming from silesia , but as i 've said this is the 15th century , nationalities were not important . 
  let him be half german half polish , and we are done here . 
  well , he was born in polish prussia , a state in the kingdom of poland . 
  his parents were slavic , and their family has been living in poland for centuries . 
  although one have to admit that poland , especially the prussian area is very mixed and multicultural , and copernicus also traveled to a lot of places in europe . 
  i mean since we cant go back and ask him `` are you german or polish ? '' ... 
  he was polish , just happened to live in prussia . 
  i think by the early 1900 's there was an act that said where there is a non-hungarian majority , that city could have official offices in the majorities language , and of course schools in that language . 
  romanians in gy\u0151r and its area ? 
  why would they be in literally the other side of the country ? 
  rightful ? 
  whats more rightful than owning it for 500 or so years ? 
  what is romanian , anyway ? 
  because in my eyes , its a mix of slavic-hungarian-turk and every other nation . 
  no , i 'm not trying to be rude , i am thinking the same about everybody who lives in the carpathian basin and in the balkans . 
  saying they were the rightful owners because of their origin is a miserable excuse . 
  then i will go and take back mongolia because of my ancestors . 
  yeah , no . 
  it was legally part of the kingdom of hungary until 1918.12.01 , then the romanians took over it with a national assembly , via the majority of romanians in transylvania . 
  we actually tried , but the french wanted to save the little entente . 
  the hungarian soviet republic of 1919 even attacked successfully to czechoslovakia , but they were rather disorganised , had no supply and the enemy had bigger numbers . 
  why ? 
  because we conquered and colonised transylvania , and successfully kept it for centuries . 
  you have to realise , before the 18th-19th century , nobody cared about nationalities , just heads . 
  you pay your taxes , you live your little life and you are fine . 
  radical sides are living on this side of the border , and on the other side aswell , and both of our governments are trying to keep fueling the hatred between us . 
  in reality , more and more hungarians realise that it does n't matter what happened , and we should move forward . 
  however , on every july 4th , there will be some who shouts `` transylvania will be ours again '' in the air . 
  you just ca n't change that . 
  the crazy thing is that some nationalists are mostly hurt about transylvania , while the treaty and the drawn border is actually quite acceptable , i think . 
  i mean , the border is at least trying to be on the border of hungarians and romanians , and you ca n't really do anything about the enclave in transylvania . 
  the slovakian border however ... 
  the problem is , the balkans and the carpathian basin is so mixed with cultures , languages and other things that basically we are at this point the same people , just happening to be talking in different languages . 
  nationalist movements in the 19th century were great for the french , the germans and the italians , but made no sense on this part of europe , since there is no ethnic slovakian , hungarian , romanian , croatian , serbian or anything in this area . 
  a guy from bratistlava or zagreb could have closer relations to king stephen than i. 
  i 'm happy that we can see the romanian and the hungarian flag next to each other , and celebrate together without hatred . 
  ** edit : ** i 'm actually stupid , what i 'm talking about are nato missions . 
  in hungary , the peacekeeper units in the kfor and cyprus are volunteers . 
  you can `` choose '' how long would you like to be there , e.g. 
  there are 2 week missions , 3 months , 6 months and 18 months but these can differ . 
  you have to apply for it though , and some higher ranked officers decide whether you can go or not . 
  for example , if your psychical condition is not good enough , you will not be able to join the mission in afghanistan , but missions like kfor require less . 
  you also get more money for it , and while you are out on a mission you still get your monthly payment aswell . 
  my father has been in sarajevo and pristina a few times before , he has been working on the logistics out there . 
  oh , and he says the italian chefs are the best . 
  trying is better than not trying , i guess , 
  i do n't really know about safety , but i guess we can say morocco is safer than turkey right now . 
  however there are relatively cheap , direct airlines from budapest to istanbul , while to morocco , you would have to go to frankfurt first i imagine . 
  i 've never been to hrvatska , this summer is going to be my and my family 's first . 
  am i making a mistake by going to trogir ? 
  personally i 'd rather go to turkey , if i could than the nations listed below . 
  but , that is for a reason , and that reason is my interest towards eastern nations and islam . 
  like , one does n't go to turkey to enjoy the sunshine and the beach , but rather to have a wonderful adventure in istanbul . 
  however , i admit most people does n't really care about culture and heritage , and the number of these people are the ones in majority if we are talking about the tourism of turkey . 
  i still believe that he is nowhere near to be like erdogan . 
  people are hyping it up , obviously donald trump is satan now and everybody is focusing on the bad things , so its really one sided . 
  i know he says things that would rather be in a comedy show than on the twitter of the potus , but still , if you are comparing him to erdogan i think you are thinking way more about trump than what he is . 
  neither czechia . 
  i mean , i wish i was czechia level poor ~ ~ with their juicy euro ~ ~ . 
  edit : for some reason i thought they had euro , but not yet ( ? ), 
  i just googled coimbra and holy shit does that city look sexy . 
  462 km 's , according to google maps , but keep in mind thats the driving distance , not the train rails . 
  you have to keep in mind that states did n't have as strict borders as they have nowadays . 
  this map just lets you ... imagine it a bit , kinda . 
  but i would n't say its misleading ... its common knowledge , one could n't really assume that this is how it was and thats it . 
  but the eastern-european jewish population , at least some of them , threw away their jewish heritage and assimilated to the country they were in , for example to hungary . 
  i think if the person does not consider himself a jew , he is n't . 
  obviously , when you are being asked by the gestapo about your mother and stuff , its `` easier '' to say you are not jewish , but i do n't think that they cared about the torah , the third reich just had to blame someone and it was very easy to blame it on the jewish people . 
  no , axis soldiers killed him and his companions . 
  later they were put into a mass grave .

   ps : french are weird . 
  this is the point . 
  and i think wayy too many people simply accept french nationalism 's principles ( which are pretty extreme tbh ) without thinking . 
   different nationalities = different ethnicities . 
  there is not much of a difference . 
  no , of course there is n't . 
  but you should be consistent with the terminology if you do n't want to make a distinction . 
  but * somehow * , in western europe , if one is the same nation that the country says they say it 's their nationality , if they are n't , then it 's just their * ethnicity * . 
  it 's a distinction that 's stupid to make imho , and it 's mainly to de-legitimize the nationhood of nations that do n't line up with the countries . 
  it 's a weird practice that - to me - that mainly western europeans do . 
  ( and this is also because of french nationalism , from what i can tell ), 
  do n't think that would lure away greece . 
  it 's where what used to be / r/european hangs out now, 
  oh right , well that actually makes sense though . 
  hold my quran , i 'm goin ' in !, 
  also pretty random . 
  any idea why they decided to do this ? 
   russian is not foreign there might be minority schools where it 's a foreign language, 
  hungarian was spoken by all the hungarians . 
  latin was the state language . 
  latin was good because it was neutral , so the nationalities did n't care about it that much . 
  but then nationalism came around , and in 1844 the state language was changed to hungarian so that state offices , which were mainly held by hungarians in the first place - started using hungarian instead of latin . 
  that 's basically it . 
  that upset the nationalities of course , because now it was clear that hungarians were favored by the state openly . 
  which is not good , i might add , though i also might add that slovakia has the same thing today , and so does almost every country . 
  i think the main thing that lead to all this was nationalism , which is what we should blame for this whole thing . 
  oh , so you are just a weird nationalist . 
  alright i guess, 
  the keyword is ethnic . 
  you just call them same nation , different ` ethnicity ' , whatever that is supposed to mean . 
  in hungary we call them different nationalities . 
  so yeah , you 're basically also advocating that what we have now should never be changed , nobody ever should want change , should they ? 
  because that 's what you 're saying now . 
  so one should never try and change the system , they should always escape the system and find a life elsewhere , that 's what you 're saying ? 
  no revolution was ever right either , was it ? 
  they should 've just moved, 
  yeah i got that , i just do n't understand why he needs to call it an empire . 
  because probably he also knows full well that it 's basically defined by the fact that it 's not an empire . 
   and why not ? 
  is everyone living in france of french ethnicity ? 
  everyone in uk of british ? 
  in germany , german ? 
  no they are n't , but they do n't acknowledge that the different people are different . 
  i think france has in its constitution that every citizen of france is french and their native language is french or something like that , which is pretty dumb tbh . 
  yeah , but the fact that he calls them colonists is incredibly wrong . 
  sz\u00e9kelys did not come from the main block of hungarians to transylvania , they came with the rest of the guys into transylvania first , and starting from there was the rest of hungary colonized ( or settled , whichever you prefer ), 
  yeah , the ones i met usually bitch about autonomy and/or language use rights . 
  obviously no one sane thinks anywhere that it 's gon na ever be rethought , not here in hungary either . 
  jobbik asshats exist on either side of the borders though . 
  i meant , they had to mention it when talking to western europeans . 
  ( since the dude i was replying to is one ) because let 's be honest , when does a western european comprehend that it 's possible to be from slovakia but not be a slovak . 
   and most hungarians never met in their life , nor spoke to , hungarians minorities living in slovakia , romania or serbia . 
  i have though , to all three of these, 
  the award ceremony of a school competition . 
  they usually invite hungarians from everywhere to those, 
  hungary enacted the first minority protection laws in the world in 1849 , which were also in the post-1867 laws . 
  they sometimes were n't entirely enforced , which is what we call magyarization . 
  contrary to popular belief , in hungary you had the right to study in your own native language , but not all teachers actually let them do it , so they had to study in hungarian mostly because of the teachers ' own choices ( taking into account that at the time intellectuals were incredibly nationalistic , it 's not hard to imagine why people got the idea that you could n't do it in the native language ), 
  no , actually , hungary did have its own units . 
  do your research goddammit . 
  in the monarchy there were 3 types of troops : monarchy troops from both the empire and hungary , imperial troops for austria and guess what ? 
  hungarian troops from and for hungary https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/austro-hungarian_army#royal_hungarian_landwehr even croatia-slavonia had their own troops btw . 
  actually , often they are just called extra counties of hungary . 
  i 've been to ceremonies , where as county of origin they would just put romania or slovakia or ukraine instead and called it a day . 
  i said a thing about `` hungarians who live outside of hungary '' , which he referred to as `` us '' . 
  i mean that 's pretty obvious, 
  again , what 's your point for trying to make millions of people leave their homes ? 
  maybe come up with an actual solution ( which would be to end nationstates once and for all ) , instead of trying to force your own way of thinking onto them . 
  hungarians there are just fine , and unless they are jobbik supporters ( = nationalists ) , they could n't care less . 
  so why do you want to force a shitload of people out of their homes just so that * your * vision of how things should work gets enforced ? 
  satu mare and oradea were pretty obviously only taken for strategic purposes , but yeah . 
  the romanian border still was the most fair one . 
   the hungarian colonists from the middle ages `` colonists '' , which in romania apparently means `` people who did n't actually go further west with the rest of the guys so they can protect the rest of the guys from attacks on the east '' ... weird, 
   hungarian empire the what ? 
  you mean the kingdom of hungary . 
  that literally fought a war to make sure it is n't part of any bullshit ass empire , you just casually call it an empire ... alright then, 
  i think the greatest lesson from the trianon treaty is to realize that national unity is a worthless buzzword . 
  states do n't need to align with nations , one can live just as well without a nanny state to protect their fragile identity . 
  basically , trianon and its consequences basically should invalidate nationalism altogether . 
  i do n't even know what the hell you 're trying to say here . 
  you are saying that 2 million hungarians who are just fine should move , just so they do n't have to remember a historical fact ? 
  man , you really must hate history . 
  i literally could n't care less . 
  do n't boycott stuff because the place it 's from is disputed , you are just hurting the local economy , thereby making life worse for everyone living there, 
   why do you assume they identify as hungarian ? 
  because i know a bunch of them personally , met them and talked with them about this very topic extensively . 
  oh yeah , the great place known as carpathian ruthenia . 
  in the last 100 years , it had 6 owners . 
  must have been great to live there, 
  lol jobbik is invading reddit ? 
  the irony is , they would 've probably appreciated a united hungary if they could assure themselves that we take stance against austria and germany, 
  hussar definitely comes from hungarian husz\u00e1r , the origin of the hungarian word is disputed . 
  it is also said to come from the hungarian word h\u00fasz ( 20 ) , referring to the fact that every 20 peasant house had to bring in one hussar soldier into the army under matthias i, 
  i guess you have to explain to foreigners why you are n't slovak though if you are from slovakia , do n't you ? 
  my family was moved by stalin , they did n't have any other reason to move . 
  also what if tomorrow someone told you that your home is now a different country so get the fuck out ? 
  `` the palace every good hungarian is supposed to pee on '' , according to my old geography teacher,

  some sort of russian/slavic type identity ? 
   said that if we want a unification it should be to make greater moldova . 
  lol lmao , ca n't say the guy is n't ambitious . 
   said romania gives too many scholarships to moldovan students as a form of propaganda . 
  so everything that 's wrong in moldova is romania 's fault ? 
  convenient rhetoric if people are susceptible to accepting it . 
  but you were part of the axis for 4-5 years during the war , only at the very end did you manage to swap sides when things went downhill . 
  most of those people died fighting for nazi germany ( eg . 
  invasion of russia ) , fighting against the allies . 
  is this moldovan-romanian identity split the main thing that stands in the way of reunification ? 
  or the issue with transnistria is even more serious ? 
  * lights a candle for tyrol *, 
  thanks that 's quite comprehensive !, 
  from what i read now if i was moldovan or romanian i would very much worry about that dodon guy ... how did he get elected ? 
   in 1812 , the eastern part of the principality of moldavia , called bessarabia , which includes the current territory of republic of moldova ( except for transnistria ) was ceded by the ottomans to the russian empire . 
  so am i right to essentially think of bessarabia as a `` russian ( influenced ) romania '' , transnistria aside ? 
  apart from those few who elected to believe the `` artifical moldovan fairy tale '' ? 
  what are the main differences between moldovans and romanians ? 
   romanian moldovan is that a thing ?

  good questions , yeah would be interested in a summary as a separate post if you gather enough data . 
  cheers !, 
  well if you look at it this way , everyone 's living in their own tiny bubble of experiences and ideas , let it be their everyday lives , their closer community , their nation . . or even the `` world '' itself is just a tiny insignificant ball of rock and metal compared to the vastness of the universe . 
  i 'd wager this shortsightedness is integral to being human ( or sentinent for all we know ) , ca n't really just say one day `` hey let 's forget that , look at everything this other way '' and change ourselves on a whim . 
  there has to be some kind of outer impulse , a threat or vastly different/unexpected information , for us to change our views so drastically . 
  i ca n't really explain this properly but i hope you get what i 'm trying to say . 
  so let 's go with schultz . 
  but either way , it 's not like you have to choose between bad or worse , as had some others recently , luckily . 
   i think that in the future the whole world will work together and that nationalistic feelings will fade . 
  i 'd like it to be that way but there has to be something that replaces nationalistic feelings . 
  could the world look at itself in its own merit , without the comparative context of `` those others '' ? 
  i think our ideas and attitude would need to develop a lot , even in/for the first world that 's been through so much , let alone for the rest of humanity .

  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5srhx7/fresh_poll_on_hungarians_opinion_about_relation/ddhg9zu/?st=iyx2u7bv&amp;sh=636ab6a4 ) yeah there 's also tension with the topic but hey , at least we are able to create and maintain a discussion on the most controversial topic between our two nations without jumping at each other 's throats ( * cough * former yugo * cough * ) . 
  that 's something right ? 
  ( there was an edit :d ), 
  that user is a nice person . 
  i read these lines too , you know ? 
  i 100 % agree with what you 're saying here . 
  i have known people and have friends from transylvania as well as slovakia and it 's mostly just a way for politicians to trigger people detached from everyday life in there . 
  still , for some reason it 's always a hurting spot when it comes to theoretical discussion about the topic . 
  and for that / r/europe and the internet generally is a perfect place .

   of course we would n't complain either if it was the other way around . 
  it 's funny you say that since it would 've been the same ordeal population-wise you got with transylvania but on a smaller scale . 
  also the rest of the territories would 've been almost entirely hungarian populated . 
  [ * k.u.k. 
  intensifies * ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0c/austria-hungaria_transparency.png ), 
  hungary was n't exactly a fully compiling , faithful ally to nazi germany . 
   hitler would soon have cause to rue his decision regarding the fate of carpatho-ukraine . 
  in six months , during his 1939 invasion of poland , the common polish-hungarian border would become of major importance ** when admiral horthy 's government , on the ground of long-standing polish-hungarian friendship , declined , as a matter of `` hungarian honor , '' [ 8 ] hitler 's request to transit german forces across carpathian rus into southeastern poland to speed that country 's conquest ** [ . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hungary%e2%80%93poland_relations#world_war_ii )  the hungarian refusal allowed the polish government and tens of thousands of military personnel to escape into neighboring hungary and romania also one of the reasons nazi germany invaded hungary towards the end of wwii was their reluctance to commit `` properly '' ( that 's ugly to write but you get the point ) to holocaust in hungary under horthy ( who they replaced with right wingers of the arrow cross party after they invaded ) . 
  -- i do n't doubt that it was a `` natural '' result of the war ( although it 'd be interesting to think about why austria-hungary was so severely punished and germany left mostly intact ) , nor mind what the plebistice would 've resulted in . 
  it 's just the notion i can not agree with , as i mentioned above , that his comment implies . 
  it was n't the entire transylvanian population that chose this . 
  [ there was room for middle ground kind of deals . 
  ] ( http://i.imgur.com/4ehhygn.png ) it was the allies that decided it to be this way . 
  hungary got punished big time . 
  they got invaded by nazi germany after failing to manage a deal with the allies , like romania , so they lost the war . 
  that 's all . 
  well good luck to you . 
  those recent protests across whole romania were a good step forward . 
  just keep your voices loud . 
   ** they did n't technically lose ** , there was a romanian majority under foreign leaders . 
  ** they chose to join romania ** . 
  this was your original comment on hungary losing territory due to the decisions of the treaty . 
  i ca n't explain this more thoroughly . 
  so you kind of have the same `` no good choice '' deal as we do in hungary then . 
  [ this churchill quote pops in mind . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75oun5gvdau&amp;t=3m14s ) how can the people win ? 
  it 's the notion that the result was a democratic , free will sort of deal that the romanians advocated , instead of what it actually was , a punishment on hungary against the plebistice advocated by austria & hungary . 
  they could 've awarded territories more reasonably ( [ eg . 
  ] ( http://i.imgur.com/4ehhygn.png ) ) should they really cared about a fair treaty . 
  that 's not what happened . 
  i 'm unsure what that map represents exactly . 
  majority of supporters of current govt in red ?

  true , states are so intertwined in modern economics that it 's really difficult to distance ourselves from certain , significant , players . 
  it might 'd take a real russian scare with reduced us support before people start thinking about putting self defence ahead of economic interests . 
  but when would that happen without a war ? 
  it could be that the west just got too accustomed to being served by the us . 
  it 's certainly easier to develop without having to worry about and spend on self defence . 
  but that mentailty is like a tepid soup , nothing decent will come of it on its own . 
  i would be more worried if they did n't show russia that we are prepared and ready to respond . 
  * si vis pacem , para bellum * - you ca n't affect the russians with harsh words ... only actions . 
   to add a military component , maybe even a warrior-like strategic culture , is contradicting a serious part of the eu 's roots and makes many people rather uncomfortable about the very notion .

  the 1848 revolutions were already about that . 
   they would be forced to relinquish a good portion of their agenda though do n't think so . 
  they would just brand the european nationalists as traitors , start a quick smear campaign and that would be enough to delegitimize it if it catches on . 
   you are underestimating the might of societal subversion through ideology you are too . 
  the point is , the traditional nationalists have the entire establishment behind them , so if you want to get popular , you 'd need to bring something new to the table . 
  kinda sad tbh : /, 
  using the same logic :  religion is a ideology . 
  theocracy is an ideology . 
  all people inside a country must be of the same religion, 
   by this you hijack nationalism from the right you wo n't hijack it from them . 
  they will continue to be nationalistic as well , and you will end up with an even worse situation than what you started with . 
  you should rather appease the nationalists , give them something that will still represent their nation , but make sure that nations stay nations , as in , cultural groups , and not political issues or entities like they are now . 
   purely a political ideology , not a racial or ethnical one it already is and it clearly is n't working . 
  i would go as far as to say that ethnic nationalism actually works better than the civic one , based on what i heard from hungarians from slovakia and romania ... being a minority is clearly better in the more ethnic nationalist romania than the more civic nationalist-y slovakia . 
  civic nationalism to me looks like it 's just saying big words without proposing anything , with no results other than angering the people who are n't parts of the nation . 
  and if you start off civic nationalism where lots upon lots of people are n't part of the `` european nation '' and never will be , then it 's a million times worse, 
  would 've said that but in my experience they mostly identify as swiss . 
  i do n't know if it 's possible that way , but i sure as hell wo n't help promote the identity politics that the nationalist shit will create, 
  you are still a full member until article 50 is invoked though ... 
  well yeah if you 're a billionaire you might even be able to afford one as well, 
   it will inevitably happen yes it will , and that is exactly why you * should n't * base a country around it . 
  what 's the point of promoting it in such a forced way , when we all know that it would happen regardless ? 
  plus , why anger the people who do n't want themselves a new identity overnight , completely unnecessarily ? 
  that 's good to hear  have fun here , 
  while sure , most likely my parents and grandparents were lying about it , surely some western european who barely knows what communism is would know better than them . 
  aw , shame on them . 
  the best you can do is ignore them unfortunately : /, 
  now you just went on to spout completely untrue shit . 
  no , people did not starve during communism . 
  there were cases where they did , but most of the time they did n't, 
   let luxembourg take in a million syrians from turkey and we 'll see how far their `` tolerance '' really goes . 
  so what you 're saying is , if you have lots of people who do n't like democracy , that will make democracy disappear ? 
  what a surprise there ? 
  too bad that still does n't prove your statement whatsoever , this has nothing to do with multiple nations being present , this has to do with the ideology, 
  nor would it ever manage to function that way, 
  that would be glorious , yes . 
  the eu has the potential to be extremely strobg economically , which is something we should strive for, 
  the situation is very similar with orb\u00e1n here , with the exception that he doesnt specifically hate latin american people ... 
  well yeah , but i wouldve expected someone whose native language is spanish would make the easy choice of going to spain ... hungary isnt exactly a popular destination for immigrants , though there certainly are quite a few . 
  not just that . 
  there are countless examples of borders changing and the cultural situation not changing in history . 
  yeah , i was just being tongue-in-cheek, 
  he 's a western european , naturally he has no idea but pretends to know it well, 
   for a european national identity to form ( in addition to the national identities , not at the expense of them ) is inevitable with continued integration , though . 
  no , i fundamentally disagree with that . 
  that 's the prime mistake of nationalism , assuming that . 
  it 's not necessary . 
  eh , communism could 've done the same . 
  eradicating hunger is not a big challenge for either economic system . 
  it 's mainly a matter of personal interests in either case . 
  the `` important guys '' will always decide who gets to eat , whether they 're head of a state or a company does n't make much of a difference . 
  yeah , spanish and english are related languages , while hungarian is entirely a different language family ... and yeah , as you know , it uses an entirely different logic and structure compared to indo-european languages . 
  this is a difficulty for native hungarian speakers as well though , to learn these languages the other way around . 
  yeah , that 's my problem . 
  that is what i think will cause trouble , and i do n't agree with it . 
  i understood it perfectly , it literally says `` european civic nationalism '' there in the manifesto . 
  that is something i would not like to see , as there are enough nationalisms in europe already, 
  / do n't worry , this level is perfectly good . 
  if you can talk like this in real life then anyone will be able to understand you , which is very much enough  especially if you also speak english as well . 
  do n't worry too much about the suffixation , as long as you can make yourself understood , it 's fine . 
  and if you mess something up , then they 'll just correct you, 
   afaik hungarians speak german more often than english not really , no . 
  might have been true a few decades ago , definitely not true now . 
  yeah but you know , patriarchy is evil, 
  seriously . 
  how did they get these statistics ? 
  what about the language ? 
  so the only options are multi-ethnic * absolute monarchy * or democratic * nationstate * ? 
  jesus christ , that 's one depressing reality to live in, 
  brutal, 
  i will never understand the people who think that with the borders moving , the cultures change . 
  they do n't , that 's not how it works, 
   venezuelan living in hungary . 
  damn , how 'd you end up here ? 
  damn , / r/acteuropa ... 
  i was following it closely until i read the manifesto . 
  had to nope out at that point though . 
  it still strives for a mainly nationalistic europe which is just calling for trouble . 
  that 's not telling them to unite . 
  that 's telling them to support `` the spirit of the nation '' , which is obviously referring to himself . 
  note the subtle difference between `` support each other '' vs `` support me '' . 
  they would say that belgium is n't a functioning democracy with multiple nationalities ? 
  or that luxemburg ca n't function because of the multiple nationalities going on ? 
  or that spain is n't democratic because of the abundance of nationalities ? 
  western europe really scares me tbh . 
  it 's so detached from reality it 's frightening . 
  worst thing is , those guys are in charge of the world right now . 
  the only counterweights to them are russia and china , which are also really not the type of governments you 'd like to be governed by . 
   a few imperialist countries um , ca n't really name a non-imperialist country before switzerland came about . 
  european federalism ? 
  capitalism being * slightly better * than the * totalitarian * planned economy does n't exactly make it good . 
   cohesive nation-states haha , nice joke there . 
   belgium  luxemburg  uk  spain fuck off with this stupid nationalist nonsense, 
   wannabe totalitarians so like nigel farage and the eu ? 
  or trump and the mexicans ? 
   eu is united . 
  that 's bullshit, 
  a totalitarian state would never ask its population to unite , unless they 're complete morons . 
  divide et impera is like the first thing they need to keep in mind .

  however , if we 're talking about hungary as a location , we use the above form . 
  we stick an * - i * ( sometimes * - beli * ) to the end , and use lowercase . 
   instead of preparing for the shit-storm politicians sat around thinking - how can we put a spin on this and push our agenda rather than really protecting our people . 
  how can you prepare , or protect our people better , than restricting entry ? 
  the fence prevents anyone walking through , now you ca n't skip the border checks . 
  the problem is , nobody figured anything better out so far . 
   they pose risk because governments want them to pose risk so politicians can pedal forward through murky waters of lies and propaganda pinning innocent people against innocent people . 
  they pose a risk , because in their culture , it is acceptable to stone a woman who was raped , to death , and [ they have proved to keep their radicalism ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/apr/11/british-muslims-strong-sense-of-belonging-poll-homosexuality-sharia-law ) even after a couple of generations in western europe . 
   here 's the right-wing nationalist agenda : great-hungary i 've never heard him openly speak about restoring our borders , only jobbik is thinking along the lines of that . 
   people who gained citizenship through naturalization will never be considered hungarians the same way as someone born in hungary . 
  they are , according to our laws , and i ca n't get you a poll on this , but i 'm sure the majority considers them hungarians . 
   do n't kid yourself thinking that they 'll vote for him [ i do n't . 
  ] ( https://hu.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014-es_magyarorsz%c3%a1gi_orsz%c3%a1ggy%c5%b1l%c3%a9si_v%c3%a1laszt%c3%a1s#eredm.c3.a9nyek ) pay attention to those who voted in mail . 
   they do n't refuse to speak the native language , they ca n't speak the native language . 
  so , how exactly are they not qualify as hungarians in the eyes of hungarians ? 
  their * native * language ** is ** hungarian . 
  their country 's official language is n't . 
   dude , the numbers of christians are not declining because of refugees or muslims , they 're declining because because of many reasons . 
  however , they 're still over 50 % of our population , and when orb\u00e1n promises them to protect their majority , it obviously earns him their support . 
   making you re-evaluate your options about having a family or raising a family in a religious environment there are n't any side effects of christianity that i can recall , that would affect our day-to-day lives , currently in hungary . 
  we are not some country ruled by a terrorizing religious fanatic , like those islamic countries . 
   they are robbing you of your own wealth , not refugees or immigrants , and then go around fear-mongering feeding you lies about how the muslims are taking over . 
  our history is about being run over by islam , from the south . 
  how do you expect the average hungarian to react when he sees [ hordes of men marching in ? 
  ] ( http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/624/cpsprodpb/01ab/production/_85372400_3uj7e9qu.jpg )  it 's insane to me to grab at something so irrelevant as religion it 's not irrelevant when these people use their religion as state law . 
   as a reason to not let people who need our help into the country how do you propose help them ? 
  we ca n't give enough money to our state run hospital 's doctors and nurses , they all leave to germany . 
  we ca n't provide our pensioners with enough medical support , we ca n't pay our teachers in schools , we do n't have jobs to hire our own . 
  what could we give to people , who do n't speak our language , do n't share anything common with us ? 
   you 're giving him way more latitude than he deserves . 
  just because he has a law degree does n't mean that he 's a credible authority . 
  it just means he has a law degree . 
  i do n't say he 's credible , i say he is clever , smarter than all of his challengers in hungary , especially in legal issues , because he 's a lawyer . 
   is n't orban pushing for the change in constitution where marriage will be defined as a union of one man and one woman ? 
  yes he is , but if i remember correctly , he was more on the `` family = marriage between man and woman '' line , he wanted to define family as the marriage between man and woman . 
   orban said that muslim migrants from the middle east and north africa will pose a security risk for the mainly christian hungary . 
  what freaking security risk ? 
  is n't this pushing the christian agenda ? 
  keep in mind , orb\u00e1n is a law graduate . 
  he watches his words always . 
  he 's too good at this . 
  he 's right when he says muslim migrants pose a threat to hungary , which happens to be mainly christian . 
  [ isis has been found ] ( http://www.businessinsider.com/r-german-spy-agency-says-isis-sending-fighters-disguised-as-refugees-2016-2 ) using the migration to get extremists into europe . 
  they are a threat . 
  not every migrant , not every refugee , but some are . 
  also , orb\u00e1n pushing the `` christian agenda '' is the same as i 've said in my previous comment . 
  he 's doing it , because half of the country is christian . 
  the other half includes people who simply do n't care , people who are strongly anti religion , and every other religion . 
  he supports the biggest group . 
  always . 
   why is he handing out citizenship like they 're candy from a pinata to hungarian minorities in croatia , slovenia and serbia ? 
  because they ** are ** hungarian , and he realised the stupid mistake made by his predecessor , who handled the situation of hungarians living in the territories of great-hungary . 
  this granted him around 100,000 votes for nothing . 
  these people will always vote for orb\u00e1n , because `` he gave us the right to be hungarian again '' . 
  keep in mind , there are still areas in these countries , where everyone speaks hungarian , some even refuse to speak their country 's official language . 
   look , i seriously do n't want to start a conflict here . 
  me neither . 
  he is a worm , we agree , but i do n't agree with your reasoning . 
   edit : one last thing , remember what happened with the referendum ? 
  he 's not a lawful or honest person . 
  he declared themselves winner , because everyone ( above 90 % ) of participants , voted in favor of their point . 
  it was invalid as a referendum , because the opposition campaigned `` stay at home '' , because they dared not to see themselves losers of yet another popularity contest . 
   hungarian christians are in danger their numbers are declining . .  small nation complex we are n't exactly huge with all the 10 million hungarians we have in the area . 
  come on , at least give me proofs to hate orb\u00e1n . 
  i already dislike him , but i wish to be able to argue against him , every now and then . 
  how will i ever hate him , if i ca n't find anything on him being racist and homophobic ? 
   hungary i 'll gladly go through your points . 
   fidesz is the ruling party and they 're as right wing as they come . 
  fidesz is not a right wing party . 
  they are more to the right compared to our socialist party mszp , but that does not make put them on the right . 
  i 'm not even sure if they can be categorised . 
  they always go with the wind in issues . 
  sometimes they make socialists blush with their policies , and sometimes they entertain right wing nationalists with their anti immigration stances . 
  they do this to stay in power . 
  they never upset the majority in any issue , this is their trick . 
   it gave us do you actually live here ? 
   super nationalist , racist , homophobic , xenophobic pm , vikor orban nice buzzwords . 
  how is he racist ? 
  show me a quote or policy by orb\u00e1n , which makes him racist . 
  how is he homophobic ? 
  show me proof , i want to hate him too !, 
  the same goes for xenophobic too . 
  give me anything other than `` he is xenophobic , because he built a fence to keep ` refugees ' out '' . 
  the fence was built , because he had to draw the strength out of actual far-right jobbik . 
  all the fence does , is it keeps entering into the country under control . 
  if fidesz did n't do anything about the migrant crisis , jobbik would 've had a stroll in the next election . 
   the refugee crisis in the past two years has given them a surge in popularity nation wide . 
  some of the awful treatment of refugees has been well documented and reported globally , but this is what 's happening locally http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-38881349 would it be better if jobbik a.k.a `` let 's keep a tab on jews in the parliament '' got more power because of it ? 
  i do n't think so . 
  btw , toroczkai is a unique joke , i would n't waste my breath on him . 
  other quote from the article :  one resident , eniko undreiner , said it was `` really scary '' to see `` masses of migrants walking through the village '' last year as they crossed into the country . 
  let 's not forget , we are the country , who banned far-right marches ( magyar g\u00e1rda ) too , because they were frightening . 
  it was banned by fidesz . 
  to answer op 's question : our far right is represented by jobbik , they have 23 seats out of 199 in the parliament , making them the third biggest political force , behind the leftist conglomerate ( 38 ) , and fidesz ( 133 ) . 
   are these people literally sitting on their asses all day ? 
  or are they doing the bare minimum to survive and then go do whatever they like ? 
  [ dunno , you tell me . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpe4a3keno8 ) back in the day during communism , they might enjoyed selling the radiators and the wooden floor from their government provided houses for their government provided work in the mines , as scrap metal and firewood , but i 'm not sure . 
  that could also be the things they like to do . 
  i honestly do n't know .

  here 's my brief theory . 
  despite the differences in population and their linearly proportional talent pools , the number of people `` going pro '' is a sub-linear function of the population , much closer to being constant than proportional . 
  since there 's only so many medals to offer in national junior competitions , kids who never win anything quit , and you 're left with a rather fixed number of kids who had some sort of success , regardless of your population . 
  then you have to rely on this smaller number of kids to train hard , develop well and become olympians . 
  of course bigger countries have better starting material to work with because the kids had to clear higher standards to stay in sports , but their numbers are n't all that much higher than those in smaller countries . 
  and how much they improve on top of their junior performance is somewhat random . 
  i think there might be some interesting math in there by the way , extreme value theory and stuff . 
  i think i could build a model that is n't complete bollocks and reflects the above factors . 
  like : 1 . 
  take a normal distribution for innate talent for some sport . 
  generate n `` kids '' where n is your youngster population , and take the best 50 . 
  add another smaller normally distributed random value to these 50 reflecting their junior-to-adult improvement . 
  take the best 3 . 
  these go to the olympics . 
  add another even smaller random value to these 3 reflecting their form at the olympics . 
  do this for other countries with different population . 
  give medals for the top three overall . 
  repeat many times for many sports and plot the number of medals against population . 
  you 'd get a curve that grows slower than the population , much like a square root function . 
  i once did an analysis between population vs medal count among countries that take the olympics seriously enough to get more than x medals every time . 
  and i found that medals vs. square root of population fits the data best . 
  then i applied that formula for every participating country with the really tiny ones included , and britain has won this year . 
  you could go even lower with uk , italy , hungary and still be # 1 with 27 ( vs 26 for usa right now ) . 
  his whole point is that these `` facts '' were calculated brainlessly even with the state falsification aside . 
  you ca n't apply ppp to a planned economy the same way you do for a market economy . 
  it does n't matter what the prices of a car/phone/food were set to because you could n't buy them . 
  but it 's not a building ... 
  wtf are you on about , it says opera singer xy was killed * at the front line * . 
  do you know what the term front line means ? 
  what do you want , `` killed at the front line , you know that war place where soldiers are fighting with guns and stuff , not civilians '' so retards like you understand it better ? 
  i do n't know if you missed the 2013 ruling or you mean homeless people by `` not everyone '' , but every household has to pay now , whether or not they own a tv or radio . 
  there are no gez spies peeking into your apartment looking for a tv anymore , you just have to pay , period . 
  so that makes it a fixed per-household tax regardless of how you dress it up . 
  he 's a competitor , not a pundit . 
  a sportsman has no business belittling a fair opponent 's mentality , even if his statements would be considered a realistic assessment from a pundit 's mouth . 
  my opinion on this matter is unchangeable . 
  a good sport does n't do it . 
  period . 
  regarding the iceland are n't going to do nuthin stuff , you may well be right and he could have meant iceland are n't going to attack . 
  goal differences in their qualifying group : netherlands +3 , turkey +5 , czech +5 , iceland +11 . 
  first of all , i 'm not a hater , i 've always cheered for cristiano doing well as i 'd been following united for nearly 20 years . 
  and obviously i 'll continue to do so regardless of some mean post-match statements . 
  but let 's call a spade a spade . 
  he was n't `` respectful at all times '' and the media did n't twist his words like your entire post is trying to convince us . 
  he did say `` small mentality '' , right ? 
  he did say iceland are n't going to do anything in the competition , right ? 
  both of these are very disrespectful things to say about an opponent who 's just drawn you fair and square , without playing dirty , without being favored by the ref . 
  ronaldo has played dozens if not hundreds of games like this , his comments are so uncalled for it 's ridiculous . 
  btw , it 's such an odd thing to say that a team ca n't amount to anything playing like this , especially from ronaldo of all people . 
  he should really know better , he was on the pitch in the 2004 final . 
  what a load of shit . 
   iceland did n't try anything . 
  they were just defend , defend , defend and playing on the counterattack . 
  it was a lucky night for them . 
  we should have three points but we are ok . 
  i thought they 'd won the euros the way they celebrated at the end . 
  it was unbelievable . 
  when they do n't try to play and just defend , defend , defend , this in my opinion shows a small mentality and they are not going to do anything in the competition . 
  not far from what americans pay for their gas in total . 
  not computers , but the general [ architecture of modern computers ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/von_neumann_architecture ) . 
  it has to do with how data and programs are stored in memory , how they are loaded into and executed by different units of the processor , technical stuff . 
  so not some shiny physical computer . 
  the question was `` how favourable is your view of ... '' for which the vast majority of respondents probably just ticked the box in the middle , hence the 52 % result . 
  i mean , i would probably do the same with latvia , maybe one step towards positive out of eastern european sympathy . 
  estonia is a different story with their high-tech reputation , but i guess it 's not so widely known enough yet . 
  good idea , that 's the only noteworthy region of your country anyway . 
  that 's the happy one with fireworks and a negligible amount of politics compared to the other two .

  that 's not a mirror translation , that 's a new word . 
  and surely you could have found a better example than a word that has n't been used by anyone for 50 years because a hungarian word has long displaced it . 
  mere mirror translations do n't count . 
  just because two words have the same logic does n't make them lexically similar if they are a completely different bunch of letters . 
  form has to match too . 
  you would n't say widerstand and ellen\u00e1ll\u00e1s are similar just because they 're built against + stand . 
  i do n't have any particular ngo in mind , you 'd have to do some research . 
  but i think there must be a couple of foundations for facilitating healthcare access . 
  this is n't asking for money randomly , think more of a ( somewhat risky ) loan than a donation . 
  by losing your disability you could enter the workforce and finance your treatment , the ngo would merely help you pay the upfront costs which you 'd subsequently pay back to them . 
  considering that you also have a viable lawsuit , you might be able to find someone who would be willing to take the risk and help you . 
  okay , i get it . 
  sounds like your treatment would be a one time thing ( as opposed to , say , a sustained 1000 eur/month cost until the end of your life ) . 
  which makes it better because it gives you a chance to make that much back by being gainfully employed after your treatment . 
  therefore i would n't be so quick dismissing ngos . 
  a bank will not give you a loan for this but an ngo might . 
  especially if they see a chance that you could sue it back from the insurance institution eventually . 
  what are the costs of the treatment and how much are you losing out on by not being able to work ? 
  i suppose there 's either a large gap between the two or it 's upfront cost heavy . 
  if it 's the latter though , would you be able to repay it if some ngo financed it for you ? 
  there is no `` that land '' , the majority of counties were ethnically separated .

  i was just visiting a ( danish ) friend there , but i could n't help but notice the flags everywhere . 
  it 's a nice flag , though , i must say . 
   they 're flag crazy . 
  i noticed this , too . 
  flags on birthday cakes !, 
  flags on christmas trees !, 
  i asked someone about it and he said it 's more a commercial thing or the flag as a `` pretty decoration '' than patriotic . 
  something like , `` how shall we decorate this stupid cake ? 
  oh , i do n't know , throw some flags on it or whatever . '', 
  that 's just one opinion , though , so ... 
  people mix up beethoven with mozart . 
  [ mozart 's nationality ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mozart%27s_nationality ) can be debated . 
  thank you for the explanation !, 
  i 've always wondered what stopped him from going farther south into judea . 
  was he on friendly terms with the people ? 
  fought back ? 
  saw no reason to grab a bunch of desert ? 
  ah , thanks . 
  i wonder why people stopped . 
  i did n't fly before 2000 and then only rarely until 2007-ish . 
  even now that i 've flown quite a bit ( within europe ) , i 've never seen anyone but georgians do it . 
  i thought maybe the habit came from giving extra praise to any pilot who manages to land an aeroflot plane safely . 
   clapping when the plane lands georgians do that , too ... 
  you should visit !, 
  it 's great . 
  i 've spent quite a bit of time there . 
  wonderful people . 
  and you can see the same kind of architecture as in budapest and vienna ( although unfortunately they do n't have the budget to get it all restored ) . 
  the nature is also lovely and stryisky park is easy to get to from the city center . 
  i do n't know about the beer , but if you like vodka , khortytsa is definitely worth a try . 
  well ... he did n't say she * ate * a pizza , only that she * wanted * a pizza . 
   but danes are probably considered slightly more approachable than the colder norwegians . 
  i think this is mostly what my friend meant . 
  that norwegians tend to be quieter , shier , more reserved in a similar way to finns , whereas danes tend to be more expressive and out-going . 
  but i also wonder if i got that impression because i spent summer in denmark ( see , it 's not just you guys ) and winter in norway , and people are just moodier and less sociable in winter . 
  seriously , though , this is exactly what a finnish friend of mine told me when i said i find danes so much more relatable than norwegians ( thinking they should be similar cultures ) . 
  `` well , danes are continentals like you ... '', 
  good point . 
  that 45c was in jordan , so definitely dry . 
  it affects you more when you 're not used to it . 
  i spent a lot of time in the near/middle east and could walk around in 45c with little trouble . 
  the first year i came back to europe , i so tired all that winter from the relative dark and cold . 
  now it 's reversed . 
  now -20 c is no problem , but anything over 20c ... no thanks . 
  i still read it as `` football hooligans ( of any country ) . '', 
  but yeah , i agree if they meant all poles , that 's ridiculous . 
  i 'm assuming he/she meant the particular individuals who did this , not the entire country of poland . 
  stopping recruitment may not be why she 's doing it . 
  she may be doing it to make the people it 's directed at ( jews , gypsies , whoever ) feel a little less shitty as they take their daily walks around town . 
  if you 're into metal , you might be interested in this [ finnish dna-profile-based music ] ( http://www.visitfinland.com/symphonyofextremes/#intro ) being planned for the end of the year . 
  apocalyptica 's writing it . 
  it seems to be something to attract attention from foreigners , though , because there 's no finnish version of the site ( or maybe it 's out there , but i have n't found it ) . 
  just thought i 'd mention it . 
  i have no idea about that . 
  although i * think * i remember my friend commenting that drivers in lviv were nice about looking out for pedestrians . 
   people do n't obligate to traffic code ( driving in ukraine was a really bad experience ) a finnish friend of mine recently visited me in lviv ( i spend a lot of time there ) and he said driving was `` like in spain . '', 
  so , quite disorganized compared to finland . 
  but yes , the roads . 
  you notice it even driving in from romania . 
  he also liked the strawberries and noted that they 're probably organic , judging by their appearance . 
  also , that the chicken has real flavour . 
  the food here really is quite good , both the cuisine and the raw ingredients available . 
  sorry to hear about the language thing , though . 
  i love this holiday !, 
  one year , a couple guys poured * two whole buckets * of water on me from the balcony of the hotel shirak in yerevan . 
  i could n't see exactly where they were pouring from and i was waiting to cross the street , so i could n't really avoid them . 
  not that i really cared . 
  of course , it helps that when its 38c out , you * want * someone to pour water on you . 
  ( i mean that seriously . ), 
  nah , he was non-religious `` culturally jewish . '', 
  he 'd come on a press trip to learn about the jewish community and i happened to ask what he thought of the synagogue ... and he had n't seen it . 
  so i took him around to see some things . 
  he was * pissed * that they had n't shown it to him . 
  but i know what you mean . 
  the smaller [ synagogue on rumbach street ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/24/rumbachfotothalertamas10.jpg/1280px-rumbachfotothalertamas10.jpg ) was built because some people did n't like the organs in the main synagogue . 
  glad you enjoyed it !, 
  hope you can came back sometime . 
  spring and autumn probably are the best times ; summer 's humid and winter lacks snow . 
  yes , she is [ quite faboulous ] ( https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/0e/94/d4/0e94d41fc3efc4c58f520ab0a37f2fbe.jpg ) . 
  yes , and third biggest in the world after jerusalem 's belz great synagogue and then one in new york , i think . 
  i took a british-jewish acquaintance to see it once and as we walked out in front of it , he stopped , stared and said , `` my god , it 's a jewish cathedral ! '', 
  my personal favorite description so far . 
  this photo makes it look a * little * bigger than it is , though , imo . 
  quite a lot , actually . 
  the particular `` far rightists '' in this article seem fairly off their hinges , but i 've met some far-ish right people ( jobbik supporters ) who are the type that say `` those other jews '' ( soros et al , i suppose ) are the bag guys , but your regular neighbours and co-workers who are jewish , well , they 're perfectly fine and no one should ever harm them . 
  we have quite a few gypsy and jewish people , whom i doubt this lot considers `` white '' . 
  that said , i agree with the person above who said the look like an insignificant group of school kids . 
  i was going to say i 'd rather be a southern drunken mongol , but then i saw your username ... 
  see ... even then , 50 % of people being afraid sounds crazy . 
  i 've walked through the 8th district at like , 2 am , and never had a problem . 
  i used to live in the 6ths and 7th . 
  walked all over . 
  never had a problem . 
  only two times i 've * ever * been bothered at night were in the 9th and 19th . 
  still feel perfectly safe walking at night . 
  i will say , i felt * much * less safe walking home in oslo ( was there for 3 months ) . 
  it 's got to be largely perception .

  in that case , there 's not much to say , because any politician will tell you that isolationism is not an option for the us . 
  it blows my mind that you think the us even has the ability to not get involved , when the current status quo is literally built upon american intervention . 
  this is n't just some civil war , this is russia actively undermining a sovereign nation that is in the progress of joining nato and the eu , which undermines our sovereignty . 
  this is literally an attack on western interests . 
  if this is n't the time to get involved , then there is literally no reason to get involved , and you truly are an isolationist , which is a school of thought that died out long ago for a reason . 
  it 's politically unfeasible , and it 's only fed by the misconception that the us has anything to lose by protecting its interests . 
  you write better than a putin bot , but you 're saying exactly what his supporters want to hear . 
  for god 's sake man , use an / s !, 
  us internet warriors have trouble telling friend from foe !, 
  the us has fifty states that have been ruled by their federal government for over two hundred years . 
  the american colonials had a lot less distinguishing them from one another than europeans do even when this nation was born , and since then this country has been the victim of cultural dilution for a couple of centuries , yet each state still has a unique identity that 's evident the moment you talk to someone there . 
  i understand your fear , but it 's entirely unwarranted . 
  not only that , but this sort of fear is the basis of nationalism and extremism , while almost always being proven wrong . 
  the family structure was n't broken apart when women were given the right to vote , kids did n't start murdering their parents when nudity and violence started being shown on tv , and european countries will never lost their identity . 
  in fact , if there 's anything we should be worrying about , it 's countries not being able to work past their pride and accept that we 're better off as one people . 
  i love europe , i 'm quite a fanboy , but i 'm deeply jealous of how americans can be brotherly with no regard for which state they come from , while europeans still find reasons to set themselves apart . 
  you do n't think there 's racist undertones in ukip rhetoric ? 
  i wo n't say that the party itself is racist , but it takes a long stretch of the imagination to say that there are n't prominent members that are fairly racist . 
  something something the heart of darkness . 
  the uk was always and still is able to join germany and france at the head of the table . 
  it 's entirely up to the uk if it does so . 
  yes , because joining the eurozone could be characterized as insane . 
  / s god forbid you find out that other people have different perspectives than you . 
  maybe you 're joking , but french engineering is fairly good in the arms field , and american missiles do n't cause friendly fire , the nature of war does . 
  the us has the most accurate ordinance in the world . 
  here you go : `` 1 . the united states of america , the russian federation , and the united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland , reaffirm their commitment to ukraine , in accordance with the principles of the csce final act , to respect the independence and sovereignty and the existing borders of ukraine . 
  2 . the united states of america , the russian federation , and the united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland , reaffirm their obligation to refrain from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of ukraine , and that none of their weapons will ever be used against ukraine except in self-defense or otherwise in accordance with the charter of the united nations . 
  3 . the united states of america , the russian federation , and the united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland , reaffirm their commitment to ukraine , in accordance with the principles of the csce final act , to refrain from economic coercion designed to subordinate to their own interest the exercise by ukraine of the rights inherent in its sovereignty and thus to secure advantages of any kind . 
  4 . the united states of america , the russian federation , and the united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland , reaffirm their commitment to seek immediate united nations security council action to provide assistance to ukraine , as a non-nuclear-weapon state party to the treaty on the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons , if ukraine should become a victim of an act of aggression or an object of a threat of aggression in which nuclear weapons are used . '', 
  russia has broken all of these , which leads me to :  it does not include any defense provisions . 
  the us/uk absolutely did not agree to defend ukraine from all outside threats . 
  you 're right , it does n't , but what happens when one of the signing members violates the agreement , and the nation that made the agreement have any meaning does n't do anything ? 
  you 're anti-involvement , so your stance breaks this agreement any way you spin it , and said agreement implies some sort of involvement , in which case dodging involvement furthers my point , it 'll be seen as america using loop hools and technicalities to not help europe after we followed it into that mess of a war called afghanistan . 
  these kinds of agreements are always as vague as possible , that does n't mean that governments pick and choose outside of extreme situations . 
  what you 're saying is , the language is vague enough , so lets not be the balancing for that we forced our way into . 
  do you know how much of a hand the us has had in european development ? 
  do you know how much hinges on the us being a strong ally to the eu ? 
  do you know how much hinges on vice-versa ? 
  i ca n't tell if you 're an isolationist , lack empathy , or just do n't know things , because you absolutely have to be one based on what you said . 
  then they 're using the flag erroneously ( which the federal government has also done quite a bit ) . 
  i live here ( in the us ) and partake in the military community , i see vets complaining about it all the time . 
  the difference is that iraq was an stupid and unjustified war that the world 's strongest single nation got duped into , and ukraine is a country in europe , being courted by the eu , america 's best ally . 
  ladies and gentlemen , an anarchist has joined the discussion . 
  thank heavens that we have disgruntled college students to guide our people . 
  you do realize that part of the reason why ukraine is getting fucked by russia is because america convinced it to give up its nuclear weapons in return for protection against foreign threats , and because of people like you , the us government has held back and lost credibility ? 
  just because you were n't alive when the us made a commitment does n't mean that you get to back out of that commitment . 
  if the founding fathers can dictate every aspect of american politics with a vague document , then agreement made a couple of decades ago should n't be that hard to follow . 
  also , the eu is america 's only steady ally in the world . 
  if america suddenly does a 360 and stops intervening when it matters , it will lose its place at the head of the table . 
  luckily , men much more informed than you are leading this country . 
  american military flags have golden frilly stuff to differentiate them from federal flags . 
  the military carries the authority of the american government , but it is a limited authority , and as such ca n't be represented by a normal american flag . 
  i 've seen a few fiascos over frilled flags being used at federal functions , people are touchy about that . 
  americans take flags pretty seriously , it 's a little weird , but to each their own . 
  i feel like your comment is n't getting the appreciation it deserves . 
  they do n't drop on top of enemy positions anymore ( mostly ) , they 're meant to deploy from aircraft and helicopters ahead of other friendly forces , or where friendly forces ca n't reach by conventional means . 
  air mobile infantry is still incredibly important in modern doctrine , especially when you 're the us , with an insane amount of air assets to back those troops up . 
  they 're welcome to try something , but i 'm living in the us right now and trust me , the current backlash against foreign intervention would n't extend to a south or central american nation messing with the us . 
  also , i 've been thinking about getting my citizenship through military service , so hey , it would be an exciting enlistment . 
  yo , iceland is packing some sweet rides . 
  whenever see stuff like this i click the link just to see the bad ass picture of western european cops doing their thing . 
  was not disappointed . 
  i 'm not going to listen to someone try to justify the soviet union 's crimes , so just post another link and be done with it . 
  he was overthrown because he dropped a cooperation agreement with the eu and decided to sign one with russia without even consulting his people . 
  actually , that 's not even why he was overthrown . 
  he was overthrown because he did n't change his path when his people * clearly * showed that they were completely against what he was doing , and as a cherry on top , he had the police beat and kill peaceful protesters . 
  if that does n't warrant overthrow ( although at that point , a respectable man would have resigned ) then i do n't know what does . 
  ukraine was homogeneous before russia implanted artificial minorities for times exactly like this . 
  judging by your name , there 's a chance that you 're on a novelty account that actually does argue for the sake of it , but when playing the devil 's advocate you need to make it clear that you do n't buy into all of his bull . 
  these are the things they discussed . 
  it 's surprising that yet another eu nation has decided to try to milk putin for favor in return for clearly going against the eu . 
  scratch that , it 's not just surprising , it 's alarming . 
  you ca n't spin tsipras ' opposition of the sanctions as anything other than dirty politics . 
  the man does n't care if ukrainians are needlessly dying , he 's too busy being greece 's konrad adenauer , or pretending to be . 
  the man is clearly aiming to have his name be associated with the return of greek strength , and he 's taking some truly shady roads to get there .

  i do n't know why you 're being downvoted , at its core , the soviet union was an incredibly nationalistic state that killed millions . 
  the distinction is important , but not so big that russia is any better . 
  in fact , many would argue that nazi ideology was less `` evil '' because it included private ownership . 
  none of that would be an issue if russia did n't f * cking invade ukraine in the first place . 
  if you 're seeking to judge a group of people for having negative attitudes towards a country that is invading them , and has only done one good thing for modern europe compared to the long lost of bad things , then i suspect you 've got a bit of a russian bias . 
  ukrainians are n't invading russia . 
  they are n't funding an artificial civil war . 
  they 're not sending jets to harass russian airspace . 
  why are russians becoming increasingly nationalistic when they 're they 're the only aggressors ? 
  why do they hate the eu when the eu has been trying to promote euro-russo friendship since the soviet union fell ? 
  ehm , you do realize that putin was in the kgb and almost certainly ( fuck , we know for a fact ) committed crimes against humanity . 
  having proof written by the criminals themselves could go great lengths to discredit the current leadership of russia , which is balls deep in the soviet thug orgy . 
  this sub also has ( mostly ) informed people posting on it . 
  a lot of europeans are still prone to believing in things that we on the internet know are simply false or twisted . 
  no doubt , it was a real risk watching that when i was young and impressionable because by god , did the nazi 's know how to seduce . 
  europeans agree that fox news is literally worse that the triumph des willens . 
  you can joke about that clown all you want , hungarians with internet access who have the ability to understand basic concepts ( like jokes , or why orban is a corrupt dickweed ) wo n't mind !, 
  we 'll be neighbor 's in the russian death camps when western europe sits by and allows russian aggression . 
  * glares at all of the western europeans in the thread * . 
  i know , i do n't fully buy into the patriotic stuff during peacetime ( france does some pretty cool stuff in africa though , i kind of feel like we owe those people some help ) , although i 'd probably be ideologically vile if anyone actually attacked europe . 
  having lived outside of europe extensively throughout my life , i do n't take kindly to anyone messing with my little fortress of reason and civilization haha .

  ofc you can always answer with a question and find a medieval anecdotes based chronicle , which also states that we find our first home thanks to a magical deer . 
  hungarians has a rich history and many chronicles with fascinating stories . 
  believe in the hungarian and german colonists and other nationalist myths or zombies and vampires , if you like . 
  `` bulgaria was invaded by the hungarians in ** 894 ** , but a joint counter-attack by the bulgars and the pechenegs -- a nomadic turkic people -- forced the hungarians to find a new homeland in the carpathian basin . 
  ** historians still debate whether they encountered a romanian population in the territory . 
  ** '' '' ... theories on the romanian urheimat or `` homeland '' can be divided into two or more groups , including the theory of daco-roman continuity of the continuous presence of the romanians ' ancestors in the lands north of the lower danube and the opposite immigrationist theory . ( ... ), 
  although for a millennium migratory peoples invaded the lands now forming romania , a sedentary romance-speaking population survived . 
  these lands remained the main `` center of romanization '' after ** the slavs began to assimilate the latin-speaking population of the balkans in the 6th century ** . ( ... 
  ) following the collapse of the empire 's frontiers around 620 , some of this population moved south to regions where latin had not been widely spoken , giving rise to the modern ** vlach shepherds ** . ( ... 
  ) they were first employed as border guards along the southeastern frontiers of the kingdom of hungary and later settled in other sparsely inhabited regions as well . 
  although sheep-breeding remained their principal economic activity for centuries , their ** permanent settlements are also documented from the 1330s .

  if you beleive in this , than you are a nationalist idiot , who just does n't care the historical facts , just chauvinist fairy tales . 
  in that case it 's useless to even try to argue with you . 
  in any other cases , you should try to learn some history , english wikipedia is maybe a good starting point , as the hungarian and romanian opinions are largely balancing each other there . 
   amongst the german and hungarian colonists relocated in those parts of the country , whereas the native population had a lower general literacy rate . 
  that 's what happens when you fight and pay tribute to the ottomans for 500 years , only to be conquered by the empire next door which takes away your biggest and most productive chunk of the country , hah , good username . 
  you are really a big fat liar . 
  in my opinion it 's bad , because the hungarian government use it as a decoy . 
  orban fools those who believe his propaganda in hungary and in europe , while he uses his office and power to fuel his mafia network with european money and calling everyone a commie , a liberal or nazi , who tries to stop him . 
  he is a very dangerous man without moral values .

  from wikipedia : bratislava the first written reference to a settlement named `` brezalauspurc '' dates to ** 907 ** and is related to a battle , during which a ** bavarian army was defeated by the hungarians . 
  ** it is connected to the fall of great moravia , already weakened by its own inner decline and under the attacks of the hungarians . 
  in the 10th century , the territory of pressburg ( what would later become pozsony county ) became part of hungary ( called `` the kingdom of hungary '' from 1000 ) . 
  it developed as a key economic and administrative centre on the kingdom 's frontier . 
  this strategic position destined the city to be the site of frequent attacks and battles , but also brought it economic development and high political status .

  you wrote a comment in response to mine below , which i was in the process of responding to but you deleted it . 
  it said ... `` based on that logic , slovakia/felvid \u00e9k should not exist '' this would have been my answer . 
  it should exist , but bratislava should not have been a part of it . 
  like it says in the link you posted ... at the onset of wwi , the city was 42 % german ( austrian ) , 41 % hungarian , and 15 % slovakian . 
  handing over a city to the country of slovakia , a country that the city had never belonged to in its history , where 85 % of the population are non-slavic , certainly baffled more than a few people . 
  you could argue over whether it was more germanic , or more hungarian , but slavic ? 
  it is what it is . 
  borders and boundaries have changed . 
  wars have taken place . 
  it 's long in the past , but it really never was a slavic city . 
  and to pretend that it ever was prior to that , is revisionist history . 
  you doubt it ? 
  based on what ? 
  it 's a fact ... use a search engine , and type in hungary . 
  then read a bit about it . 
  `` in the 10th century , the territory of pressburg ( what would later become pozsony county ) became part of hungary ( called `` the kingdom of hungary '' from 1000 ) . '', 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bratislava#history in which country is dallas , texas ? 
  miami , florida ? 
  san diego , california ? 
  would you say those cities are in the united states ? 
  or are those cities in mexico ? 
  within these massive cities , one may hear the spanish language spoken as often as the english language . 
  either now , or in the not too distant future . 
  in many us cities , especially in the south , spanish is native language spoken by a majority of the local population . 
  yet these cities are not in mexico . 
  that applies here as well . 
  bratislava was right on the border with austria to the west , and with more slavic territories to the north . 
  of course you were going to hear those 3 languages spoken by many people . 
  that does not negate the fact that the city was inside the borders of hungary from the 900 's until the 1900 's . 
  at no point in time was the city of bratislava not within the borders of hungary for almost one thousand years . 
  having large groups of minorities in one of your cities does not make it a foreign city . 
  no city is `` purely '' anything , but bratislava was a city inside the country of hungary , or kingdom of hungary from the 10th century until the 20th century . 
  was there a minority of germans and slavs living there ? 
  probably . 
  obviously no city is `` pure '' nor should it be . 
  but the city was inside the border of hungary for 900-1000 years before the country of slovakia was created . 
  bit of a tangent from the topic of transylvania though . 
  i would have guessed that the percentage was higher than just 6 % ( although that number was for the entire country , not transylvania ) , but after 3 generations , the cultures have intermarried , and the 3rd generation now , while perhaps still holding onto hungarian family names , are mixed-ethnicity , and may likely no longer feel such a close tie to their grandparent 's and parents ' native land that they 'd fight for autonomy . 
  i really ca n't see this ever happening . 
  after trianon , the romanian government moved ethnic romanian families into transylvania so as to dilute the region , and that has certainly come to fruition . 
  the empire of austria-hungary certainly overstepped their bounds , and took many lands to which they had no rightful claim . 
  when they were punished after the wars , they lost many lands to which they did have rightful claim . 
  it 's somewhat unfortunate , but it was the cost of going too far . 
  bratislava ( pozsony ) is another example of a city which was purely hungarian for 900 years prior to the world wars , and it was just taken away . 
  large parts of transylvania fall into that same category , including cluj ( kolozsv\u00e1r ) , but far too much time has passed since the two world wars ( during which time there was something of a back and forth ) . 
  the amount of people that believe strongly enough in this to protest for it is nowhere near enough . 
  most hungarians have long ago accepted this as a reality , and i think most transylvanians have too . 
  it 's always `` national security '' is n't it ? 
  releasing information to the public ? 
  national security threat . 
  the common people knowing what 's actually happening , that 's the biggest threat of them all . 
  national security is the new `` protecting the children . '', 
  the reason being ... `` we are determined to further reduce rates of smoking and believe this important step today will help . '', 
  we really are ignorant . 
  they want to reduce rates of smoking . 
  if only we had known , we would n't have mocked the increase in size of the warning labels from 40 % of the pack to 65 % . 
  it all makes sense now . 
  that 's the problem ... people could n't read the warnings !, 
  this is far more disgusting than pornography . 
  it always seems to be in the name of `` protecting the children . '', 
  government overreach , and a step toward the primitive . 
  i think he 's a troll . 
  all of the underwater mediterranean kingdoms in the deep-sea speak hungarian . 
  but with a weird southern accent . 
  is it accurate that they had the civilians move the bodies of the ones that had already been executed before then killing those guys as well ? 
  i fast-forwarded but that 's the impression that i got , which is devastating . 
  no , you do n't get it . 
  numbers do n't lie . 
  the strategy worked . 
  he got the extra votes he wanted by implementing this strategy . 
  why are you so upset ? 
  that 's what happened . 
  obviously not all of them voted for him , in fact , most did n't vote at all . 
  only a child would conclude that that should be the takeaway from what i wrote . 
  in order to win a super-majority he handed out millions of hungarian citizenships ( 4-5 million i believe it was ) to ethnic hungarian people living in former territories such as transylvania , slovakia , serbia . 
  this gave many of them eu status or schengen status . 
  most of these people living outside of modern day hungary and unaware of internal politics here , voted for him and his party because they gave them citizenship .

  we may need some more shocks on the scale of snowden and even more shocking . 
  people currently do n't care about this . 
  `` i have nothing to hide '' and `` why would anyone spy on me '' are the basic responses . 
  anything further seems paranoid to them . 
  i have a dual boot setup , and if i want to play games i boot to win7 . 
  but i can understand you , it 's not really easy for normal users . 
  the gaming thing is basically a self-reinforcing thing , because they do n't release games for linux due to the small number of users , and there 's a small number of users due to the lack of games ( partially ) ... 
  i also had problems with it , but it 's still the best in my personal experience . 
  i also tried linux mint and fedora . 
  fedora was a constant battle against misconfigurations and bugs and hacking around stuff . 
  i 'm a programmer but i just could n't stand fiddling around with basic os stuff all the time instead of having a solid base . 
  i know fedora people would tell me i have no patience or it 's just a learning curve or whatever , but i prefer to have a base that works without randomly breaking . 
  ubuntu has its annoyances but at least it does n't break horribly and regularly ( for me ) . 
  i still have a win7 on dual boot , but ubuntu is enough usually . 
  generally i dislike the saas idea . 
  why does google need to know what i translate ? 
  i get it from a technical point of view , they can review how well they are doing and concentrate on what people use . 
  but still , if i want to translate something , i 'd want to do it on my computer . 
  i see how it takes away the incentive to make the product/service , hence the existence of the whole debate , but the future does n't seem too nice in this regard . 
  linux mint is another popular `` normal people '' distro . 
  it 's still a good starting point . 
  the fragmentation and internal battles in the linux community are not interesting for `` normal '' users . 
  they just want something that works and does n't spy and steal your data . 
  ( i know about the amazon `` spying issue '' of ubuntu , but i think it 's still a minor issue ) one could also try linux mint , though . 
  but i like to keep it simple and just say ubuntu . 
  it 's well-known , big and works . 
  it 's confusing if we keep changing the recommendations every year ... 
  try ubuntu and libreoffice . 
  it has improved a lot in recent years in terms of user-friendliness . 
  there is some transition time , of course , but seeing where things are going , i switched and i have n't regretted it . 
  you can do the same shit on linux : browse the internet , listen to music , watch movies , etc. 
  the downsides are : games are almost never released for linux , and special software like cad and professional video editing are lacking . 
  what is the reason that you do n't want to consider linux ? 
  does it sound too nerdy ? 
  this is a bit paranoid . 
  hungary has essentially no military and it 's an invisibly tiny minority who 'd want to go to war to get territories back . 
  it 's ridiculous . 
  i do n't know what fearmongering newspapers you read , but austrians being afraid of hungarian military is absurd . 
  we are in the nato , eu , we 'd be bombed to the ground if we tried to `` take back burgenland '' or whatever . 
  an area that has basically no hungarian population . 
  any tl ; dr in politics is heavily subjective and opinion laden . 
  two opposing views can get you totally different tl ; drs. 
  so you mean hungary is * not * spending enough money on immigration ? 
  but that 's the whole point !, 
  orb\u00e1n and many hungarians * do n't want to * spend a lot of money on immigrants . 
  if we do n't spend more in 2016 than in 2015 it 's a * good thing * , a * success * . 
  eventually you 'd reach an equilibrium that it 's equally shitty all across the globe . 
  then there is no more motivation to move . 
  sure , i can not do that here . 
  you could say it about all comments here . 
  read a book on evolutionary psychology , monogamy and promiscuity , the arms race of the sexes , mating habits etc. 
  here i ca n't summarize it in a way that could n't be called `` just claiming '' it . 
  there 's a difference between justification and pointing out the reason for something . 
  the lion wants to eat me because it 's hungry . 
  still if i have a gun and it 's attacking me , i 'll shoot it . 
  but i 'm not saying it was surprising that it attacked me . 
  i can understand the reasons , but i think it 's wrong to eat me , it 's unjustifiable to eat me for food ( except if i 'm in a very altruistic mood ) because i 'm important for myself . 
  i see no contradiction here . 
  i 'm not trying to justify it . 
  i elaborate on it in [ this comment of mine ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3eb4ks/diagram_of_infidelity_by_gender_and_country_in/ctdl4sh ) . 
  i agree totally !, 
  however , i like to keep the activities of `` thinking about something '' and `` judging it '' separate . 
  i know this kind of thinking is just alien to some people who were brought up differently . 
  but i think you ca n't understand a phenomenon unless you look at it in an unattached way , like an alien observing humans from outer space . 
  maybe you are n't interested in `` understanding it '' and i ca n't make you be . 
  but there is a difference between acknowledging that a hungry lion is going to eat you and liking this fact . 
  lions eating me is natural but still i do n't like it , and not liking it is my nature . 
  so i try not go get eaten by lions , but then i myself go on to kill pests . 
  well , in some societies you must care about your reputation more than you care about having arms and legs . 
  because ruining your reputation equals totally ruining your life . 
  yes , in europe we mostly have the luxury of not giving a fuck , but not everyone has it . 
  love is pure , fluffy and sweet and happy pink unicorns farting rainbows out of their asses . 
  sorry but this is a very naive view . 
  you can either fall into misanthropy/mis-life-y after hearing this or see things for what they are and recognize that you yourself are a sinner too ( this is an important tenet in religions too - although i 'm atheist ) . 
  just a hypothesis : think of it like this . 
  without contraception in an ancient environment the percentages may be more equal . 
  but today , a different man can be with a woman with every other night but there is no baby out of it for extended times . 
  so the woman remains available for more and more time . 
  even if this idea is wrong , the one area where male and female thinking is surely very different is mating habits / reproductive strategy . 
  you can say men and women are the same in problem solving , writing novels and cooking , but you ca n't say they are the same in sexual relationships . 
  basically all our differences in physical features evolved because of ( or in tight connection to ) these different strategies . 
  the problem is , lying and deception are among the most prevalent phenomena in nature at large . 
  the biological imperative is to lie so convincingly that you yourself even believe it , but then slowly ( through hormonal changes ) unexpectedly fade out of the commitment ( even surprising yourself , possibly even feeling guilt ) , and then leave . 
  i think this was already recognized by many in ancient civilizations and they ( probably initiated by fathers with daughters ) tried to correct it through enforcible contracts , i.e. 
  marriage . 
  i 'm not saying it 's wrong . 
  i 'm trying to look at it objectively . 
  it 's a bit like the alarm clock , in that it breaks the `` natural '' reproductive habits , just like an alarm clock breaks your natural sleep . 
  there are of course `` natural '' examples for proofs-of-intention and proofs-of-effort akin to marriage in other animals , too . 
  but the basic biological imperative is always to one-up on the partner and make them believe you provided a valid proof , while you did n't actually . 
  this can happen subconsciously in the mind of the cheater . 
  the deception can be as unintentional as a butterfly 's wing patterns ( looking like an eye ) are unintentional on the side of the individual butterfly . 
  it 's simply due to the frequencies of the genes in the population ( evolution ) . 
  this does n't mean i find it morally right . 
  but crossing moral lines must be natural , otherwise we would n't even have a rule against it . 
  cheating * on you * is the most despicable thing . 
  and of course outwards everyone maintains this face of `` oh , i 'd never '' . 
  this is cultural . 
  just like religious people say they 'd never masturbate and therefore they end up believing they are the only ones doing it in their community . 
  people cheat .

  also , eastern and central european post-communist societies are fed up with foreign influences telling them what to do and what to adapt to . 
  it 's the effect of a socialist society forced on the people from moscow ; in general , we do n't give a fuck about what others expect from us , be it other countries ( especially those who were lucky enough to avoid decades of socialist brainwashing ) or incoming masses of migrants/refugees . 
  in other words , it is n't plain xenophobia , but self-reliance and defiance against external influences . 
  left-wing liberals wo n't ever comprehend this unfortunately . 
  just call us if you need help with that , deutschland . 
   the eu is n't to blame for this crisis whatsoever . 
  it 's lazy , introvert countries with no sense of solidarity or cooperation or even a sense of responsibility to implement effective action that are causing this crisis . 
  what . 
  the . 
  solution . 
  to adopt ? 
  these so-called refugees do n't want to do * anything * with countries other than their choosen destination ? 
  what unified , selfless coordination of europe would have helped all these entitled migrants who do n't give a shit about anything except wanting a `` german life '' in germany or a `` swedish life '' in sweden ? 
  the funny thing is that mama merkel still wants to spread them all over the eu when in fact these people only want to be in germany , the promised land . 
  ... except one or two govts who shrug off being called fascist/neo-nazi/racist / xenophobic . 
  * cough * well at least we try . 
   once you 've entered hungary ha . 
  haha . 
  entering hungary !, 
   some people just simply want higher wages and less taxes which is weird this is basically our curse in hungary . 
  i believe that people want to live a decent life , but a lot of people here ca n't do anything else than aping how the `` west '' gives 3x-4x-5x-10x more than the wage here and that they `` ca n't live '' in hungary . 
  and then they go on demanding both more wage and less taxation , but both ca n't happen at the same time . 
  actually i would n't mind them going abroad and living there if they would n't talk like shit about our native country , like it 's a third-world shithole ... 
  i 'm not going to argue for anything here , but let 's just say that age of consent is a damn hard thing to define . 
  partly because nobody gains the psychological insight after waking up to their nth birthday . 
  and then we have dumbfucks who want to ban lolicon manga and anime because ... well , they depict `` children '' . 
  yeah , nonexistent children with unreal proportions . 
  it 's almost like some people believe in thoughtcrimes . 
  i 'm not who calls a gun just a `` tool '' all the time . 
  i would be if i would be a gun-happy american , they call it just a tool to shoot projectiles . 
  a blowtorch , a chainsaw , a nailgun , a gun , a car , a lot of stuff can kill you accidentally , does n't mean you are a survivor of an accident involving them just because you happened to be in the vicinity , moron . 
  germans actually recognize the nature of the problem and try to do something about it other than mindless demonizing . 
  i ca n't believe what a minefield is even mentioning pedophilia , and how absurdly the word is thrown around ( i 'm looking at you , americans ) when people express any sort of passing interest or appreciation of even teenagers . 
  maybe all those fictious lolicon manga are n't that bad at all if it 's about urges and controlling them . 
  of course , for some , even reading that means you must be an evil monster keen to hurt children . 
  edit : typos, 
  still , you imply they should n't shoot a warning shot if there is anything nearby . 
  in pitch dark , and given the situation , the guard did n't do anything wrong . 
  yeah , because we have n't seen majority muslim people here in the previous 2 months , nah ... 
  they have been all kosovars speaking arabic and urdu !, 
  also , seen unhcr or frontex data ? 
  those are n't `` orbanized '' , do n't worry . 
  there 's an if ... we can agree syrians , being muslims , have a different worldview than christian/atheist germany ( and europe ) . 
  and not just because of islam . 
  that entire region has different views and values about a lot of things . 
  if so , why are european nations told to accept quotas ? 
  let 's try who can and who can not take refugees in reality ? 
  refugee status should n't be about a cozy house and nifty welfare anyway ... 
   she has been repeatedly on air saying that the eu outer borders have to be controlled more tightly yeah , great , what she means by `` control '' is to get them registered and preferably slow them dwn so german authorities can catch a breath . 
  but if we build a fence and actually make it possible to cross the border only via legal means ? 
  that 's against european values and human rights !, 
  now tell me , how the fuck schengen outer borders should be protected if not by a goddamn fence ? 
  i did n't expect that all the commenters would be experienced drug users who would legalize mdma and other substances ... 
  but well , it 's life , off i go . 
  and we get told these are educated people , ready to work in jobs requiring skills ... 
  but no free moniez , no hausing , has to do paperwork , wo n't get free legal and medical help after the trip ... 
  even as an eu citizen ... :(, 
  but no free moniez and hausing ... 
  you ca n't comprehend that they are n't entitled to be given asylum in their wealthy country of choice ? 
  fuck the unhcr , it is impossible for germany and sweden to host all these `` refugees '' just because they have the best welfare systems according to the refugees . 
  germany itself wants the quota system to share the burden . 
  we either allocate them to the countries we choose , or let them swarm their few countries of choice . 
  if they refuse a perfectly livable country because it does n't have the absolutely best welfare system , then they are n't pitiable war refugees , simple as that . 
   romania and bulgaria no offense , romania and bulgaria . 
  any other workable idea to handle ungrateful fucks calling themselves refugees ? 
  no , there is n't . 
  and so what ? 
  what to do with people who only want to live in x country ? 
  let them swarm x country ? 
  x country must be happy . 
  `` quotas will be the solution . '', 
  - every party to the left . 
  yeah it works greatly . 
  polan plz let eston join nordik . 
  what if people from other war zones try to go to germany because it 's open attitude ? 
  africa has some war-torn regions with a few million people in and around ... also , when other people who are n't refugees ( i.e. 
  economic migrants from shitty areas ) jump on this `` refugee bandwagon '' , germany ( and probably the transit countries too ) will be overwhelmed just by feeding and housing them `` humanely '' while they are processed and kicked out according to the laws . 
  it 's so important that merkel herself said it is the beginning of a new germany , it will be hard , etc. 
  not just the number what counts , these immigrants will form a subsociety and it might be incompatible to what your average german thinks . 
  what they plan right now does n't mean much . 
  why they want a germany-level life if they plan to return to syria ? 
  why not italy ? 
  why not austria ? 
  why all the `` germany , germany ! '', 
  mentality if you do n't care about permanently settling in a good place ? 
  yes , they want to return , they think like that now . 
  ask them in a few years , when syria is still a bombed-to-hell shithole , and they set up a cozy life and community here . 
  i doubt they would leave their new german life for a bombed out syria , even if the war will stop somehow . 
  or in syrian soil . 
  well , i do n't know , maybe because they are all keen on berlin ? 
  they are sheltered there and in a few bigger cities . 
  wait for them , if you are so eager to see them . 
  hopeless , shameless asylum seekers , that is . 
  many are only theoretically asylum seeker , they know they are n't eligible , but try anyway . 
   they can move anywhere in the eu . 
  not that they do n't walk around europe right now without having literally any papers ... 
  you are gravely mistaken if you think that the migrants flooding europe and germany are mostly from balkan countries and that there is no real migrant crisis to speak about . 
  wilkommenskultur at its best . 
  come , dear middle easterners and africans friends , for any reason . 
  we sort out you later , and we will give some of you deportation orders , which wo n't be enforced .

oh dont worry , they know what they are doing , saying this tax would give policemen a raise ... just as if he wants to make police and people collide ... they obviously asked many people before about what they think in this topic . 
  so my conclusion is , this whole idiot idea is just to make people forget that usa banned several high ranked officials from entering the country due to heavy corruptional cases . 
  all officials were close to the current government leading party ( fidesz , orb\u00e1n ) . 
  what will happen is they will keep on saying stupid shit about internet and taxing and in a month they obviously will backpedal from it so meanwhile people forget this usa incident while fighting with police ... because internet tax pisses off everyone ... except police since they get the raise from it . . what a coincidence . 
  actually probably the government just wants to deter attention from a big recent scandal where usa banned several officials from entering the country due to heavy corruption . 
  and banned officials were very close to fidesz ( current governing party with 2/3 lead ), 
  sweden , norway has around 90 % turnout . 
  west countries like germany austria has i think more than 80 too, 
  there are no better possibilities , others are lying even more and sold the whole country , there were many surfaced talks they had with eachother how they constantly lie to the people and falsify the budget . 
  then we have another party who is getting more popular because the people are desperate . 
  a nazi party . 
  so choose from this 3 , good luck . 
  there are other small parties but people dont even hear from them because orb\u00e1n made it so hard for new parties to emerge with many regulations and fully controlling media . 
  and honestly the only reason orb\u00e1n still got more votes , is because hungarians from serbia/romania voted for him since they got hungarian citizenship due to him ( for the sole purpose of getting votes , but nonetheless i support that decision of his ) and he always supported people working abroad , so most of the people from london ( 200.000 hungarian ) voted for him . 
  all these hungarians outside the border more than 90 % of the voters voted for orb\u00e1n as i heard . 
  edit : oh and there was a joke-like party mkkp , who might have had a huge voter base , but for some mysterious reason the court did n't allow them to be a party because their name does n't represent their political view and aims . 
  it went to the supreme court or maybe european court i dont know , but in the end the name was obviously allowed , but it was too late and the elections were over . 
  wow this image is brilliant !, 
  im not sure you put much thought into that `` false dilemma '' of yours . 
  you 're = / = your . 
  i guess you read bible in its original language since without knowing differences between your and you 're you did n't really understand any of it did you ? 
  do you still think he lives in the sky ? 
  watching you mastrubate furiously over tittybangbang porn while you are fisting yourself ? 
  i like how you think i sound 12 with your name tittybangbang :d this is the most teeny virgin name ive ever seen . 
  good luck in future , at least if you are dumb you are virgin too ... which is a compliment for someone believing in bible . . 
  i dont understand anything you said . 
  i could n't find one logical explanation how what you said even remotely connected to what i said . 
  dude you are the worst troll ever , your arguments are weaker than god 's sanctity after he fucked virgin mary . 
   `` yes i do think most wars in history were made by logical choices '' lol hilarious , maybe you should read some history/scientific books instead of reading the bible over and over . 
  after this sentence your credibility dropped so much , that the only way of it coming back is if i now become religious and successfully pray it back for you . 
  dude , i dont even know where to start . 
  most wars start as a glorious idea for the rulers , that they will rule all people in their name , or to carve their name to history . 
  so they manipulate people into it for this emotional reason . 
  for like thousands of years this was the sole reason for wars . 
  other reason is when companies see more profit in war or coupdetat , there are so many instances in the past 200 hundred years that i have no room to write it for you ... but like here is one , i dont dare to give you many sources because you might realize along the way that it is not the bible and you wo n't read any of it : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1954_guatemalan_coup_d'%c3%a9tat  no idea what you mean here , i am pretty safe living in the uk if that 's what you mean ... :d thats what im talking about , of course you have `` no idea what i mean '' , if you had , maybe you would know that hitler did n't have any logical reasons to start the war aside from his white power superiority complex ... which is more like an emotional reason . 
  :d :d :d :d ... so plenty of people expected it then , but now when poland expects it , suddenly it does n't matter because attacking the whole world as germany did is not logical . 
  what are you on , are you high or something ? 
  you contradict yourself on 3 fronts . 
  do you think any war in history was made by logical choices ? 
  actually some of them was , but most was pure manipulation by people who profited from it , or it was from pure emotion of the leaders . 
  oh and dont worry about putin , he will be safe in his bunker while 95 % of population dies . 
  just like every war before ... wonder why the children of these leaders somehow never die in wars ? 
  just because you want to live safe and be naive in your little first world bubble , does n't mean you should completely shut your eyes and give yourself up to your god and let it happen what he wishes . 
   i agree with their governments . 
  except the part where they think they would be attacked , it wo n't happen ... they 'll mess around economically but that is all . 
  you did n't read much about how hitler attacked poland did you ? 
  nobody expected it , and all started like how it is starting now with russia , `` peaceful '' but aggressive politics . 
  and you saying russia has no chance in water or air etc. . wtf ? 
  they have like 1000 nukes , there is no way the war will be conventional until the end , they will all drop nukes and in 1 hour half the world would die . 
  yes , actually it is fucking shameful , just like some years ago maybe you remember the case [ where an armenian was killed on daylight ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-19463968 ) and hungary of course gave the terrorist back to his country where he got pardoned . 
  it is just hungary made many deals with russia , most recent is the nuclear power plant built by russians for the next like 10 years it takes . 
  so yeah politicians as corrupt as they are , dont care about others just themselves , and for politicians to get more money in their pockets . 
  you can argue , both decision is politically correct from purely hungary 's point of view , since we had trade relationship with azerbaijan , not with armenia . 
  we have better trade relations with russia , not with ukraine ... still it is fucking shameful , whole country is run by criminals so the only thing they see is profit . 
  i see , i was probably wrong in some of my accusations , but i feel like you are trying to convince me why voting yes is good . 
  i never said it is wrong to vote yes , i do n't know at all which is good for scotland , but from the things you said , voting yes seems pretty logical . 
  yet my problem was with how salmond presented that choice , not with what he represented . 
  you had sound reasoning behind what you said , that uk is right wing and scotland is left wing . 
  uk wants nuclear weapons , scotland does n't . 
  this is all there is to it in every topic , but salmond was never really arguing about this but rather about emotion manipulation , let me respond to some things you said in regards to this :  tax on empty bedrooms , introduced by the uk government . 
  the scottish people and government thought it was unfair on the poor who are often assigned houses with more rooms than they might use . 
  well , tax on empty bedrooms really mostly tax the richer people , the poor who have bigger assigned houses are probably very few , and this could be easily changed within the uk system , if someone wants a smaller house he can change it with other who wanted a bigger house , i dont remember anytime in the history when somebody wanted less and he did n't get it . 
  problem is when you want more , not less . 
  so it is strange to me this is a problem to begin with . 
  but basic political tactic is to always talk about every type of tax you can find , tax is the best way to convince people as a politician during a time of peace to vote for you . 
  most political parties say they will decrease a tax ( for example eliminate the empty bedroom tax , or give more welfare money ) but of course with this the state loses money , these taxes were n't introduced ( most of the time ) just for fun or for politicians to get more money in their pockets . 
  every politician knows if you make a new tax , people will hate you . 
  so they try to avoid increasing tax as they avoid fire . 
  so introducing any new tax or increasing income tax is only done if the state needs money for something . 
  so back to the point , many politicians say they eliminate/decrease said tax , and they will keep their promise to not seem 2faced , but soon new taxes with different names will come , because they somehow will have to solve the now deficit in the budget . 
  maybe he will give more welfare and delete empty bedroom tax but will make a new tax for people with cars , and we could again hear reasoning that this law is bad for poor people who are assigned cars etc. 
  taxes are there for a purpose , it is used to build the country and pay people working for the state so it actually gets back to people . 
  ( even if a politican would steal 10million euros from it , that is such a small number compared to yearly budget that it wo n't be even the 0,1 % of budget and will be unnoticed ) . 
  what im trying to say is , saying that taxes need to be decreased or eliminated is pure political trickery , if you want a different approach to it you should say from where you want to make the money for it . 
  here at least he said that the money will come from trident , but he did n't say he would use the money from it to solve the deficit from taxes , but rather said it is to use it for poor children and disableds . 
  i do n't know the numbers since they never really talk about it ( or maybe they did in the full debate ) , but changing seemingly little things about taxes result in billions . 
  but nonetheless this is an actual point he makes that he wants to stop trident . 
  ( problem is , public safety probably should n't be up for vote and the way should be chosen by military professionals . 
  but of course i do n't know anything about this matter , but seeing russia 's behaviour about ukraine , maybe this is not the best time to demilitarize . 
  weapons are not for only attacking other nations , but rather as a deterrent to not get attacked randomly )  0:45 i do n't know how familiar you are with the campaigns , but the opposite side has been saying that oil revenues were too unstable to be relied upon or counted upon . 
  i dont know who is right but does n't matter , he still on purpose exaggerated . 
  not to mention things like these should be not debatable , this could be proved by professionals in the field if there really is oil shortage or not , economic things should never be put up to a vote , but decided by skilled people . 
  only basic policies could be voted , like environmental friendliness etc. 
   in the full debate , a few minutes earlier he gets to speak on oil a little . 
  making the case that norway has 20 % of it 's gdp as oil revenue , scotland would have 15 % , so unless people consider norway unstable , scotland could n't be either . 
  again these things should not be debatable , 1 wrong does n't make 2 right . 
  these should be proved by data and not `` common sense '' . 
  and there could be a million difference between these 2 countries as to why it is more liability for scotland and not for norway . 
  i dont know if any parties showed data about their choice , but they should . 
  and until they do , talking about is only trying to make the other look dumb , which is again not a honest direct way of politics , but manipulation . 
   what the snp propose is that we accept some debt for a proportional amount of the national assets seems fair , i completely agree , but things are usually more complicated , i would probably need to hear the other side 's argument , because there could be many scenarios theoretically where it does n't work like that from pure materialistic perspective . 
  for example ( this is total fiction ) uk borrowed a lot of money so in 4 years they can invest in scotland farmlands because it is perfect place for it , and in 15 years the money could be paid back . 
  now if scotland gets autonomy before they even start to build farmlands , yet they already borrowed the money , they are in a shitty situation especially if they made some prearrangements in contracts/spendings , with this , scotland has no asset so he would n't have to pay any debt , yet it does n't seem fair does it if he does n't help paying back the money ? 
   4:20 : hospitals being mentioned are due to cost cutting in england . 
  scotland 's budget is decided in part by how much england spends on hospitals , so if they spend less , we have less to spend on our own services . 
  i dont know the situation but my problem was that he was accused of lying publicly about it , yet he just laughed it off , sadly we ca n't see his response , but seemed like there is no real response to that , because when you actually accuse someone of lying publicly , you have to have proofs else you could go to court for defamation . 
  ( as far as i know , but maybe scottish laws are different )  6:00 he 's talking about how the opposition are spending a lot on nuclear weapons when we as a country have rising child poverty rates . 
  well , i do n't even understand the concept of his , how can a child be poor , every child is poor until they start working . 
  but nonetheless , uk policy is of course the same as scotland 's would be in that regard , that they would n't allow death by hunger . 
  every democratic country in europe will try to solve things like that , so phrasing it like this is just exaggeration again .

  the western part of romania that 's not de jure transylvania ( arad , oradea , satu mare , and their general area . ), 
  talking about flairs , your has a typo in it, 
  because muh nationalism , muh centralized nationstates . 
  in other words , people live in the mid-19th century, 
  partium has quite a few hungarians too, 
  applicable to a region of a country too - hungarians in szeklerland do not have the right to fuck with romanian , and not the other way round either, 
  no , that 's called the `` tyranny of the majority '' which is n't good either, 
  [ fyi ] ( http://www.voxeurop.eu/files/images/article/hungary-diaspora-a.png?1244128431 ), 
  because as we all know , hatred and violence solves anything / s, 
  for some reason nowadays the snow always comes in february or even march, 
  sure , if you have the right attitude to it and the intelligence for it , its ok to read it . 
  but most people are stupid , especially as teenagers . 
  i think we are overestimating the reasoning skills of teenagers . 
  ( in general , im not saying everyone of them is too immature to read it , but a fair chunk ) . 
  and yes , jobbik says hi . 
  do you think the neonazi teenagers who support jobbik would reevaluate their beliefs if they read mein kampf ? 
  i dont think so, 
  i know , but look at all the words ending in - ism . 
  they make up a pretty pattern , except for the word feminism ( in the minds of extreme feminists , it does follow the pattern , for normal feminists it doesnt ) . 
  it would be more sensible to just call it a branch of egalitarianism , which would be much more descriptive of what it stands for , and wouldnt be so confusing for many . 
  much shittier , too though . 
  unless you have a hard on for soviet architecture , you shouldnt go there as a tourist, 
  they should also read mein kampf so they see all the different opinions , amirite, 
  how about not giving them fucking books at all ? 
  ( aside from the occasional old ass literature , i 'm all for sleeping in class , but giving teenagers books about * this * is fucking disgusting ), 
   modern feminism = stalinism you may need to brush up your english bro . 
  he says that giving teenagers books about ideologies = stalinism , and tbh i have to agree with him on that, 
  `` the sultan and the bear : kinky times '', 
  and that , is why you do n't list all forms of anything in finno-ugric languages . 
  similar things happened in hungarian , except much earlier , and there are not many records of it anymore . 
  for example old hungarian * utu rea * ( utu = road , rea/re \u00e1 = onto sth ) -  \u00fatra, 
  except when the suffixes are used on their own , but they are always conjugated for the subject : ** nek ** em , ** nek ** ed , ** nek ** i etc. 
  i wonder how confusing that is for a non-native, 
  i know that feel bro, 
  for jobbik - yes it is antisemite , for the rest , no . 
  jobbik likes to deny the holocaust and basically every atrocity hungary has been part of, 
  mentioning gy\u00f6zike being on the level of pet\u00f6fi is , to say , questionable, 
  because these guys are retards, 
  i 've thought about it too , actually , the danubian federation wouldve been an amazing thing , but it wouldve been dismantled after ww1 anyway . 
  yeah , i dont think anyone was afraid of the revenge of romania or hungary, 
  i was talking about magyarization , but that 's right as well : fighting against hungarians in their war for independence isnt a good point in relations either, 
  i mean the war reparations . 
  they were forgiven for germany because they were judged to be too harsh a penalty . 
  you are now under arrest at the order of ~ ~ sultan ~ ~ president erdogan, 
   hungary is ruled by blatant anti-semites . 
  no , no . 
  hungary has a bit of self-hate from the holocaust ( not nearly as much as germany , but still a little ) , and as such usually is n't against jews, 
  as seen in many town names : oradea - nagy ** v\u00e1rad ** ; sighisoara - seges ** v\u00e1r ** ; hunedoara - hunyad ** v\u00e1ra ** etc, 
  no , hungary is a different country which * happened to * have the same monarch , atleast since 1867 it is, 
  i thought that was a traditional hungarian thing , called the * citera *, 
   i 'm romanian . 
  flair up then  also , i thought the unification of moldva and wallachia was the formation of romania, 
  these people make me sick in my stomach , honestly . 
  they are so radical it 's terrifying , they 'd tell any hungarian ( including myself ) that they 're not hungarian enough . . 
  i 'm glad they were arrested , and hope they get many years in prison, 
  also inspiring ass poems ( pet\u0151fi 2 required ), 
  nothing , they 're just bored ass neonazis, 
  this is not the birthday of romania . . this is the unification with/conquest of transylvania, 
  happy unification day guys ... ^ ( gib ^ northern ^ transylvania ^ / s ), 
   hungarians definitely remember i 'm sorry to tell you this but hungarians remember the day of trianon ( june 4 ) and not the romanian unification day . 
   ruled by the very people we hate this hate stems from the 19th century oppressive hungarian regime , before that this hate did n't really exist . 
   we 've been decent stewards of transylvania cough ceausescu cough ( though i agree with you on it in general , but dont forget the guy ), 
  i expected a picture of horthy . 
  tbh versailles * was * revised . 
  trianon was n't . 
  holy shit hungary is better than france and finland . 
  unexpected, 
  please no budapest !, 
  stop sucking the taxpayer money . 
  instead build motorways or something, 
   implying he doesnt do that already, 
  well , obviously . 
  had one language spread so far in the past it would break up into many smaller languages ; see latin for example, 
  idk where you got that from , overusing national flags is still a pretty rightist thing , no one i know has one in their house, 
  wish i could draw , i got so many ideas - paprika , pre-trianon map on the wall , picture of mr horthy too , \u00c1rp\u00e1d-striped everything , tshirt with a huge turul on it, 
  i 'm afraid that it wo n't be true . 
  `` strong '' with a thick eastern eurooean accent, 
   this is virtually unheard of this exists in my hometown , a whole neighborhood is basically this, 
   the first soviet republic in europe ( hungary ) . 
  it 's not like that thing was anything permanent . 
  yeah , although in the 1990s there was a big inflation ( though in romania it was worse , if i recall correctly ) . 
  still , a permanent solution would be much better . 
  where ? 
  they are going to come back no matter where you put them . 
  well , you know . 
  if you 're gon na introduce a new currency , make it new and shiny :p, 
  tho i suppose it 's much more possible to live out of that in romania than in western countries ( not saying that 100eu is an acceptable wage whatsoever ), 
  `` dae eastern europe is literally a shithole and money doesnt exist lolol western masterrace '', 
  til it 's actually called * leu * in singular . 
  we in hungary refer to it as `` rom\u00e1n lej '' , so i thought it was actually * lei *, 
  as i said : fucked up stuff ( btw i didnt downvote you i dont know why ppl did that here ), 
  thats some pretty fucked up stuff, 
  `` yeah , stop blaming the poor multimillionaire company , they did nothing wrong by avoiding having to give up part of their income for the common good '',

   do n't upvote you do n't tell me what to do, 
  kinda applicable to all extreme nationalist groups, 
  i think the beginning of the end for daesh started at this point .

  chronic diseases put one into a class of disability so that they do n't need to worry about insurance . 
  so yes , on average , everybody is better off - but if you seek a non approved treatment ( too expensive ) you are on your own . 
  ( i guess this is why i kept hearing of death panels in context of obamacare ) - the ethical question is real : should we pay 100k eur to extend someone 's life with one month ( in pain ) or pay for 10 other people 's treatment . 
   doubt it about the us us - due to your flair . 
  as for the rest - hugely thanks - few more questions . 
   60 months of benefits in their lifetime you sure it 's their lifetime ??? 
  in most europe if you contribute for a while you are eligible to welfare for another while . 
  ( something akin work 6 months , 12 months on welfare , repeat ) . 
   the law also requires recipients to find a job within 24 months of first receiving benefits in hungary the government mandates all unemployed to do `` community work '' . 
  while this is n't helping them much with new skills or reintegration the grass on the side of highways is well trimmed . 
  one final question : who covers for the health of all this people you mention ? 
  i seriously doubt that a person will not commit suicide because it 's illegal or they are afraid they will get punished  but then hey , ( quote from memory ) - 70 % of suicide attempts are desperate attention seeking . 
   it 's too expensive to move to another city or they have no family to help them get the money to move to a location where there 's jobs to be found ? 
  nope . 
  they work a bit on the black market on the side of benefits and they are better off . 
   not all people in a shitty situation want to be on the dole ... ca n't agree more . 
  thanks for your answer - it 's always better to speak with real people and understand how they think than reading self proclaimed annalists opinions - that 's why i love reddit . 
   a substantial proportion of the leave voters are retired , retiring or comfortably well off - when we said reduced immigration , we meant reduced immigration this makes no sense . 
  retirees are not to be impacted about polish plumbers . 
   after it became apparent the eu would not take steps to enforce external borders why again ? 
  uk is not in schengen , you even had an opt out from mandatory redistribution , if anyone was impacted that was germany and sweden !, 
   to many of us a freedom from the problems related to the ongoing illegal migration again , today ( with uk in eu ) you have full control of your borders wrt illegal migration . 
  how is being in or out going to change that ? 
   and are n't much troubled by the direction of the ftse 250 finally someone who knows what ftse 250 is instead bringing the ftse 100 as an argument  huge thanks again for your reply , looks like it 's coming from your heart . 
  ( i disagree but i 'll always appreciate brutal honesty over polite hypocrisy ), 
  i 'm lost . 
  is there a country where suicide is illegal ? 
  i mean what are they going to do to suicidal people ? 
  execute them ? 
   it 's ok to withdraw drugs from general population because in the age of internet everyone is a m.d. 
  and will just make the bacteria resistance worse .

  admins made it so that maga posts from the_donald do n't reach / r/all anymore . 
  as a side result we have much more porn on / r/all ( that 's good ) but also / r/all is changing much slower ( that 's boring - i used to browse / r/all like hourly , now it 's the same thing again and again ) . 
   european immigrants in the uk often do speak english and have a network of contacts through their immigrant community . 
  no offence , but the probability of polish plumbers speaking english is not much higher than the probability of us plumbers speaking french !, 
   that 's the more common situation in the us at any rate doubt it ( a bit ) . 
  generally speaking benefits in eu are way higher than anyway in the states . 
   there are only so many jobs , and many people ca n't afford university tuition rates for a degree that would still mean an uncertain employment future . 
  you are fully right . 
  but we are n't talking of people who want to go to college . 
  in my country we have people who prefer to live on unemployment benefits ( ~ 200 usd ) rather than go to the neighboring village and work for the minimal wage . 
  ( ~ 300 usd ) per month . 
  do n't get me wrong . 
  i am not some uber-neo-liberal claiming that there should be no social protection but those people do exist . 
   they are n't willing to help their employer break the law every day so that they can be exploited . 
  agree . 
  it should be the responsibility of uk or any eu country to make it damn hard to hire someone illegally . 
  germany , france and even my country ( hungary ) did it - there is a true story of an old hungarian lady whom hired someone to dig some ground and she got ratted by neighbors resulting in a huge fine ( by hungarian standards ) . 
   that they made a bad decision not disagreeing , but even if the decision is bad is their right to chose so * . 
  seriously , the faster we admit it happened , the better for everyone . 
  * based on the absolute most basic human right : the right to do stupid things on my own will !, 
   often , but not always , they will be experienced and confident in their abilities actually would n't say they are much more skilled . 
  but they are certainly more flexible , more willing to learn and more willing to relocate . 
  you know there are all this stories of uk 's `` rust belt '' . 
  those jobs are not coming back !, 
  but some people prefer to live on welfare rather than switch location . 
  as louis ck said it ( quote from memory ) : if a person who does n't speak your language , has no informal network , takes your job then the problem is probably with you . 
  also as a reply to / u/slyscorpion : due to the recent changes in algorithm , it 's easier for posts from / r/europe to reach / r/all - so in some cases they will get much more exposure and upvotes . 
  tldr ; comparing upvotes does n't say much . 
   he would always show up late , was hard to reach by phone , and made mistakes . 
  damn , you sure he was english ? 
  sounds like my last hungarian painter . 
  ( i live in hungary btw ) . 
   for example maybe erdogan loses and merkel decides to reward the new government with full membership in order to cement it 's position . 
  huh ? 
  you do realize that has to be approved by 27 other states . 
  not to speak that turkey is nowhere wrt implementation of the acquis . 
  thanks , feels irrationally good although i never worked in constructions and i would definitely suck in such a job , 
  let 's agree to disagree . 
  the difference is that 40 years ago ** all ** neighbors in the building hated each other , now it 's only 2 or 3 . 
  germany would n't annex anything since as you mentioned , they control it ... 
   they `` steal '' their jobs and drop the salaries ( black labor ) . 
  yes , but is n't then a problem with regulations ? 
  if i remember well , first waves of romanian immigration ( even before they joined eu ) went mostly to france and germany . 
  after france and germany introduced tough penalties against black labor the flow moved to spain and italy ( which also had the construction sector booming at the time ) . 
  sorry , it 's a bit unclear which ones are better in your opinion ? 
  poles or brits ? 
  if schauble will be in charge of negotiations , uk will go full metric by next year , schengen by 2017 and might be allowed to adopt eur by 2020 but only if the queen asks nicely < - satire . 
   no it was n't angie 's fault . 
  i disagree with merkel 's stance on immigration and i agree with orban . 
  this being said i could not agree more with you . 
  like it was said in many analysis , when brits said `` we do n't want immigrants '' they actually say : `` we want good jobs '' . 
  should migration wave not happened in continental europe last summer bojo & farage would had just found a different scarecrow . 
  all linked together with the huge bs myths about evil eu trying to forbid this or that . 
  and curly bananas !, 
  and last but not least , it was the brits themselves who voted . 
  not merkel or orban !, 
  claiming that they got fooled is basically an elitist assault on democracy . 
   is it primarily because of eu ? 
  it is because people intermingle ( i think this is the right word ) with their neighbors more than ever due to schengen and eu . 
  we have gazilions of erasmus families - young students , he 's from poland , she 's from portugal and they live in holland . 
  once you get to know your neighbors at a personal level ( i.e. 
  meet them ) demonization/antagonization becomes next to impossible . 
  can you imagine germany invading any of it 's neighbors ? 
  me neither !, 
  so yes , as long as we 're in eu and schengen it will be inconceivable for the general population to even consider a war against any of our neighbors . 
   romania is not eastern europe . 
  i hate to be that guy but can we stop beating this bush around ?

  `` dividing territories , an agreement by two companies to stay out of each other 's way and reduce competition in the agreed-upon territories . '', 
  the wages will go up , and it will generate inflation , just like here , where there is a shortage of everything .

  plus version , of course . 
  this guy says the ukrainian are attacking in donetsk . 
  i 'm confused .

  they did not cheat for selling less cars . 
  silly survey . 
  let 's see how many soap/capita each country consumes . 
  but i heard cold water was a good solvent for sticky things . 
  then why are there millions of turks in germany ? 
  oh just use lego . 
  if a block is too cheap , stick two together . 
  you got ta have added value , that 's where the big money is . 
  how does a satellite know when a clock is not giving the correct time ? 
  there are backups , but if only two are left , there is no way to `` vote '' them . 
  fools , everything belongs to the queen . 
  there are probably hundreds of cases like this under way , check back in ten years . 
  every web site i 've seen in the last 20 years automatically uses cookies . 
  they should have made those pop up a warning which do n't . 
  and here we are , the pound is weaker than at that time . 
  do they travel six times more ? 
  title is ambiguous . 
  37 % in the uk . 
  how could anyone from macedonia serve tea to erdogan ? 
  that 's a given . 
  red star . 
  the commies are back . 
  poland and sweden are not facing front ... it makes you think how few portraits they used . 
  still cheaper than hungarian highways . 
  if it comes to ww3 , the usa will lose . 
  that was my logic . 
  nothing more . 
  we are always on the wrong side of history . 
  now we are with trump . 
  but mo ' customers , mo ' money . 
  and do n't even think about getting back in the eu until you have better 4g than romania !, 
  i lived about 50 % my life sleeping during the day , it 's a myth . 
  i bet he wo n't run through eastern europe . 
  that 's an insult to the union !, 
  i am pretty sure it should be higher than 1.0 in hungary , primary may be one , but high schools teach two languages . 
  direct result of internet porn !!!, 
  no wonder they want to censor the porn . 
  dirty pigs . 
  same three days when north korea marches into the united states . 
  and on the balkan , too !, 
  they took our jobs !, 
  the honor system is and has always been in effect on public transportation of budapest . 
  you do n't want to cheat a poor company do you . 
  that 's like asking about the story in a badly written movie . 
  the author never finished it , okay ? 
  yes , western europe should be less greedy . 
  lower the wages . 
  eastern europe just needs to wait 20 years and all the old people who make up most of the population and was born after the ww2 will die .

now the cable companies slowly start to provide dual dubbed movies sometimes , so we can choose which one would we prefer . 
  slowly but at least there is a possibility for it sometimes . 
  yup , every movie and series is dubbed here . 
  we are so proud of it , because the hungarian dub industry was really good 10 + years ago and it really was but not anymore ( that is my opinion of course ) . 
  great education happened . 
  edit . 
  : everyone learns languages in the primary and high school but the classes are not so good for practical skills . 
  lot of words and grammar but the lack of practice does not help at all . 
  for the students the language is the necessary bad . 
  everyone need the language exams for the college degree so they learns for the exam . 
  of course they do n't like it . 
  that is what i saw . 
  my english sucks also . 
  i shall meet with them in september in dresden . 
  maybe they can bring some for the cultural evening of the project . 
  thanks for the tip !, 
  this year i tried \u0160akotis , and i liked it . 
  also the shape . 
  i will ask my friend to bring some skruzd\u0117lynas next time . 
  possible and logical . 
  highway is where the speed is needed . 
  i did not see any audi police car so far . 
  if you discuss that topic with intelligent people then it is fine . 
  but some of us can get really `` excited '' about that . 
  in a bad way . 
  it is a road in the downtown filled with expensive shops . 
  tourist bait . 
  the other is just a long road to the north part of the city as you said . 
  anytime my friend . 
  the toast is pir\u00edt\u00f3skeny\u00e9r . 
  yeah . 
  and the sewing machine is the varr\u00f3g\u00e9p . 
  i love you too : hug :, 
  hmm . 
  makes more sense actually . 
  wow , we hate them so much apparently . 
  ( hungary ), 
  which is the 9th symphony of beethoven . 
  nice subliminal message by the way . 
  edit : part of the 9th to be precise . 
  and tears in my eyes . 
  i want to go to a 9th symphony as hell . 
  10-15 years ago it was great . 
  they did many good workaround on puns and actually made them better . 
  i really like to watch classic comedies with hungarian dub ( leslie nielsen movies for example ) but not anymore , word by word translation or cringeworthy versions . 
  i prefer the originals nowadays . 
  i was not there in the past few years but to be honest i think the situation is still the same . 
  i can not answer for the estonian park but we too have one in hungary . 
  it is basically the same . 
  we gathered a bunch of old statues from the communist era to a park . 
  http://hu.wikipedia.org/wiki/memento_park ( hungarian but with more photos ) http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/memento_park http://www.mementopark.hu/, 
  as a hungarian , i never heard about grabanc ipa . 
  i will taste it if i have the chance . 
  yup , bike is the best solution in budapest . 
  lets drink together friend , 
  wow , that video is evil and great . 
  i would like to watch it numerous times , just to watch different countries each time . 
  it would be hours . 
  believe me many hungarians are butthurt about transylvania as well . 
  i am totally fine with the actual situation . 
  the famous dacia ( we had a lot in hungary in the 80 's ) . 
  beautiful landscapes and mountains . 
  perfect for hiking . 
  spent weeks there , one of the best experiences in my life . 
  butthurt lot of time ( literally ) to travel to travel by train from hungary to the sea . 
  manele music ( sorry , the modern one is terrible ) . 
  red lake ( lacul ro\u0219u ) . 
  technically there are a lot of hungarians because transylvania was part of hungary until the world wars . 
  edit : downvote hammer as i see . 
  i did not want to say anything offense , and i am sure i did not write well what i wanted to say . 
  i just wanted to say if you check some cities in transylvania ( satu mare , t\u00e2rgu mure\u0219 ) you can see their 33 % of the population is hungarian . 
  it is more then `` some '' . 
  i do n't know its reason . 
  i recently bought a race bicycle in decent condition for city use for $ 100 and spent roughly $ 80 for the necessary accessories ( a good lock , a cheap lock ( for the front wheel ) , some cheap lights , prism reflectors ) . 
  constitution is the word what i searched for . 
  thanks !, 
  yup , they are just playing with these things like nothing matters . 
  strange feelings . 
  the situation in hungary is truly shit but i do n't think because of fasism and anti-semitism . 
  yes , there is some problem with that here but far from the situation what the article wrote . 
  i chuckled on the `` neo-nazi '' jobbik . 
  they are mindless radical , but fortunately not so much people agree with them . 
  the main problem is the corruption and the total power what our minister want to achieve ( or already had ) . 
  the leading party changed the basic laws and did everything to make the next election succesful for themself . 
  every single big project in hungary is about to give money to someone who is close to the leading party . 
  we built bridges and tunnels on flat surfaces on highways for millions of euro , renovating bridges for the price of a new one , building football stadiums to the countryside where noone wants to see football ( to the home village of the minister ) and the list is long . 
  they spend incredible amount of money to keep rich their neightbour and the unemployment high , the prices are the same like in western europe but the salaries are much less ( around $ 2.2 / h ) . 
  the hospitals are in trouble ( sometimes they do n't have money for sterile needles and the doctors are underpaided ) . 
  i think that is why the minor anti-semitism here because many people believes the jews are the invisible enemy behind the government who controlling them and leech the money . 
  but you can see traditional jews walking on the street in the usual outfit and noone harms them . 
  they are just a symbol of the situation , like the national tobacco shops ( which was an other big rip-off lately ) . 
  ( wow , wall of text , sorry about that ), 
  wow , you are torturing yourself for our country . 
  not at all . 
  and originally it was `` only '' 15 years . 
  now 30 , and they are going to spend millions more because of that . 
  no problem , we have great economy , few millions wo n't matter ... / s, 
  according to the wikipedia all these 3 are one of the meanings of the toth . 
   t\u00f3th ( sometimes toth ) is a very common surname in hungary , meaning `` slav '' and later `` slovak '' in old hungarian ( now spelt t\u00f3t ) . 
   it can also mean `` croat '' , since one of the hungarian names for slavonia ( the northern part of croatia , bordering to hungary ) was tothorszag ; although horv\u00e1th is the more usual contemporary formulation .

  that is my point . 
  being a distinct nation does n't mean they are unknown foreigners from faraway exotic lands . 
  it 's very hard to deport someone from germany if they are there and have a right for asylum . 
  you know , german constitution , eternity clause etc. 
  it 's even hard if they do n't have a right for asylum . 
  the only place to stop them is at the greek border . 
  i 'm pretty sure he does it as a kind of realpolitik . 
  just see what he said around 2007-2008 . 
  i think that was what he really thought and may still be thinking in the back of his mind . 
  his first government was totally pro-atlantic , pro-west , pro-nato , pro-eu etc. 
  i guess some facts and reports have changed his mind on what 's possible in the position of hungary . 
  as he recently said , we are historically in the germany-russia-turkey triangle and we have to navigate this system and avoid getting occupied or `` colonized '' . 
  it 's not really easy . 
  wtf ? 
  hungary has no claims whatsoever on any neighbors since the 1940s . 
  of course the 1848 revolutions and austria crushing it with russia in 1849 . 
  that was more than a 100 years back . 
  during the austria-hungary times , franz joseph i 's role was totally reinterpreted as a kind old figure and it was basically forgotten that he took part in crushing the 1848 revolution . 
  his wife , the queen consort elisabeth was a kind of celebrity and an admired woman . 
  there were a lot of germans living in hungary , buda-pest was a majority german city in the middle of the 19th century but it was still 15 % german in 1900 ( austrian was n't considered an ethnicity then ) . 
  the culture is inter-tangled with german-speaking culture . 
  see figures such as franz liszt . 
  see the huge amount of germanisms and calques in the hungarian language . 
  then hungary went through two world wars on the side of germany . 
  and you say hungarians were some far , unknown foreign aliens to germans/austrians ? 
  true , but i doubt most of the refugees were . 
  the kuk times after the 1867 compromise were among the most prosperous and peaceful parts of the austrian-hungarian coexistence and it 's basically seen as a golden age of modernization and development in hungarian history . 
  the coexistence of romanians , slovaks vs. hungarians is a very different issue and has nothing to do with this topic now . 
  no , because official application has limits and delays . 
  it means you have to stay in turkey and can not be sure when the limit is reached . 
  on the other hand , if you go to germany by yourself , you can be sure to get there . 
  we should create a big safe application camp in turkey and send any illegal migrants back there . 
  of course this needs turkey 's cooperation , which the eu would need to buy . 
  it 's not easy but europe must use its power in some way , the eu should n't be just the bitch of the world who just has to take it up all the way . 
  the eu is economically strong and should use its influence . 
  erm , what ? 
  just 38 years after the dissolution of austria-hungary , austria got culturally so far from hungary as germany from arab countries today ? 
  the `` large numbers '' is crucial too , along with the cultural difference . 
  14,000 christian central europeans in germany is very different than 1.5 million ( a * hundred * times more ! ), 
  middle eastern muslims . 
  if russia really seriously attacked ukrainian civilians , for example , then i 'd be all for letting a few thousand to hungary . 
  people still would n't like to have too many of them , but it would be much better accepted than people who attack and disregard police and riot their way through borders as far as they want . 
  edit : math, 
  that ca n't work . 
  there is automatically a preference , because if you `` just come '' then you are here . 
  if you wait there , you may or may not be allowed to come . 
  what we need is n't simply `` no preference to applications already in the eu '' , but the absolute impossibility to get asylum if they come illegally on their own , instead of going to the official application point in the turkish camp . 
  how did the revolutionaries turn communist in the mere 9 years of soviet occupation till 1956 ? 
  you mean they just hated r\u00e1kosi and stalin but they really liked the other parts of communism ? 
  not just western europe , though . 
  here are the highest numbers ( [ source ] ( http://www.natarch.hu/szemle/20023/soos.htm ) ) , as of june 30 , 1958 . 
  * usa 35,240 * canada 24,588 * austria 17,499 * germany 14,289 * switzerland 11,975 * france 10,237 * australia 9,663 * sweden 5,823 a big difference is that these hungarians waited for official permission in austria , did n't just force their way into their country of choice . 
  if they only got a place in argentina ( 915 ) or venezuela ( 677 ) or south africa ( 1315 ) then they started their new life there . 
  if someone was n't communist , then the '56 refugees from hungary . 
  it wo n't . 
  they all want to come now and not when europe potentially changes its mind about letting them in around spring . 
  they do n't swim in the sea , they use boats . 
  if you dress up warm enough , i do n't think your life is at risk . 
  they use ferry , trains , buses etc. 
  on most of their journey anyway . 
  it takes around a week to get to germany . 
  one week cold trip for a life in germany is a good deal for many . 
   we finally want a european solution for a european problem - and this fully according to the treaty on the functioning of the european union . 
  hungary would probably profit more than germany from such a solution what do you mean ? 
  what can hungary really do with its 0.7 % of the total eu gdp and about 1.4 % of eu population ? 
  do you think we can really contribute a lot ? 
  will it really make a difference whether we take 5,000 refugees ? 
  you are knocking on the wrong door . 
  try the uk . 
  they only want to take 20,000 over 5 years . 
  all this orban and jobbik thing is a ridiculously petty diversion of the real conversation about what the big countries should do and whether the borders should be protected or migrants indeed have the right to enter as they wish . 
  those are the real questions . 
  orban is a nobody on international level , he 's great for the role of the boogeyman for the media . 
  it 's ridiculous to think that a relatively poor country of less than 10 million is the important party in this crisis . 
  see , croatia is all pro-europe and pro-germany and pro-humanity in their rhetoric , and what does that do for them or for the eu ? 
  the migrants are still out in the cold and do n't have good supplies in croatia . 
  they still go to germany through croatia , and croatia wo n't be able to accommodate a significant portion of them anyway . 
  giving eastern europe a disproportionately high number of refugees ( the least skilled and most problematic ones ) plus some financial aid is surely the dream of western europe , but we will not allow that . 
  these are countries with a long history of oppressors and revolutions and we wo n't allow such a thing . 
  even if the west may crush us down like the soviets did , we will try to resist this . 
  the whole deal is about this . 
  we must act preemptively and stop any such effort in the beginnings or before . 
  that 's why it is absolutely important to channel the discussion to the important matter : border control . 
  see my other comment on article 31 . 
  that 's a decisive thing . 
  in hungary 's interpretation good cause and all this can be checked in a few hours in most cases by questioning things like whether they have applied for asylum in serbia , whether they are persecuted there for their race , ethnicity etc ( see art . 
  if they are n't persecuted by serbia , hungary does n't consider them refugees . 
  this is a central point in the legal argument , everything diverges from here depending on whether you agree with this or not . 
   directly is meant as without ending the flight = settling elsewhere before , and there is in addition the good cause . 
  i posted a quote from a comment here on the thread , other comments i read say about the same about this point . 
  this is an * extremely * important point . 
  if directly means not settling in a country in between , then you are right and germany really must accept every refugee from all around the world if they wish to live in germany . 
  `` the austrian high court has ruled art . 
  31 inapplicable to any refugee who has even transited through another country en route to austria . '',

  `` at the time it was drafted , this reference to article 1 meant that it applied only to events occurring before 1 january 1951 . 
  the ` coming directly ' phrase was inserted at the request of the french at a late stage because france was concerned that article 31 would apply to others who had no connection with the events occurring before january 1951 . 
  it is debatable how relevant the phrase is after the coming into force of the 1967 protocol which has removed this temporal limitation . '', 
  ( [ source ] ( http://eulawanalysis.blogspot.de/2014/07/penalising-refugees-when-should-cjeu.html ) ) this unclear phrasing seems to be a point of controversy . 
  in my interpretation , the clause is there to allow the fleeing refugee not to pay attention to the exact location of official border crossing points ( which may also be far away ) , when they are literally running for their lives and need to exit the country at the geometrically closest location to avoid having to spend any second longer than absolutely necessary in a country where their persecutors may find and kill them .

  sure , if you 're a naive anarchist , you do n't think that far , but these things have consequences down the road . 
  and i know it 's not the uber drivers protesting . 
  because they also do n't look too far ahead . 
  well , `` orsz\u00e1g '' alone simply means `` country '' ( independent sovereign state , like `` ausztria egy orsz\u00e1g . '', 
  = `` austria is a country . '' ) . 
  but it 's not `` country '' as in `` countryside '' , that would be `` vid\u00e9k '' . 
  for example the translation of the movie title `` no country for old men '' uses `` vid\u00e9k '' , not `` orsz\u00e1g '' because it does n't refer to a sovereign country , but simply a rural region . 
   so native speakers do n't know how the declension works if native speakers do n't know it , it 's not part of the language . 
   it 's just that there are n't other nouns with the same pattern as koko yes , many times in languages there are such outliers with no good analogous frequent words and in these cases native speakers feel uncertain themselves as to how they should say a certain form . 
  this is an interesting phenomenon to study , and it 's somewhat related to `` defective words '' where certain forms ( which would have a sensible meaning ) simply do n't exist ( for example there is no subjunctive-imperative form of `` hiccup '' in hungarian ) . 
  but the fact that dictionary authors chose one variant as the `` right one '' does n't mean anything further . 
  this is a philosophical difference between prescriptivism and descriptivism . 
  this simply means there is no solidified form for this type of declension ( btw . 
  conjugation is used for verbs ) , or that there is variation or that a change is happening . 
  there are such examples in every language . 
  from a descriptive , scientific point of view it really does n't matter what the dictionary editors and grammar book writers think ( often based on their own intuition , not based on actual data gathered from native speakers ) , what matters is how the native speakers use the language . 
  anyway , that 's the age of prescriptivist vs. descriptivist debate ( `` do rule books or native speakers define languages ? '' ), 
  that has been basically settled in science with descriptivism being the sensible approach . 
  not sure if you 're joking , but that does n't really happen . 
  maybe you 're comparing the formal written finnish language with the casual spoken version . 
  well , if montenegin , serbian , bosnian and croatian are all different languages , then sure , sz\u00e9kely could also be standardized to be a language of its own ( with things like `` es '' instead of `` is '' and other stuff ) . 
  or the szeged dialect could be also considered a separate language with all those \u00f6 's . 
  language vs. dialect is always politics . 
  but i never had any difficulty understanding it . 
  yeah , another nice point of connection . 
  we do n't use it in isolation , though . 
  it 's mostly part of `` kurva any\u00e1d '' , meaning `` your whore mother '' , a shortening of `` baszd meg a kurva any\u00e1d '' = `` fuck your whore mother '' , the other half of which `` baszd meg '' ( sometimes written `` bazmeg '' ) is also widespread in itself . 
  or `` kurva \u00e9letbe '' ( `` to the whore life '' ) . 
  or as an adjective in some more elaborate swearing sentence . 
  only if you 're a linguist . 
  there are a handful of similar words , but even cognates are severely distorted . 
  the two languages diverged around 4000 years ago ( hard to tell exactly ) . 
  for example `` mouse '' is `` hiiri '' in finnish and `` eg\u00e9r '' in hungarian , both are derived from the proto-finno-ugric '' * \u0161i\u014bere '' . 
  or tree is `` puu '' in finnish and `` fa '' in hungarian . 
  or hungarian '' \u00e9g '' ( sky ) is etymologically related to finnish `` s\u00e4\u00e4 '' ( weather ) . 
  we understand zero from finnish , nothing at all , not even the gist or even the topic . 
  some hungarians say it sounds vaguely similar to hungarian from far away , with enough background noise . 
  but that 's all . 
  so some laypeople say this is all bullshit , `` hiiri '' ca n't be related to `` eg\u00e9r '' and they come up with fringe theories of sumerian and etruscan or even japanese etc. 
  superficial correspondences . 
  also , in some circles the conspiracy theory still exists that hungarian is not uralic , that 's just a 19th century fabrication by austrians to destroy the national pride of hungarians with these fishy-smelling relatives , instead of glorious turkic or sumerian relatives . 
  needless to say , since finland became rich , most people are now perfectly fine with the association . 
  i like [ finlandia ] ( http://www.finlandia.com/assets/img/facebook/finlandia.jpg ) . 
  `` g\u00f6rd\u00fcl '' ( and `` g\u00f6rd\u00fcl\u00e9keny '' ) is more frequent . 
  also `` g\u00f6rg\u0151 '' for those wheel-like things . 
  and `` g\u00f6r\u00f6ngy '' . 
  and that 's what every language feels like to a hungarian who ca n't speak foreign languages . 
  for us the weird thing is to imagine someone speaking a language that 's similar but not identical to your own . 
  which is pretty normal for speakers of slavic , germanic and romance speakers , but we never get to experience that . 
  the closest languages to hungarian are hanti and mansi in siberia , but you still ca n't understand anything at all from them as a hungarian . 
  but that 's the state in the us . 
  referring to the country in the caucasus region , it 's pronounced `` georgia '' . 
  it has nothing to do with * grammar * . 
  grammar is stuff like conjugation ( e.g. 
  past tense ) , declension ( e.g. 
  accusative case ) , word order , use of prepositions , articles etc. 
  yeah , it 's pronounced the same , just written phonetically in the hungarian way . 
   how does you say https://youtu.be/p1efyyoxa4k?t=1m1s, 
  yeah , the budapest `` standard '' dialect does n't differentiate them , but most dialects do . 
  you mean sadistic . 
  it 's a good poem though . 
  [ here 's the folk metal cover of it by dalriada ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mi48-1qj0se ), 
  `` orsz\u00e1g '' is country , originally from '' \u00far '' ( `` lord '' ) + '' - s\u00e1g '' ( '' - ship '' , '' - ness '' ) , basically `` lordship '' . 
  `` land '' would be `` f\u00f6ld '' , for example `` thaif\u00f6ld '' is hungarian for `` thailand '' , also `` szv\u00e1zif\u00f6ld '' ( `` swasiland '' ) , `` lappf\u00f6ld '' ( `` lapland '' ) . 
  we also have the archaic word `` ol\u00e1h '' for `` romanian '' , from the same origin . 
  yeah it probably originally meant an `` unspecified romance language-speaker from around the region '' . 
  but vlach and olasz are cognates . 
  yeah , there are different levels of precision . 
  when meaning the uk , we often casually just say `` anglia '' . 
  a bit more correctly we say `` nagy-britannia '' . 
  the actual `` egyes\u00fclt kir\u00e1lys\u00e1g '' ( `` united kingdom '' ) is not so widespread and sounds like a too direct translation and a bit pretentious . 
  also , it may seem natural in english , but simply `` united kingdom '' skips the most important part , united kingdom of * what * ? 
  it 's like saying the `` people 's republic '' to mean china . 
  so saying uk in non-english languages seems to elevate the importance of the uk as a country , since it 's `` obvious '' that you mean it even when not naming it actually . 
  i feel the same with the us . 
  earlier it was always said like `` amerikai egyes\u00fclt \u00c1llamok '' ( `` american united states '' ) , but nowadays more and more just `` egyes\u00fclt \u00c1llamok '' . 
  it just just too intimate and close . 
  it 's unterstandable for americans to shorten it , but for european countries it seems too familiar . 
  yes , and it 's sometimes ( not really anymore today ) written phonetically in hungarian as `` velsz '' . 
  you could be `` belgaorsz\u00e1g '' ( belgian-country ) . 
  `` n\u00e9met '' ( `` german '' ) comes from a slavic language , compare slovak `` nemec '' , or polish `` niemiec '' ( also meaning `` german '' ) . 
  it originally means `` dumb '' / `` mute '' . 
  according to wiktionary , it may be etymologically related to english `` mute '' and german `` mummeln '' ( `` mumble '' ) , too . 
  `` olasz '' ( `` italian ) '' comes from slavic `` vlah '' , meaning `` romanian '' ( `` vlach '' ) . 
  i 'm not sure why it came to mean italian . 
  it 's old news , it 's like this since november i think . 
  yeah , but most native speakers do n't instinctively grammatically analyze what they say , they have a stream of speech in their heads and they transcribe that to text . 
  but it usually shows a lack of caring and that the person does n't read too many books ( unless the person has some mental condition , like dyslexia or similar ) . 
  but spelling is a totally different thing than the language itself . 
  even historically , writing itself is much much more recent than spoken language . 
  also , small children first learn to speak , they only learn to write in school . 
  written language is not their native language . 
  so everything that i said was about spoken language . 
  linguistics basically only studies and cares about spoken language . 
  spelling and orthography are much more arbitrary conventions with lots of historical baggage , there 's not much interesting to be studied and said about spelling . 
  there are basically no more migrants in hungary . 
  linguistically speaking , native speakers can not make consistent mistakes . 
  if they use a pattern consistently ( for example `` i 'm good '' instead of `` well '' ) , it means that the language contains this pattern . 
  there are no other criteria for correctness in any language other than how the native speakers speak . 
  languages change .

  sorry , i was n't trying to be rude , i 'm really sick , tired and a monster right now . 
  a statue for soldiers who fought for their country , including hungarians , italians , russians because its a ww1 statue , and your goddamn kin aswell . 
  edit : plus civilians who died , and soviet soldiers in the same location . 
  things always have two sides , its not a soviet statue . 
  people just do n't give a fuck . 
  we always have to choose a side , we are tired of it . 
  you want to know how well we choose sides ? 
  there is ww1 and ww2 for you . 
  and my opinion about this : i ca n't take any more anti-russian propaganda . 
  every single online news site lies , throws the anti-russian , anti-putin , anti-everything articles , and to be honest , i 'm fucking sick of this . 
  i do n't care about russia , and i think the `` others '' have just the same and bad propaganda as they do . 
  there is no good and bad in this situation , and if `` russia wants to make a neo-ottoman axis and destroy europe '' ( lol ) , then go ahead , just ... leave us out . 
  i know they probably would n't , but i will most likely not live to the day something similar happens . 
  also keep in mind , we are not pro-russian . 
  orb\u00e1n is . 
  well he is n't really , he is just marked . 
  just as the pre-ww2 government , they were slowly drifting to a side , and when they realise what is going on , they could n't stop it anymore . 
  the present administration of the us had no big things to decide about yet . 
  you simply just ca n't call it untrustworthy , because its trump , because the mainstream media says he licks putin balls . 
  i think we should wait and see before telling everyone how much the us sucks . 
  oh my god really ? 
  neo-ottoman axis and war against eu ? 
  sounds like a good science fiction to me . 
  first is first , why the hell would those three fight on the same side , whom against , and would they really help russia in an offensive war ? 
  against the eu ? 
  what would they claim ? 
  switzerland ? 
  ceuta ? 
  do n't get me wrong , everybody can see the threat of the west and russia getting against , but it would n't make any sense . 
  there are so many wrong points in your sentences , it just ca n't be possible . 
   you should kiss american 's feet the britts were there too , and the us had no word in the percentages agreement between churchill and stalin . 
  its not just the americans , right ? 
   the uk was the one who tried defending greece in ww2 aswell , and after the threat was no longer there , the su could n't give them the freedom we gained . 
  only some pubs `` allow '' smoking in bp , but the charge is very expensive if the get caught . 
  the good thing is that in restaurants people ca n't smoke , not that it was that common , but still it is a good thing . 
  technically russia did n't even collapse in 1991 . 
  russia is unified though . 
  what you are thinking about is the soviet union , dear lad . 
  russia was an ssr , not the whole , to be fair . 
  so , in theory , they would have to unify the soviet union , and not russia . 
  okay . 
  something like world war one , no biggie . 
  and obviously , they have been the peacekeepers , at least the uk was , for the last few centuries , in eu ... 
  is it really ? 
  eastern europe was sold out because they could do nothing , and uk also let zie germans take the sudetenland and the rest of it . 
  it really is the same thing , ` winners ' playing the sheriff in the wild . 
  churchill and stalin had no right to decide over the fate of eastern europe , or the middle east , they did it anyway , 
  its like the police or the government allowing you to steal someones car . 
  its very , very different , the geopolitics of the ww2 era are important to understand and learn . 
  germany could have only been hold back by the winners of ww2 - the uk , the us , france and italy . 
  italy was on the side of germany ( kinda ) , the us choose to isolate himself from eu politics , so it was all down to the uk and france to `` keep the safety of europe '' . 
  you know , like the policy the uk used in the 1700s-1800s . 
  never let the balance of europe flip . 
  this is much better to understand the population density of spain . 
  holy hell . 
  you are wrong . 
  hitler was [ allowed ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/munich_agreement ) to take the sudetenland . 
  its not like the czech had any say in it , but it was n't just an annexation . 
  what you are thinking of is the annexation of moravia and bohemia , as a whole . 
   i recall a leader of both countries looking at the map and deciding that it makes zero sense for crimea to be part of rsfsr . 
  its history , so it always have a sense . 
  political , geographical and other reasons aswell , but not zero sense . 
   17 % think stalin did ( almost ) nothing wrong i mean he saved them from the germans , whether or not this is a good thing , and the answer is not saying `` did almost nothing wrong '' , it says it did more good than bad . 
  51 is more than 49 . 
   almost half think of / r/russia thinks homosexuality is an illness thats 43 users , 7.9 % of the ones who answered , the subreddit has 23 thousand followers ... now you are just trying to foul the russians , but at least get your facts straight please . 
  its definitely not the worlds biggest thing but if you are going to a city you 've never been to , its very convenient to have it . 
  this is very , very weird . 
  i always thought istanbul was bigger than budapest , and it is in fact bigger , but in 1930 , the population of budapest ( from 1900 , the population number counts the agglomeration aswell ) is 1.442 million , 2 times more than istanbul !, 
  a few decades later , istanbul is 8.7 times more populated than budapest , and its only 3 times bigger . 
  holy hell , what happened there ? 
  if i 'm correct , he even writes it in the mein kampf . 
  jews did nothing wrong , they are just the perfect kind to ... i dont even know what to call it , fight against ? 
  central-european and eastern european countries had huge antisemitist population , and by origin you can connect jews to money , because in the medieval ages they were the one counting and managing the treasury of the king or a noble man . 
  we gave them this role , and it fired back at them , because they were at the top in the great depression , so its easy to make them the enemy . 
  hitler knew it . 
  to be honest i 'd rather have a nice road trip around france than being in paris for a week . 
  i would totally do a midnight walk in paris though . 
  which nations people are the worst in general , as a tourist ? 
  every single nation that has an army have defensive and offensive plans , whether they are in the nato or not , even hungary . 
  and this might come as a surprise , but every single army has training and exercises aswell , for all possibility . 
  the nato units have been training with some sort of napalm in the bakony exercise last year , for example . 
  exactly !, 
  the greeks should defend themselves from the goddam turks , the dutch and the belgians from the reich , and india from great britain !, 
  they are historically aggressive !, 
  i get your point , but i think its stupid . 
  egg or chicken situation , basically ... 
  i wonder as a russian , how does it feel that everybody is pointing guns at you and you are the bad guys ? 
  because from dozens of these articles , this is what i 'm getting . 
  russia will attack here , and there and there , but there are anti-missiles , nato units or aircrafts in almost every nato nation bordering russia . 
  russia must be a huge threat to us , if we need sooo many forces against them !, 
  and they did n't even tried being friendly . 
  of course they can worry about `` defensive-missiles '' on their borders , or in range to their country . 
  its the same as any other nation who is worried about russia , because they have weapons aswell . 
  they ca n't feel threatened , because they are the * bad guys ? 
  * i would shit my panties if i was russia , missiles , nato units and shit on my borders . 
  yeah , we want peace right ? 
  thats why we are pointing our guns at each other . 
  and then there are the articles about killing the russian economy and war against them , always on the headline . 
  how dare they put their country so close to our military bases , nato training fields , missile points , tactical airports ? 
  : ddd,

it always leaves me in awe , how blatantly insignificant happenings mark the actual `` milestones '' , and `` great moments '' of romanian history . 
  union in the 1600s ? 
  having the same ruler does n't mean unification ffs . 
  you would be surprised . 
  germany is the most popular destination , but uk and austria are definitely the second . 
  i 'm currently studying about the 1938 conference in bled , what a coincidence !, 
  this picture is so beautiful . 
  ... and your politicians want her as head of the government \u00af \\ _ ( \u30c4 ) _ / \u00af with respect , we sure could take back * some * territories , if they are too much for you to handle , 
   romania is still relatively homogeneous as a country mind the hungarians please . 
  and people are wondering why we drink so much smh ... 
  what bugs me really , is that tragedies like this happen , and it 's not on frontpage , but the good sleep doggo from / r/me _ irl is . 
  priorities ... 
  these recent protests are all weird , including this , but the antifa riots abd blm demonstrations aswell , they are not better or worse than eqch other . 
  all actions are followed by reactions , so no , i 'm not shocked or surprised at all , you had it coming . 
  y' all really have to get your shit together and abolish all these radical groups soon . 
  learn from europe 's mistakes .

  folk art , culture , but most importantly our dances . 
  i think we win in this over any country in the entire world . 
  our dances are really complex , colourful , even to watch , and if we add the neighbouring nations ' heritage in the mix , it 's like a caleidoscope , there 's nothing to compare it to imho . 
  i 'm dancing since i was 6 , i tried a lot of things , from salsa to hip-hop , from traditional gypsy dances to foxtrott , but the hungarian dances ( and exceptionally the transylvanian dances , from kalotaszeg and mez\u0151s\u00e9g ) are on a whole other level . 
  '' , which means `` to ( your/our ) health ! '' . 
  we 've been much around slavic folk i guess . 
  is used a lot less , and means `` god , god ! '' . 
  i do n't know why do we use it even , it has a good ring , but that 's all . 
  we have a lot of other , informal/funny ways to say `` cheers '' , eg . 
  : `` what did bela kun say ? '', 
  `` into the system ! '', 
  ( fyi : bela kun was an infamous commie leader of ours right after ww1 . ), 
  bonus fun fact , because why not : until 1998 , there was a tradition , which prohibited to cling beer glasses or bottles before drinking , because the austrians celebrated the execution of the martyrs of arad by saying toast with beer after our failed freedom fight in 1848/49 . 
  cross the street when the lights are red . 
  germans tend to gasp when they see us doing it . 
  i mean , we only do it when it 's safe , what 's the matter ? 
  magor , the forefather of all hungarians , the great grandson of noah , brother to hunor , who himself was the forefather of huns . 
  according to written history , the byzantines write about a guy named levedi , who led our people into crimea , at around 750-800 ac . 
  we are not sure if this is his real name , or the byzantines just named him after the region we were settled . 
  a lot , actually , but it was mostly on purpose . 
  i was part of a folk dance assembly for 13 years , casually chilling in traditional clothes before/after a performance always draws a lot of attention , especially since some of our ensembles are exceptionally colourful . 
  socks = footjail . 
  my mum does n't like me to fo barefoot , so for her sake i go with slippers when at home . 
  itt : the ex-industrial regions of europe with all the depleted mines . 
  i 'll ask my grandma - his uncle served as a hussar prior ww1 in the k. u. k. army . 
  he served at the eastern front i believe . 
  edit : apparently , he took part in the charge of the hungarian hussars at the battle of limanova in 1914 , and he claimed that he shook hands with hindenburg after the battle in the hospital . 
  they charged the russians unmounted with only pistols and sabers . 
  he was really proud of his military career : his friends even called him the `` little hussar '' after the war . 
  shame i did n't get to know him . 
  meh , you can have it . 
  but liszt is ours !, 
  i wish we could turn back time / to the good old daaays ... 
  this goes for all of the former eastern block imo . 
  i loved those books as a child . 
  all people i know of with the same surname as me can trace back their ancestry to the very same village in the northern part of the country . 
  literally all of us are related to some extent . 
  god bless him , i bet he 's been through a lot . 
  `` trianon was justice '' careful now , son . 
  only leftists have negative connotations to it . 
  and no one should have , neither to the \u00c1rp\u00e1d-stripes and any of other national symbols . 
  shame how some assholes can ruin national symbols to anybody , especially after decades of their deaths . 
  if you want to hate something , hate the arrowed cross . 
  sorry for the rant btw , i just like that big ol' bird . 
  i did n't study law , so it 's possible that i used the wrong term and/or i 'm slightly wrong on some topics . 
  what i meant was the continuity with the previous versions of the constitution . 
  the one the commies installed rendered every previous version invalid , while covering much fewer aspects of governing and state functions , and of course losing some basic values . 
  after the fall of the iron curtain , we had a `` temporary '' constitution , which was based on the old commie one , and was replaced by the current in 2011 . 
  it 's fine imho , but the rights of the constitutional court was cut way too much . 
  anyway , it did n't restore the historical constitutions , and is n't even based on them . 
  it might seem sentimental , but i just think that a fundamental document like that should have deep roots in the country 's past if possible , while , of course , being adjusted to its present needs . 
  it should n't be a thing to change often and radically . 
  while i 'm fine with the current one , i would definitely install a new , just to restore constitutional continuity ( which was broken by the commies after the war ) . 
  it 's such a nonsense it did n't happen so far ... 
  we have a lot of hungarian students coming from over the current borders ( like from transylvania for example ) . 
  the neighbour girl listens to it literally non-stop , and it pops up my fb feed quite often . 
  i think it 's really popular . 
  not really . 
  last summer tho , we were a happy country full of joy for a few weeks . 
  thanks football !, 
  indeed , i forgot about that . 
  i would guess `` szia ! '', 
  but maybe it 's too long . 
  turks however would probably understand this : `` zsebemben sok kicsi alma van '', 
  as always . 
  certainly , we are n't having our best time now , but as the saying says , if we would have left the country everytime there was something wrong , the carpathian basin would already be deserted for centuries . 
  depends on the faculty , really . 
  in social studies and sociology for example , everyone is hardcore leftist , in science , engineering , and history , the people are mainly conservative , students included . 
  probably not , which is a shame . 
  maybe in coalition with the neighbouring countries , we could hold the carpathians for a few days . 
  i mean techincally , duh, 
  thank you all for making my day !, 
  it may sound strange , but basically goulash is the soup version of p\u00f6rk\u00f6lt . 
  they have similar taste , but guly\u00e1s is eaten with spoon , and you cook it with the potatoes , while p\u00f6rk\u00f6lt can be eaten with fork , and you eat it with noodles , or bread , or separately cooked potatoes .

  well he certainly has a theme going on . 
  that head hanging ... `` i am a slave of the system '' lol . 
  would be fun knowing what he thought standing there . 
   he does n't do or say things that might not benefit his party in a way i think i read that he 's said recently that he does n't mind being viewed as a dictator though . 
  how would that benefit his party in turkey ? 
  is there a general crave among the population for a putinesque strongman behind the wheel ? 
  is that an exaggeration that he 's trying to undo everything atat\u00fcrk has achieved/shaped turkey to be ? 
  events like what thrwwtrk 's shown us only reinforce atat\u00fcrk 's image as a great benefitor of turkey , would n't really suit erdogan 's agenda i 'd imagine . 
  but maybe i 'm overestimating its significance . 
  wonder how long until erdogan orders them to not sound the sirens . 
  am i overestimating putin and/or underestimating trump ? 
  the latter seems just the guy who if you pull the right cords will be dancing just as you 'd want him to . 
  it 's two stages but we have no electors , it 's direct . 
  * actually it 's one stage now since 2012/2014 apparently, 
  neither in hungary . 
  lol seems like 2016 has n't tought you anything . 
  nah , putin 's smarter than that . 
  `` that 's my boy '', 
  this post has no substance whatsoever . 
  no baklava ? 
  well , if one wants to be optimistic , nato is still alive and kicking as of now , trump 's so far only raised concerns about european members ' contributions not hitting the 2 % threshold . 
  but , as expected , putin is seeking good relations with the us and that could easily be to convince trump about laying off europe . 
  they 'll likely have an easy way doing so , they 'd only reinforce trump 's general ideas . 
  guess we 'll see but if putin 's smart enough he 'll be silent until the initial panic is over . 
  thing is , europe is nowhere near united in opinion and desire , there 's barely any common spirit among us , especially on the east . 
  maybe because of that he can be played from within the house too but i 'd assume the gop is n't full of people you 'd trust being manipulated by lol . 
  and because of that he wo n't question his emotions when he 'll be manipulated by smarter people . 
  one has control over his feelings and actions , the other does not . 
  one 's not like the other though . 
  destroying the us ' image , all in good fun . 
  of course not but you can be assured putin will have a renewed interest in dividing the west . 
  salami tactics take time , if he can play trump he 'll be in a great position to go on with it . 
  at least you 'll be warm in your alps watching the world burn . . :d, 
  well it 's up to you whether you 'd wake up now or when the bear 's already mounting you, 
  from the people 's pow there might still be an amount of pensioners reminiscing about the last couple of years of communism , how things were in `` order '' back then , especially in the east where many lost their jobs after the system has changed . 
  there 's also the classic hungarian mentality of spiting everything , trying to go against the flow , the establishment , `` oppression '' which currently constitutes eu `` rule '' as they see it . 
  people overestimate this remnant of a country , live in the past and project it for the present . 
  they are proud and foolish and ca n't be waken up or be forced to look at things objectively . 
  real self-criticism is underdeveloped in hungary . 
  we have fatalism , melancholy and stubbornness instead . 
  as for orb\u00e1n et al , they 're probably trying to balance between eu and russia , keeping options somewhat open ( which is funny to think at , being already part of eu ) . 
  poland tried that with germany and russia prior to wwii in their false sense of greatness and we all know what happened to them , they got played real hard . 
  of course spineless-headless chicken west are n't a great analogy to the third reich but still , delusion at every level pretty much . 
  it 's more that we need to make it a mostly european thing , not a us thing . 
  maybe if we ask russia nicely, 
  he 'll become putin 's bitch and wo n't even notice . 
  well you live on the safer end so far . 
  nothing , just bend over , close your eyes and pray . 
  mother russia wo n't be gentle .

  [ look at these walls . 
  ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cc/ani_townwall.jpg ) the seljuks ruined it . .  the army entered the city , massacred its inhabitants , pillaged and burned it , leaving it in ruins and taking prisoner all those who remained alive ... the dead bodies were so many that they blocked the streets ; one could not go anywhere without stepping over them . 
  and the number of prisoners was not less than 50,000 souls . 
  i was determined to enter city and see the destruction with my own eyes . 
  i tried to find a street in which i would not have to walk over the corpses ; but that was impossible .

  ok , tell me about our non-colony empires . 
  tell me about our glorious days that are obviously still affect our daily lives . 
  and while at it , please remove denmark and norway from the non-empire list in your previous post . 
  i would love to read something about the empire that hungary had . 
  could you please name some of our colonies ? 
  i usually do n't bet , but after this series of immigration fuckups , there most likely will be a change of management in sweden . 
  when hungarians left their country after the 1956 events they spent months waiting to be processed and have a country to accept them . 
  and after that you got stories like that : http://satwcomic.com/all-work-and-no-play, 
  this was filmed a couple of days ago . 
  the migrants wanted the train to go to austria , despite they were told at the start that it wo n't leave hungary . 
  police also told them to get off the train and proceed to the nearby refugee camp to be processed . 
  most of them refused and also did n't accept the offered food and water either as a protest . 
  they did exactly the same in denmark , when they did n't want to be processed there but wanted to go to sweden . 
  this also happened there ( first video ) : http://news.sky.com/story/1545899/desperate-refugees-dragged-off-rail-tracks, 
   the whole political spectrum calls out for more immigrants . 
  all the parties want the same , all except the sweden democrats , sd . 
  so , let me guess : series of landslide election wins for sd in the near future ?

  edit : [ basf sold all gas storage capacity to the russians . 
  did n't france supplied weapons for the rebels a while ago ? 
  like , at the beginning of the conflict ? 
  you remember the shit hungary got for the proposed and then killed south stream project ? 
  why ? 
  just let them run into the forest of dicks , with their mouth open . 
  it is either the most pathetic thing i 've seen this week or a parody that way too meta for its on good . 
  this is a weird bunch of charts . 
  it basically claims , that islam being culturally not compatible with europe means terrorism and since islam terrorism is not that high in europe , it is probably just perceived to be non-compatible . 
  you do n't have to be a terrorist to be culturally non-compatible . 
  [ ogdenville , brockway , north haverbrook . 
  ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/44/marge_vs._the_monorail_%28promo_card%29.png ), 
  i 'm a tad confused about this article . 
  it brings out examples of eu not caring about democracy , like the deal with turkey , or the current governments of hungary , poland or slovakia . 
  it basically concludes that the problematic regions should be kicked out . 
  does it mean , that europe should kick out donald tusk and the european council too , because of their dealings with turkey mentioned in the article , or we are having another `` some animals are more equal than the others '' moment ? 
   there is no such thing as german food . 
  german cuisine is entirely regional . 
  but all those regions are german . 
  you already have a multicultural country that was united by common history and the language , and unlike the current batches of migrants , they have culturally compatible roots . 
   germany is the youngest country of the big influential countries in europe look up the history of the holy roman empire . 
  you are sitting in one of the most culturally richest and influential region of this damned planet , do n't give me this yeah-but-life-gave-us-lemons crap . 
  see my other answer . 
  i think that the current german leaders are ... lacking . 
  they maneuvered pretty well within the eu , but when an external issue came that did n't have a solution they could force through , it got them with their pants down . 
  i 'm not saying that other countries have much better ones , but if an entire country does n't seem to produce at least one competent alternative to merkel , then there is something seriously wrong . 
   that 's why they 're one of the strongest economies in the world right ? 
  they are riding on the work of the previous generations . 
  their current batch of leaders are not in the league of brandt , schmidt or kohl . 
  and yeah , orb\u00e1n ai n't flawless , i would n't wote him because of the corruption level of his bunch , but at least he had a practical solution on the migrant problem ... 
   germany becomes more and more culturally weak . 
  what the everliving fuck . 
  you got great food . 
  engineering and what you build with it . 
  traditions that go back to the beginning of europe and one of the more influential cultures in the history . 
  yeah , you ai n't that good in comedy and your politicians are shit-tier , but your history alone makes germany one of the cornerstones of europe . 
  stop staring at your shoes , grow a pair and be proud of the good parts of your country . 
  there are a shitload of them , just look around . 
   but it works for the population outside no , it does n't , if they met more like-minded fellows in the prison and get more organized/radicalized inside . 
   what would happen if germany were to close its borders ? 
  first and foremost we 'd see some highly impressive mental gymnastics as merkel tries to justify the move . 
  your application to the visegr\u00e1d axis of evil is noted , we 'll get you back with the results in a couple of days . 
  yeah , werner faymann is a bit of an idiot . 
  was n't him that when austria also started to build a fence , tried to call it not a fence but a large gate ? 
  communism can even fuck up the sand supply in the sahara desert . 
  like the new soviet microprocessor design ? 
  the one you only needed six m8 screws to install ? 
  hungarian one : `` the dying capitalism is dancing at the edge of the abyss . 
  socialism , of course , one step ahead of them . '', 
  they are germans . 
  this is what they do . 
  i have no strong feelings about any of our neighbors actually . 
  romania is ... eh , alright , i guess . 
  * looks at the flag * fuck, 
   von neumann pretty please , with sugar on the top , point me somebody from the current batch of migrants who is like half of j\u00e1nos neumann 's level of genius . 
  they might get the necessary hardware , but how would you make them react united and fast ? 
  by the time the eu finally has a war meeting and as the first point of the agenda the eu parliament votes themselves a wartime bonus , the russians would already occupy half the continent ... 
  as somebody from the former eastern bloc : to have shit like that in the past we needed a soviet occupation . 
  one of the reasons we wanted to join the west was to stop things like that to happen . 
  this is not surreal anymore , this is getting straight into twilight zone territory . 
  hungarian refugees were taken to camps they could n't leave until a country offered them home . 
  some of the refugees were in the camps even in 1960 . 
  germany ( and austria ) did care . 
  when hungary built the fence , we were suddenly measured about 0.65 kilonazis on the evil scale , because trying to stop the migrants was a bad thing . 
  this is what i 'm afraid of . 
  instead of treating the problem early , they 'll wait until everybody will be pissed to the extreme . 
  i wonder , what will be the last drop in this stream of nonsense that finally forces germany to grow a pair . 
  so , i assume following this they crucified the supplier 's qa and the luftwaffe staff that handled the upgrade process ? 
  did they even test it ? 
  what is with the german air force lately ? 
  i thought they 'll get their act together after the euro hawk fiasco ... 
   sorry but monopolies have been broken across the world yeah , uber is trying to monopolize the taxi business worldwide , so you might need to do a self-check . 
   uber and other ride sharing apps are much better . 
  ok , i do n't know what your job is . 
  let 's say a new company moves in next door , doing the same stuff you do .

  asylum-seekers coming to europe across africa or middle east from faraway countries would be deported to the asylum center closest to their country of origin . 
  in return , eu countries would voluntarily decide to carry out active resettlement programs from the u.n. refugee agency facilities . 
  thanks to this , incentives to undertake dangerous sea crossings would decrease . 
   policy on legal migration would remain a prerogative of individual eu countries . 
  however , any immigration policy should be accompanied by integration measures , which would emphasize the adoption of european liberal democratic values and would actively counter the spread of extremist ideologies , such as islamism , among migrants and their descendants . 
   if the uk leaves the eu then uk people could be stripped of eu citizenship sir , dear is no such thing as an `` eu '' citizenship ... so you ca n't strip something which does n't exist . 
  also orban had 2/3-rd of the parliament ( with elections organized by then ruling party ) - when he did most of the changes to constitution . 
   orban is using poland 's crisis for his own good . 
  he is no longer `` black sheep '' of central europe . 
  nah , that only means there are two black sheep now , 
  their income will shrink either way - but it 'll be called inflation would n't you use euro . 
   any asylum seeker who fails to identify themselves , or pulls the `` germany '' response , they get taken back by the navy to their point of origin very hard to do that - they will not tell you their point of origin and we will not `` enhance interrogate '' them . 
  there were cases of non arabic speakers insisting they are syrians ...  and their traffickers are arrested on sight . 
  traffickers are in a non eu country - they do n't drive the boats and we ca n't arrest them :( good ideas but impossible to put in practice - at least not without an european cia, 
   i think the un is pointing out that simply sending everyone back ... that 'll be back to turkey . 
  do you think that might `` lead to their death '' ? 
  i disagree with the simplistic conclusions of the article . 
  in hungary , orban did the same as fico ... and raised in polls . 
  so sorry , i doubt the causality effect . 
  however , jobbik ( very right wing ) did n't raise . 
  they were fun to watch actually . 
  orban was saying : we 'll build a 3 meter fence , jobbik would say it must be 4 meters . 
  if anything will bring down orban , that 's not going to be the migration crisis where he enjoys 70 + approval but a lot of small shits like sunday shop opening where is a 70 + disagreement , many corruption scandals or the newest teacher protest . 
   `` i am deeply concerned about any arrangement that would involve the blanket return of anyone from one country to another without spelling out the refugee protection safeguards under international law , '' which one ? 
  because apparently now we have one international law for eu and another one for let 's say saudi arabia . 
  it 's wikipedia - just change it and make sure to provide a source . 
  no offense but this is an emotionally blackmailing speech - it 's also riddled with logical inconsistencies and blank statements ( but said with pathos ) . 
  edit : just realized i did n't provide an argument . 
  bad me . 
  for example , the speaker presents 2-3 examples of successful refugee entrepreneurs and implies everyone is like this . 
  this is exactly the same logic used by extreme right groups - present some rapists and imply everyone is like that ... qed . 
  both are wrong . 
  i ca n't speak about czech citizenship but for hungarian citizenship one has to pass a written and oral exam ( constitution , history and culture ) . 
  the exam is in hungarian . 
  imo , if a foreigner manages to learn hungarian ( the easiest language on planet ) he/she is totally welcomed to be a citizen . 
   why does eastern europe react in such a hysterical way to the idea of even a miniscule number of refugees ? 
  we do n't . 
  for example hungary grants refugee status to 5-600 people/year . 
  ( yes , i know it 's minuscule ) . 
  during september negotiations , v4 leaders insisted they should first discuss securing the borders not redistribution . 
  when merkel chose to bulldozer her way through ( and boy , did she overestimated the support of rest of the states ) v4 radicalized in the opposite direction . 
  the biggest fear was the automatic quota system - so we chose to oppose any quota system from the very beginning . 
  hungary could totally handle 1200 people but orban will be in deep trouble with 20-30 000 . 
  paris and koln did n't help either - quite the opposite . 
  edit : and is n't the main point of brexit on controlling who gets in ? 
  oh wow , i had no idea turkey is the only country on planet who does n't recognize republic of cyprus ... an eu member . 
  so yeah , i think your stance is entirely justified but then again , turkey will never join eu unless they recognize cyprus and solve their border issues with greece . 
  hmm . 
  the more i think the more i like also the idea - if people know they ca n't relocate to germany probably even less will come . 
  germany will not be able to avoid - sorry to say - petty thieves ( it 's better to be a pickpocketer in germany than in let 's say morocco ) but anyway you have this problem already ( i.e. 
  it wo n't get worse ) . 
  we always worry about the last crisis . 
  long term thinking is a foreign concept to us :d < - joke, 
   but he 's from china and we 're from turkey that 's not how it works  visas have no connection to history , etc but with two main things : potential of immigration and security aspects . 
   then maybe turkey should start asking for visa from europeans too ? 
  you are entirely entitled to do so but that might hurt your tourism . 
  agree with the first part . 
  on mandatory relocation : trouble is that beside germany no big country except maybe spain is willing to contribute ( france announced they 'll cap at 30k , italy has enough already , uk will opt out ) . 
  moreover sweden and austria are full , finland is grumbling , etc. 
  moreover hungary and slovakia do n't have any other choice than to oppose - if you remember they challenged at ecj the first quota - so until there is a decision there 's no other choice - but anyway we 're talking about a relative small number of people here . 
  also i am a bit disappointed nobody discussed ( yet ) about the two big elephants in the living room : - how to handle the fact that refugees want germany or nothing - why the first redistribution deal failed miserably, 
   that how unfair the visa process they throw to us , no offence , there is nothing targeted at you guys - the same things are required for anyone applying for a schengen visa . 
  my chinese friend can not visit me because he is a freelancer ( i.e. 
  no fixed income , etc ) . 
  10 years ago ( when hungary still needed visas for us ) i went through the same , i know how it feels . 
  i 'm not disagreeing but oh boy , there will be a lot of if 's and but 's  the first plan was worse indeed but more likely to succeed . 
  if we look at yesterday 's concerns there will be a lot of diplomacy needed . 
  - v4 + austria + maybe france and romania on mandatory relocation - cyprus and greece on opening of chapters - italy on freedom of press - france on visas edit : and some of these + money will have to be approved by parliaments in some countries, 
  me bad - that was the second paragraph . 
  ok , once more : tusk negotiated with turkey and it looks they reached an agreement then called the summit which was supposed to be a formality . 
  one day before the official meeting ( 3 ` rd paragraph ) :  turkey made europe a counter offer early monday that six months ago would have prompted eu negotiators to get up and walk out . 
  if you guys were unhappy with the initial deal that tusk brokered should had said so and negotiate with tusk further not use foot in the door negotiations . 
  good response , thanks for the links . 
   which is perfeclty fine if you do n't have a serious problem with turkish people in general . 
  nobody has a problem of turkish people in general - some countries are afraid of granting exemptions to anyone ( for example it took romania and bulgaria ages ) because fears of immigration . 
  and before you tell me that people with visas can immigrate as well - that 's correct ; but it also means a lot can be rejected so the risk is reduced . 
  some other countries ( e.g. 
  france ) might have security concerns , etc - again , this is not the world against giving turkey visa free travel . 
   when did turkey ignored the agreement exactly ? 
  no offense , but did you read the article ? 
  i mean literally the first paragraph states :  the eu learned that lesson the hard way when it discovered the carefully crafted refugee ** deal ** it believed it had sold to turkish leaders in the run-up to monday 's summit turned out to be little more than the beginning of the negotiation . 
  wrt  why turkey is n't having horrible behaving refugees like europe does yeah , i guess that 's why there is a queue of refugees fleeing from europe to turkey < / s , 
  yup . 
  and those countries are eu members - meaning their concerns must be addressed first . 
  if it means nothing then why are cyprus and greece opposing ? 
  i fully agree with the rest of what you say . 
  on top of that they 'll have to solve the territorial disagreements with greece . 
  thanks for labeling me ... 
  personally i do n't mind at all turkey being exempt from visa but i 'd prefer them to follow the same process as everyone else - and not via shortcuts due to historical conjuncture . 
  to make a ( very forced ) analogy : if putin would say remove visas or i 'll nuke you would that be right ? 
  it certainly does n't look nice when turkey just decides to ignore the already negotiated agreement and say , you know what : make that double and add something on top of it ... 
  because geography - it 's second easiest point to control the situation ( after turkey ofc ) . 
   core values are for domestic politics , not for foreign policy . 
  yes but when turkey asks for opening of some extra chapters should n't it mean the core values should start applying to them as well ? 
  oh look the racist card - that means you are apriori right whatever you say , correct ? 
  the ee is complaining about forced relocation . 
  also refugees are very much existing just not the ones you are looking for . 
   eu is trying to bribe turkey the 3b already agreed is a bribe . 
  the extra 3b and the political stuff are a ransom . 
  how else do you interpret : `` hey guys , we agreed on something - now i have a few extra requests '' in the last minute ?

   the refugees should be distributed evenly within the eu , to share the burden that currently only a few countries carry . 
  why ? 
  also , evenly based on population or on economical power ? 
  and again , why should they be distributed ? 
  what does hungary , or poland have to do with the syrian conflict ? 
  when was the eu promoted to the nanny of the world ? 
   yes , for now this will have to be the case for a while . 
  prepare for the howls of racism . 
   it 's easy : the benefits are only paid in their responsible country . 
  if they move elsewhere they will not get money . 
  plus you can fine them and send them back if they are caught elsewhere in the eu . 
  who will pay the money ? 
  the responsible country ? 
  then who decides who will go to the poorer eastern countries , where they can offer only the fraction of the money they could get in the west ? 
  will be this some sort of punishment ? 
  or the eu pays the bill so every migrant gets the same ? 
  what do you think will happen if the immigrant gets more in benefits than an engineer or medical doctor who works in east ? 
  or , if they get what the respective eastern country can offer , they still better off with going to west and do some illegal/undocumented work , or even begging . 
  also , let 's say that stereotypical refugee wants to work , maybe has some actual work clarifications . 
  he is an usable person , who can be a blessing for the workforce . 
  what about the language barrier ? 
  they probably speak english . 
  i doubt many of them speak german . 
  i 'm sure as hell they do n't speak polish and i guarantee you they wo n't be able to learn hungarian . 
  why would you send them to the east ? 
  why would he remain here ? 
   refugees should n't be allowed to move to other eu countries and if they do , they should recieve a fine and be sent back to their responsible country . 
  so , refugees should be second-class people in the eu ? 
  everybody else are supposed to be move freely between the countries . 
  how would you enforce this ? 
  how would you keep track on them , if the internal border controls are basically non-existent ? 
  it is easy to play the moral high until you realize the amount of shit you have to shovel back to the horse . 
   the lack of empathy from the eastern european nations is what i find most baffling . 
  i truely would like to hear an opinion from eastern europeans on this . 
  did you check how many immigrants want to stay in eastern europe ? 
  basically none of them . 
  we can not offer the perks that west can give . 
  hell , working people here do n't get that many perks than immigrants in sweden or germany . 
  people living in the poorer southern hungary area went through the stuff ( food , clothes , tents etc ) the migrants threw away - most of them donated to them a couple of days earlier - , because it was better than they had . 
  look at the videos , where it was glaringly obvious that the immigrants were gaming the press , were not cooperative with authorities and were throwing a hissy fit when they were not allowed to freely roam the place without any control . 
  you can keep these people . 
  the article stops before it would address the question . 
  actually it is strange , that eastern europe is considered to be more racist than the west . 
  i mean , it is n't eastern europe where locals burn down a refugee home every day . 
  i do n't remember a rise in buying guns either . 
  also , it might have something with the news bias . 
  when hungary builds a fence and uses tear gas to protect it , it is racist and barbaric . 
  if austria builds one , it is not really a fence , more like a door , according to official statements . 
  the tear gas used in west is probably more like a freedom gas , producing tears of joy for the migrants arriving to a democracy or something . 
  except all this nord stream 2 did n't happened in the past few weeks : http://www.gazprom.com/press/news/2015/july/article239946/ https://www.omv.com/portal/01/com/omv/omv_group/press_room/press_releases/!ut/p/b1/04_sjzqymdiwnlcwmdlvj9cpykssy0xplmnmz0vm0q9ozqojrznfg_ibwgr6otoburq4e3r4ehh6ghpagl6fr35uqn5uzkaiahgapdw!/dl4/d5/l0ljsklkq2dwuxbsq2dwuxbsq2dwuxbsq2dwuxbsskehl1lowu1bqufjtuvbquffruvds0dlr09lt0nlqkpcskzcrknctkrorexotenosfbiuefuqwlisw9nruehis80smthuw9rce1overvstflt1fvehfjywdusvvrmuzovfrrs0dhbg1vnthnis9anl9nmdlirklvmlvbnekwqli1nkjgmdawmdawmc9an19nmdlirklvmlvbnekwqli1t0c0mtawmdawmc9qt1jutevux0fsrzevc2l0zs9ptvzfq29ycg9yyxrll1bpulrmrvrfqvjhmi90zw1wbgf0zw5hbwuvu2ltcgxlx0fydgljbguvue9svexfvf9bukczl3n0ewxlcy9zdhlszv9szwvyl1bpulrmrvrfqvjhmc9jb250zw50awqvmti1ntc2nze2mjyxni9ib21l/ also , the south stream project , that was going through eastern europe was torpedoed a year ago . 
  germany and austria are a bunch of hypocrites . 
  yup . 
  we do . 
  `` this is about ensuring an orderly , controlled entry into our country , not about shutting down the border , '' my eyes are rolling harder than linda blair 's in the exorcist . 
  fuck it . 
  i do n't have any problems with any of the neighbors . 
  we should all sit down , have a drink , listen to ramones and chill a bit . 
  poland is also invited . 
  in my experience germans are generally nice people . 
  the traditional german values on life , work ethic and all are also commendable . 
  what germans rarely seem to grasp - not just leaders , but the people too - , that non-german people might have different values , approach life differently and the solutions that worked in germany might not work in the rest of the world . 
  they do n't understand this but keep pushing their ideas . 
  i even accept that they are mostly well-meaning , but sometimes they could shut the fuck up for a little while . 
  they will also have the same problems with the immigrants , who are not germans who happened to live in another country until now and might have * very * different views on everyday life . 
  this will be a very nasty culture shock . 
  well , welcome in the club . 
   only a little while ago the dude was selling our energy sector off to putin so ... doing the exact same thing as [ germany and austria ] ( https://www.omv.com/portal/01/com/omv/omv_group/press_room/press_releases/!ut/p/b1/04_sjzqymdiwnlcwmdlvj9cpykssy0xplmnmz0vm0q9ozqojrznfg_ibwgr6otoburq4e3r4ehh6ghpagl6fr35uqn5uzkaiahgapdw!/dl4/d5/l0ljsklkq2dwuxbsq2dwuxbsq2dwuxbsq2dwuxbsskehl1lowu1bqufjtuvbquffruvds0dlr09lt0nlqkpcskzcrknctkrorexotenosfbiuefuqwlisw9nruehis80smthuw9rce1overvstflt1fvehfjywdusvvrmuzovfrrs0dhbg1vnthnis9anl9nmdlirklvmlvbnekwqli1nkjgmdawmdawmc9an19nmdlirklvmlvbnekwqli1t0c0mtawmdawmc9qt1jutevux0fsrzevc2l0zs9ptvzfq29ycg9yyxrll1bpulrmrvrfqvjhmi90zw1wbgf0zw5hbwuvu2ltcgxlx0fydgljbguvue9svexfvf9bukczl3n0ewxlcy9zdhlszv9szwvyl1bpulrmrvrfqvjhmc9jb250zw50awqvmti1ntc2nze2mjyxni9ib21l/ ) ? 
  i 've worked with some very good swedish and german engineers in the past . 
  i 'd say hungary would gladly accept about 100k highly trained medical doctors , engineers and it professionals from these countries , so they can have more space for the migrants . 
  i do n't have the article , but i remember reading that the money is a good incentive . 
  albanian family goes to germany , put away the money they receive during the ~ 3 month of bureaucratic process and it is almost enough for living the rest of the year at home . 
  i thought germany can handle this , especially since immigrants are good for the economy . 
  what happened ? 
  i know it is a weird concept , but how about * not breaking the law * in the first place ? 
  what did these people expect , a paid welcoming committee just like in vienna ? 
  i know . 
  i just ridicule it , just he did with mine . 
  it is still behind stockholm , that has a shitload of immigrants . 
  weird coincidence , innit ? 
   once again , vienna has roughly 180,000 turks and is all together around 40 % foreign-born , especially from the balkan , yet our crime rates are very low in comparison to most other eu capitals . 
  you do n't think there are differences between immigrants ? 
  are you putting all immigrants from various places of the earth into one group ? 
  are you a * racist * ? 
   i 've heard very bad things about certain parts of tokyo from friends wow !, 
  just like a big city !, 
  yeah !, 
  just like any big city !, 
  it is not like the fourth highest number of crimes of the [ eu capitals ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/crime_in_belgium ) . 
  those pesky belgians , always making trouble . 
  and chocolate . 
  friend of mine was in brussels on a conference a while ago . 
  he mentioned that parts of the metro line were a bit of an interesting ride and they were warned not to go out to certain areas after dark . 
  i thought he was exaggerating ... 
   this is what the tents look like ... 
  i have no words . 
  what do they expect ? 
  what is the level of comfort that would make them shut up at least for a while ? 
  or origo . 
  one of them `` news from an alternate reality '' portals . 
   they are angry about the living conditions in the camp , so angry in fact that in protest they skipped breakfast and lunch .

  slightly ? 
  we spent a stupid amount of money to make grippens nato compatible , and i would think swedish design is closer to nato than russian design . 
  ( or maybe you are right . 
  after all the soviets were stealing nato tech by espionage and the swedes probably did n't . 
  almost-compatibility-via-espionage is a hilarious idea but it may be true . ), 
  this is actually a sensible idea , but i am not at all sure if such contracts are legally allowed here . 
  perhaps , if he can prove he can not fill the vacancy , which he can ... a very slow bureaucratic process may allow it at the end . 
  but this is unusual because there is still a lot of unemployment or people on public works , so people do n't yet really think this way . 
  i do n't think anyone is nationalist against them , we got used to each other during the soviet era just nice , it is just a very novel idea to import workers here . 
  an older entrepreneur , who still studied russian at school , so they can communicate on a basic level ... it could work out , it is just very novel . 
  but why would e.g. 
  a ukrainian person move into hungary when with a similar effort they can move to austria , germany , france etc. 
  for 4x higher wages ? 
  if they decide to move , why stop here ? 
  i mean ... vicinity and familiar culture plays a role this is why i work in austria too , not france xd so that makes sense , for a person , who lives in ukraine just 20km from east hungary , to move over . 
  but why would they move to west hungary ( sopron ) when they drive only 10km more and they are in austria ??? 
  github just pulled a page advertising a suicide pill 22 days ago due to roskomnadzor complaints . 
  i do n't think they blocked it . 
  no reason to . 
  is it technically feasible to filter for a word on a page ? 
  like not display any pages with psilocybe on it ? 
  if yes , then it is just an excuse . 
  the accent . 
  it comes accross as [ so similar ... ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xb7bwvd5b5y ) ( in that scene the long haired guy is an irish actor from dublin , the short haired guy is english actor from suffolk and they just sound exactly the same to me ), 
  yes !, 
  i remember how everybody here had a laugh when in an us who wants to be a millionaire show a woman did not know hungary 's capitol . 
  then i asked the loudest laughing people what the capitol of alabama is . 
  embarrassed silence . 
  ok a state and country are not the same , but if one compares relative importance and significance , like gdp ... 
  hungary . 
  in the french revolution they came up with all this flags being important thing , flags became all trendy . 
  it started there , this why most flags are tricolores . 
  before that flags did not matter . 
  we hungarians did not give much a fuck about all this flags being cool and important back then . 
  but three generations later people also here thought if we want to have a proper revolution in 1848 we need a flag , and a tricolor one at that . 
  so they just shrugged , looked at the [ coat of arms ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:coat_of_arms_of_hungary.svg ) and took the colors from there . 
  and red-white-green was close enough to red-white-blue to make the revolutionary political message clear . 
  i still think we are not really that 100 % strongly attached to the flag . 
  it is just follow with the international trend . 
  but i think we are more of a coat of arms type people . 
  same colors anyway . 
  franconia in germany is a bit confusing though . 
  especially in german . 
  austrians complain about the same , `` no kangaroos here '' , for double mindfuck i tell people i _ ate _ kangaroo in austria , in the parndorf steakhouse . 
  ( it was like some really old mutton . ), 
  this must be hilarious . 
  i imagine you do this : - `` are you hispanic ? '', 
  - `` yes . '', 
  - `` where are you from , mexico ? '', 
  - `` no , spain . '', 
  - `` but you said you are hispanic ? '', 
  - `` i am . '', 
  - `` what ? '', 
  - `` hispania was the latin name of the roman province . 
  spain is an anglicized form of it . '', 
  - ... do you do this or something even better ? 
   and one joke was that he knew every countries capital that 's a joke ? 
  that is called not getting a fail grade in geo at 15 years old in the high school here . 
  on a verbal exam , if someone was doing poorly , our teacher offered `` saving '' questions : name the capitols of 5 us states or 5 german states etc. 
  so we went below the country level as well , but not that deeply . 
  so basically we could give up identifying with the past mistakes and crimes of our countries , and we could identify with the past mistakes and crimes of the whole of europe instead . 
  hm , that sounds attractive :-), 
  bavaria would just love that name . 
  i have heard about g\u00fclenism . 
  my source said it is similar to opus dei in catholicism , a religious movement that puts lot of emphasis on economic success , so urges people to get a good education in business or technology , save money , start businesses , and generally be economically succesful . 
  pro-capitalist and so on . 
  is that true ? 
  my condolences . 
  who was he and how he got there ? 
  i mean , famous investigative journalist trying to cover news from the region , or random tourist , or ngo worker ? 
  i wanted to avoid , because the i liked the idea in general , but not the brutal hazing everybody was complaining about i.e. 
  older soliders torturing and humiliating younger ones . 
  it was surprisingly easy and i did not break the law . 
  i just had my employer write a letter every year `` yes this guy is really essential at his job '' and then i got after a while too old to conscript . 
  26-27 mostly . 
   traditionally , one hectare was about the amount of land one person could tend to with raw muscle strength . 
  i am suspicious about this type of genetically metric humans who can somehow tend exactly a 100m by 100m square with raw muscle strength . 
  not really - we in hungary tend to think a family farm that can survive in the market economically ( e.g. 
  can afford to buy a tractor ) starts at 50 hectares ( around 125 acres ) and i do n't think land in siberia is more fertile than ours . 
  however they have huge quantity of land in siberia so i am not really sure why do n't the give away like 100 hectares to the first 10 000 applicants . 
  1m hectares are 10 000 km2 so basically a 100 km by 100 km square . 
  that would not be much in siberia . 
  i wo n't say p\u00e1linka , it is getting too much of a stereotype . 
  p\u00e1linka is more of a fad now , since microdistilleries were legalized like 10 years ago and now it is this `` craft p\u00e1linka '' fad although not called so , but stuff like plum and honey p\u00e1linka etc. 
  our true traditions are wine and not just tokaji . 
  try something from badacsony or eger or sopron . 
  us based startups tend to cluster around universities and university research labs . 
  see mit ai lab -  massachusetts cluster . 
  berkeley , caltech -  silicon valley . 
  i think we are more likely to have many small universities perhaps due to not liking to stay in dorms but rather go to our home city perhaps due to the government paying tutition so we do n't want to get in debt just to pay dorm life in a different city . 
  it may differ in per country though . 
  we in hungary in the last 15 years tend to think every bit larger town has to have a college , so many small colleges propped up , often training teachers and similar , as if you are choosing that kind of path , it is far cheaper if you stay with your parents . 
  we should try to gravitate tech universities and postgraduate tech university research labs to 1-2 locations but nationalism will get in the way . 
  maybe a place like belgium , my wife visited a friend just there , she said you can speak english , german , french or dutch and in each case you will find plenty of people in belgium who understand you . 
  i think belgium has this international character , this is why the nato and eu was put there . 
  maybe we should try to gravitate universities and tech research there . 
  is there any obstacle to , for example , any european university setting up subsidiary faculties abroad ? 
  here is a plan . 
  take a huge cow field in belgium and build a huge campus . 
  have many european universities rent space there .

  sites are being blacklisted because they go against putin 's policy . 
  such as articles about crimes committed in sweden by migrants not accessible from swedish ips ? 
  a lot of stuff relating to ww2 not accessible in germany and france ? 
  or are these not censorships because you think they are * right * ? 
   do western leaders kill reporters , dissidents and their political opponents ? 
  please , tell us more . 
  no , in the west people are publicly shamed and became a persona non grata . 
  anyways , show me evidence that putin systematically kills his political opponents . 
  why did you answer this one only ? 
   despicable cynicism . 
  you make a mockery of the values that have gotten us where we are today . 
  it was n't 5-6 years ago when the west decided topple the governments in many middle eastern nations . 
  which was a good thing back then , it served our interests in the short term , later we were proven wrong though , we did n't enforce border control and did n't have a strong dictator we can bribe to stop migrants . 
   let 's all be self-serving sociopaths . 
  let 's just be self-serving . 
  just like nato is self-serving , so is every nation state ever . 
   i 'm curious , by your definition , what did hitler do wrong ? 
  what every baddie we ever learnt about did . 
  not winning . 
   you ca n't take facts seriously ? 
  that 's a shame . 
  note how they are specifically targeting pages related to crimea . 
  this is censorship , plain and simple . 
  according to you internet is germany , france etc too because certain sites are not accessible . 
  would you say internet is censored in germany too , or sweden ? 
   this entire post was about morality ( admitting stalin 's atrocities ) . 
  the morality of claiming putin is no worse than western leaders is the entire topic of discussion here . 
  and putin is no worse than western leaders , he simply does not play in our team . 
   same fashion he did ? 
  you want me to lie and misrepresent to defend my side , make arrogant jokes and claim all arguments others have are just another point of view ? 
  i 've already presented his most egregious bullshit in the post above . 
  yes , in the same fashion he did , if you think he lied and misrepresented it , that 's fine . 
   thousands killed in his war games in chechnya , ukraine , georgia the west waged wars too . 
   annexing foreign territories it was in their interests , also were populated by russians . 
   bombs civilian buildings to get in power ??? 
   called the dissolution of the ussr `` the greatest geopolitical tragedy '' it was for the russian people . 
   he is an ex-kgb , which means he is a snitch , and tens , maybe hundreds or thousands have been jailed for political reasons over his reports . 
  `` maybe '' , `` maybe '' not . 
   should i continue ? 
  please , go on . 
  you can critize him for this and that , but what he does makes russia more powerful , this is what the role of the president is , not waving flags and virtue signaling . 
  if it 's in your interest to annex a warm water port , you do it . 
  if it 's in your interest to attack a random muslim country for oil you do it . 
  you can decide if it 's morally right or wrong , but he does what a president has to do . 
  i hope he wo n't succeed , because hungary is playing in the opposite team right now , but attacking him for these things is stupid . 
   russians have the internet ( which is censored there ) i 'm sorry ... 
  i ca n't take you seriously . 
   solid and thorough response where he compares the actions of a criminal dictator with some unsavory actions of the west ? 
  both players do things what are in their own interests . 
  you might think they are morally right or wrong , up to you , but that 's how empires operate . 
   what the fuck are you smoking ? 
  are you that impressed by long responses that you ignore the utter crap that 's actually said ? 
  care to reply to him in the same fashion he did , or will you just keep calling him a russian shill ? 
  something not negative only about putin ????? 
  ** downvote ** / s, 
  a lot of people with a citizenship of a western european country are black too , many jews lived in europe for centuries , no problem there other than the holocaust . 
  as for the hate of italians , many 3rd world country hates their former conquerors , so i guess that makes sense . 
  ah , considering you said in an other post that you are from libya , i 'm sure you could teach me a thing or two about the hatred of jews and blacks . 
  so please tell me about it . 
  about italians , i do n't know who dislikes them in europe . 
  please name the americans who lived in an * arab country * , lived as * arab country * citizens and decided to blow civilians up in the name of ` murica . 
  what about them ? 
  war is war . 
  i 'm sure there were people protesting against that too though . 
  frankly muslims did n't give them a lot of reasons to do so . 
   peace marches by germans for the crimes of hitler . 
  i too think that muslims should collectively pay reparations for the people who survived terror attacks in the recent years . 
  you sound stupider day by day , is everything ok honfit\u00e1rs ? 
  i second that, 
  the same ditib that refused to participate this time ? 
  the same ditib that refused to participate this time ? 
   few hundred . 
  i 'm willing to bet the majority were leftists/shia muslims . 
  not sunnis . 
  ouch , poor guy . 
  what does this article have to do with viktorka ? 
   ps : adopt the euro !, 
  no no no , forint is good too !, 
  sadly happened all over eastern germany and eastern europe where people were '' '' `` liberated '' '' '' . 
  while it he can be sued for and hungary indeed can not overrule it , they ca n't not deny out cohesion funds , the council can only take it away if a member state has excessive public deficit . 
  not because we did n't take in arabs . 
  also you must be foolish if you think germany will let those sweet cohesion funds go away , since we contract german companies and/or german equipment to do the job . 
  a 2 year old article , about a ruling made 2 years ago that no-one kept . 
   sadly the hungarian peoples ' wishes do not overrule legally binding decisions of the european council . 
  but the decision of the hungarian government overrules the decision of the european council . 
  and the hungarian government will not welcome migrants . 
  nor will poland or slovakia . 
  the czech accepted what , 20 ? 
  also down voting because i disagree with you , how democratic . 
  cool , not going to happen . 
  west can keep their gdp growth inducing wundermenschen . 
  what vote are you talking about ? 
  also talking of democratic votes , i guess you will conveniently ignore the referendum where our countrymen made it clear we do not want migrants . 
  or that does n't cunt because the fidesz is root of all evils ? 
  but if some of the members invite twenty homeless people to the communal dinner against the will of the rest , they should expected to pay the bill for those homeless , do n't you think ? 
  looks like you do n't need gender quotas if you are actually capable to do a job . 
  great arguments , i 'm sold . 
   they 've never not disclosed it . 
  then your treasured ngos have nothing to worry about . 
  so almost half of the people supported orb\u00e1n in 2014 , yet you imply it was a `` loophole '' .

  the fact that you use magyar instead of hungarian is a dead giveaway that you 're just trolling, 
  1867-1919 is not a long time, 
  of course we should always look at everything western europeans draw to be borders as the holy scripture and we should never complain , just serve them as we are meant to, 
  one in 6 hungarians live outside the current borders because of that treaty ( at the time of the treaty it was one in 3 ) . 
  if you met one of those , they will obviously mention it . 
  and most hungarians will know others who live outside as well , so it 's kind of a crucial point for the nation you know ? 
  in the settlements there are human rights violations going on , so i can understand the motive behind that . 
  in golan heights , there are n't . 
   stealing that name without giving credit, 
  how is golan heights connected to the settlements though ? 
  the majority of people had no way to intervene , hell probably a large percentage of people was n't even aware of it at the time ( like myself ), 
  that is so cool  makes me wan na visit transylvania even more . . 
  weird . 
  by the way , do you mean that romanians in romanian use szia , or just the hungarians ? 
  there 's like a million places in romania that have the exact same thing and they work just fine . 
  also most likely almost everyone there speaks both languages . 
  i bet you also celebrate the fuck of western european national holidays though, 
  i subscribed , just in case . 
  i do n't want to be left out of the fun, 
  that does n't mean that retarded boundaries are kept retarded at all . 
  east berlin was n't kept separate from the western part either , was it ? 
  it made no sense to keep it that way , just like it makes no sense to have it that way in this case . 
  the whole village would just be assigned to one of the two countries ( or i mean , it should ), 
  hardly `` federalist porn '' though . 
  if the eu was a federation the town would just be assigned to a municipality and there would be no need for the joint police force and all that type of stuff , it 's just be the normal thing that it 's policed by the same police ( a no-brainer really ), 
  we also say ciao , but it 's very informal . 
  you only greet your closest friends with ciao . 
   szia - used mostly in transilvania - i think it 's because of the hungarian influence , in hungary they say sziastok for hello , szia for short nonono sziasztok is to address more than one person . 
  szia is when you talk to one person only, 
  buzzwords  explanation amirite, 
  well , whatever you prefer . 
  you should realize though that both serbia and hungary are shitty small countries that will never be able to get anything done without outside help . 
  without being part of a larger block , neither can really prosper , and they wo n't either . 
  i think your problem is that you think sovereigny is worth it . 
  living in a country that had its best days when it wasnt sovereign at all , i can assure you that is not the case . 
  i dont understand your logic , why would anyone lose their identity because of federalization in the first place ? 
  look at bosnia , or look at serbia . 
  did anyone in the region lose their identity , just because the country they lived in wasnt called exactly the way they wanted ? 
  of course they didnt . 
   seeing belgrade turn into an internationalist city of foreigners and hipsters is about the last thing i want to happen . 
  go take a look at budapest fam , it 's nothing like what you 're describing . 
  western europe did that part to themselves , eastern countries did n't want that and did n't become that either, 
   the belief that each life has a value is what brought us this far that belief is n't even 100 years old , jesus christ stop pretending, 
  should n't it be ayntrim then , because that 's what i would call ` pretty much the same ' . 
  how on earth does aontroim become antrim in english ? 
   trusting polls  in 2016, 
  well i mean there was work for all , in the sense that everyone got paid for doing absolutely nothing ... 
   hungary can finally into sea now !, 
  we would 've liked the clay better , we already have a [ hungarian sea ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lake_balaton ), 
   ( i do n't know about the situation before that , i 'm not that old ) i 'm pretty sure under communism no one was homeless , i mean was n't that kind of the whole point of communism ? 
   you 're basically equating all ukip and trump supporters with neonazis no i did n't . 
  i never used the word `` all '' in my comment , which seems to be the focus of your comment . 
  i did n't even mention a thing about people who voted for trump . 
  i said that the same type of people i 'm describing ( the new alt-right wave ) is called different names in different countries , but they are manifestations of the same global surge of reactionarism/conservativism . 
  it 's the ~ ~ illuminazi ~ ~ soros gy\u00f6rgy, 
  love added touch of the capital i having the dot, 
  that white part is scary . 
   i 'm inclined to disagree with the idea that aristocratic rulers had anything to do with creating the nations . 
  i did n't say that . 
  i said that the elite took advantage of it , especially once nationstates came to be and were unavoidable . 
  they , with the idea of nationstate also made people jingoistic and to look at other nations as enemies and very different . 
  best example : prussia/germany . 
  this was basically the exact same as religion used to be ( the church also taught people to distrust different religions and in extreme cases , literally kill everyone who is n't of the right religion ) but this was different from religion , the western variant at least : nationalism let them make the inside group/outside group match up exactly with the citizens , thereby minimizing internal conflict and also minimizing sympathy with other nations . 
  it was like a wet dream for power hungry people  remember , for example , that the martyrs of arad were joined by non-hungarian which believed , like them , in republican humanist ideals and were later decried by the tribal loyalties of the royalist elites of their ethnicity as being traitors to their own kind . 
  well , yeah . 
  that 's pretty nice i guess . 
  they were n't motivated by the nationalist narrative , they were motivated by the social reform narrative . 
  as i said , these two came in a package from france , and at the time people did n't really realize that the two do n't have to come together . 
   meanwhile the old blood-loyalties tried desperately to keep together their genealogical alliances , and in the east succeeded . 
  alliances among the aristocracy were kinship-related mostly . 
  rural lower class people , living in the diverse mess that is eastern europe , usually had a sense of ethnic identity ( not a very strong one , but a very existing one anyway ) . 
  and that is what developed into eastern european nationalism , the ethnic identity of the peasants , not the blood-loyalty of the high aristocrats . 
  because what was the urban intellectual elite that birthed nationalism anyway ? 
  really just the rural people coming together, 
  i meant them as in , hot topic important stuff . 
  i do n't count the french revolution to human rights being hot & important , because their idea of human rights was vastly different from today 's, 
   via 9gag . com / r/europe is hitting a new low, 
  obviously it 's * rend * ( order ) * \u0151r ( iz ) * ( guard/to keep safe ) * - s\u00e9g * ( `` thing that does that '' ) . 
  so `` order keeping force '' . 
  compare that to police , literally deriving from latin * politia * ( government ) ... 
  it 's like you guys just * want * to live in a police state . 
  nationalism mainly developed in england and central france , neither are really places where you 'd expect people to meet other nations en masse . 
  croatia obviously never developed nationalism by itself , it was influenced and/or created by the already-in-place german and hungarian nationalism , both of which were inspired by the original french nationalism therefore , obviously nationalism was designed to work in homogeneous areas with homogeneous people , which is why cultural genocide sprees like germanization and hungarization happened , but also more recently bosnia . 
   funny , my rural ancestors got moved about by various morons from various empires , countries , nations , they spoke several languages before an urban traitor in the capital did . 
  well the way i understand it , the cultural/social progress went like this : 1 , - aristocratic society where nations do n't matter and therefore is tolerant and accepting with different nations 2 , - nationalistic society where classes are formally gone ( still present but that 's a different story ) and is culturally intolerant because of the rampant nationalism 3 , - modern urban society back then , rural places were still in the first phase , urban areas in the 2nd , while today , the rural areas caught up to the 2nd , but the urban areas are now in for something new which is hindered by the countryside . 
  so yeah , i 'm gon na `` spinning in my illusion '' , which was in no way challenged by your comment, 
   thinking you would find a millionth order derivative word in a dictionary silly slav . 
  obviously you 've never heard of agglutination . 
  search for * szent * in the dictionary , the rest is just conjugation, 
  as i said , i 'd love to see them together in a bar, 
   quite the opposite , nationalism is extremely young . 
  before that class and religious differences were far more important . 
  we 're both saying the same thing , just on a different scale . 
  obviously for something that is such a hot topic in actual politics today , nationalism is a pretty goddamn old rusty thing , at its 150-175 year-ish history now . 
  others like immigration , integration , human rights , stuff like that are way younger . 
   it 's origin rests in the fact that written revolutionary material was dispersed along linguistic lines , and that formed the basis of ` national identity ' . 
  in some places that identity became non-ethnic , like america and france , and in others it was hijacked into ethnic identitarianism , central and eastern europe . 
  quite the opposite . 
  i think it was the westerners that hijacked the idea of a strong national identity into a generic `` anyone in the country = inside group , anyone outside = outside group '' , which mainly benefited their rulers , who played the game of thrones above the people . 
  for the great powers of the early 1800s , this was awesome .

  i do n't think it applies to people crossing borders inside the heart of europe . 
  but i 'm not a lawyer . 
  if some high european court ruled that it indeed means that anyone who is in danger in a certain country gets a free card to cross any border until they reach their dream destination , then we have to protest and refuse that interpretation . 
  if it 's not successful then country after country we have to quit such a refugee convention and make a new , clarified one . 
  i find the free-card interpretation nonsense and crazy . 
   well , it was orban who started to send them , after merkel 's statement , without asking germany and austria before . 
  but well merkel should 've also announced her statement to orban before . 
  both did n't play fair here . 
  i agree that both were n't fair here . 
  there was no other choice for hungary than to let them to the austrian border . 
  it 's a kind of dickish move in some sense , but it was after days of futile efforts to put the migrants into camps . 
  when they heard about germany not sending syrians back to hungary , they got extremely excited and wanted to go to germany and thought hungarians are evil for forcing them to stay in hungary . 
  the alternative would have been to dissolve the crowd marching to austria by police force . 
  germany would have been outraged by that . 
  so hungary said , we load them to just before the border and see what austria does . 
  if they keep them off using police , then they will be in the news , not us . 
   we do n't want to take refugees at all . 
  but they are in europe and somebody has to care about them . 
  and one of the main motives why merkel acted was to take pressure exactly from the balkan route and prevent a humanitarian and political catastrophe there some time later . 
  if you do n't want to take them , then do n't post selfies , do n't decorate train stations with balloons and do n't clap . 
  be quiet , emphasize that the migration is unwanted and that germany will assist greece with any equipment necessary to defend their borders . 
  but if we interpret article 31 as a free card , then of course controls do n't help . 
  if germany keeps to the free-card interpretation , they have no choice and no place to complain . 
  either unilaterally void the geneva obligations of germany , or accept the direct-neighbor interpretation . 
   i am not talking about the new arrivals , just about those who are there , ca n't be sent out of europe anymore , and for humanitarian and political reasons , ca n't be let in any of the non-eu balkan countries ? 
  unless the influx is controlled there is no sense in differentiating between those in europe and those who will come to europe unhindered since some countries accept the free-card interpretation . 
  those who are here are only a fraction of the potential migrants . 
  but what i do n't understand is how you can support the free-travel-anywhere interpretation but at the same time support mandatory quotas , i.e. 
  forcing refugees to countries where they do n't want to be . 
  be consistent . 
  either they can go where they want and then germany keeps them , or they ca n't go where they want and they have to stay in the first safe country . 
  first , the hungarian border is open for legal entry . 
  only the green border ( forests , fields ) are fenced . 
  hungary never claimed that the fence on the hungarian border is a solution . 
  it is n't . 
  it 's an emergency treatment of the immediate problem . 
  the government calls it the `` second best thing to do '' , the first being securing the greek border . 
  but there 's no will to do that , for whatever reasons ( certain interpretations of international law and human rights etc ) . 
  also do n't forget that the schengen agreement is still valid and germany can not invalidate it ( and of course they did n't even try , on the contrary , they emphasize its validity ) . 
  many eu members , including the v4 and the baltics do want the schengen agreement to be enforced as it was signed ( so some of them even sent policemen and soldiers to help hungary with holding up the treaty ) . 
  hungary closed the border because hungary would like to close the greek border , but obviously has no right to do so . 
  but hungary is obliged to defend their own border by the schengen agreement and by their own people . 
   those people are already in europe , they wo n't disappear because we toss them around between european countries . 
  and we ca n't deport them out of europe currently . 
  so somebody has to care for them . 
  sure . 
  not our problem , thanks . 
  germany can not force other countries to take economic migrants who are n't refugees according to the geneva convention ( came through safe countries ) . 
  you have to decide if you are arguing based on feels or law . 
  by law , there is no obligation to take them . 
  if you want to take them based on perceived moral obligation , you can do that in your own country but can not force others . 
   according to the geneva convention they have a right to apply for asylum at the border or in the country , and it 's not legal for punish them for illegal border crossing . 
  i see your name often here so it 's strange you still have n't seen the word `` directly '' in the geneva convention article 31 . 
  i was criticizing the way german media reported the events on the 3rd or 4th september when germany and austria let the migrants in germany . 
  before that they insisted on them staying in hungary ( though their split mind also said that they wo n't send anyone back if they do get to germany despite this insistence ) , but in an extremely weird and surreal way their media still condemned hungary for stopping them from leaving hungary ( by cancelling trains etc ) . 
   how would you like them to stop for entering germany . 
  there is no legal method . 
  i 'm not a german citizen , i have no right to tell them what to do . 
  if they let a zillion-chillion migrants in their own country then that 's what they do . 
  i 'm neutral in the issue . 
  just do it without messing with the countries on the route . 
   border states like hungary hungary is never the first point of entry to the eu for the migrants . 
  they enter in greece or italy ( or potentially from bulgaria ) . 
   could you please check the facts ? 
  the people at keleti were requested repeatedly to be relocated to refugee shelters where they had food & stuff . 
  guess what ? 
  they refused !, 
  apparently not so hungry and desperate . 
   the hungarian police could had forcibly remove them ( and send them to camps ) but then that would had been inhuman ... damned if we do and damn if we do n't . 
  it 's obvious that hungary would be still getting a lot more shit if what 's happening now in croatia & slovenia happened in hungary . 
  like 10 times more shit . 
  i 'm so glad we are not on the route any more , that fence is very very important , i do n't even care how much it cost . 
  i just hope they wo n't come back through romania , but we 'll fence that off as well if they do . 
  winter will come and germany and austria will close their borders . 
  whatever they may be saying now , they * will * close the borders and the migrants will get stuck somewhere . 
  and luckily it wo n't be hungary . 
  selfish ? 
  yes . 
  but after the treatment that we got from the international community and media , i think staying out of the whole shit is the right approach . 
  eu policy is very heavily influenced by germany . 
   taken in the hungarian refugees that 's covered in a very twisted way in germany . 
  she did n't `` take them in '' , nor were they hungary 's refugees . 
  they were n't recognized as refugees in hungary . 
  some have applied for asylum out of necessity but they all just planned to go to germany . 
  they even walked on the motorway on foot just to get there !, 
  what she did was that she did n't stop them from entering germany . 
  she simply opened the gates because the short-term alternative would have been to use the army against the migrants ( and the long term alternative would have been to declare migration as unwanted and to support the protection of the greek border ) . 
  the difference is that the official way would be offered only for a limited number of people . 
  but there are a lot more who wants to come . 
  so they will just come unless they are physically stopped . 
  i do n't know how it is in poland , but many homophobes in hungary think [ this ] ( http://pannon-info.hu/images/stories/meleg_felvonulas_biblia.jpg ) , [ this ] ( http://pannon-info.hu/images/stories/meleg_felvonulas_2010.jpg ) and [ this ] ( http://img.444.hu/semjen_kerenyi.jpg ) when they hear `` homosexual '' . 
  the german state 's ard news editor has even admitted doing this . 
  gniffke said in front of experts : `` when camerapeople film refugees they seek out families with small children and big eyes '' . 
  but the truth is that `` 80 percent of the refugees are young , strongly built single men . '', 
  * not all come from war zones . 
  many just live in overcrowded shitty camps , and many just simply live in poor countries and now see the opportunity to start a new life in a rich country . 
  * men can usually tolerate harsher circumstances and do n't have to fear rapes for example . 
  * the trip is expensive and some families can only afford sending one person or none at all . 
  they need to pay for the smugglers , ferries , trains , buses , food etc. 
  it can cost 10,000 eur or more for one person .

  tbh you at barcelona have the best chance to be a silicon valley . 
  rest of the mediterranean is going toward tourism . 
  ( and migrants lol ... ), 
  make britain great again !, 
  i hope the eu bureaucrats realize that there are many eu citizens whose livelihood depends on apple and google . 
  please junkcer do n't fuck this up . 
  it 's bad enough they persecuted linus torvalds . 
  srsly while it 's a master peace , it can be told in 1 short sentence . 
  the glorious mother russia kicks out napoleon from the country , plus some hidden class warfare to further the early commie propaganda . 
  that 's my problem with books . 
  even lord of the rings ' 3000 pages can be told in 1 sentence and you wo n't miss much . 
  a short man visits and climbs a forbidden mountain and throws a ring into it , saving the world for the cancer-like humans while the glorious elves leave in disgust for west . 
  true , they are hanging out on youtube , twitch or some random chat app . 
  and tbh i dunno if this is a bad thing or not ... 
  well , guess what is next year in germany ? 
  that 's right !, 
  election time !, 
  could be true . 
  orb\u00e1n is keeping the wages intentionally very low . 
  of course it ends in corruption . 
  represent ffs ... 
  `` slowest and leakiest ship . '' heh , that would be us . 
  erm ... nope we do n't even have ships lol ... 
  yeah , finally someone is doing something in syria instead of fucking around and look like an idiot . 
  hello putin ? 
  same here , we have like 68 % . 
  they had it easy . 
  we had the glorious red army and their glorious dicks . 
  for 40 years lol ... 
  well yeah , there 's lotsa crap shoveled together in that article . 
  it 's very simple , migration will kill off eu . 
  nothing could but this will be the thing that will put an end to it if thing wo n't turn around very fast . 
  attn !, 
  millennial detected !, 
  no you daft . 
  it works because australia has a strong migrant policy , and germany does n't . 
  if you keep merkel in office , in a few years sharia will rule germany . 
  just wait till the donald takes the office . 
  then us troops will leave europe and we will be left with a weak minded merkel and hollande to fend for ourselves . 
  who will help you against the sea of migrants ? 
  putin ? 
  have been saying this for years . 
  but there 's a point when you must accept the truth , that you have failed . 
  i think this is the time when you assume the siege mentality . 
  ( and you ca n't really blame the muslims , we have done this to them like 1000 years ago . ), 
  the big reversal will be when the donald takes the office . 
  this political correctness will die at that very moment . 
  ( the only question mark is ofc putin . 
  will he start the occupation of europe on the next day ? 
  ... tune in and find out in november ! ), 
  this was news item here too . 
  good job poland . 
  i just heard about this celtic union thing . 
  if scots and irish pull this that will be the coolest name on the map currently . 
  straight out of some fantasy . 
  i hope they capitalize on this druid thing lol ... 
  all of eastern-europe has gone to spain ( and uk ) to work . 
  why on earth would you come here lol ? 
  anyways if you speak english and spanish you can find a job under 30 secs . 
  ( not just here but anywhere in the world . ), 
  problem is , as always , the salaries . 
  china will have free reign in uk ... well that will be interesting to say the least lol ... 
  good , without looking at the article i say double their budget without a second thought . 
  oh non no no , it 's just the latest fad from orb\u00e1n . 
  we need a properly equipped frontex , not a grande armee . 
  big army and europe do n't mix well lol . 
  make britain great again . 
  yalta 2 . 
  we all knew this . 
  trump does not care about europe . 
  ( and tbh why should he ... ), 
  srsly turkish army is more democratic than their politicians . 
  hats off to their army . 
  respect . 
  it 's very sad it had to come to this . 
  i would have actually preferred if rich turkish expats would actually spend money to educate people about democracy . 
  i hear east and middle turkey is still massively erdogan believer . 
  ( just like we have orb\u00e1n believers in the countryside rofl . ), 
  yeah salah abdeslam is not that photogene roflmao ... 
  yeah , us too . 
  i 'm a pacifist but even i can see the importance of this . 
  grat , it was a great match . 
   taken for granted until removed . 
  yeah , that should be the motto of humanity in the 21st century ... 
  yeah , greeks could n't do this but you were brave enough rofl ... 
  make britain great again !, 
  jeez looks very good . 
  if you have full hd version please upload it . 
  need it for wallpaper ty . 
  i say more british gentlemen on the continent ( this time w/o arms lol ) . 
  we need more of this , god bless brexit . 
  do n't think that for a minute . 
  ocober and november will be about the usa . 
  i dunno what 's up with anglo-saxons this year rofl ... 
  tbh all of eastern and central europe could use some british immigration . 
  shame it wo n't happen but i would be totally cool with it ... 
  spain should shut up . 
  and cherish the money mama merkel sends their way roflamo ... 
  so it has started ... 
  the great shitstorm of our time ...

  wow , i did n't know pine can be that color . 
  i had to google it . 
  the only yellow needle tree i 've seen is [ larch ] ( http://www.buzzbishop.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/img_4784-1024x768.jpg ) , so i just assumed . 
  he still did a good job ... 
  [ scania !, 
  ] ( http://pimg.tradeindia.com/01571632/b/1/tim-tim-orange-drink.jpg ) as close as i could get , sorry . 
  well , that 's just sad . 
  yeah , i remember hearing about that . 
  amazing it took so long to find . 
  maybe that was part of why i thought about intentional plantings . 
  now here 's [ a german flag ] ( http://view.stern.de/de/picture/1814688/sonnenaufgang-himmel-wolken-meeresstimmung-arktis-sea-flagge-940.jpg ) to help you feel better . 
  i would n't know , really . 
  i 've never been there . 
  i was thinking larch are n't so common , so maybe a landscaper specifically chose them . 
  but of course , in the north/cold climates they 're more common . 
  also lovely . 
  yeah , the `` ukrainian flag in nature '' is very popular . 
  there are a few more [ estonian ones ] ( https://www.google.hu/search?q=estonian+flag+in+nature&amp;biw=1366&amp;bih=609&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0cayq_auoawovchmilmznmzxeyaivhrysch2elajq ) in google images .

  ] ( http://data.whicdn.com/images/6123568/large.jpg ) ( i felt bad leaving you out after including denmark . ), 
  that 's lovely . 
  i imagine that was an intentional planting . 
  it turned out well . 
  i can offer a [ hungarian flag ] ( http://trollfesz.cc/i/238323.jpg ) and [ ukrainian flag ] ( https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/3c/77/6d/3c776d689e2173069654f0b7962ee8c6.jpg ) ( available in summer only ) .

  he knew he was breaking the law , but refused to stop . 
  moreover , by * announcing * that he had a baby , he seemed to think the police should care . 
  as if that made him some kind of `` exception . '', 
  he could have stopped , claimed asylum , and stayed with his kid . 
  for example , that guy the journalist kicked was running from the police while crying , `` baby !, 
  baby ! '', 
  [ video 's here ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2015/sep/08/journalist-appears-to-kick-and-trip-fleeing-refugees-video ) i 'm not justifying kicking him , but he seemed to feel he should be allowed to run away from the cop who grabbed him because , hey , he 's got a baby . 
   i 'm sorry you had that experience . 
  actually , as a whole , living in those places was a positive experience . 
  no region is perfect , of course . 
  but to answer your question ... this is really long , but you asked !, 
  :-) thing is those established communities are made of individuals , and ( at least in my experience ) on average they 're much more conservative than even religious conservative europeans . 
  i worry how many are really a good fit for the societies they 're entering . 
  and it 's hard to believe those who are n't a good fit will be sent home when it 's safe again . 
  anyway , about gender roles , it did n't feel absolutely barred from things and i certainly was n't treated as less valuable , but i felt i had to always consider what 's `` appropriate '' for a woman versus for a man . 
  i felt too much * difference * between roles for men and women . 
  for example , my co-residents ( long-term guest house ) teased me for shaking hands with a man and threatened to tell my boyfriend that i cheated . 
  they were just playing , but it 's very conservative , religious thinking . 
  or when you 're expected to sit in the back of the taxi because sitting in the front can give the driver `` the wrong idea . '', 
  or people who think it 's `` shameful '' for a man to do housework . 
  ( seems this is mostly the older generation , though . ), 
  or when you 're advised not to wait for someone outside because a woman standing alone , even during the day in normal clothes , `` looks like a prostitute . '', 
  or how men will not enter a home ( eg . 
  to collect rent ) with a woman alone because the woman might be afraid or neighbors might see and `` suspect something . '', 
  ( of course , i understand men do this from respect . ), 
  i do n't think these things are * inherently * bad and , in fact , plenty of women prefer them . 
  also , in some ways , women are treated * better . 
  * so , it 's really just personal preference . 
  but i personally found it very constrictive , probably because i was n't raised with those ideas . 
  in regard to contact , i just do n't know . 
  i 'm not sure that will help . 
  i 've lived in the middle/near east ( mostly turkey and georgia , also armenia and jordan ) . 
  around six years all total . 
  my main issue is that i felt strict gender roles were * suffocating * in all these places except armenia . 
  i felt like i had to consider my gender ( female ) in nearly everything i did . 
  so , if i have `` negative feelings , '' that 's why . 
  yes , there are many wonderful , kind , intelligent people in these cultures and there are things i like about `` middle eastern culture '' in general ( greater hospitality , for example ) , but as a whole , i do n't prefer to live there . 
  so , in my case , greater contact did n't help . 
  oh , yes , of course we 're still friends . 
  the present is built on the past . 
  i 've travelled a fair bit and it 's always good to meet poles abroad . 
  once in tbilisi , georgia , i was looking at a flat for rent . 
  i assumed the owner was georgian . 
  she asked me where i normally lived and when i said budapest , she seemed really excited and said , `` eg\u00e9szs\u00e9gedre ! '', 
  when i looked confused she said , `` i 'm polish ! '', 
  ( just happened to know a few hungarian words . ), 
  then we were like insta-friends . 
  just another example . 
  thank you !, 
  yeah , i was going to say ... 
  but then `` viking '' was in quotes , so i thought maybe that also included , say , magnus ' wife who just stayed home knitting while hubby was out raping and pillaging . 
  or trading . 
  whatever . 
  so perhaps the quotes were meant to suggest not every individual in the country was involved . 
  it 's so sad how teleki ended . 
  he really tried . 
  yes , i knew about the poles who came during wwii . 
  glad they had somewhere to go . 
  and going back further , there 's jozef bem , of course . 
  thanks for the link !, 
  we also have some memorials , like this [ memorial to the city of szczecin ] ( http://21.kerulet.ittlakunk.hu/civil/131211/szent-imre-teren-elevenitettuk-fel-regi-baratsagot-lengyelekkel ) for showing solidarity during ' 56 . 
  apparently there 's also a memorial in szczecin . 
   and even hours of some events . 
  doing better than i am , then . 
   and i hope you remember us !, 
  :-) we try !, 
   you 're talking like you do n't know how to drink . 
  i do n't !, 
  two shots of vodka is my limit . 
  after three , i can only laugh , not speak . 
  but you have a point . 
  in future , i 'll assume they 're all slightly drunk , just be sure . 
  they probably have to drink to tolerate our chattiness . 
  you 're not stealing anything . 
  :-) poles also [ donated blood ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hungary%e2%80%93poland_relations#revolution_of_1956 ) to help hungary in ' 56 .

  maybe with proper education it can be done within a generation , and if saudi arabia implodes because of the low oil prices , the fucking wahhabists would lose their funding and stop being an impediment . 
  how many times did we win it ? 
  plenty , if i remember correctly . 
  go yellow !, 
  and by following the `` logic '' in your original post , not keeping nations separate means shitty life for everyone . 
  poor dutch people , i 'm actively making their country worse by working here legally ... 
   but there 's no such restriction when it comes to declaring rendk\u00edv\u00fcli \u00e1llapot , sz\u00fcks\u00e9g\u00e1llapot or vesz\u00e9lyhelyzet . 
  those can be enacted only for distinct sets of circumstances that are also defined in the constitution . 
  the reason why the new modification is dangerous is that it can be declared in case of a `` terror threat '' , and * the government can simply decide that there is a terror threat * . 
  so not wanting to give basically infinite authority to the government ( to a government which abuses even the power it currently has ) is being retarded . 
  we should just get rid of checks and balances and enact tyranny of the ( relative , mind you - the current government had a supermajority with 44 % of the votes ) majority . 
  it has worked out so well in the past , right ? 
  by the way nations in their current form are a fairly recent invention , from the 19th century . 
  most countries - including monarchies - were multinational up until that point . 
  also , even though you seem to be in love with the slippery slope fallacy , your slippery slope is rather like a slippery rollercoaster . 
  you do n't need a nation to have order . 
  you need fair and stable laws , and a police ( and similar authorities ) that can enforce them . 
  hell , even states that are not nation states can go overboard with order , just look at the soviet union . 
  but let me show you two current examples . 
  exhibit 1 : usa . 
  draconian drug laws ( until recently , and even that is only starting to change in the blue states ) , yet drug use is higher than in the fucking netherlands because the police ca n't enforce those laws consistently , and 99 % of the lawbreakings go unpunished . 
  and you ca n't find a more patriotic population than them , they are essentially brainwashed from elementary school , yet they have the highest incarceration rate in the world and a huge crime rate . 
  exhibit 2 : germany . 
  they got the patriotism beaten out of them so hard that even i say it 's a bit much , let the poor krauts love their country ffs . 
  anyway , both their incarceration rate and crime rate is significantly lower than that of the us , and while it 's probably going to increase in the near future , they have a long way to go to hit us , or even hungarian levels . 
  oh , and there is the fact that too much order will start to infringe on personal freedoms . 
  it 's all fun and games as long as it does n't take away your personal freedoms , but sooner or later it will be your turn to be the hated deviant . 
  maybe you like your occasional bowl of weed , maybe you simply smoke , maybe you like junk food , maybe once in a while you like partying until 4am , maybe you listen to punk , maybe you 're not christian , maybe you like using google , i do n't know . 
  but i like doing whatever the fuck i want as long as i 'm not hurting anyone else , thankyouverymuch . 
  edit : [ this ] ( http://imgur.com/iynsaeu ) was the comment that i replied to . 
  obviously i ca n't prove that i did n't edit the comment via developer view before taking the screenshot , so you need to take my word for it . 
  or not . 
  your choice . 
  anyway , i probably could n't produce such an edgy teenage fascist rambling even if i tried . 
  ^ ^ \\ ( at ^ ^ least ^ ^ my ^ ^ slippery ^ ^ slopes ^ ^ would ^ ^ follow ^ ^ some ^ ^ semblance ^ ^ of ^ ^ a ^ ^ logical ^ ^ order . ), 
  not since they lost a district in a midterm . 
  what * you * fail to understand is that currently they need 2/3 of the votes to enact a state of emergency . 
  with this modification , they wo n't need it , they will have the authority to declare it whenever the fuck they please for 60 days . 
  and it might be true that extending it after the 60 days requires a 2/3 , but since there is no `` cooldown period '' , they can enact it again immediately once it expires . 
  sure , the constitutional court might rule it to be against the spirit of the constit ... ooops , they neutered the constitutional court already , it ca n't reject laws on that basis and even if it could , it 's staffed with their own people . 
  does that make it a good thing ? 
  also , these rights in those countries are far more limited , they give more authority to the police but they ca n't order complete curfews , block phone networks , the internet , or the highways , and they ca n't modify the budget at-will . 
  what the fuck would be patriotic in supporting a modification of the constitution that essentially allows the government to declare a state of emergency at will and override laws ? 
  [ meanwhile on fidesz 's facebook page ] ( http://imgur.com/kevrdcr ) translation : -- the left-wing parties do n't support : * the tightening of immigration rules * dispatching policemen and soldiers to the borders * the construction of the fence now they do n't support the modification of the constitution , they do n't want to protect the country from terrorists !, 
  for us , the safety of hungarian people is the first !, 
  -- 1950s reloaded . 
  the closest translations would be `` alf\u00f6ld '' , but we 're already using it as a common noun for plains . 
  or `` m\u00e9lyf\u00f6ld '' , but it 's also a common noun ( for any land below sea level ) . 
   because women usually enter for free remember : if you 're not paying for a service , you 're the product . 
  exactly . 
  maybe if different clubs actually played somewhat different music ... for example , i 'm convinced that the 4-5 clubs in the center of maastricht where everyone goes just share a spotify playlist . 
  you can do a club-crawl and hear the same song in every single one of them . 
  budapest already is ( the famous `` ruin pubs '' are actually more like night clubs ) . 
  as a hungarian , this is very , very familiar . 
  that 's a start . 
  i assume / hope this ( and more ) is in exchange for providing a safe country where people fished out of the mediterranean can be put for processing . 
   i also do n't understand why the european union seems to be not capable of thinking about a solution where all european countries are involved . 
  it 's mostly because a ) the countries that are neither border , nor destination countries do n't want to make it their problem and b ) politicians , both from the left and the right are rather content with using the crisis for their own political goals . 
  ideological talk is free , solutions are expensive , and even recommending any expensive actual solution would be unpopular . 
  but that is not an answer to the question `` what ** could ** women do to prevent crimes like this ? '', 
  in a week it will be tens of thousands . 
  do n't worry , this is / r/europe . 
  in a week it will be 100k of them . 
  the way nuclear physics works , if it decays over millions of years , it 's not dangerous ( = it emits a low level of radiation ) . 
  the truly dangerous ones that emit a lot of radiation have short half-lives . 
  it essentially said that the capitalists can only become richer by exploiting the workers more . 
  essentially made society out to be a zero-sum-game of capitalists vs. workers , any gain made by the capitalists is a loss for workers , and the only way workers can gain anything is by taking down the capitalists . 
  turkish people were in a different situation though . 
  they were n't refugees , for one . 
  a more recent example would be the balkan wars ; most refugees were returned to their country of origin once the wars were over . 
   so , should we help those migrants which came from war-torn countries ? 
  i think we should , to the degree that wo n't significantly decrease the standard of living , unless decided differently by a popular vote ( some nations may be willing to sacrifice more of their capacities to shelter refugees ) , but some minimal humanitarianism should be mandatory . 
  helping them now would increase stability in the region in the long run . 
  after all , having hundreds of thousands of refugees who have experienced life in the west , maybe saved up a couple of thousand euros working here , had their children educated in western schools for a while , etc. . . return to syria would be much better than having them return from a turkish refugee camp uneducated , with only their clothes on their back , and having only erdogan to be grateful to . 
  it can be a country that can do the manufacturing currently done in china , maybe cheaper ( lower shipping costs ) , plus a market for european goods and services , and there will be some money to be made in the reconstruction too . 
  the refugee crisis is only a crisis because instead of solving it , politicians have used it to further their own internal ambitions . 
  both orb\u00e1n & co. and merkel & co. are guilty of this . 
  by your logic , the eu should cut off structural funds to e-europe ( because the western countries could easily spend that on themselves , improving the life of their citizens ) and ban e-european workers . 
  and since you started it : fuck you if you think that society is a zero-sum game , that 's the kind of fucked up thinking that led to fascism and communism in the first place . 
  fuck you for not being able to think of a way to improve their lives without worsening our own , and fuck you for stereotyping a whole nation as terrorists . 
   they 're not going to be able to live a good life . 
  that 's a big part of the issue . 
  they 'll form ghettos and live as second class citizens doing unregistered work , living off welfare or turning to crime . 
  which is still a better life than being stuck in a refugee camp without access to jobs ( even unregistered ones ) , education , healthcare or even safety . 
  and definitely better than going back to syria and getting killed by the army , a bombing by some superpower or isis . 
  they are likely using steganography and/or otps , both of them are trivially simple ( so even if they force makers of commercially available software to integrate some backdoors , any terrorist with minimal programming experience can whip up a small program that does n't have said backdoors ) . 
  this is again just an attempt to erode privacy disguised as a matter of national security .

  just remember march 15 2013 , the anniversary of the hungarian revolution against austrian rule when austrian snowplows had to help out as the government response only consisted of one unhelpful text message , despite the snowfall having been predicted days earlier . 
  ( `` do n't leave your vehicle . 
  if your fuel runs out , switch to another car . 
  signed : ministry of internal affairs . '' ),

  since then putin went missing and orban is a bit indisposed either . 
  modern day europeans are not domesticated , just living in law and order . 
  30 years ago yugoslavia was a modern country but there was a point when neighbours started to kill each other . 
  few years before they were surely drinking together in the pub and played poker on sundays . 
  as my uncle told me based on what he saw in 1956 `` you do n't need a gun , because when you will need one , you will get one without asking for it . '', 
  yes , but people back in the 40s could n't believe either that the civilized germans can do that . 
  i watched a show about a similar us ship on natgeo and that did n't learned it well . 
  you only find moderate ones at guantanamo . 
  it 's quite suicidal from the muslims to help to forget the holocaust . 
  if a genocide of that scale would ever happen again in europe against a minority , it 's obvious who will be the new jews : the muslims . 
  they cut the branch they are sitting on . 
  mr. juncker stated that late at night he toss and he turn and he dream of what he needs ... 
  he need an army , he is holding out for an army 'til the end of the night , it 's got ta be strong and it 's got ta be fast and it 's got ta be fresh from the fight . 
  he needs an army !, 
  `` i love rumors !, 
  facts can be so misleading , where rumors , true or false , are often revealing . '', 
   i think what you tried to say when you said what you said is that he was an informant for the soviets . 
  i 'm ready to learn how to be an informant for an economic theory , though . 
  that is how we call them in hungary and in the ex-eastern bloc countries : communist informant . 
  it is not about marx , eastern europe saw communism working in practice and those people who made it work was called themselves communists . 
  you know if someone openly declares himself a communist we should take his word for it . 
  do you mean kolontar ? 
  9 deaths , several chemical injuries and a few hundred citizen relocated from their homes ? 
  i am glad you had fun .

  i am sorry , because i do n't have time for a more detailed answer , but i would like to clear some of my points to avoid misunderstanding :  relative calm periods & collapse after 1740 there was a threat of collapse for the austrian empire in every major conflict ( 1740 , 1763 - lost influence in germany , 1790-1815 , 1849 , 1866 , 1914 ) and they survived most of the time because the international community wanted to preserve the empire . 
  ofc they survived the calm periods , empires usually do n't collapse in peacetime and without the ww1 they would be still be here to stir things . 
   monocausal history i did n't want to say anything like that . 
  all i wanted to say is that without the ottoman pressure there would n't have been multinational empires in central europe . 
   after karlovitz 1699 ( at the latest after the treaty of belgrade 1739 ) the ottoman empire posed no real threat i agree . 
  but after that the international community always saved the habsburgs ' throne , because of the european balance of power or a good marriage ( 1810 ) or because of conservativism and the divine right of the monarchs ( 1849 ) . 
  yes . 
  because of that and the war of the spanish succession they ended up with central and eastern european territories with different laws and customs and they were struggled with creating a unified state for centuries . 
  after the war of the austrian succession they were always on the verge of collapse and survived until 1918 only thanks to the international politics . 
  the habsburg and jagellonian monarchy or the empire of matthias corvinus were created only because of the ottomans . 
  without them the different estates would have never accept the unification and a multinational empire . 
  100 years ago it caused a world war , but today ... hungary sent several police units to balkan countries to help them with the immigration , slovak , polish etc. 
  policemen arrived to hungary with the same goal , hungaroring always has a mixed hungarian , slovak , polish , austrian , romanian police force , there are also foreign police officers at the lake balaton in the summer and hungarian policemen patrol the croatian coast during vacation season etc. 
  so it 's fairly common . 
  short answer : it was because of turkey . 
  detailed answer : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/german_question, 
  yep , what you gon na do when they come for you ? 
  [ hungarian situation ] ( http://www.police.hu/sites/default/files/styles/large/public/images/20162704141218.jpg?itok=uto_bu0u ), 
  exactly . 
  europe was n't full that time . 
  book of the week : a race for purity - the history of the german beer by max mustermann, 
   britain contained some of the most developed areas outside of italy . 
  more developed than africa , lybia , egypt , asia , galatia , cilicia , cyprus , judea , syria , cappadocia , pontus , bythinia , macedonia , achaea , sicilia , narbonensis , baetica , just to name a few . 
  sure . 
  we will rename it gondor on the day when aragorn von habsburg returns , right after prime steward orban jumped out of the parliament 's window . 
  it 's just a matter of time , now that mordor released a great darkness toward canada . 
  that is what the romanians say when they run out of honey : `` bye-oh-honey ! '', 
  i tasted it when i was a kid and i can tell you it 's not for kids or at least not for central european kids , mainly because of the black olives . 
  but i will try it again sometime , because french meals are usually good , so maybe it was me who was n't ready for this . 
  a really hungarian pizza is the [ piedone pizza ] ( https://falatozz.hu/kepek/receptek/000/065/400x/piedone-pizza.jpg ) which is made with marinara sauce , onion , bean , cheese , bacon and mozzarella and it clearly shows the hungarian people 's deep feelings towards bud spencer and his [ beans with onion ] ( https://youtu.be/c0itxq-ftls?t=1m39s ) . 
  i see . 
  then the most popular here is the sour cream and cheese topping , yoghurt is not widely used . 
  but you can put nearly anything on a langos , from ketchup to nutella . 
  sometimes they wrap a hotdog in langos dough , but only really hungry hungarians can eat that . 
  all you need for a langos is flour , yeast , water , salt and some sugar and milk for the yeast , so yes , these are pretty cheap ingredients . 
  based on what i read when i googled the pictures i think that the mcd european hq chooses a plan and they use it for some years everywhere in europe . 
  so for example , a medium size mcd in dublin built in 2006 is nearly identical to every same size mcd built in the same year anywhere in europe .

  no , that is made for mcdonalds ( and a fuel station , maybe ) only . 
  it 's in batumi , georgia and it 's really unique and also very cool inside .

  thanks , i saw this one , only i could n't find a bigger pic , that 's why i chose the other one . 
  this is a really nice one , much better than the average green-brown combo . 
  the < 75 part is far too general . 
  i think [ this one ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/images/a/a7/regional_disparities_in_gross_domestic_product_%28gdp%29_per_inhabitant%2c_in_purchasing_power_standard_%28pps%29%2c_by_nuts_level_2_region%2c_2013_%28%c2%b9%29_%28%25_of_the_eu-28_average%2c_eu-28_%3d_100%29_ryb15.png ) is more informative . 
  if you have some better pictures or pictures of a unique mcd from your country , please feel free to post it . 
  what is your fav chocolate ? 
  mainly the not real chocolates like mars , snickers , twix , kit-kat etc. 
  what is the best chocolate in your country ? 
  if you mean best local brand , it 's [ boci ] ( http://www.nestle.hu/brands/edessegek/boci ) , otherwise it 's obviously toblerone . 
  my main problems concerning the hungarian chocolate market are : every hungarian `` premium '' chocolate is full with alcohol and nestle crunch is no longer available here . 
  edit : youtube user [ emmymadeinjapan ] ( https://www.youtube.com/user/emmymadeinjapan/featured ) tasted hungarian sweets 3 times [ [ 1 ] ( https://youtu.be/_kny2kia9nm ) ] . 
  ( i think over the years she tasted almost all local european candies . ), 
  translation : `` man from the audience ran to the stage to defend antigone - the audience of the bethlen square theatre witnessed an awesome scene : a man could not stand to watch the flogging of [ antigone ] ( http://www.sparknotes.com/drama/antigone/summary.html ) and he rushed to the stage to rescue the greek heroine . 
  `` you ca n't hurt her any longer ! '', 
  said the well dressed cca . 
  45-50 years old man , while he threw himself on the actor who played the guard . 
  the surreal case was told to szinhaz.hu by tamas g. egressy , the leader of the spirita group , who was also threatened by the man when tried to intervene . 
  `` are you a dictator ? 
  i 'll kill you ! '', 
  groaned the man and he tried to grab egressy 's arm . 
  he was banned from the theatre . 
  the whole audience and the members of the group watched the man in stunned silence . 
  the music was stopped , the lights went on and two employees escorted the man out of the theater and not allowed him to return .

  not much about police beating hippies , but about society relating to hippies . 
  my father was a hippy in hungary in the late 60 's . 
  he lived in another city , minding his business while his parents thought he is studying at the university , which he apparently did not ( much ) . 
  my grandma told me , when he came home once in a flower printed shirt and with long hair then my granddad decided to take this in his own hands . 
  he never let my dad go back , took him off the uni . 
  he has grabbed my dad and took him to the first place that was hiring in the small town . 
  which was a restaurant , looking for dishwashers . 
  my dad then went to `` normal mode '' and two decades later he has owned the same restaurant that once hired him as dishwasher . 
  he has never lost his hippy spirit though ; he closed the restaurant every saturday evening and let an alternative music club arranging their parties in the emptied rooms . 
  it 's more like a fear of someones , not a threat , not even in speeches of the governing parties . 
  i can still well imagine that ultras use this rhetoric . 
  but i am not an ultra , nor is the vast majority of hungary , who are , honestly , care not much of romania . 
  is he talking shit about romania ? 
  seriously . 
  cameron is calling you stealing homeless gypsies and you still love uk . 
  orban is , as i see , does not mention romanians in his speeches or not in negative context . 
  he is addressing his speeches to hungarians living outside hu . 
  which may still piss off anyone who is native in that country . 
  i would be pissed off too . 
  but for clarity , it is better to say that you hate hungarians because you dont like how hungary relates to hungarians outside the border . 
  no more no less . 
  i sense double standard in your reasonings . 
  you wrote above that you guys love uk , regardless of what their politicians are saying about romanians . 
  here you reason with a politician for hatred against amother nation . 
  i do believe it is not just orban , but a much deeper hatred . 
  no idea why , romania is not much talked about in hungary , and typically not in negative context . 
  i mean , your excess hatred is rather on directional . 
  edit : typo, 
  pilsudski is considered as a great polish politician in hungary ... 
  i have never heard of his dirty businesses . 
  in hungary , before 1989 in the communist era , there was a law that `` everyone capable to work , must work '' and whoever did not work , was sent to prison . 
  also the police was quite heavy handed that time . 
  this has kind of loosened up the gipsy communities and allowed some sort of integration with the rest of the society . 
  gipsy kids were going to school , adults were working , although often took low wage simple jobs . 
  this attitude had some momentum even after the communist regime broke in 1989 . 
  my dad had a restaurant in the 90s and had quite a few gipsy employees . 
  kitchen staff , waiters etc. 
  they did the job , got the payment , like everyone else . 
  noone in my proximity has treated them differently and they returned with goodwill . 
  things got worse later , due to rising unemployment and emerging racism . 
  now you surprise me . 
  i ca n't remember learning anything of him , mostly about matthias who has ruled the same age . 
  well the curriculum may change continously ( and my memories are fading too ), 
  hungarian here . 
  i dare to say that there is no negative feeling here against modern russia . 
  kind of neutral . 
  certainly noone likes what soviets did here , but , well , its over so it 's better to look forward . 
  so what is better then ? 
  depression and shame ? 
  are n't you proud of being finnish ? 
  i think national pride shall not be the same as nationalism . 
  the latter i deny . 
  however i really do not mind if slovaks , poles , romanians and hungarians and whoever else around are proud of that little , but hopefully growing results of their efforts . 
  so why do you think hu is supporting croatia 's migration to eu ? 
  the scenario that you mentioned is almost unlikely next to impossible , if you see it realistically . 
  yes . 
  sea ... 
  i like how sweden has transformed l\u00e1ngos to its taste with the shrimps topping . 
  kudos  once you might just try the original one , with plenty of crushed garlic . 
  i am just speculating , but i think that the language similarity between romanian and french makes france a favored destination for romanian gypsies . 
  still it does not justify france 's bold attitude on the issue . 
  so what then , will they distinguish people on their origin and race ? 
  bright future , indeed . 
  hungary is checking in !, 
  pm me , 
  good . 
  [ guly\u00e1sleves ] ( http://www.nosalty.hu/files/imagecache/img-421x289-v/recept_kepek/tradicionalis-gulyasleves.jpg ) ( spicy beef soup with potatoes and paprika ), 
  thanks for the info about the movies . 
  i have not seen any of these . 
  my favourite of his historical novels is turms the immortal , but i read the johannes and mikael series too and sinuhe , and the secret of the kingdom and the roman as well . 
  i have read two palmu detective stories and the chinese kitten too , possibly that 's all ... waltari is really a great storyteller !, 
  i did check it now and found [ this ] ( http://tudasbazis.sulinet.hu/hu/magyar-nyelv-es-irodalom/irodalom/irodalmi-animaciok-szimulaciok/irodalom-9-10/a-kalevala-mitologiai-apparatusanak-szarmazasi-rendje ) ( in hungarian ) . 
  its grade 8 elementary school material . 
  it may happen that it is not mandatory. , though . 
  well , i learned it 30 years ago . 
  focus of the studies is certainly changing by the time . 
  it was a more pagan time you know , nowadays i guess the focus is on the christian version of the story . 
  in hungary the finnish kalevala is the part of the elementary school curriculum . 
  we should not learn it by heart but had to read it and analyze parts of the epic . 
  i still remember that the world was meant to be made of a mallard 's egg . 
  sharing some ancient words with hungarian , for ex . 
  kala - hal ( fish ) , voi - vaj ( butter ) * antifreeze refill every fridays evening * has a significant swedish minority , some parts of finland accept swedish as second official language * they had fierce battles against soviets to defend the homeland in wwii * mika waltari and his super thick historical novels oh !, 
  also his children - and detective stories are enjoyable . 
  i suspect its due to plenty of immigrant workers in the tourism industry from slovakia and hungary . 
  i have worked at a software development company in hungary that was owned and managed by swedes . 
  the programmers gave `` funny '' code names to software components and use these in the english users manuals . 
  stuff like `` geci '' as graphical editor for configuration interface ( read : sperm ) or `` segg '' as software editor for graphical gadgets ( read : ass ) were quite common . 
  i do not know how the swedish manager got suspicious but the end of the story is that he has been in looking for each new abbreviation in the above mentioned alternative dictionary till the guys stopped being creative with the naming . 
  this poverty is astonishing . 
  i do not know what is the solution for this . 
  but it is certainly not [ building city walls ] ( http://www.economist.com/blogs/easternapproaches/2013/07/slovaks-and-roma ) nor [ exempt ] ( http://rt.com/news/france-gypsies-camps-dismantle-406/ ) or [ shooting ] ( http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1895255,00.html ) . 
  then let 's just keep this belief  probably the vast majority of non-hungarians think that attila the hun was hungarian . 
  which is , indeed , highly debatable . 
  then you may just add [ peter mansfeld ] ( http://www.budapestdailyphoto.com/index.php/2009/09/16/mansfeld-peter ) too . 
  fought in the 1956 revolution as a 15 years old kid , got captured and kept in prison till he got 18 , old enough to execute him . 
  attila the hun, 
  * hungary 's involvement in the prague spring on the side of soviets . 
  * being the last european ally of germany in wwii, 
  i really can not list any victorious wars in the last 500 years of my country . 
  so here is a recent `` achievement '' i am proud of as hungarian : rubik 's cube,

  i do n't agree with the clothing part i think i have lots of german , swedish , japanese stuff ( all of them made in china and se asia i guess ) in my normcore wardrobe but not that much american one . 
  well i wear an oakley which is awesome so i got ta give them that ( but i 've mostly had italian glasses before that ) . 
  and [ tokyo ] ( http://famouswonders.com/wp-content/gallery/mount-fuji/mount-fuji-and-tokyo.jpg ) ( fuji is like 120 km from the city center ), 
  is n't that a cupcake upside down though ? 
  if we want to really split hairs , a 52 % -48 % results means 4 percentage point difference , which is 8.3 % difference so be careful with the nomenclature , math and stats nazis are watching !, 
  said `` independence '' is just a political game and contributes nothing towards humanity as a whole apart from slowing down advancements . 
  space exploration is quite the opposite . 
  but anyways , esa and eu are completely different organizations and parting one does n't affect the relations with the other . 
  that is beautiful , thanks for sharing . 
  thanks for the link . 
  this means that there was a giant jump in suzuki sales between 2014 and 2016 . 
  interesting !, 
  i think the data is outdated . 
  it was the most popular small family car in the 2000s , i am not sure that is true anymore . 
  it was very cheap ( locally produced ) so people went with it . 
  but it is not that cheap anymore . 
  the data i could find with a quick googling : * in 2014 , they sold 67.476 new cars in hungary . 
  the top 5 models : skoda octavia ( 3971 ) , ford focus ( 2595 ) , opel astra ( 2431 ) , dacia duster ( 1960 ) , vw golf ( 1945 ) . 
  * among all the registered cars in 2015 , the top5 : opel ( 451k ) , suzuki ( 404k ) , vw ( 304k ) , ford ( 256k ) , renault ( 204k ) . 
  ford , skoda and opel is very much driven by the corporate fleets while suzuki , dacia , vw is more popolar among people . 
  i think the data on the map is at least a few years old . 
  10-15 years ago , hungarian roads were literally full of swifts that is visibly not true anymore . 
  edit : summoning / u/moustachejoe here also for more visibility , 
  you should convert that into freedom units , he wo n't get the message unless it 's in mpg . 
  i do n't have most of my proper photos edited and shared online because i am way too busy and lazy but here are some random ones on instagram : [ helsinki , finland ] ( https://www.instagram.com/p/blubs3mbtzh/ ) [ trieste , italy ] ( https://www.instagram.com/p/blhqe0mb-oi/ ) [ warsaw , poland ] ( https://www.instagram.com/p/bifymrwdhm2/ ) [ vintgar , slovenia ] ( https://www.instagram.com/p/blkcemlbt8g/ ) [ tatras , poland ( around slovak border ) ] ( https://www.instagram.com/p/bhsgqnkb2yj/ ) [ lake balaton , hungary ] ( https://www.instagram.com/p/bddrim8qslk/ ) [ florence , italy ] ( https://www.instagram.com/p/bcxxageqsq_/ ) [ toledo , spain ] ( https://www.instagram.com/p/bb-eja3kstb/ ) [ gdansk , poland ] ( https://www.instagram.com/p/bh7idkuhzvg/ ) edit : i guess all of these are favorite and maybe more . 
  all of these places are beautiful and since i 've left the old continent for a longer time in october , they already make me nostalgic . 
  traveling is the best fucking thing ever , i am glad it is fairly affordable within most part of eu and i am fortunate enough to be able to afford it . 
  you can scroll through my instagram i 've been to quite a few places in the past 3 years from stockholm to naples , from madrid to kiev ( now i live in japan ) . 
  comments are welcome , i always wanted to improve my photography skills but too lazy to put the proper amount of effort in . 
  also known as : how to transfer large areas of land from one shithole to several more shitholes * ^ ^ and ^ ^ austria * ^ ^ / s, 
  it is definitely the other way around in hungary . 
  i was in helsinki before i left europe for good in october . 
  only for one day but i wish it had been at least 3 or 4 days , i really loved the city . 
  did n't have time to go out drinking but next time . 
  heard stories from a friend who works at abb and visits helsinki from time to time . 
  that 's more of a slovak thing though , is n't it ? 
  not that i have anything against parenyica , i love it  now , that i have limited access to cheese , i 'd take anything honestly !, 
  back in hungary i ' v always kept some euros at home - you know , if things go south , i need some hard currency to get a train ticket to vienna and some more for at least a few day 's worth of sausage . 
  is n't this statement a bit meta-racist though ? 
  can we compare that with speed limit compliance and drunk driving prevalence ? 
  they are memorials . 
  there are other wwii and wwi memorials in almost every town among other memorials from other dark times . 
  that 's how these should be treated and respected but nothing more . 
  most of these memorials have not much to do with nationalism , nationalist people are the ones who are generating the nationalist obsessions and they should just be ignored and not even talked about . 
  not really , the guys i know most opposing bitching about trianon and cut the conversation immediately if it comes up are the hungarians from outside of hungary . 
  they got over it decades ago , only the ones stayed inside are whining about it . 
   there is almost none magyar language used before that year just because the language of the king 's court and the language of the literate elite was latin , does n't mean hungarian language was n't used . 
  as a matter of fact it was widely used for almost a thousand years before that . 
  that 's true , i never stated otherwise . 
  but it does n't change the fact that large portion of the population feel like that . 
  no they 're not . 
  they were the soviets and these are the russians so some consider them a completely different bunch . 
  and it was n't really the worst dictatorship of the hungarian people ( there were worse in the middle ages ) - somewhat the opposite ; after ' 56 , hungary was probably in best shape in the eastern bloc . 
  lots of my grandparents ' and parents ' generation would rather go back to the [ kadar system ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/j%c3%a1nos_k%c3%a1d%c3%a1r ) rather than the current one . 
  i do n't have time to look up polls but they are worthless anyway . 
  and media is out of touch with reality just as the `` 90 % chance that hillary will win '' media , they do n't have a clue how people live and think in rural hungary . 
  people voted a party to absolute majority ( twice ! ), 
  which is populist , openly anti-liberal , eu-sceptic and not only stole their pension funds but one time put a russian flag on the parliament building . 
  that 's the best poll you can get if you ask me . 
  and the strongest opposition party is a far-right nationalist party backed by the russians - one of their leaders openly cheered for the crimea annexation . 
  no , most of their voters would n't say yes to a silly question like `` do you support a russian rule over hungary '' . 
  but they would definitely say putin if they asked `` merkel or putin '' . 
  so that support might be dormant but it is there . 
  yeah , they are called oshiya and there were similar staff at the nyc subway also a few decades back . 
  but these stories are a distortion of tokyo ( as lots of stuff in western media ) and they are not widespread , it 's not like every station is like that all the time . 
  and does n't change the fact that the tokyo metro and train system is a bloody amazing and freakishly effective system . 
  it moves about the population of poland every day around an area of the size of slovenia . 
  i live in tokyo , i take a train to work which is supposedly running at 160 % capacity during rush hour . 
  and it is definitely better than some of the rush hour buses i used to take back in europe . 
  and this allows the streets to be less busy , i have n't seen a traffic jam in tokyo ( though i 'm not moving around the business district where i suppose more people use cars ) . 
   did the people forget how the soviets ass raped hungary back in ' 56 ? 
  they kindof did . 
  old people are nostalgic how much better life was back then in the 60s and 70s , middle aged people are just simply hatin ' on brussels because all the regulations and migrants and who knows what . 
  and some of them are just like all eu leaders are bureaucrat schmucks and putin is the real deal , he is not messing around ( which is kindof true ) . 
  i mean , this is probably not the majority but a significant percentage of the population . 
  our quite strong far right nationalist party , jobbik , is also pro-russia , big time . 
  he _ is _ pro-putin and pro-trump , no question about that . 
  as is a huge portion of the population . 
  whether that 's dangerous or not is open for interpretation . 
  then it is not the best . 
  the best ones can easily handle it ( e.g. 
  yeah maybe , though that depends on the city and means of transportation . 
  it 's not like you have to live under the same roof with every single one of them , 
  it matters in a way that measures how much people _ want _ to leave . 
  granted , lots of them just saying it and will never do it . 
  but a good portion them will leave the country if they can . 
  lots of those who want will never able , especially on the eastern part where some just can not afford the costs of moving or can not leave relatives behind because they have to care for them . 
  if the people who want to leave doubles , i bet that the number of people who _ actually _ leave will increase significantly in 3-5 years . 
  i myself always said i will leave my county 3 , 4 , 5 years ago .

  the only way to really enjoy these countries . 
  you 're not into daily politics and news , you probably mostly meet like-minded people , you probably make shitloads more money than the locals and you can go home any time to your home country if you choose so . 
  and if you 're there only for a couple years , it is way easier to get over shit than for those who stuck there for their lives . 
  ( no , i do n't have anything against lodz specifically , never been there , though i consider warsaw to be one of the greatest cities on earth , even beats some canadian places i 've been to , 
  how creepy is that [ this track ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u9dg-g7t2l4 ) just started playing seconds before i was scrolling down to your comment , almost in perfect sync . 
  yeah that might be true  and our first president after the soviet rule was a freedom-fighter previously imprisoned by the soviets , wwii pow survivor , poet , writer and the translator of lord of the rings , 2001 space odyssey , among other things . 
  it 's been downhill since him : /, 
  well , still better than the previous one who plagiarized his phd and was total ass about it and even though he resigned in the end , he still has many public titles , awards and whatnot . 
  oh yeah , and there was a racist right-wing ex-communist temporary one between the two for a month or so . 
  but actually this one is pretty ok . people not really care about him that much , the ruling party appointed him and he pretty much just signs the laws the party comes up with and that 's all .

  allow me to explain - elon musk is a rounding error in the great scheme of things - shall we deny one hundred million people basic income if we know there is a billionaire among them ? 
  i am surprised it 's only 68 % actually . 
  i mean if you are asked `` would you like free money '' how many people would say no ? 
  that 's also a reason why many countries ca n't have referendums on monetary policies . 
  personally , i think it 's doable , just damn hard . 
  yes and yes,

  why would anyone call ivanka beast ? 
  c'mon , she 's not that ugly . 
   this anti-russia/pro-russia dichotomy there was a recent survey on attitudes of hungarians vs eu and russia . 
  more than 50 % of orban 's supporters support both getting closer to eu ** and ** at the same time getting closer to russia . 
  i guess the campaign strategists are scratching their heads really hard now . 
   he just said `` not in my backyard '' . 
  he said not in my backyard after v4 proposal was rejected and the eu consensus was `` let everyone in then distribute them '' . 
  kind reminder that hungary was also supposed to be one of the hotspots which we would n't had liked . 
   orban did n't offer any proposals to create a european border security you mean like this : https://visegradpost.com/en/2016/04/19/orbans-schengen-2-0-proposition/, 
  i start by noting you provide exactly ** zero ** evidence on your list of alternative facts . 
  feel free to provide sources if you find any , lol . 
   was talking about before he closed the borders . 
  before that , he let hundreds of thousands strand , strand where ? 
  at no moment in time there were `` hundreds of thousands '' in hungary ** at the same time **  without germany and austria , there would have been thousands dead on the streets of budapest and hungary as a whole care to elaborate who would had died and why ? 
  i also suggest you read this to refresh your memory : http://www.zeit.de/gesellschaft/2016-08/refugees-open-border-policy-september-2015-angela-merkel/komplettansicht  orban , again , bussed masses of people to the austrian border make up your mind were they stranded or bussed ? 
   his party was not elected by a majority if by majority you mean 50 % on the list votes you are right . 
  his party got 44.8 % of list votes the next coalition got 25.5 - he would have had a comfy majority in parliament even if he would n't had changed the system . 
  source : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hungarian_parliamentary_election,_2014, 
  no offense , but you are very wrong on almost everything . 
   how a critical look at oneself leads to advancement it depends on what is the purpose of the critical look . 
  when the purpose of the critique is purely deconstructionist without proposing much in place there wo n't be so much advancement . 
  fun fact : he never uses the term `` illiberal democracy '' in his speech , he talks of `` illiberal state '' . 
  he also states :  we needed to state that a democracy is not necessarily liberal . 
  just because something is not liberal , it still can be a democracy and  it does not deny foundational values of liberalism , as freedom , etc. 
  and  ... one that will of course still respect values of christianity , freedom and human rights . 
  those duties and values that i enumerated should be fulfilled and be respected and for people unaware of the context : it was mostly economical . 
  i ca n't really argue with you interpreting things in whichever way you chose - did you read the infamous speech ? 
  also call me optimist but any comparisons with turkey are very far fetched imo . 
  except that he meant something else by illiberal democracy - read his speech . 
  how much do you wan na pay ? 
  i 'll gladly import romania 's anti-corruption chief in exchange . 
  it 's not more complicated for an european one - it just takes time and a lot of audits . 
  also ceu has ~ 10-20 % hungarian students aka 100-200 people/year . 
  i would n't really consider them as competition . 
   unfair advantage over other hungarian universities unfair in which sense ? 
   if soros wants to have a university in hungary , he can found it just like everyone else he has one already - kke . 
   circumventing the hungarian law yes , the law which was changed 2 weeks ago ... 
  problem is 80 % of the students get only us diplomas . 
  this means not only ceu is registered in us but also that they are ** accredited ** to give us diplomas . 
  any university in europe - could apply for accreditation in us but is a long and tough process . 
  why should it be hungary 's concern who does usda accredits ? 
   rrom is only used in romania nope , we use roma in hungary as well nb . 
  the hungarian `` a '' is a different vowel than the romanian `` a '' - romania is written `` rom\u00e1nia '' so noone would confuse them   i hope is not the same reason why they are so obsessed with calling every gipsy a romanian even when they are not . 
  here 's the bad news : western people could n't care less about ee views on citizenship/nationality/ethnicity . 
  brits and others will use what 's written in the passport and wo n't ask hey , are you a true romanian/hungarian/eean or a gipsy ? 
  was there some major corruption event which caused the protest or the social tensions reached the boiling point ? 
  afaik gypsies always called themselves rrom in their language . 
  so it 's not like they redefine themselves . 
  it 's the same as when we call ourselves magyar whereas the rest of the planet calls us hungarians . 
  and sorry , i am not buying the idea that someone decided to call them roma just to confuse the rest of the planet . 
  and less loud than the spanish . 
  i ca n't think of any negative stereotype either . 
   in romania they call themselves tigans ( gypsies ) you sure ? 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/romani_people#romani_usage imo is just an unfortunate coincidence , not a conspiracy, 
   all eastern european nations have negative feelings about the eu . 
  ~ ~ huh ? 
  eu is viewed more favorably in ee than in we ~ ~ edit : moral of the story read the whole post before commenting . 
  we allow ~ 60-70 daily to apply for asylum . 
  you are absolutely correct but in this case we have conflicting laws & regulations - i think the detention or not is not a law but a regulation , otherwise we 'd be sued out of existence . 
  on one hand we are supposed to protect schengen - on another the current interpretation of the regulation is that if someone comes at the border and says `` i am a refugee '' we 're supposed to fingerprint and take a picture then put him in an open camp . 
  good luck finding them later . 
  after bataclan we actually got some flack for allowing some of the attackers to go via hungary . 
  so we shall not detain anyone but not allow them to pass either . 
  makes perfect sense . 
  at the same time the eu citizens have to wait 4-5 hours at the border because the commission is out of touch with reality . 
  and while 're we 're at rules : those people should n't be sent to hungary in the first place , but to greece . 
   he likes to use eu as a boogeyman not the eu but the european commission ( juncker/brussels ) . 
  concluding that being anti commission is anti-eu is like saying that being anti-orban is anti hungarian . 
   and he started a campaign to change that which one ? 
  the anti brussels one is ongoing since 2-3 years . 
  ginious is the right spelling in glorious balkans !, 
  serious answer , also for / u/anarchotech : orban repeatedly said hungary 's place is in europe . 
  he never , ever even remotely mentioned the possibility of a huxit . 
  heck not even jobbik ( which were burning custom made flamable eu flags few years back ) does n't want it . 
  in politics you will never win if you try to push the electorate into what they do n't want - 70 % of hungary 's population has a good or very good opinion of eu , the trust in eu is higher than the trust in our government . 
  this being told - i see a lot of binary thinking here , some comments even implying that the only possible way the net money receivers are allowed to behave is in absolute obeity . 
  otherwise we 're ungrateful asses , blah , blah . 
  orban is criticizing some proposals of the european commission . 
  that does n't means he wants out . 
  criticism is currently related to : forced migrant relocation plans , price of utilities , the proposal on mandatory minimum wages for ee people . 
  this can be all legitimate concerns . 
  what is distasteful is that he is using this issue in a propaganda way - my guess is to win the next elections .

  fidesz shares their lack of compassion , but opni became kind of a symbolic issue , so the current government tries to reopen it . 
  east germany is depopulating , as the jobs are in the west . 
  east germany has both a lower fertility rate , and lower proportion of young people as west germany . 
  crime might not be as bad as in detriot , but the depopulation and the lack of jobs is similar . 
  is this good enough ? 
  and also because the usd is more accepted around the world than the eur so you can print yourself out of a crisis . 
  turkey is a bad example , they ban wearing even headscarfes in government buildings . 
  they banned the fez too . 
  will daycare centers provide you privacy , if that 's where you register ? 
  i prefer normal blogs . 
  actually many hungarian politicians use blogs , much fewer use twitter . 
   when the eu funds , for example , a new bridge in romania , there are clauses that specify that equipment must be bought from european companies , the maintenance contracts must also be given to europeans etc. 
  that can mean romanian companies too , since they 're in the eu . 
  does israel have to buy from european companies ? 
  it would be much stronger restriction than in case of romania . 
   is the turquoise land that touches russia supposed to be hungary ? 
  no , it 's the greyish one north-west from the balkanic country ( which is the european part of the ottoman empire ) . 
  the problem is that hungary was represented as a sovereign state ( it was n't since 1526 ) , but it went from the ottomans directly to the habsburgs . 
  well , they could n't get the habsburg monarchy right either , and it had existed for far longer . 
  the thing is , eu agencies storing the metadata was not a secret , it 's been a law for almost 10 years . 
  the more worrying part is reading the content of e-mails . 
   well , i am against xenophobia and generalisations , but i would never go as far as to extend the blame to society . 
  i think it was sarcasm . 
  flair up !, 
  yep . 
  we had [ communism-light ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/goulash_communism ) . 
  but only after [ 1956 . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hungarian_revolution_of_1956 ) hungary was also the place where the iron curtain first fell . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/b%c3%a9la_kun#later_career  one bitter repercussion was the association of hungary 's jews with the suffering inflicted by the communists ; since kun and most of his colleagues were clearly jewish , [ 15 ] many hungarians recognized a jewish element in the bolshevist conspiracy afoot in central europe . 
  of course a lot of jewish property was also nationalized by the various communist governments , and they also suffered from the general discrimination against religious people . 
  well , it 's mix of traditional 19th century antisemitism , a chip on the shoulder because of m\u00e1ty\u00e1s r\u00e1kosi and b\u00e9la kun , and an overdose of ' 30-ies nostalgia . 
  i 've seen this a lot on spar store-brand products . 
   horthy the guy responsible for those roma , jewish , slovakian , romanian deaths during the war , is getting statues erected in his honor and is respected by the right , orban included . 
  horthy deported the jewish refugees that came here from germany , but he defended the jews with hungarian citizenship as long as he was in power . 
   there are a of romanians who remember the 1940s , and not very fondly . 
  there is a strong victim mentality on both sides . 
  yeah , but messing with hungarians ( and germans ) was government policy too . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bene%c5%a1_decrees http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/czechoslovak-hungarian_population_exchange, 
  in handwriting it 's written with straight dashes . 
  but as gerusz said , it would make certain letters do big too look good in print . 
  showing them who is the boss . 
  because more immigrants speak english than german . 
  also uk had historically more lenient immigration policy . 
  i say we go back to communism because it works with the current people . 
  please tell , where can we get better people ? 
  there was low crime , no homelessness , no drug problems , no unemployment . 
  but it was propped up by foreign loans , the system could n't sustain itself economically , that 's why it crumbled . 
  hungary is a republic too , there 's still a crown in the coat of arms . 
  that 's the joke . 
  it 's worthless frozen land . 
  it was n't a colony , it was part of kingdom of hungary . 
  felvid\u00e9k was just a geographical term anyway . 
  are you sure it 's not r/spacedicks ? 
  yeah , and we 've seen how safe these applets are ... https://threatpost.com/en_us/blogs/oracle-rushes-emergency-java-update-patch-mcrat-vulnerabilities-030413, 
  on the other hand gmail does n't let you include . exe files , even in compressed archives . 
  is n't it strange ? 
  i think it would be simpler to make it a loan , and if you stay you can write off - let 's say - 40 % of the payment from your personal income tax . 
  that way going abroad and coming back could be handled more flexibly , not with this all or nothing scheme . 
  on the other hand , hungary pays less into the eu budget than it gets back : most of the university renovations are done with eu grant money . 
  the grammar is pretty similar actually e.g. 
  tenses , passive speech , fixed word order . 
  is ( i kid you not ) used as an interjection such as `` really ? '', 
  i 'm not sure what you mean here , but if it 's `` bazdmeg '' then it would be translated to `` fuck that '' . 
   you spell it as you speak it , and you speak it as you spell it . 
  ( take that , french , german , english , ... ) mostly true . 
  one exception is `` ly '' vs `` j '' . 
  they sound exactly the same , and if you fuck that up , it means you 're `` uneducated '' . 
  fortunately there are not that many words with `` ly '' , around 20 that 's commonly used . 
  how do rich people get rich anyway ? 
  either they did something dirty or they inherited it . 
  after the fall of communism former factory and land owners all got a compensation . 
  they did the same with the church except the church opted for giving away many of its buildings to state schools in exchange for a regular monetary compensation . 
  at least that how it happened in hungary . 
   in the case of my brother , it 's over-tipping that they have to put up with . 
  / r/firstworldproblems, 
  he already filtered out `` shirt '' . 
   under the previous rules , parliament 's legal committees would assess the requests and issue a non-binding approval or rejection before a mandatory vote in the chamber . 
   with the changes approved on tuesday , parliament would not need to vote if the committees reject the requests from prosecutors . 
  i think the law is similar in hungary as well . 
  you described 99 % of country specific subreddits . 
  it does n't mean anything else besides german . 
  wikipedia says it 's of slavic origin : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/n%c3%a9met `` but another theory states that rather these words are derived from the name of the nemetes tribe , [ 28 ] [ 29 ] which is derived from the celtic root nemeto - . 
  [ 30 ] [ 31 ] '' http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/slavic_peoples#ethnonym, 
  in hungarian we have the word `` sv\u00e1b '' too , but it only refers to german minorities living in hungary . 
  we call the germans `` n\u00e9met '' . 
  and they have much more casualties than the us army and have no chance to overthrow the us government . 
  automatic weapons are banned , semi-automatics are allowed . 
   and that gypsies sent their children on the street to beg this thing actually exists . 
  you must have had a very sheltered life . 
  you can only get a black flag if you 're dead . 
  then you must be an untrustworthy double agent . 
  if they had smartphone with gps , they would n't have missed the continent in the first place .

  bring them back to turkey ? 
   he also only expected about 500-1000 people . 
  that 's a really stupid excuse .

  you should write it down in ms office , developed by a hungarian , or send me a letter written by a ballpoint pen aka biro , invented by a hungarian .

  ### hungary `` hungary was very lucky , because despite the fact that the usual winds would cover the country with a radiation cloud , the actual wind took it to western europe '' - said sandor pellet , deputy director of the radiobiology and radiation health research institute of hungary in 2011 , on the 25th anniversary . 
  because of this in hungary no special protective measures were taken . 
  the soviet leadership tried to hide the disaster , but after sweden warned about the radioactive clouds , it was impossible to conceal the accident for a long time . 
  part of hungary first heard about the accident from the austrian and yugoslavian tvs . 
  on the morning after the disaster , after saw the pollution in the collected data , some employees of the central research institute for physics , budapest called several kindergartens and nurseries across the country on street payphone , to alert teachers to `` a strong solar radiation that can be harmful to children . '', 
  from the kindergartens the warning spread throughout the country . 
  on april 28 ivan bedo , chief editor of the hungarian radio 's news announced the disaster , after he heard it from the bbc radio news . 
  the higher authorities stopped the transmission and bedo received a penalty . 
  due to a travel ban introduced in several european countries for soviet vehicles , hungarian truckers transported the goods from the soviet union to europe , mainly through kiev . 
  many of them received most significant radiation dose during the trip , many of them died within a few years . 
  however , the reasons did not show a clear correlation with the radiation . 
  it is undeniable that the truck drivers died remarkably early , but officially not because of the radiation . 
  that means broadband over power line in oradea in a few years . 
  wow . 
  is n't that because of zoltan teszari 's rcs & rds ( aka digi ) ? 
  in hungary the real drop in prices and increase in speed started , when digi first attacked upc and t-com . 
  that is because ~ ~ the ~ ~ zoltan teszari 's rcs & rds ( aka digi ) does n't attack upc and t-com in western europe . 
  according to my highly educated google search ( and i am a russian expert , as i saw russian people several times ) : vladimir : russian speakers understood and understand the meaning as `` world ruler '' , putin : `` someone who goes along the way '' . 
  wow . 
  creepy . 
  orban 's and his party 's popularity has been steadily declining and hungarians afraid of immigration as much , that in 2006 , 68 % of them disfavoured the immigration of the non-existing [ pir\u00e9z people ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pir%c3%a9z_people ) . 
  really badass anthem . 
  yeah , export in comecon was about bartering . 
  there was a joke about that : there is a governmental audit at the last checkpoint on the soviet-hungarian border . 
  the inspector is pleased with the accounts and he calls for the local customs officer : - comrade , i am very pleased to see that our economic connections with the glorious soviet union are flourishing and improving day by day on the basis of mutual advantages . 
  - yes , they are , comrade . 
  - i see we exported 100 wagons of grain , 50 wagons of meat and 50 wagons of iron ore only in the last week . 
  - it is impressive , comrade . 
  - i see that the soviets sent us exactly 200 hundred wagons of seshit in return , comrade . 
  - they did , comrade . 
  first grade seshit . 
  - what is `` seshit '' ? 
  agree with that . 
  i did n't mean some pure christianity as there are fathers and doctors of the church , christian traditions , councils and 2000 years of evolution . 
  but christianity is there in our european character , in our way of thinking about the world and society and sometimes about science ( for example i do n't think that supporting stem cell research or cloning of servants would be an ethical problem for an ancient roman ) . 
  and i am guess you are a proud neo-pagan and this is a religious question for you . 
  now , release your anger . 
  the roman empire did not fall because of the christianity . 
   the ottomans were n't the successors , but more the morticians of the remains of the east roman empire . 
  mehmed ii claimed the title kaysar-i-r\u00fbm `` emperor of rome '' and proclaimed himself the protector of the orthodox church . 
  [ wikipedia ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ottoman_dynasty#titles ), 
   if our religion was christianity ... should we send in the monks and jesuits ? 
   just joking , half of hungary is a muhtesem y\u00fczyil fan , so apparently we like ottomans . 
  they are , but i do n't know a better name for that than christianity and we should not fear to use that name . 
  imagine european culture without investiture contest , christian schisms and reformation . 
  even what is survived from the classical literature is almost entirely preserved by christian monks . 
  but this is very off topic . 
  maybe , i do n't know their triggers . 
  i was n't there , but vladivostok is a european city , while beijing or tokyo is not . 
  that is true but that is the best name for it , the `` asian cult founded by jesus '' is not catchy . 
  without that foundation there would n't be renaissance and enlightenment etc. 
  again , i am not a religious guy , but ancient greek and roman or jewish ethics are different from ours . 
   they have many ural-altaic minorities ... oh , no , they are quickly assimilating the uralic people . 
  a few years ago a hungarian guy got beaten up in izhevsk in a bus stop , because he spoke with a friend in hungarian and the local russians thought he spoke udmurt ( and the `` why do n't you speak russian ... '' started ) . 
  ( edit : grammar ), 
  every time i said here that european civilization is essentially christian , i was always handled as a religious maniac . 
  but christian ethics and values is the real foundation of our culture and society , not the pure , ancient greek and roman values . 
  true . 
  but i am just the messenger here .

   i 'm not the one down voting you . 
  i did n't think that and did n't want to imply that . 
  i meant that you wanted to prove that `` glory '' stands for some pro-habsburg sentiment on my side , i am sorry that it was n't clear enough . 
  [ for your valiant service in defending the homeland . 
  wow , you are really into this . 
  thus passes the glory of the world means that something which was glorious , great etc. 
  once disappeared . 
  it has nothing to do with mourning or regret . 
  it 's not a feeling . 
   your original remark is ill fitting in a topic about czechoslovakia 's independence , imo . 
  because czechoslovakia is well and alive ? 
  anyway , if you want to know my opinion , one thing is common in the habsburg empire and czechoslovakia ; both survived far longer ( habsburg empire : cca . 
  100 years ; czechoslovakia : cca . 
  50 years ) than they should thanks to the international relations . 
  when the slovaks had a chance to create an independent state they did that without any hesitation , twice . 
  that 's the point of using a proverb . 
  honi soit qui mal y pense as sic transit gloria mundi was more like a general observation on my part regarding both the fate of the habsburgs and czechoslovakia , not some kind of a habsburg adoration . 
  we have a proverb which goes as : `` it does matter on which side of the dick you are . '', 
  he did n't say that , but the rest of the interview suggests that because of their secularity they are not able to understand the current situation , if i understand that correctly . 
  cry havoc and let slip the dogs of war !, 
  thanks . 
  this question was asked here before many times , and my answer is just the same as it was before : goauld as that language has only two words : jaffa and kree . 
  okay , please let me know your decision .

  i would laugh my ass off if orb\u00e1n got one too , but it 's not gon na happen . 
  nobody cares enough to suffer through a trial or to make orb\u00e1n more popular by making him a martyr . 
   look at the history of the countries that are doing okay , corruption-wise . 
  yeah ? 
  what did they do , tyrannicide ? 
  not opposed to that tbh seeing through google results though , it seems like the answer is that  we in denmark have a very high degree of trust in other people and in the system which is just laughable and ca n't wait to see the next orb\u00e1n arising there , kek . 
  `` trust the system '' is equivalent to the communist bullshit about trusting the system , you will never ever get people doing that , unless you brainwash them thoroughly `` trust us we wo n't be corrupt '' ... seriously , got a good laugh out of that . 
  the closest you can get is `` accept '' a system , trusting anything is just pure insanity, 
  lego duce is the best tbh .

  fuck you too, 
  you did choose the least touching story possible . 
  there are millions of poor people in russia , and i 'm supposed to feel bad for some rich ass guy who putin stole from ? 
  how about he steals from his entire goddamn country via corruption , literally everyone . 
  yeah , how dare these people not allow non-quality content , the fucking assholes . 
  how dare they want to enjoy good content instead of absolute garbage . 
  everyone should be allowed to post anything to any sub without repercussions,

  and you think the next asshole pretending not to be corrupt will actually not be corrupt as well ? 
  haha , you 're gullible as hell . 
  i do care but also realize how absolutely futile that caring is . 
   kid excuse me ? 
  i ai n't no kid :3 i 'll take the compliment though, 
  that 's not an argument , that 's a fact, 
  orb\u00e1n was doing it before it was cool, 
  so , hes a normal politician . 
  that 's like the only thing all politicians share . 
  they 're corrupt scumbags without an exception, 
  nationalism is still the lesser evil , if you have to choose between nationalism and state religion, 
  those underage stats are great . 
   toroczkai after googling him , yeah sounds accurate . 
  this might come as a surprise , but north korea is n't the only type of dictatorship . 
  for example in hungary there was this dictatorship until 1989 , to which orb\u00e1n has been compared millions of times already , and i would say they are very right in that . 
  damn , messed up the names , meant to write \u0160e\u0161elj for jobbik, 
  kek , the more you say something will never is the more likely it will happen, 
  does n't really matter . 
  i 'd say the same for hungary for example, 
  could say the exact same about the british empire . 
  it really was needing that coup de grace already, 
  not really , the 19th and 20th are way more interesting to argue about ... and why would we argue about that , everyone knows slovaks have nothing to do with the moravians :p / s, 
  so basically vu\u010di\u0107 = jobbik , obradovi\u0107 = fidesz and the third guy is the only sane candidate . 
  sad that the same bullshit is there across the border as well : /, 
  finally , a place where all the people posting random pictures will hopefully go . 
  though they do n't seem to realize that / r/europics exists either , so i do n't have my hopes up too much,

   there is absolutely no mention of avars or anyone else but slavs in the entire pannonian basin after 810ish . 
   according to pohl , an avar presence in pannonia is certain in 871 , but thereafter the name is no longer used by chroniclers . 
  pohl wrote , `` it simply proved impossible to keep up an avar identity after avar institutions and the high claims of their tradition had failed '' . 
  [ 31 ] although , ** regino wrote about them at the year of 889 ** . 
  [ 29 ] [ 32 ] the growing number of archaeological evidence in transdanubia also presumes an avar population in the carpathian basin in the very late 9th century . 
  [ 29 ] wikipedia, 
   slavs source ? 
   there is absolutely trace of them again , source . . the moravian empire never reached to pannonia , it was a duchy in the frankish empire, 
  the same can be said about any group of people everywhere . 
  no one is `` original '' in any way , with respect to their ancestors , unless there was an excessive amount of incest . 
  so who lived there , germans ? 
  slavs ? 
  kinda find it hard to believe that the otherwise non-nomadic slavs would have moved into the area and also get out without a trace ... 
  if i had to guess the avars probably joined the hungarians, 
  yeah, 
  jeez dude , ever heard of a joke, 
  before the hungarians , avars lived here , who were also nomads and probably fairly similar to hungarians genetics-wise, 
  or slavs are genetically hungarian to a large extent . 
  whichever you prefer, 
  free markets have massive monopolies or quasi-monopolies which make it even harder to start a business . . 
  the government actually intervenes to prevent monopolies from happening , anti-cartel laws for example if the situation is that way , then it 's the fault of the people doing the interventionism , not the act of interventionism itself . 
  that 's what you get when 95 % of your country votes for parties that are basically just the tools of the corporate elite . 
  ( do i even need to remind you that just last year they went so far to cut the middleman and actually elect a millionaire ? ), 
  no amount of free trade will change that . 
  well , good luck, 
   seems functional to me . 
  so , basically you do support interfering with free trade,

  if you speak hungarian , then you should check this [ blog ] ( http://politicalradical.cafeblog.hu/ ) which made by the political capital 's staff with interesting posts about the jobbik . 
  they wrote an article about [ asotthalom ] ( http://politicalradical.cafeblog.hu/cimke/szelsojobb/ ) and their conclusion is that the swing you mentioned does not exist and the left lost voters because of their lack of solutions for real problems . 
  in my pov fidesz supports jobbik and lmp with his communication in order to create a convenient opposition , like putin did in russia . 
  if mszp would be destroyed than there wo n't be any real competition for them as the jobbik always could be labelled as a dangerous extremist party and lmp is too intellectual and i do n't have better word , `` jewish '' for the mainstream hungarian voter . 
  moreover jobbik or lmp would join the fidesz in a coalition , while mszp , dk or egyutt would not , which is a pity , i would love to see gyurcsany and orban in the same cabinet , they would kill each other in no time . 
  see , i know everything about germany . 
  the business part of the discussion was ended for me at the lesser evil and russians are euroasians statements , however i still say that no business like oil business , but i gave up the discussion because of that rampage . 
  you wo n't like it , but here is the `` i am a roma , a criminal according to many , i trust you , hug me if you trust me . '', 
  video made on the calvin square by roland bango . 
  we still have solidarity in our country . 
  a hidden camera video [ footage ] ( https://youtu.be/yzki6ffowdc ), 
  cnp ( cuckfield national party ) will deal with that . 
  that is true . 
  i would just add that sometimes the fidesz speaks like kadar did , so it is not hard for a socialist voter to feel at home there . 
  omg , man . 
  it is pretty much similar to what a western european right extremist would say only you need to change gypsies to muslims . 
  you hit it outta the park with this rampage but do n't try to sell this shit to me , find someone from outside hungary . 
  something something something oktoberfest . 
  something something something complete . 
   for which they didnt apologize yet ( 1954 hungary . 
  hungary ** 1956 ** . 
  watch my flag dude . 
  and they did apologize . 
  yeltsin did it twenty years ago . 
  edit : european civilization has christian roots . 
  that is a fact . 
  the socialists lost support in the north eastern part of the country after 2006 and the jobbik gained much support there , but this support is because of the gypsies and the jobbik 's racism . 
  the socialist lost the middle after 2006 , but the middle went to the fidesz , not to the jobbik ( and many of the former socialist voters just finished with politics ) . 
  i think the jobbik found new voters and voters from the fidesz , not former socialist voters as the distance is too big on the ideological spectrum . 
  the lmp and fidesz always states that the jobbik has a plenty of former socialist voters but they do n't have anything to prove that , it is just the part of their communication to place themselves in the middle . 
  i know former socialist voters who supported the fidesz in 2014 only because of the tax system , so based on my experience i think a former socialist would vote sooner for the fidesz than for the jobbik . 
  i will try to find sources for proving my pov , but i ca n't promise anything . 
  well , ponta is a socialist , maybe the main goals are still the same . 
  i think because of the current political hysteria you mix up people and goverments and short time and long time political goals . 
  russia is european and christian from kaliningrad to vladivostok while iran is not . 
  we have common cultural heritage with russia . 
  iran is a theocratical muslim state which sponsors terrorism . 
  the goverments of quatar and saudi arabia does not support terrorism , moreover the arab league fights iranian sponsored terrorists in yemen in these days . 
  see , they have just found the oil and i have already offended the proud people of west sussex with my ignorance . 
  that was my [ source ] ( https://www.georgewbushlibrary.smu.edu/ ) for the data and they have plenty of similar cutting edge analyses . 
  true , that is why i wrote ` pilot onboard ' . 
  wow , man . 
  you really love your grammar . 
  between belgium and spain and west from switzerland . 
  i talked about supply and demand not about what need to be . 
  you wo n't be happy when the west sussexian indigenous people ( like the proud [ people of cuckfield ] ( http://www.midsussextimes.co.uk/webimage/1.6432551.1416585296!/image/764952908.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_620/764952908.jpg ) ) will lose their cultural heritage and [ sacred cultural sites ] ( http://thebarleymowpub.co.uk/wp-content/plugins/riva-slider-pro/timthumb.php?src=http://thebarleymowpub.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/the-barley-mow-the-bar.jpg&amp;h=322&amp;w=617&amp;zc=1 ) because of the oil industry . 
  still iran has a pretty bad record regarding human rights and terrorism . 
  but no business like oil business . 
  there were plenty of links here on the r/europe in the last year . 
  like the [ report ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2z43p4/hungarian_veterans_of_the_ukrainian_armys_128th/ ) with the hungarian guys from the mukacheve ~ ~ battalion ~ ~ ( edit : brigade ) or the the video where separatists [ paraded ] ( http://in.reuters.com/article/2014/08/24/ukraine-crisis-idinkbn0go0hj20140824 ) pows in donetsk . 
  it was quite obvious what happened to those pows after the parade . 
  do you still consider drone attacks war crime if there would be a pilot onboard ? 
  drone warfare is still aerial warfare only without a pilot . 
  i would n't trust iran either . 
  do n't you remember the protests only three years ago ? 
  i do n't think that a theocratic dictatorship is better than russia , which is still a european country and causes no trouble under normal management . 
  it is popular to be anti-russian in europe and anti-european in russia but europe needs gas and russia needs to sell it . 
  killing down a good business because of short sighted political goals is plain stupidity . 
  edit : i deleted the `` russian '' attribute from `` russian gas '' , because of the pressure from the grammar lobby . 
  nice article , but i would be more than happy if i see a single article about the destruction of hortobagy national park ( an unesco world heritage site ) in the international media . 
  yeah in h'zeus . 
  only big parties have a chance to implement their ideas in reality . 
  what is ideal is one thing and an other is what we have , that is why i think that if there is a chance on the left , then that is the mszp . 
  jobbik voters are not former socialists that was showed by the polls a few times . 
  about reinvent itself : maybe they just stop reinventing themselves all the time and just win the election if they can . 
  anyway you ca n't show an other hungarian party which changed its leadership as many times as the socialists . 
  it is not 95 . 
  you forget that mszp won the elections after 1990 three times . 
  also every time it lost it changed its leaders on every level . 
  the mszp has a chance to win an election in the future , while lmp has not . 
  it 's a metropolitan new left party for intellectuals and will remain that and most of the voters think they are just creatures of the fidesz . 
  do n't think just drink it . 
  fidesz is full with former communists . 
  they like the way how fidesz works . 
  mszp is the heir of the lefty tradition and it is clearly showed by the constant attacks of the right . 
  there is good and bad imperialism . 
  bad imperialist powers are : spain , portugal , germany , japan , austria-hungary , russia and italy . 
  good imperialist powers are : uk , france , the netherlands , belgium . 
  tintin and quatermain good , hans gruber bad . 
  he can tell a lie with a question . 
   our socialist party is still the official continuation ... mszp is 147 years old , communism was 45 years from it . 
  shame , shame but at least it 's not cloaked . 
  vote for fidesz if you prefer cloaking of communists . 
  we just call him c ronaldo in hungary and we also know figo and soon everyone else will . 
  it 's similar , but without basil and garlic . 
  the mainstream lecso starts with melting some paprika powder in oil and this makes lecso much more like a vegetable goulash , but every family has his own recipe . 
  the typical is to have 15 % onion , 25 % tomato and 60 % paprika in your lecso but someone put zucchini and such in the dish also . 
  eat cake for god 's sake !, 
  peasants !, 
  i think the basics are the same everywhere in europe , in hungary the real addition to the basics is the [ fozelek ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/f%c5%91zel%c3%a9k ) , a vegetable stew . 
  every hungarian kid hates [ squash-fozelek ] ( http://m.cdn.blog.hu/mi/mitegyek/image/etelfotok/tokfozelekfasirttal2.jpg ) or [ green peas fozelek ] ( http://erdely.ma/ujkepek/2014/06/nagy/1403493412_5561.jpg ) but fozelek is the backbone of the everyday hungarian cuisine . 
  my personal nightmare is the [ savoy cabbage fozelek ] ( http://paleovital.hu/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/kelk%c3%a1posztapasztern%c3%a1kkal1.jpg ) .

  obviously it 's much easier to conclude that merkel suddenly lost her minds and wants to destroy germany because she is disgusted by it . 
  frankly i 'd pick her over any other politician who 'd flash his undies with the national flag if that 'll bring some votes . 
  i do n't like merkel but the interpretations of this gesture are moronic . 
  what does it have to do with europe ? 
  hungary - wizzair , paprika from szeged ( szegedi paprika ) , pick, 
  kids this days know only manele : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6sv4dqnzda anyway , nu doar mortii stiu cum e sa mori ... or something . 
  try brisca . 
  putin is love , putin is life !, 
  i also speak english ... as of romanian , was n't it scoala ardeleana campaigning for latinization leading to sentences like `` o bella mea ce bella esti pe zi ce trece te belesti '' ? 
  comrades , my head does n't hurt enough due to the new color schema . 
  why do we even have the blue and dark red ? 
  the only true color is russian red !, 
  we need more red !, 
  also glorious cccp symbols are not present enough !, 
  also wtf mods : no picture of vladimir ? 
  please revise your attitude !, 
  also mandatory : bursuc , barza , viezure , \u00e9rted attila , pui de dac ? 
  anyway , i was quoting romania 's dearest president ( according to number of votes ) : https://ro.wikiquote.org/wiki/ion_iliescu, 
  google translate gets better and better :p for example : pus astfel in lumina , recursul la universalitate nu eludeaza meandrele concretului . 
  eng : in this light , the recourse to universality is not eluding the complexities of the beton . 
   oh , come on . 
  read the thread . 
  your wish is my command . 
   that 's what happens when you fight and pay tribute to the ottomans for 500 years , only to be conquered by the empire next door which takes away your biggest and most productive chunk of the country , removing any means of actually getting back on your feet after the ottoman clusterfuck . 
  so romanians were less literate because they were busy fighting ottomans while hungary was conquering romania ?? 
   no offence , this is a bit silly . 
   he said that austro-hungarian empire relocated ethnic hungarians and germans in those parts of the country ( which is true ) , and that they were more educated than the local population ( which is also true , and not a tad insulting ) . 
  the map is from 1930 - that is 70 years after small union and 15 years after the big one . 
  blaming it on hungarians/germans is nonsense . 
  that 's a shitload of time to catch-up at least in moldova-valachia . 
  the word colonist itself is insulting , not the argument . 
  yes , the hungarian government site is a piece of propaganda and in this post you do a much better job on debunking it than this shitty guardian article !!!, 
    like a few years ago when jobbik ... 
  i think actually the jobbik piece comparing food for migrants vs food in hospitals was far more powerful . 
  i will abstain from voting so that the referendum will not be valid btw . 
  tucatu-te-as :p, 
   he did literally say this - bolded , no less no , he was quoting wikipedia , the mother of all knowledge :p anyway , mea culpa , i did n't read up enough to see that , you are right and i will edit my post . 
   i do n't find the term `` colonist '' to be an insult , really i said it 's insulting for hungarians in romania ; you are obviously free to interpret it as you wish . 
  i guess dacians were also colonists right ? 
  or was romania a bareland when they arrived ? 
   you actually argue that there was no population inside the carpathian basin in year 900 ~ ~ he did n't said that ~ ~ and frankly not many people in hungary believe it either . 
  edit : / u/vortalwombat actually quoted that but at the same time there was not much statehood in transylvania . 
  also calling hungarians and germans `` colonists '' just because they happened to be there for only 1000 years is a tad insulting . 
  i mean , why do n't you call romans/italians colonists as well if you love so much continuity argument ? 
  respectfully suggesting you read the rules of / r/europe and provide a english translation as well before one of our trigger happy mods takes note . 
   first time seeing a romanian `` redditor '' / r/romania is that way proudly boosting 28 245 members , 
  oh , c'mon - this is a fairly malicious article . 
  from the whole website they cherry picked the most debatable topic , everything else gets barely a mention . 
  the hungarian page has no reference altogether - guardian is quoting without linking a source . 
  and finally it manages to contradicts itself :  and a ticking clock supposedly representing a migrant entering ** europe ** every 12 seconds  however , according to official hungarian police statistics , that figure inflates the current reality on the ** hungarian border ** by over 6,000 % . 
  because one can enter to europe only via hungary . 
  as i said many times , i dislike orban but that does n't mean i will agree to a shitty article . 
  `` m\u0103-ta '' has cratima . 
  kids this days ... 
  by this logic uk also invaded us whereas spain and portugal invaded south america ... 
  i 'm not a big merkel fan on immigration issues but she did a lot of turns . 
  here 's the lates one : http://www.usapoliticstoday.com/another-angela-merkel-u-turn-refugees-must-all-leave-germany-once-isis-is-defeated/ the only one she had n't done ( and probably never will ) is publicly denouncing #willcommenskultur but in politics actions are louder than words if you are willing to listen . 
  i love your metaphor but i slightly disagree . 
  this is a union where the richest passenger takes over the wheel and insists we can totally handle the collision with the iceberg . 
  luckily she starts making an u-turn . 
  question is if the u-turn will be fast enough to avoid the iceberg . 
  i 'm on the mobile so ca n't find the link but was n't it so that in september they basically closed a border closing with serbia because everyone got arrested ? 
  naturally the question is how you will enforce this ? 
  i mean you have trouble with deportations ... 
  my apologies - i did n't meant to be mocking - just show things in perspective - humans tend to exaggerate the unknown . 
   but some muslims have the security passes for a nuclear plant in belgium , think that 's safe ? 
  just because it has atoms it does n't mean it 's gon na boom . 
  seriously - it 's not like in the movies - that one can manage to cause a nuclear reaction in an atomic plant bypassing the multiple automatic safety mechanisms . 
  we 've been planning a trip to us for about a year now , and we were planning on doing it in may . 
  however , due to the recent terrorist attacks in boston , we 've been talking about cancelling our tickets ( cancelling all of our tickets will cost $ 1000 ) and going to greece . 
  is this worth it / a good choice ? 
  should we still go because of the relatively low chances of an attack happening where we are ? 
  oh boy , this is dumb . 
  what shall google do for a result which has to be removed globally due to france 's decision and has to be kept globally due to a potential `` freedom of speech '' us decision . 
  basically the court tries to force national internets ... which is not how the things work . 
  joining late to the party , poles are our brothers . 
  happy common friendship day , we shall do it more often , 
   an attack that may in itself be a strawman , but not an ad hominem . 
  hmm , guess you are right . 
   mass immigration has n't been a thing since the 1960 's . 
  my interpretation is that he is referring to exactly that . 
  however the integration part was ongoing . 
   the use of the term , population replacement   one of the largest population replacement exercises in history this happens is n't it ? 
   while offering no solution themself . 
  i 'm with you on this one . 
  but to be fair both left and right are only bashing something without saying solutions . 
  also i guess he means a solution which works . 
  also if you read analysis of situation in belgium pretty much everyone also blames politicians . 
  you do n't need to insult someone to have ad hominem . 
  it 's enough to dismiss what he said by calling him biased . 
  or claiming he used a strawman therefore his arguments being invalid  i also see no muslim bashing here btw but again two people might have different conclusions . 
  ok , which of the following sentences you disagree with :  among other things the fact that we are living with the consequences of an immigration and ` integration ' fantasy which should have been abandoned years ago . 
   instead our governments have kept pretending that the weakening of europe 's external borders and the erosion of its internal borders happening at the same time as one of the largest population replacement exercises in history could have no tangible effects on our continent 's future . 
   in fact nobody looks to anyone else 's model anymore . 
  because all of the ` models ' failed . 
  so here we are -- stuck with a problem our politicians have given us and to which they have no answers . 
  sorry to say but if the article is strawmen then your post is an ad hominem . 
   reader to the conclusion that all muslims are bad i prefer the ad literam conclusion : politicians lived and live in la-la-land . 
  very bad timing due to ongoing attacks in belgium . 
  i learnt touch typing on an english keyboard , never learnt diacritics .

  i do not like his politics for a number of reasons , but i do not consider him far right or neo nazi . 
  authocratic tendencies ? 
  yes . 
  yes . 
  nazi ? 
  but there is something in what you wrote about cultural differences that makes hungarians less daring to stand up against such ill behaving politicians . 
  a series of historical failures etched in hungarians culture and mindset ends up in having a nation that is generally less proud and initiative on mass level . 
  we try to compensate with individual success , but it is not defining a good society . 
  those are the ski tourists who forgot to buy motorway ticket and got fined . 
  fixed : grammar, 
  hugs, 
  it 's improving as you see . 
  and you guys can contribute to the improvement , too , by calming down abomination . 
  both parties shall work on it . 
  your google-fu is of black belt level , wow . 
  ok , the mandatory period of 6 hours to to keep it secret is over . 
  reveal the mystery , where was the photo taken ? 
  it 's raining . 
  let me guess , gothenburg ? 
  edit : it 's probably stockholm as / u/wiquzor has identified in the comments below . 
  my shame . 
  i heard about this language reform from a polish girl . 
  so i double checked with her just before writing the response . 
  apparently she has just trolled me , exaggerating the distance between poles and russians . 
  however it was not apparent to me until now that she has just made it up :( my bad , i am going to correct the original post . 
  according to [ wikipedia article ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jagiellonian_university ) it was founded in 1364 , that , and also heard from krakow citizens that it is one of the oldest ... 
  dear romanian neighbors , your government is quite amateur if they allow the opposition making any audible voice . 
  / s you might just come over and get some advice/consultancy on how should it be done properly in a way that opposition does not even has a chance to be visible . 
  ( double / s ) jokes aside , i hope that your fight against corruption will succeed and you will make a good example for the rest of us . 
  the general `` nie ma problemu ! '', 
  ( no worries ) attitude that i like so much . 
  ~ ~ poland have made a major language reform a centuries ago in order to make polish more distinguishable from russian ~ ~ people from southern region of poland migrated to the adriatic ( the white croats ) - also a reason why croatian is similar to old polish they gave us stanislaw lem , and i can not be grateful enough for this the krakow university is one of the oldest in europe , perhaps the second oldest ? 
  there are bison in the bielowieza forest , quite unique in europe . 
  edit : i was told about the polish language reform , but someone has just trolled me . 
  removed from the list . 
  why is it so high in slovenia ? 
  almost the same as in greece . 
  well , we have an audi factory too . 
  ( and i proudly drive an a3 that was manufactured there ) . 
  thanks !, 
  one step closer into space !, 
  i just checked on google maps . 
  * berlin - dubrovnik via slovenia : 1624km/16h56min * berlin - dubrovnik via hungary , avoiding slovenia : 1688km/17h22min, 
  thanks !, 
  my bad !, 
  ... when , exactly ? 
  this is really missing from my archives :(, 
  envy ? 
  by the way , hungary did not invade poland as hungary . 
  austia-hungarian monarchy has invaded the southern region of poland , but that was initiated/performed by the austrian body . 
  i do not want to enter in denial though , it is very likely that hungarian soldiers were also commanded there . 
  in the second world war however , the hungarian soldiers commanded to poland by germany 's request were denying the orders and were actively helped the warsaw resistance . 
  [ video link ] ( https://youtu.be/-ycsh7estsm ), 
  the number of hong kong residents whom i have ever danced with converges to zero . 
  please do not take as insult , but i am genuinely wondering whether russian language for bulgarians would not be rather easy to deal with ? 
  so i would assume , you could list that as a language that the majority of bulgarians speaks on some level ? 
  i am just drawing a comparision with other nations speaking a certain language family , who can easily list a number of related language as `` spoken '' : romanians the italian and french , slovakians the czech and vice versa . 
  you served your military service in the seventies , if you were born in 1956 . 
  soldiers were * not * shot for not cleaning their guns in the 70 's . 
  you are exagurating . 
  not only that . 
  but the fact that nothing really could be `` yours '' as private property , has plagued our recent `` free '' past , too . 
  now , everyone is looking for the immediate quick profit , because the culture of prudently maintaining wealth is just not existing . 
  this is the heritage of the communist times , too . 
  my elementary school teacher was an informer . 
  she reported about me and my parents . 
  our crime was listening to the free europe radio . 
  we call it franciasal\u00e1ta ( french sallad ) . 
  it is not a common christmas dish , rather eaten at new years eve . 
  look , as long as she is not stealing and not lying , does it matter what is her name and which god she believes in ? 
  this defines the term ` hero ' . 
  thank you , lukasz . 
  you can still hear the elderly in csongr\u00e1d using a little more '' \u00f6 '' than in other parts of hungary . 
  same in b\u00e9k\u00e9s with '' \u00ed '' replacing '' \u00e9 '' . 
  then on the border of b\u00e9k\u00e9s and csongr\u00e1d `` pecs\u00e9t '' becomes `` p\u00f6cs\u00edt '' . 
  source : my grandma . 
  we try to educate all roma kids with a `` gentle pressure '' : the families do not get social aid or family allowance if the kid is absent from school for more than a few days per year . 
  when it was introduced , the school attendance ratio of roma kids got from maybe 30-40 % to 98 % . 
  the segregation is still a major problem . 
  perhaps in that grim situation , it was the only thing that he could phrase . 
  personally , i am not sure if i would be able to phrase any sensible sentence with a cold iron on my neck . 
  would it be possible to make him the king and just that the queen does not want it ? 
  or it is legally/technically impossible due to some obscure royal code ? 
  if it is actually possible but the queen does not want it , what could be the reason ? 
  the relatives in the bloodline are objecting strongly ? 
  or that his blood is not blue enough ? 
  haha that 's a good one . 
  the [ skateboarding priest ] ( https://youtu.be/y1wacupmoro ) is magnificent too . 
  it is very likely , that these companies are still selling a magnitude larger quantity to we markets . 
  which means , improving the ee product quality would make it marginally less profitable , but that 's all . 
  also the products in question were often sold on higher price in ee . 
  which means it is mere profit maximalization matter at the expense of a population that has less capability to enforce their interest . 
  that time we were kind of , subordinate of the khaganate . 
  hungary supports your schengen application , if that matters . 
  also in the light of the mass migration from africa and middle east , it is hypocritical to be afraid of internal migration within eu . 
  the article says that he has flown the jet to his own property . 
  now , i am genuinely wondering what sort of property has the facility to land and take off a military jet . . ? 
  he must have been well prepared for such actions !, 
  similar distinction exists in hungary , too : eserny\u0151 ( rain shield ) and naperny\u0151 ( sun shield ), 
  this is how you make someone immortal .

  the most important question is what will happen when they reach bicske , where the refugee camp is ? 
  it will happen soon ( a couple of hours maybe ) . 
  more economic and humanitarian yes . 
  but illegal . 
  one nod from empress merkel and the trains are on their way . 
  people are driving some vans full of water beside/behind them , afaik . 
  or something like that . 
  they also stop to take breaks every now and then in the shade under some intersections ... 
  sure , but the train company can not take a train full of people who do n't have the necessary papers to leave hungary . 
  that would be illegal . 
  however , they are free to go anywhere they like inside hungary . 
  of course nobody should be allowed to walk on the motorway , but it seems that police does n't want to escalate any conflict with them . 
  they will get tired and stop at some point . 
  in other parts of the country they are escaping from the refugee camps , or do n't get off the trains near the refugee camps . 
  you ca n't forcefully put them in the camps , because they are open facilities and not prisons . 
  previously hungary also had the legal tools to create closed camps , but the eu ruled against those , so now we only have open camps . 
  let 's see what austria and germany react . 
  5-6 days and they walk through to austria where the austrian authorities can show how welcoming they are . 
  in the sense that i live nearby and this is totally crazy and i feel physically dizzy and nauseous in my stomach . 
  austria is 200 km from here . 
  where the hell are they walking in the sun ?

   this little sideshow should he let them board trains to munich ? 
   to make life difficult for a small number of people they are not willing to go to the refugee camps . 
  they go on a hunger strike in the trains and refuse to cooperate . 
  suggestions , please !, 
  there is a new refugee camp under construction near the southern border . 
  what should hungary do in your opinion ? 
  are you saying orb\u00e1n should let them board trains to munich ? 
   i was speaking with a rather prominent undercover hungarian policeman recently -- said the random redditor, 
  that 's what they are trying now . 
  they are gathering a crowd to walk there ... video : http://index.indavideo.hu/video/ebreszto_6b01?utm_source=flash&amp;utm_medium=watchoninda&amp;utm_campaign=videoplayer let 's see if anyone stops them . 
  except that germany and austria made it clear that hungary is not allowed to let refugees on the trains towards germany . 
  they need to be registered in hungary . 
  are you saying hungary should violate international law and go against what merkel asked ? 
  oh , i did n't know that . 
  any link or info about their reasoning ? 
   a lot of men are very aggressive a small minority . 
  most of them know that if they hurt a police officer their chance for asylum is minuscule . 
  they are in passive resistance now . 
  we already had like 4 posts about this in the last 12 hours . 
  news say that now 500 refugees are going to protest in front of the german embassy in budapest ... 
  i 'm not sure what they expect . 
  germany wo n't accept unregistered people . 
  that 's never the case . 
  the law is not all that matters . 
  germany could at least help out unofficially , stating what they expect to be done . 
  i think they are in communication behind the scenes , but german media is building the narrative of the evil hungarians doing evil stuff without having any suggestion besides vague things like `` be nicer to them '' . 
  there is chaos among police and the usual shitty communication of the shitty railway company . 
  hungarian authorities do n't really know what to do with the people now . 
  they must be registered , but they do n't want it . 
  they are on hunger strike outside bicske , and refuse to go to the refugee camp . 
  they throw away the water bottles that police gives them . 
  at this point , i would really like if austrian and german authorities helped out , and said what they expect to be done . 
  to finish their journey from turkey and get to germany as they planned ? 
  all want to go further . 
  they want asylum in hungary just as much that they wanted it in greece , macedonia or serbia , i.e. 
  not at all . 
  no shopping involved . 
  germany invites , people go . 
  there are around 13 officially recognized nationalities in hungary . 
  because it is specifically germany that invites them . 
  do n't pretend you do n't understand . 
  they leave turkey because they hear how much germany welcomes them . 
  also , there are millions of syrian refugees in turkey and the middle east . 
  the countries on the `` balkan route '' are just the road towards germany . 
  they are simply travelling through . 
  now they feel stranded in the middle of their journey . 
  well , the 3 main stations are called `` eastern '' , `` western '' and `` southern '' . 
  today these names are not very meaningful anymore , it 's neither describes their location accurately , nor the direction of the trains . 
  refugees/migrants have zero idea or interest in the governments of the road-countries : greece , macedonia , serbia , hungary , austria . 
  they want to go to germany from day 1 . 
  that 's what they care about . 
  it 's a lie to say they specifically dislike hungary . 
  they did n't even apply for asylum in austria . 
  they do n't know much about european countries . 
  they know germany welcomes them , so they took a journey from turkey to germany , but now they are stranded midway . 
  you have no idea . 
   which do n't exist in hungary according to their constitution wrong . 
  a part of them are real refugees who want to seek asylum in germany , due to the willkommenskultur . 
   and not every single person coming through wants to go to germany that 's more or less within statistical error bounds . 
  but terms like `` white guilt '' are not really in common discourse . 
  this may be hard to understand for you . 
  europe is a lot less clear cut than the mainly black/white racial situation in the us . 
  here we have many different countries with very different levels of development and economies . 
  an englishman may look down on romanian or polish people , even though they are all white . 
  the main issue is not really race in europe . 
  edit : southern europeans often have darker skin but nobody really cares . 
  gypsies usually also have darker skin , but that 's not the important factor for most people . 
  yes , because unfortunately politicians are not really allowed to change their mind . 
  they must first find some fake reason ... 
  this skin-color obsession is more of an american thing , i 'd say . 
  race is not even a part of educated and official discourse here . 
  we have no `` race '' entry in our ids or birth certificates or any documents , and it seems really weird that the us does this . 
  we do n't really talk about `` white people '' as such in europe ( except some far-right groups ) . 
  part of a statement by the hungarian government , the reason why refugee trains were let to munich on sunday , but not afterwards :  on sunday , the [ hungarian ] government requested assistance from the german ministry of the interior , he [ j\u00e1nos l\u00e1z\u00e1r , hungarian minister overseeing the office of the prime minister ] continued , and said : it is typical of the german position that the [ german ] ** minister told ambassador ** [ of hungary in berlin ] j\u00f3zsef czukor ** to allow 250-300 people to board the trains and not to tell the press ** . 
  the reason migrants have been increasingly impatient and aggressive and have refused to cooperate with the hungarian authorities since sunday is that the german government is not communicating its message clearly and explicitly , he explained .

  it 's there . 
  do i have to spell out sarcasm for you ? 
   are you hungarians always like this ? 
  [ ... ] we europeans never can do it right for you , ca n't we ... 
  i ask again even though i know you will ignore it , like you did before . 
  what is your obsession with hungary ? 
   i 'm adapting to the way you do this . 
  i was attacking your pathetic attempt at an argument , not you . 
   political prosecution from the soviets . 
  the hungarians did prosecute them themselves . 
  stop dragging in the russians in this . 
  you like deferring your problems on outsiders , do n't you ? 
  did hungarians invade our country in 1956 ? 
  those were soviets . 
  the political prosecution was committed after that by their loyalists , which i consider soviets too . 
  i guess i could call them communists , makes little difference . 
   it does n't have to . 
  but it sure as hell can . 
  sure it can , but why ** should ** it ? 
   not like hungary . 
   you mean the motto of hungary ? 
   you mean the hungarian way ? 
  what 's your obsession ? 
  i do n't understand why are you trying to shift the argument against me , after admitting your idea would n't work . 
  this is not an argument anymore . 
   no camp making stuff up again , i see . 
  i do n't say they did n't handle it better , but to claim there have been no camps , while i can prove you wrong with 1 google image search , makes you a fool . 
   also no war for years in hungary , no need to cross half the world . 
  no , no war . 
  fear of political prosecution by the occupying soviets for who knows how long does not seem bad at all , you are right . 
  from austria , they were transported later , when their turn came to countries such as usa , australia , canada , and all over europe . 
  all i 'm asking is ( which you conveniently ignore every time ) is why does the eu have to ** treat ** this crisis on it 's own ? 
  treat , because accepting everyone will not solve the crisis itself in syria . 
   you reply by talking out of your ass  no camp and i 'm talking out of my ass ? 
   skill only seems to be arrogance , if you look at it from below . 
  thanks for the compliment ;-) you mean your skill of imagining a best case scenario and building a belief system on top of it ? 
  or your skill of projecting your hatred against orb\u00e1n to me and everything that 's happening in our country ? 
  or your ability to judge a country and it 's people based on headlines ? 
  sure , i 'll gladly stay down on earth , you supreme being . 
  in camps in austria , where the austrians treeted them like animals ... oh wait . 
  right . 
  did n't happen . 
  you do realise austria is our neighbour , right ? 
  that 's why our people had to wait there . 
  it 's simple , you should be able to understand it . 
  syrians ( and many others ) want to go straight into germany . 
  why should hungary help them in this ? 
   yeah , try being funny i 'm not trying to be funny , you are making too many assumptions . 
   enjoy your life on the periphery . 
  and enjoy your refugees . 
  but you 've said we do n't allow anyone in , how could we enjoy refugees , when we do n't have any ? 
    your way does n't either . 
  so what now ? 
  thank you for finally admitting it . 
  `` my '' method would work , if every eu country wanted to do it . 
   stop harassing the rest of the eu , when it tries to do it in a cooperative manner through frontex why does the eu have to solve this crisis on it 's own ? 
  why do n't we ask saudi arabia to help ? 
  they 're closer , they have sources too . 
  why is this strictly an eu problem ? 
  we ca n't be expected to take care of the whole world . 
   so wait , you realise all of that , but you still keep defending him . 
  i 'm defending his way of handling this situation . 
  not him . 
   it is n't supposed to . 
  it 's for my entertainment . 
  i do n't like you . 
  to be honest , so far you really did n't give me any reason to like you . 
  at least i do n't call you illiterate , right ? 
  i do n't want you to like me . 
  you are being arrogant and you are the one who makes assumptions about me , not the other way around . 
  i 've attacked your idea , for which you replied in this manner . 
  when i saw you refused to read or digest anything i 've written , i 've called you illiterate , because i honestly do n't want to believe you ignore my points on purpose . 
   the hu approach again , i see . 
  let 's bring in the un in and make everything even slower and more inefficient . 
  germany can go ahead and make their own guarded bases in syria if they 're so capable , and solve it on it 's own , if you do n't like the united solution . 
  why only the eu has to work on this , and not the un ? 
   i imagine a world , where the host country is telling the other countries : `` nah , i 'm not ready right now , you need to wait a little . 
  we 'll call you back later , ok ? 
  thanks '' . 
  you do n't have to imagine . 
  when hungarians had to flee their country in 1956 , they spent months in austria waiting for host countries like usa , canada to accept them . 
  they were dictating when and how many . 
   55000 refugees from syria voluntarily returned home in 2016 that 's great . 
  [ out of over 1 million ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-34131911 ) , 55 thousand left on their own . 
  no problem then !, 
  the [ 130000 who 's gone missing ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/germany/12174803/germany-admits-130000-asylum-seekers-lost-raising-fears-over-crime-and-terrorism.html ) does n't raise any alarms either . 
  they 're probably busy working somewhere for their plane ticket home . 
   you 're inconsistent . 
  it should be dealt with by germany . 
  but you want to do it on your own . 
  when i tell you , to bring those people directly here , by plane , because they do n't want to waste months of their lives in some shitty camp , you tell me : no !, 
  we do it our way !, 
  good job , again !, 
  your way does not solve the problem . 
  it only makes sure these people get to germany , but as you 've said , it would depend on them to actually leave too . 
  what would happen to those , who refuse to leave and spend all their money ? 
  that moment you would claim we all ( eu ) have to solve this crisis in germany , because they are already there . 
   the route fucks italy and greece over [ italy and have been fucked over by ** illegal immigration ** quite some time now ] ( http://www.economist.com/node/18561247 ) . 
  [ [ screenshot of the article in case of paywall ] ( http://i.imgur.com/ugqvoxi.png ) ] distributing the people who arrive at your border is not a solution to the italian and greek border security strugle . 
  hungary can protect it 's schengen borders as it is required ( although we do enjoy the help of our friends ) , while italy and greece ca n't .

  [ here it is in graphical form ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/file:first_instance_decisions_in_the_eu-28_by_outcome,_selected_citizenships,_4th_quarter_2014.png ) edit : found 2014-15 graph . 
  you would have a point , if the majority of the refugees came from morrocco . 
  [ unfortunately the situation is not that simple ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/asylum_statistics ) . 
  625 920 refugees came in 2014 , that is a 45 % increase over the previous year . 
  [ in 2014 ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/images/d/d5/countries_of_origin_of_%28non-eu%29_asylum_seekers_in_the_eu-28_member_states%2c_2013_and_2014_yb15_iii.png ) : * 20 % were from syria ( more than double over the previous year ) * 7 % were from afghanistan * 6 % were from kosovo * 6 % were from eritrea ( more than double over the previous year ) * 5 % were from serbia * 5 % were from pakistan * 3 % were from iraq ( double over the previous year ) * 3 % were from nigeria ( almost double over the previous year ) * 3 % were from russia ( half of previous year ) * 3 % were from albania * 3 % were from somalia * 2.5 % were stateless ( almost double over the previous year ) * 25 % came from ukraine , mali , bangladesh , gambia , iran , bosnia , macedonia , unknown , georgia , congo , algeria , senegal , guinea , sudan , armenia , sri lanka , china , and turkey * 11 % came from ` other ' to sum up : 69 % came from ` controversial ' countries , 20 % from syria , 11 % from ` other ' . 
  these are not folk trying to go from middle class to high class . 
  to be fair , the thousands of refugees are not coming from france . 
  there is an ethical and moral responsibility . 
  the way there would be if thousands of refugees fled from europe to russia , middle east , or north africa . 
  some are also drawing parallels to 1930 's , when jews were asking for asylum and were n't given it . 
  look how that turned out . 
   i would rather my country crumble into dust than become `` vibrant '' yeesh . 
  i was nodding along all the way down this thread , then i read this . 
   it can only take one decision to make a complete turn around and be a jihadists is there trigger that you think is more common than others ? 
  i mean can we blame them ? 
  most immigrants go to western country for a better life . 
  my parents and us ( children ) moved to us from hungary for the same reason , people from a wartorn country see things more desperately . 
  if the situation was reversed and europe was being categorically destroyed by terrorism , poverty , corruption , you can bet people will flee to the middle east , russia , and north africa . 
   enforce current border laws . 
   stay in your camps . 
  apply for asylum there i thought current laws require asylum seekers to apply for asylum in the country they are applying for ? 
  1000 euros = 12,000 per year . 
  poverty line in belgium is 9,300 . 
  plenty of motivation to get a job when you 're teetering on poverty 's front door . 
  edit : for future information on belgium :  those living in refugee reception centres receive a weekly spending allowance of 7.40 euros per adult . 
  some can also carry out paid work at the centre , receiving up to 185 euros per month . 
  after six months , people can apply for a work permit . 
   work permit issued once asylum application is approved ; immediate family members can then also come to belgium . 
  being beheaded in that region is not limited to christians ... 
  gypsies ? 
  well , iran and pakistan are at any rate . 
  uae not so much . 
  i see , thanks . 
  i 'm obviously lacking in basic cognitive faculties . 
  why does it follow that because they think it 's racist to build the wall they should move to mexico instead of canada ? 
  yep . 
  just pointing out trump wants mexico to pay for the wall , which is just not going to happen . 
  i do n't think comparing the hungarian wall to a possible us wall ( `` 50ft tall '' ) is fair . 
  first , trump says us wo n't pay for it . 
  second , the us wall is going to be much longer and , allegedly , much taller . 
  finally , the us wall is much more expensive ( at least , last i heard it was estimated to be 30 billion dollars , not including things like building roads to the site , getting permission from land owners , etc. ), 
  i 'm pretty sure people bring it up because of facts . 
  right now more mexicans go back to mexico than come here , so there 's no need for a while . 
  in addition , 50 % of undocumented residents came here legally then overstayed instead of going back . 
  again , no reason for a wall . 
  also , trumps statement . 
  mexico sends over its rapists , murderers , something something and some of them are good people . 
  something not paid for by syrians , but by hungary . 
  this is in direct opposition to trump 's plan . 
   when they should be going to mexico . 
  wait , why ? 
  i do n't follow . 
   how about you start electing people who want change like obama ? 
  not that it changed much . . 
  maybe it started out that way but then he got used to it ? 
  if he is talking like that as a strategy , you would think he would modify is talk based on audiences . 
  talk one way with vets , another way with leaders , another way with scientists , another way at rallies and media events , etc. 
  but he seems to be using the same method at all times . 
  what do you mean it does n't matter ? 
  in a nation of 300 million , 63 million voted trump and 68 million voted clinton , with a 60 percent turnout . 
  you ca n't say trump is a representative of the us when half the country disagrees with him and 40 % did n't vote . 
  just to clarify . 
  people call it a muslim ban become trump [ wanted ] ( http://www.cnn.com/2015/12/07/politics/donald-trump-muslim-ban-immigration/index.html ) a muslim ban . 
  actually , [ this article ] ( https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/01/is-president-trumps-immigration-order-a-muslim-ban/514989/ ) summarizes pretty nicely the reasons why people call it a muslim ban . 
  and , of course , the courts [ seem to agree ] ( http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-immigration-court-iduskbn18l2io ) so far . 
   us appeal court 's chief judge states revised ban ` drips with religious intolerance , animus , and discrimination ' . 
  so , hungary is ... a rock ? 
  i always thought it looked like a ship or something . 
  and there goes my innocence . 
  july 18th is a bit early for our date , we are leaving september and coming home in december . 
  for sim cards we need to get new phones . 
  not a big deal , there are many cheap phones available for use with a sim card . 
  thanks for that link , the castles and especially the transfagarasan road looks intriguing !, 
  these routes look fantastic , exactly what we were looking for . 
  germany is definitely on our `` countries to go to '' list , so i will have to take up on your offer as we narrow down our choices some more . 
  right now we are taking everything that everyone suggested , looking it over , and seeing what we can add in .

  ~ ~ i am not familiar with london ( any part of it ) , is there any place in particular that would be cool to explore ? ~ ~ edit : wrong reply button . 
  funny you should mention . 
  my primary destination besides family in hungary is [ taize ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/taiz%c3%a9_community ) , france . 
  any specific place in france you would recommend ? 
  we actually looked at both eurail and interrail . 
  one of the requirements for interrail is to have lived in a country in europe for `` for at least the past 6 months '' and have a european passport . 
  so we are left with eurorail , which although is more expensive ( 566usd v. 800usd ) does allow for more than one month of continuous use . 
  do you have a link to one of the rail guides ? 
  just somewhere i can start looking ? 
  based off of the previous comment , i feel like i 'm missing a reference to something . 
  but i am googling your suggestions nevertheless . 
  thanks !, 
  yes , that is basically our intention . 
  besides visiting family , we thought we would take this opportunity to get to know at least some of the countries and cultures that we can . 
  is there a specific significance of that soviet uranium mine ? 
  it does look fun to climb through , but not sure what we should expect . 
  this is fantastic , will definitely looking into it . 
  hi reddit , so this is my first time posting in this subreddit , and i apologize if it is mainly for european politics and news . 
  let me know if there is a better subreddit to post this to . 
  my brother and i are going on a 3 month trip to europe next semester . 
  we are first generation hungarians who moved to the us at ages 7 and 9 , and we are fluent in english and hungarian . 
  we can get by on german after we brush up a little bit . 
  the goal is to see not just the major sights like the eiffel tower , berlin wall , vatican , etc , but also any relatively quiet places as well .

  they clearly did not . 
  of course treaties only matter while they have substance for the parties but do n't try to paint yourselves as innocents . 
  * you started it !, 
   yes , yes they fucking did . 
  heck yeah but they did for several months what i do honoring ai dow requests in games : accept and contribute nothing . 
   even though poland was overrun in about five weeks in the german invasion of poland beginning on 1 september 1939 and soviet invasion beginning on 17 september 1939 , the western allies did nothing . 
  war had been declared by each side , but no western power committed to launching a significant land offensive , ** notwithstanding the terms of the anglo-polish and franco-polish military alliances which obliged the united kingdom and france to assist poland ** . 
  to be fair the maginot line worked perfectly where the main fortifications were built . 
  you just did n't ( fully ) expect hitler to go * that far * . 
  if you were poland vs ai germany and ussr you 'd beat them on both fronts ... 
  it 's the real life equivalent of a steam achievement . 
  and not trying to balance between the two powers you were surrounded by for the past decade or so . 
  we even have a polish-hungarian friendship day , [ march 23 ^ rd ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/march_23#holidays_and_observances ), 
  * we have quite an intertwined history . 
  among other things like fighting in each others ' uprisings , [ there were two hungarian-polish unions ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/union_of_hungary_and_poland ) . 
  i do enjoy reading about our defiance , to spite hitler [  ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hungary%e2%80%93poland_relations#world_war_ii )  hitler would soon have cause to rue his decision regarding the fate of carpatho-ukraine . 
  in six months , during his 1939 invasion of poland , the common polish-hungarian border would become of major importance when admiral horthy 's government , on the ground of long-standing polish-hungarian friendship , declined , as a matter of `` hungarian honor , '' hitler 's request to transit german forces across carpathian rus into southeastern poland to speed that country 's conquest . 
   the hungarian refusal allowed the polish government and tens of thousands of military personnel to escape into neighbouring hungary and romania . 
  not inaccurate . 
  well if i was eating it 24/7 i would get fed up with it quite fast as well .

  africa, 
  i blame eurostat, 
  yup we had a good share of mongols as well ( we use tatars synonymously ) , they halved our population pretty much . 
  mostly because we fucked up at mohi though . 
  i mean yeah , but compare a couple battles with your entire kingdom 's affairs revolving around ottomans for 2-300 years . 
  i do n't mean to take away credit where it 's due for you , i 'm just simply pointing out that people tend not to give credit for hungary which is quite an oversight to say the least . 
  not in that battle but people always forget hungary 's role in keeping you away from the west from 1366 to 1566 . 
  they just praise the poles since only vienna matters apparently . 
  it 's a bit frustrating considering the effects it had on the country . 
  yup , single handedly saved europe . 
  [ nevermind hungary ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ottoman_wars_in_europe#1526.e2.80.931566:_conquest_of_the_kingdom_of_hungary ) , struggling with and holding the ottomans at bay [ for the past 200 years ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ottoman%e2%80%93hungarian_wars ) .

  what is that seemingly vaguely drawn blob labeled as russia ? 
  it says `` hungary awaits you '' by the heart and the web address is discoverit.home ( as in hungary ) . hu, 
  you chose the hard way !, 
  it 's an interesting phenomenon but several travel abroad more than staying in hungary for holidays . 
  some years ago at least , it was due to prices being nearly identical ( excluding travel cost ) home or abroad . 
  i 've been to greece and italy a couple times before i had a proper ( not just pop down to balaton on a weekend ) hungarian holiday . 
  that 's neat , do you speak both languages then ? 
  we do , unlike them regarding hungarians ... but i absolutely do n't agree with labeling the entire country as extremists because there was a decision he did n't fancy ... and playing innocent victims while they had their hands dirty the entire time . 
  shut up !, 
  tbh early hungarians mixed with the local population extensively quite early on , one of the reasons our genetic composition is so similar to the surrounding peoples . 
  ah that rings a bell . 
  thanks !, 
  me neither , i found [ this ] ( http://www.johndclare.net/league_of_nations4_disarmament.htm#preparatory_commission ) source however , claiming 99,086 troops for germany in 1926 . 
  as apparently they have n't withdrawn from the disarmament conference [ until 1933 ] ( http://www.johndclare.net/roadtowwii3_rearmament.htm ) i 'd assume this figure , which seems really low , stayed more or less the same until that point at least . 
  [ how could we ? 
  ( among blind , the one eyed rules ) neat !, 
  yeah they certainly were ambitious , maybe a bit too much . 
  though early '30s germany was n't much of a threat so i 'd say they had some ground to it as well . 
  where did i hear that name before ?

  i remember when i saw it first and thougth : the coreography is perfect . 
  here is [ something ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6llse9onck ) you can be ashamed of  or its [ sequel ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hves95iel4i ) [ another wtf ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fktclnj4ibm ), 
  here is the most famous scot joke : the scot and his son go to the market to sell a chicken . 
  after they sell it the son asks his father to buy him a slice of melon , now that they have money . 
  the scot buys it and his son eats it . 
  15 years pass , and the scot and his son go to the market again , and sell a cow there . 
  so the boy asks : father , we sold the cow , i grew up , buy me a beer !, 
  are you out of your mind , son ? 
  beer after melon ? 
   for the first time , you 've been given and in the meantime we were sitting there idle and looked through our eyeballs . 
  what comes next , you will look search my pockets for your money ? 
  for not the first time , hungarians offered everything they had for the hope of better work/living circumstances . 
  lets make hunconomy great again , and let the hungarians pay for it ? 
  and you wonder people in hungary start making parallels . 
  closing up the lesser developed east is a political direction . 
  im sure we would notice if someone would abuse that political direction . 
  it doesnt matter if western or eastern union , we average hungarians have to wake up and go to work wach day , regardless of current administration . 
   and you think it 's all some trick to keep you if anyone would only suspect that , we would have exited this union by ourselves already . 
   no one among us is your enemy . 
  wrong , this is not a you and me situation . 
  we are rowing the same boot , but dont expect to do it smiling with a broom in your hand . 
  dont try to seperate unkari . 
  we are all in the eu together , discussing important topics within the frames of eu law . 
  be adult about it and accept that some poeple have different views . 
  i dont think i have to explain you , how good it feels , that after all the occupations , there is finally a local looking guy , who ( seemingly ) gives the shots , and not someone from moscow or vienna/stockholm . 
  [ hungarians usually reject the 1956 asylum seekers too . 
  you are welcome !, 
  its not exclusively for mothers . 
  its for whoever raises the child ( grandparent , husband etc. 
  i live on the moon . 
  people like you chased me there . 
  now i sincerly apologize for being this conservative , and try to behave to fit in in your modern worldview  i pointed out that `` westerners migrating for work to hunland '' already happened in the medivals . 
  in time it changed the culture and ethnical compound of the land , what was later used to claim land and justify wars . 
  knowing world history wont hurt you either . 
  clueless average people like me generally fear changes and are precautious . 
  voting on a referendum can be describe as hatred from your pov ( what other hate crime comes in your mind , that happened against refugees in hungary lately ? 
  ) , but i think only a few ( idiot ) would feel hate towards different people . 
   to be a bigger influence on eastern europes reputation dont worry , the western capitalists are demonized in the local papers aswell . 
  borders are not closed . 
  literally anyone can apply for asylum . 
  they can wait the end of the process in an open safe house or move freely in the eu in the meantime . 
  if their application is declined they are not forced to leave . 
  l\u00e1ngos and goul\u00e1sh each day .

   i do n't think anyone is gagging to keep hungary in the union the eu is nothing more than a fiscal union , so hungary will be released when the costs of keeping it in the union will be higher than the gains from their cheap labour force , tax free market and privatizable state institutes .

  overlords come and go , pillaging the land with the same rhetoric : we only want your good ( s ) . 
  to keep hungary in the ` union . 
   in 20 years , after our investment into eastern europe , when we try to move east for jobs it happened in the medievals already . 
  people who seeked work were welcomed . 
  people who tried to carve out their own kingdom were chased away . 
  also would you please hurry up , there is workforce shortage in every sector . 
  literally no one will hold you back . 
  dont let eastern minimal wages scare you . 
   but pretty annoyed that they are n't giving anything in return hope this opinion is not wide spread , else i have to point out how stupid it is , to too many people . 
  what about their work ? 
  and the taxes they pay in the host country , and their cost of living there . 
  giving up part of the etnical identity to work with foreign people might sound alien to you but it is something eastern europeans have to pay while moving `` freely '' across europe . 
  live your socialism quitly , while eastern europeans work for crumbs in your country . 
  it matters if it happens for the same goal . 
  what does w\u0119gr\u00f3w mean ? 
  its close to w\u0119gry , so is it something hungarian related ? 
  beautiful middle earth , 
  its georgia , but dont know the exact location .

  only because they didnt inveted drahtzaun back then , 
  hungarians tried that too . 
  but got confused after two . 
  because a paprika has only two sides . 
  latvians got confused after six . 
  because only six toes . 
  but whats your excuse ? 
  that was the old europe .

  its simple . 
  `` we didnt herded goose together '' means we were stealing horses in the meantime ,

  was thinking about adding the map of the [ region , formerly known as kingdom of hungary ] ( http://trollfesz.cc/i/219355.jpg ) , or ~ ~ magyarize ~ ~ colorize some parts of the surrounding - ia 's . 
  i regret nothing .

  sz\u00e9kelys are the hungarians in transylvania . 
  yeah , hungarian does n't really have accents either . 
  there are sz\u00e9kelys who speak differently , but for the most part you would n't be able to tell if somebody was from budapest , debrecen , or sopron ( all of which are in completely opposite ends of the country ) . 
  a lot less impressive though considering we have like a fourth of your population . 
  they 'll probably last a while then , but i do n't know if the rest of the world would run out of oil before they switch to alternate sources of energy . 
  one could probably debate over this until oil actually runs out though , it 's completely hypothetical who would last longer . 
  do you have a source ? 
  or did you calculate that yourself ? 
  that is assuming i even said anything about boycotting oil , which i did n't . 
  but assuming i did : the saudis do n't need money to function ? 
  if it came down to that there would be alternatives to oil , but there is n't really any alternative to cash . 
  and you 're being overly dramatic , it 's not like plastic products would suddenly disappear , and energy can be generated with other means . 
  i do n't really give a shit about gas either , since i could ( and do ) commute inside the city using bicycles , trams and metro , and outside the city with railway . 
  that is leaving out the fact that the majority of oil exports to europe do n't even come from the middle east . 
  in december 2014 , 71 ' 994 barrels came from europe itself , while 118 ' 421 bbl came from the former soviet union . 
  second place is africa with 86 ' 001 bbl . 
  the entire middle east exported 55 ' 091 bbl to europe , of which around 30 ' 000 came from saudi arabia itself ( [ source ] ( https://ec.europa.eu/energy/en/statistics/eu-crude-oil-imports ) ) sure , oil prices would rise if we ( as in , europe , the article only actually mentions the uk ) sanctioned saudi arabia . 
  but let 's not pretend that we depend on them as much as people are implying here . 
  i 'd even say it 's the other way around , but that 's of course very arguable . 
  and the other way around ? 
  this goes both ways , they 'll be just as fucked if nobody buys from them . 
  they 're in parentheses the same way rumansh speakers are . 
  i was talking about the major languages . 
  yeah , same in switzerland , where the train from geneva to st. gallen has both languages all the way through . 
  i wan na say that 's the case with regional trains too but i 'm not sure . 
  yeah , ffs it works perfectly fine in switzerland . 
  and there you do n't have to deal with two languages , but with three ( or even four if you count rumantsch ) . 
  then again from the outside it looks like the borders between the languages in belgium are much more abrupt than in switzerland ( belgians , correct me if i 'm wrong ) , where you have places like fribourg and valais that serve as a transition between the languages and where both are spoken . 
  you do n't sound condescending . 
  never knew that , i only ever learned about their conquests in europe , which is why i pointed that i did n't know how much they expanded into africa . 
  i did n't mean to sound condescending . 
  they did conquer a large part of europe , but they were far , far away from spain . 
  they only ever conquered territory up to and including most of the carpathian basin , which they held for over 150 years until the 17th century . 
  in africa they held territory that included egypt , but i 'm not sure how much further they got . 
  you might be thinking of the umayyad caliphate who conquered the iberian peninsula a few centuries before , but they do n't really have anything to do with the ottomans except for their religion . 
  edit : by the way , look this shit up on wikipedia . 
  i learned far more there than i ever did in history class , and it 's a more useful way to be bored than reddit . 
  are you serious ? 
  balaton is the `` default '' vacation spot here , seemingly everyone goes there in the summer ( and you 're right , there 's a lot of germans there too ) . 
  many families own vacation homes there , and if they do n't , they 'll just rent one . 
  the villages around the lake are completely deserted outside the summer and a lot of restaurants and shops are closed then too . 
  outside the country favorites include croatia and greece . 
  ah right , it even says so in the title, 
  no , but i did n't say it was actually put on a billboard , i 'm just saying that it is n't that subtle . 
  it 's not that subtle, 
  yeah there is n't an exact definition as far as i know , just as long as you use your brain instead of your muscles it 's a denksport . 
  no , i would n't . 
  you know , just when i started thinking certain stereotypes about french are n't true , you show up . 
  good job . 
  edit : let me rephrase this comment . 
  motor sports have `` sport '' in their name too , and while drivers are much more physically active than gamers , i think it 's only fair to call competitive gaming `` e-sports '' . 
  calling it `` sport '' in itself is a bit too much though . 
  german speakers do it too , they call games like chess or stuff like math competitions `` denksport '' ( thinking sport ) while not seriously considering it a sport , so i do n't see why the same logic ca n't apply in english as well . 
  i 'll have to agree with you . 
  i understand calling it a sport from a legal perspective , but sitting in front of a computer is n't a sport just because it 's competitive , no matter how much effort you put in it . 
  if i played lol all day you would n't call it `` doing sports '' either , but as soon as it 's played competitively it suddenly is ? 
  that does n't make sense . 
  any real sport is a sport no matter how much effort you put in it , and that 's not the case with any video game . 
  call it what it is , e-sports , just do n't pretend it 's a sport without the e. 
   calling e sports not real sports is like saying twitch streamer should get a real job even when they are working more hours than other people do . 
  not really . 
  well , this protest was n't exactly baltimore , so i would n't worry too much . 
  if anything it 's good that this is happening . 
  if anybody here ca n't read cyrillic : `` nezvanyj gost huze tatarina '', 
  it 's what their name is in hungarian , gr\u00fazia . 
  come on , that was kinda unnecessary . 
  it has nothing to do with the topic at hand . 
   ( even cleaning service ) . 
  elaborate on this , cleaning service is n't allowed to enter said rooms at any point or just not while it 's in use ? 
  migros has no alcohol either ... 
  they literally are, 
  _ cough _ rtl klub _ cough _, 
  you know this because you live in hungary and are affected by this , right ? 
  `` humans have never been part of europe , they came to us '' \\ - neanderthals, 
  i 'd say they were only really `` accepted '' after they converted to christianity , so i 'm not sure that logic works . 
  huh , i did n't know that . 
  right , but that 's not what i meant . 
  on portuguese websites , which variation of the language is used more , brazilian portuguese or portuguese portuguese ? 
  for english , i 'd say it 's american english , but i 'm not sure that 's the case with portuguese ( i literally have no idea , but your observation makes sense ) . 
  i suppose the easiest is just to choose the flag of the variation you use , if op 's website uses brazilian portuguese then that 's the flag they should go for . 
   hungary : no one relevant let me tell you of our lord and savior viktor orb\u00e1n, 
  you could argue that 's a different case though , because it seems to me american english is more prevalent on the internet than british english . 
  that has got to be a joke ... 
  i mean it 's _ swedish _ newspaper , they of all people should know how `` easy '' integration is . 
  right , i agree with you . 
  who 's prophesizing the world will end ? 
  where ? 
  stop putting words in my mouth . 
  look , i know it 's hard to understand , but the refugee situation is something that needs to be solved now , not in five or ten years . 
  i 'm not proposing a solution , i 'm just saying that corruption can be worked as soon as this is over , orb\u00e1n is n't going anywhere - refugees on the other hand are . 
  i 'm personally not a fan of much of what orb\u00e1n does , but those are issues that do n't require immediate attention . 
  yes , they should be dealt with , but they 're not a priority , because they 're far less prevalent than you make them out to be . 
  hungary does n't even really stand out among eastern european states in the [ corruption index ] ( http://www.transparency.org/cpi2014/results ) , so accusing them specifically is kinda baseless imo . 
   imo , we need to treat hungary the way we treated the serbs 20 years ago when they decided to shit on international law . 
  it worked . 
  meh , if this thread is anything to go by the pendulum is already swinging the other way . 
  okay , this is pushing it . 
  i 'd rather be known to be hung than angry . 
  i suppose you would know best.i was n't being entirely serious though , personally i 'd pick hungary as number 1 . 
  they border italy , austria , croatia , and us .

the difference is that hungary registers all of them as it is demanded , but croatia does n't because they ca n't handle them ... 
  calm your tits !, 
  they wo n't stay there . 
  they 're heading west . 
  they all will leave eventiually . 
  you need to have a plan for the next ones that are coming ... a fence maybe , since you ca n't handle these numbers . 
  well then there 's no problem ... all non violent migrants should go to the border , get themselves registered . 
  err ... wait they do n't want to do that . 
  on wednesday some real refugees did make their way to the registration point ... 
  they got registered , and they entered hungary to continue their journey . 
  but the rest did kick in the gates at the border ... most of them do n't care about laws and regulations ... that 's the point . 
  there is a legal way for them to cross the border ... 
  but most of them riot , protest and attack the authorities , well thats civilised, 
  you could have expected this to happen ... all the news was about hungary building the fence ... you did nothing ... 
  there was only one possible route left , going through croatia , i 'm not a strategist , but that seems logical . 
  are you really that blind ? 
  i 'm starting to think that i 'm wasting my time trying to explain why we are so mistrustful of these migrants ... you only see them as poor people looking for a brighter future ... and i 'd really like that to be the truth , but events just do n't justify the events that are happening across europe . 
  i 'm really okay with ppl legally coming to my country , settling here , starting a new life , hoping for a better life . 
  but these migrants do n't respect eu laws . 
  not only hungarian , or german , or serbian , but the whole unions laws , they act agressive and demanding . 
  please analyse the events of the past months ... read more sources , view footages of multiple news stations , and make up your own mind . 
  do n't get blinded by this propaganda . 
  if you want a realistic opinion , here it is ... migrants do n't want to stay in hungary , greece , turkey or anywhere else , they just want to go to france , england , germany , sweden , denmark . 
  why ? 
  because of reasons !, 
  hungary is and should be only a transit zone for these migrants . 
  the migrants should obey the law , and let them register themselves by the authorities . 
  they should wait patiently for the process to end . 
  and then they would be allowed to continue their journey . 
  we tried this ... 
  it did n't work . 
  why ? 
  they came in huge numbers , thousands day by day . 
  they refused to cooperate - not all of them , some obeyed the laws , and we did n't have any problems with them - the rest started to riot near keleti railway station . 
  they did n't care about any laws , they just wanted to go to germany since mama merkel loves them so much . 
  their actions forced mav ( hungarian railway company ) to stop any international trains going to austria - germany , and cancel any further international trains in that direction . 
  as the fence got built the migrants arrived to horgos - r\u00f6szke . 
  they all have been informed , that they ca n't cross the border illegally , and if they 'd like to travel through hungary , they should register themselves at the border . 
  for some unknown reason they refused that . 
  but some of them got restless ... 
  they started to throw rocks at the policemen guarding the fence . 
  more and more migrants joined in the attacks . 
  the police responded with tear gas and water cannon . 
  the media only shows one side of these events in hungary , and ppl do n't even bother researching . 
  the hungarian police is n't attacking anyone , they just defend our country from any agression . 
  the hungarian gov. 
  just acts as it is demanded . 
  it protects the schengen borders , and upholds the dublin 3 regulation . 
  imo if i have nothing to hide , and i just want to live a peaceful life far from home , and decide to migrate to another country , it would even cross my mind to attack law officers in order to go through their country . 
  i have nothing to hide , i would get registered , and continue my long journey . 
  and just another thought about this quota issue . 
  the migrants do n't want to go anywhere else but to western european countries . 
  you could try to force them to relocate to different , not desired countries . 
  what is the guarantee for them to stay in those countries , and what should prevent them to go where they 'd like . 
  nothing . 
  should they be prevented to exit that country ? 
  should we use force ? 
  is that humane enough for you ? 
  and how many should we take in ? 
  1 million ? 
  or just half a million ? 
  what about terrorists ? 
  they 're ppl too ... maybe they 're running for their lives too ... should we care for them too ? 
  about 10 % of these migrants are real refugees ... 
  the other just want something we do n't know ... 
  i feel for you my brothers !, 
  so you actually think this happened overnight with a great conspiracy behind it ? 
  this is just dumb . . are n't you a bit paranodid ? 
  guys ... to be clear ... everything that is unpopular for some groups in hungary is and always will be the fault of orban the fidesz party ... me and my coworker said this , a couple of weeks ago ... something happens for example , bus does n't arrive in time - orban 's fault . 
  this is just the same ... 
  some ppl ca n't see the truth even if it 's staring in their face . 
  it is clear that lot of commenters do n't even understand what this is all about . 
  so let me tell you a hungarian point of view . 
  we joined the eu because of its main reason of existence : free market , free capital and common trade policies . 
  as time changed the eu itself also changed , today if feels like brussels is the hq where decisions are being made without asking the member counties citizens about their opinions . 
  honestly , ask yourself , did the eu ask you to be part of syrias problem solving mechanism ? 
  i guess not . 
  `` but it clearly was the right thing to do ... '' there are some odd things i have to mention too . 
  we have been part of the eu when our left mszp party was governing hungary . 
  the eu did n't `` attack '' or propose any sanctions against hungary back then , brussels thought everything was okay . 
  and then the truth was revealed , that the mszp party did nothing , just stole money from the state budget , and indeed did nothing , and almost did bankrupt hungary - makes you think that this would have been okay with brussles . 
  this threw the country in a moral crisis also , people were protesting on the streets , peoples eyes where shot out with rubber bullets . 
  eu was still okay . 
  at least that 's what i think , because there has been no news about brussles waving its hands . 
  and yeah an imf credit was issued to save what 's left , and the need for it was that we need this to counter the economic crisis in the world . 
  so fidesz was chosen in the next polls to govern the country . 
  with a lot of work , this party managed to create jobs , lower the costs of the bills for everyday people , now just in this year they increased the minimal wage in all sectors , and there are negotiations under way with labor unions about the next raises . 
  health workers received additional increase in their wages for obvious reasons . 
  the unemployment rate is constantly dropping : http://bfy.tw/b7th & http://countryeconomy.com/unemployment/hungary so the government is doing it 's job , as it is supposed to . 
  but something must have happened , because the tavares report has come to light ( hungary 's violations of human rights ) . 
  last time i was checking , i had the ability to speak my mind , and do whatever i want , if it was n't against the law , anytime i wanted , so i did n't even understand this report . 
  but yeah , there has been some changes in the hungarian media law and it 's constitution that made someone shit his/her pants . 
  or just as people are nowadays they hear media law and they instantly refer to censorship and prohibiting the freedom of speech . 
  and the circus was on . 
  brussels was like a kindergarden , people holding up pieces of newspapers with the text censored . 
  clearly people did n't even have taken the time to read what the whole thing was about . 
  but they just yelled , that orban is dictator , and he does everything to prevent the freedom of speech . 
  check some hungarian news channels , today , i challenge you . 
  go check out h\u00edr tv , atv , tv2 , rtl klub . 
  ask your hungarian friend to translate , hear how they ca n't speak or report what they want , they are so prevented to report what they want , and all they do is praise the system ( irony ) - so the tavares report was indeed false - but brussels applauded the idea ... - i clearly did n't understand what it was supposed to mean .

  hungry sportsmen crave medals . 
   we ca n't help you anymore . 
  not as if you ever particularly wanted to . 
   blaming people for going after opportunities is vain moralizing . 
  the enlighten me why are you insisting that the quota system will work and they will stay where you put them ? 
  the hard truth is that although they always talk about refugees we are mostly dealing with bona fide economic migrants here . 
  a refugee is grateful for not having to dodge bullets , having a roof over his head , and getting decent food . 
  an economic migrant knows precisely where he wants to be and that is mama merkels mythical `` alemania '' where s-klasse mercedes cars grow on trees . 
  they wo n't exactly be happy over being forced to relocate to lets say east bumblefuck hungary , and that 's a solid understatement . 
  so while there 's point in talking about refugees , they are only a small percentage of these migrants , the rest will always be where they want to be . 
  you can try to dump them here but we ca n't limit their movement and they will end up back in we pretty soon . 
  not sure about continental but the rest are homegrown companies , bmw being even quintessentially bavarian . 
  no small surprise that they have their hq there , which is certainly good for you . 
  we however only get the low added-value manufacturing jobs ( e.g. 
  audi ) and even for that we have to beg on our knees by offering atrocious tax exemptions . 
  those bavarians know what 's up for sure . 
  it is the `` mittelstand '' , solid mid-tier companies with clear ownership and considerable added value that can form the basis of a functioning economy . 
  luring in international megacorps is a dead end , they keep skill-intensive jobs at home , relocating only the mass manufacturing ( and always ready to bring it elsewhere if that decreases costs by 0.001 % ), 
  quite likely . 
  the `` fuckin osteurop\u00e4ische gastarbeiter '' look i sometimes got from germans while uttering something in my broken german was enough to discourage me from using it . 
  but the best story was what one of my friend told me : after spending 20 years in nrw and being as fluent as goethe and schiller combined he relocated to switzerland where he was literally gtfod by a customer at his new job for his insulting north-german accent . 
  sorry for insulting you by learning your language / s ( i got your point ! ), 
  i highly recommend you the book titled `` last lingua franca '' . 
  the author depicts an interesting but - looking at the rate of development in machine learning - quite plausible scenario that within less then 20 years direct real time translation by algorithms will surpass the best human translators . 
  literally you will just grab your sort-of babel fish earphone and it will translate you just about anything in real time . 
  that does not mean though that we should abandon learning foreign languages , research shows that those who speak at least 3 languages have an improved neural circuitry compared to those being monolingual which can come handy in a lot of situations . 
  its slowly declining though according to recent surveys - at least here . 
  until the early 2000s the popularity of german was comparable to english among elementary/high schoolers . 
  imho the difference is the merciless nature of german grammar system , for some reason you can get away with really crappy pidgin english but the same does not go for german .

  it 's increasingly harder to find a vacationing spot in europe . 
  edit : keep downvoting me , not as if that will change it . 
  i 'm not making this up , you know . 
   we need to stop them in transit countries you answered your own question . 
  we can as our [ evidence ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hungarian_border_barrier ) shows do exactly that . 
  if the route to go further on gets blocked the influx new migrants will eventually diminish . 
  in the long run illegal routes will be abandoned this way .

  trust me it 's not referred as `` saint-etienne-du-rouvray '' attack in the international media because no one has a clue where it is . 
  rouen is a place though that people are at least vaguely aware of .

  yep , eu is primarily important for the us as a continental buffer to russia ( trade is a factor too but what do we have that they can not get , maybe for a bit higher price ) . 
  making the eu formidable in all traditional aspects of a state ( especially militarily ) should be a higher priority than closer ties with the us .

  you 're welcome !, 
  no , [ we did get most of the hungarian-populated territories back during wwii ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vienna_awards ) .

  maybe he was waiting for something like this his whole life , let him have his moment !, 
  no probs , always happy to help those who are in need . 
  the [ northern mountains ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/north_hungarian_mountains ) are a great area to ride around at , did it several times . 
  the only thing i can really think of is that we gained international recognition with the [ revolution of ' 56 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hungarian_revolution_of_1956 ) and with opening our borders to austria in '89 as the first to do so in the eastern bloc . 
  communism really was n't much more than wasting state resources for stupid projects like trying to grow orange in the continental climate of hungary or producing random wares just for the sake of producing something ( really , it was a thing ) because of the ideology that everyone has to work - they created pseudo-jobs for everyone so to say . 
  thinking of this , maybe the very low unemployment rate and the security it usually gave to people , especially in the less advanced east , was the only positive aspect of the whole show - if we do n't think about how efficient or useful the actual duties were . 
  there are approximately 12-3 million hungarians in europe ( and another 2 million in the us ) but the 2-3 million are in neighbouring countries [ because we lost wwii ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/trianon_treaty ) . 
  apart from the united kingdom i 'm not really aware of any significant eurosceptics around , are there ? 
  we do need more integrated eu military with an agressive great power ( russia ) in our vicinity though . 
  the bicycle road-network has improved significantly in the latest years , both around the country and in budapest , partly due to critical mass itself , but it 's not perfect yet of course . 
  i 'm not , for example [ critical mass ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/critical_mass_%28cycling%29#scale ) is quite big here . 
  also , apart from recreation , there 's a significant number of people in rural areas using bicycles for their everyday business ( work , shopping , travel between villages ) as a cheap alternative to cars ( this of course applies to cities as well , but to a lesser extent , especially in the capital ) . 
  why would you want to get rid of the west ? 
  if europe wants to have weight on the international scene , it has to have at least eu-degree cooperation . 
  otherwise it 's just a bunch of weak nation states that can be thrown around however the us and russia wants it to . 
  we have to rely on each other . 
  the world 's progressing towards semi - or continental-scale integration and that 's the only viable future for europe either . 
  we have to put our differences and the past aside and concentrate on what 's better for the region as a whole . 
  if we want to have a european future , that is . 
  i think we all know how 50 years of the reds helped our countries ' progression .

  could someone calculate how many of these projects coul 've been built with all the money sunk into greece recently ? 
  they could never win a conventional war against any of these targets , hell they ca n't even get a torn up country like syria for themselves . 
  it 's all to gather more braindead for their cause . 
   tunisia will close down 80 mosques ** that were outside state control ** for allegedly inciting violence now that makes it much more understandable , good on them . 
  an * homage * to some * great * mods on here i believe . 
  maybe backlashes on their religion is the only way these nutjobs will start thinking about going around killing peaceful people . 
  then again , i do n't know how will this happen in practice in a 98 % muslim country . 
  it certainly sends a message though . 
  that 's exactly the reason why i started looking for aquifer maps of europe , on the apropo of turning aquifers off in my new df game . 
  [ on this wiki page ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ogallala_aquifer ) of an american aquifer it states that it 'd fill up in 6,000 + years from precipitation would it get depleted .

  \u00bf que ? 
   the number of refugees entering hungary increased from a total of 2,000 in 2012 to 54,000 in january this year , which makes hungary the eu member-state that , after sweden , receives the largest number of refugees in proportion to its population . 
  then these would probably all move on into the rest of the eu . 
  same situation as in the mediterranean , hungary at least tries to do something about it . 
  [ looking at this map ] ( http://i.imgur.com/u4gpdzy.png ) i doubt hungarians should be your greatest concern .

  wondering though how would the eu react to one of the poorest regions in europe getting attached to it . 
  holy shit you are a butthurt and sad one .

  the hungarian-hun kinship is n't exactly a proven fact ( hungary comes from the bastardization of `` onugor '' , meaning `` ten tribes '' in an ancient turk language ) , despite what the hungarian nationalists might tell you . 
  hungarians are ... smart . 
   hungarians are ... racist . 
  erm ... hungarians are ... asian . 
  you assume that the people rioting are aware of the possible consequences of state bankruptcy . 
  they are probably the same people who would say things like `` if the government does n't have enough money , why do n't they print more ? 
  as for hungary : the `` progressives '' are arguing with each other . 
  dk , ferenc gyurcs\u00e1ny 's new party is open to cooperation , but his person alone would cause a 5 % popularity drop , so no one is willing to cooperate . 
  mszp ( the socialist party ) is in a complete disarray after their defeat in 2010 , lmp ( the liberal-ish party ) does n't want to cooperate with them ( they learned from the mistakes of the szdsz , the previous liberal party that cooperated with mszp and perished during the 2006-2010 cycle ) - well , at least until they will be the more popular party . 
  and more than half of the population is completely apathetic . 
  error 404 , no given fucks found . 
  this is a multi-layered issue , but the basic reason is corporate greed . 
  there are networks of companies that are owned by the same company ( t-mobile , vodafone and telenor come to mind ) . 
  they * could * provide cheap roaming and international calls . 
  however there are n't a lot of people who use roaming / call international regularly . 
  four groups of people could be differentiated : 1 . 
  those who do n't roam a lot / at all , use other networks only on vacation thus spend 95 % of their time on the home network . 
  when they are on a foreign network , they try to minimize their cell phone usage . 
  the companies * might * be able to acquire more profit if they lowered their roaming and data roaming prices , but it 's uncertain . 
  those who travel a lot to one specific country ( middle-managers of multinational companies , people living on the borders , etc. . . ) . 
  they usually have two cell phones or an unlocked phone and two sim cards . 
  lowering the prices might actually * decrease * the revenue from these people as they would terminate one of the contracts . 
  those who travel a lot . 
  they either have a company phone or are just so rich that they can afford data roaming . 
  as with the previous case , decreasing the prices would decrease the profit . 
  people who are living abroad or have a family / friends who live abroad ( i 'll probably join their ranks this fall ) . 
  skype was invented for them . 
  i 'll just convert my hungarian contract ( it 's 3 years old , so no etf ) to a pre-paid one ( to keep the number when i visit home ) , get a contract in the netherlands and use skype to make calls . 
  i might even invest in a skypein number / skypeout credits . 
  there 's also the issue of different tarifs in countries with different socioeconomic variables . 
  unless every country has the same average wage , eu-wide tarifs do n't make any sense . 
  i 'd love to see eu-wide providers , but it wo n't happen unless the mobility of workforce increases ( prompting a greater demand for cheap roaming and international calls ) . 
  / r/iwantout, 
  yeah ... no one says the winner cheated , no one wants to re-count the votes - we 're not used to this kind of thing here . 
  half of what he says in czech is swearing , and the other half is fourth-wall breaking , right ? 
  and some have it in the bathroom , and some have a separate hookup in a closet . 
  the right wing is whining about decreasing birthrates , the left wing is whining about unemployment caused by automation , both are real problems * that will solve each other well before children who are born today enter the workforce * . 
  if birth rates suddenly increased to sustaining or growing levels ( 2.1 and above ) , then we would have actually worsened both of these problems !, 
  first , someone has to care for these children . 
  the problem with an aging population is n't simply a `` more old people '' problem , it 's a `` more dependents , fewer dependees '' problem . 
  an increased birth rate would add a lot of children to this system for at least two decades , and it would definitely pull some people from the workforce ( most likely the mothers , especially in hungary ) . 
  and that is only the people who elect to become stay-at-home parents . 
  the increased birth rate would also overtax the education system , which would respond with hiring more teachers - meaning that an even larger portion of the population would depend on public money - and/or returning to or conserving frontal education which is obsolete and shitty , but relatively conservative regarding the teacher-hours/student rate . 
  and then what happens when these children grow up ? 
  they will enter the workforce in 18-25 years . 
  automation is already taking over a bunch of jobs ( i would know ; i 'm one of the people helping machines to do that ) . 
  in 25 years the problem these people were born to solve - namely the retiring baby boomers and equivalent generations - wo n't exist , and they will have to compete with robots for an even larger number of jobs . 
  if we had a time machine , or at least a transtemporal radio , and we could tell the governments of 25 years ago to start working on the birth rates ? 
  sure . 
  except they would n't have needed messages from the future , because this was entirely foreseeable , and they still did n't give a shit . 
  but doing it now would be insane . 
  - `` break a hand and a leg ! '', 
  english , german , latin and spanish . 
  german in hungary is the second most popular language after english because austria is next door and germany is hungary 's most important trading partner . 
  latin is only taught in religious schools and some other weird-ass schools like where i learned it , and spanish in high school is fairly rare ( in fact , most schools do n't even have teachers who teach something besides english and german ) . 
  as for when and how i was taught these : * english in grades 1-4 was entirely elective ( and ultimately ineffective , because each year we got a new teacher , a new book , and started over from zero ) . 
  some other kids ( or rather , parents ) picked german , with similar results . 
  * in grades 5-6 i attended a 8-year * gymnasium * with a focus on languages . 
  german was compulsory ( for half of the students , the others learned english ) in 10 classes per week , so was latin * from grade 7 i attended a normal 6-year * gymnasium * . 
  in these grades one language was compulsory , and i was learning english again - and again , it was completely ineffective because both the size of the group and the differences in level . 
  one ca n't teach a group of 20 in only 2 \\* 45 minutes a week , where the group contains both people who can barely introduce themselves and people who are at b1-b2 level . 
  ( my english is mostly self-taught , watching stargate atlantis and house md in the original language without subtitles did a lot more than the 6 years of english in school . ), 
  ultimately , i ended up testing out both because it was useless and because up until 2005 , if you had a b2-level language exam , you automatically got a 100 % advanced level graduation exam assuming you had completed all the required grades from the given language . 
  we ultimately got the principal to split the group by skill by grade 9 which improved the level of education somewhat , but i was so much ahead of even that group by then that it did n't quite matter for me . 
  * in grade 9 a second language was compulsory . 
  originally the school wanted the traditional system of english-learners picking up german and german-learners picking up english , but many people in the german group spoke some english already ( either self-taught or through private classes ) . 
  and while i was the only one in the english group speaking german , many of the others simply did n't like the language . 
  the school had a spanish teacher anyway , so we ended up learning spanish . 
  ( frankly , since in 2005 i also tested out of german , i could have just had no language classes at all , but i rather preferred to use the opportunity . ), 
  nw ( around sopron and gy\u0151r ) . 
  mostly because half of the population is working in austria , and half of the rest is providing services to austrians . 
  all of the government propaganda channels are funded with public money . 
  even those that are not officially state owned . 
  sadly , hungary . 
  especially if you go outside the touristy and university areas of budapest . 
  in hungary 50 + % of the people voted on parties other than fidesz . 
  fidesz still had 2/3rds of the seats for a while , and thus absolute power ( until they lost a district in a midterm ) . 
  according to their fans , it 's a natural outcome of the system . 
  according to the opposition it 's a failure of democracy . 
  both are right , as the new system was designed by fidesz alone , and contains every dirty trick to maximize the number of seats they get versus a fractured opposition ( short of converting the system to a fully fptp-based individual district system , possibly because such a system might actually push the opposition into cooperating with each other ) . 
  there 's already a law like this in hungary ( except it 's 18 ) . 
  nobody gives a shit , kids who want to smoke either get someone over 18 to buy them a pack , or just buy smokes smuggled in from ukraine , romania or serbia ( they are cheaper , too ) . 
  budapest : it 's a real patchwork .

  the two-tailed dog party . 
  free beer and eternal life for everyone !, 
  i do n't hate it , but even the modern far right seems to have taken both the turul and the stripes as symbols , and thus everybody not far-right will be at least a bit wary about using them . 
  the [ turul ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/turul ) , which looks badass , but unfortunately we do n't have an idea what actual bird it is meant to be . 
  it was also used by the nationalist groups before / during ww2 , so there are some negative connotations to it . 
  there are also the best-known hungarian dogs , the puli ( the small rasta-dog , frequently mistaken for a mop ) and the vizsla ( medium-sized short-haired hunting dog ) . 
  those are cute , and fortunately not over-bred ( yet ) . 
   i had never encountered a street preacher in europe there 's usually one in front of amsterdam centraal . 
  send over everyone who can speak arabic to help with processing the applications of refugees both inside the eu , and in the refugee camps . 
  especially those who can speak it well enough to tell levantene apart from other dialects . 
  also , they could realize that toppling a dictatorship and establishing a stable democracy is a multi-decade social engineering process , and if they are n't prepared to spend the next few decades in the country making sure that another extremist group does n't take over , refrain from `` liberating '' dictatorships .

  it 's only a humanitarian mission if you leave the place in a better shape than you found it . 
  ( i live in rotterdam ) every day . 
  it was made by one party in 2011 , tailored to them and their voting base . 
  it codifies a bunch of shit that a constitution should not contain ( marriage is between a man and a woman , life begins at conception , etc. . . ) , and essentially guarantees a two-party system and that no referendum will pass . 
  there are a bunch of other provisions that set up other things the government probably wanted to pass ( like that `` life begins at conception '' part , which is clearly there to set up an abortion ban , or at least a restriction on the level of poland ) , but have n't gotten around to it yet . 
  it should just be thrown out and a new , modern and much slimmer constitution should be implemented that only contains things people actually agree upon . 
  it should of course include a bunch of basic definitions ( name of the country , symbols , who is the president and what is their role , the branches of power , etc. . . ) but beyond that , it should be decided by a referendum . 
  which one ? 
  there are three . 
  two revolution-related ones ( march 15 and october 23 ) are during school period , and they are pretty boring ( and became completely politicized in the last 15 years ) . 
  the actual `` celebration '' part is just political speeches , military formation marching behind the parliament ( well , technically in front of , but the `` backside '' , the side facing the danube is probably better known ) , and in the last decade + , protests . 
  the `` country 's birthday '' , august 20 is better ( if only because there is no school celebration , and less politics is involved ) , it 's generally just fireworks and fun . 
  it 's also a sort-of harvest festival ( the first wheat harvest of the year was traditionally around that time ) . 
  sometimes there is a re-enactment of the classic rock opera `` istv\u00e1n a kir\u00e1ly '' ( `` steven , the king '' ) , a creative dramatization of the civil war that led to the establishment of the kingdom of hungary . 
  we 're supposed to side with istv\u00e1n , but [ kopp\u00e1ny , the `` villain '' has way better songs ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9n5mzmpj2g ) . 
  ( and he has , at least in the opera , [ three hot nymphomaniac bisexual wives ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mayq3ghiqeg ) . 
  and we were supposed to side with the self-doubting restrained christian prince , yeah , right . 
  in comparison , [ here is one of istv\u00e1n 's defining songs ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=upxq1wtqork ) . ), 
  the original version , seen in those videos , is almost always aired on at least one of the national tv-channels . 
  i do n't exactly think in sides , i tend to form opinions on issues on an individual basis . 
  so from a certain perspective , i am my own side , and this side 's platform is defined as `` things i agree with '' . 
  consequently , the opposing side 's is `` things i do n't agree with '' , and by definition , i do n't agree with those . 
  but we 're living in representative systems , so i have to compromise . 
  in light of this , the question can be interpreted and answered . 
  i tend to vote liberal , because of two compromises i make . 
  first of all , i consider banning hate speech a lesser evil , compared to allowing ( or even endorsing ) wholesale discrimination . 
  since there is no party who wants to take legislative steps against actual discrimination but leave condemnation of discriminative speech up to society , i have to vote on parties whose stance on free speech is not entirely agreeable . 
  second , both the left and the right have simplified views on state spending ( they want more and less , respectively ) . 
  it 's quite possible that the views their leaders actually hold are more nuanced than what they are campaigning with , but i do n't like voting on someone just to hope that their election program was at least partially bullshit . 
  liberals tend to come in two flavors , left-liberals who want the state ( = other people ) to finance everything , and libertarians who want to cut spending radically , even in areas where it does good on the long term and has good returns ( like education ) . 
  at the current state of hungarian economy , i think the left-liberal attitude would cause less damage , but nevertheless , i have to hope that their spending promises are just hot air . 
  ( in 2002 they were not , state debt jumped but the quality of life did n't , and it left the country in a pretty bad shape for the 2008 recession . ), 
  there are tons of turkish words in hungarian . 
  some because hungarians spent a while among turkic people while migrating from the ural mountains to the carpathian basin , and a lot more because of the 150 years of occupation . 
  well , the martians have been speaking hungarian in a supergirl episode . 
  with horrific accents ( just how hard is it to find a hungarian language coach in vancouver ? 
  ) , but still . 
  that 's strange , because syllable stress is actually kinda important in hungarian ( always the first syllable of the word ) . 
  maybe it sounds robotic if you 're using short words only , and if you took only a semester of hungarian , you probably did n't get around to the longer words . 
  and then there are the guys from the ne-part of the country who tend to speak in a highly melodic dialect ( compared to the much more monotonic and businesslike budapest dialect ) . 
  most people have a complete wtf face when i speak in hungarian . 
  it might sound to them like a very angry language , but that 's just because the part they get to hear from me is usually just swearing . 
  hungarians in general ? 
  none . 
  even the related languages had vastly different linguistic influences in the few thousand years since we separated . 
  hell , give them voting rights too . 
  they are just as informed as the average voter anyway . 
  we kinda elected them . 
  i mean , the minister of internal affairs ( you know , the one overseeing the police ) is a well-known mafia don ( nothing can be proven , ofc ) . 
  assuming present birth rates ( which is probably an incorrect assumption ) . 
  also , with overpopulation the problem is n't simply the amount of people . 
  it 's how much the people of earth use from earth 's natural resources and how much pollution they produce . 
  and in this regard the developed world still has , and will have the developing world beat for a long long time . 
  basically : 1-5 , 1 is failing grade . 
  but there are some variations . 
  from most common ( = almost every teacher gives them out ) to least common : * 5 \\* : perfect score . 
  usually just counted as a 5 when calculating averages for end-of-semester and end-of-year grades , though teachers enjoy a level of discretion when determining the grade : both the grade itself can differ from the average , and they can count the 5 \\* as 5,1 or 5,5 if they want to . 
  * underscore grade : tends to be given if one achieves the lower point limit of a given grade . 
  an `` underscore-5 '' is essentially the equivalent of an a - you know from american media . 
  still counted as a normal grade usually . 
  * 1/2 , 2/3 , 3/4 and 4/5 ( it was sure as hell not a math teacher who made these up , but they stuck ) : if a teacher gives these out , it 's usually for achieving the upper point limit of a given grade . 
  in the average calculation , they usually use this as 1,5 , 2,5 , 3,5 and 4,5 . 
  * overline grade : essentially the same . 
  * 0 : did n't even try . 
  handed in a blank sheet , a drawing of a dick , or something like that . 
  counted as a 1 . 
  there 's another one that occurs only in end-of-semester and end-of-year grades : 5d , `` d\u00edcs\u00e9retes \u00f6t\u00f6s '' = five with praise . 
  the actual criteria depend on the teacher , some will require that you only get 5s in the whole year , others wo n't require that , but you still need to have a good enough average for a normal 5 and then go above and beyond for some classes , and yet others require both . 
  not really official ( well , there might be some rewards for honor students at the end-of-year ceremony , but that 's it ) , basically only exists for parental bragging rights . 
  ahs usually have an international food aisle separate from the usual pasta / rice aisle . 
  that 's where they keep the curry pastes , tortilla wraps and mexican spices , ketjap , coconut milk , etc. . . ( and of course the root beer ) . 
  preferred : bike . 
  have to use : train . 
  i would never * ever * drive through the a20/a12/a2 in the morning rush . 
  ( i live in the netherlands . ), 
  outside europe , canada  nz  australia  usa  argentina . 
  israel is functional because jews were present in all strata of society in roughly the same distribution as the local majority ( and were overrepresented among the intellectuals ) . 
  the same can not be said about the romani . 
  do you want a second israel ? 
  because that 's how you get a second israel . 
  romani are a minority everywhere , creating an artificial country for them and displacing the local population will just make sure that every surrounding country will do everything in their power to take that piece of land back . 
  so unless this hypothetical romani country is propped up by a superpower like america or russia , it would get crushed in a week , and if it is propped up by one of such superpowers , it would poison their relationship with the surrounding countries . 
  which is a bad idea regardless of whether it is done in their supposed homeland ( taking territory from one , or even potentially two nuclear powers ) or e-europe ( if america does it , it pushes the affected countries straight into putin 's welcoming embrace , and if russia does it , they lose all the political clout they gained in europe by propping up right and far right parties in an instance ) . 
  i do n't know what to answer for the other two , but we definitely love fucking ourselves . 
  a bunch of people do n't have an \u00dc on their keyboards and do n't know how to use combining diacritics ( \u00a8 + u ) , the standard us keyboard does n't even has the combining diacritic ( you need the us international layout for that ) . 
  budapest , like it were a city with an insect / rodent problem . 
  and basically every word with an `` s '' in it . 
  hungarian `` s '' is kinda like the english `` sh '' , the sound that 's like the english `` s '' is `` sz '' . 
  the multimillion dollar company , for example ? 
  or like a dutch u. 
  * religion - nope . 
  * food - not really ; i use hungarian spices sometimes but i do n't subscribe to the general `` if you do n't get a quadruple bypass by age 50 , you 're not eating right '' diet . 
  * fashion - i do n't think there * is * a contemporary hungarian fashion tradition ( at least not for anyone below the top 0.1 % ) . 
  but then nope , i might get a pair of sneakers when i 'm back in hungary but they are kinda hard to acquire in the netherlands . 
  * gestures - huh ? 
  nobody learns hungarian anyway . 
  we 'll be happy to teach you the basics ( k\u00e9rem , k\u00f6sz\u00f6n\u00f6m , igen , nem , baszd meg ) , but we do n't expect you to speak it . 
  it is pretty close for foreign words or words that were created before the mid-1700s or so . 
  for words after that , all bets are off . 
  the grammar is also similar , for example , the word order is almost the same , and the same structures exist frequently ( um + zu becomes om + te , but it 's the exact same structure ) .

  `` dolguk '' means `` their job/task/duty '' . 
  in this context , something like their natural role , their godgiven mission , their responsibility , the thing we should require/expect from them , etc. 
  it 's not about forbidding , he basically says that emancipation and equal rights movements lead to pointless stuff like female weightlifters and he goes on to explain that women 's hips and men 's shoulders are wider for a reason . 
  he also says that men and women are equally important but have different roles , as described in genesis . 
  he does n't mean it in a way that we should force them to give birth to children , on the contrary : he thinks the modern emancipated women are forced to do something that does n't fit them naturally . 
  it 's fine to disagree with him , but he 's not speaking out against women taking up such duties , but against this system that equates all value with money and therefore says that women have to go out and earn as much as men . 
  i also disagree with him in many ways ( also for example about using religion as an argument ) , but he 's not saying that we must forbid this to women , but rather that we should enable them to be in their natural role . 
  for more context , see [ this partially subtitled video of the interview ] ( http://amara.org/en/videos/9ljd3v3c7haz/info/kovacs-akos-arckep/ ) from 9:10 . 
  here is the video of the interview of \u00c1kos , i subtitled the relevant part , from 9:10 , so that non-hungarians can understand what the whole fuss is about . 
  well , he was in prison for 3 and a half years . 
  i guess you ca n't put someone in prison for much longer if they have n't committed actual criminal actions besides talking and preaching and fund-raising . 
  maybe you misunderstood it . 
  they are still in hungary in detention ( or whatever is the precise term , under arrest etc ) . 
  no occupation is legal , no military conquest is seen as legitimate , especially not by the victims . 
  hungary could also say - and indeed many people do - that the ottoman occupation did not `` really happen '' in the legal sense , because our historic constitution and the rule of the holy crown can not be overruled by such things , and hungary was united all along , when in fact a certain part effectively became part of the ottoman empire , another part became a half-autonomous but basically ottoman oriented satellite state , and yet another was ruled by the habsburg austrians . 
  so yeah we can say the spirit of the holy crown still floated above these lands , but again , unless you are involved in it emotionally , there 's no sense in talking about it like that . 
  latvia was not independent in practice . 
  yes , in abstract imaginary legal theory it might have been . 
  [ according to reuters sources ] ( http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/11/18/us-hungary-britain-arrest-iduskcn0t719r20151118 ) , they are well-known islamists : * [ abu izzadeen ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/abu_izzadeen ) ( born trevor brooks ) . 
  [ here 's one speech by him ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2d0tp3efqk ) . 
  * [ sulayman keeler ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sulayman_keeler ) ( born simon keeler ) , whose incarceration was described by hstoday as the `` first time a white convert has been incarcerated for islamist terror charges in the uk . '', 
  [ video of him talking ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkz1pjdgh_a ) edit : updated with reuters source . 
  they retroactively reinterpreted their history as if they had been independent all along . 
  yeah , it makes no sense but it 's probably a sensitive issue . 
  every system regards the system before it as illegitimate , illegal , non-existent de jure , `` the true system was there in the background all along '' etc. 
  there 's really no point in arguing this . 
  it 's like arguing whether taiwan has power over mainland china or not . 
  some people will say yes , they are still the legitimate power in mainland china and then comes an elaborate legal explanation of how the communists did illegal stuff and the real government is just in exile in taiwan etc. 
  i prefer to just look at the de facto situation because everything else is just mental gymnastics and theoretical musings . 
  i was once at a german hausarzt ( gp ) , an i was astonished by the amount of pseudoscientific medical stuff there . 
  homeopathy , acupunture , a poster of an ear and a foot , marking areas responsible for different diseases etc. 
  just astonishing how this can happen . 
  probably because being a gp is a private business model in germany , so they have to compete for the patients and apparently patients want nonsense . 
  makes you wonder how much of a good idea it is to let market forces decide in things like medicine . 
  apparently unknown outside hungary but considered a masterpiece in hungary , [ the tragedy of man ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_tragedy_of_man ) ( [ text online ] ( http://mek.oszk.hu/00900/00918/html/ ) ) by mad\u00e1ch was the only classic book i could read to the end from my own will of all the compulsory reads in school . 
  it 's a reflective look at human history , the struggle of humanity in progress higher and higher but getting disappointed . 
  it 's a very symbolic book . 
  each scene is set in a historic era from the beginning of time through eras like ancient egypt , kepler and the scientific revolution , and even a dystopian future of a rational but uniform and dull society and even some scenes in outer space . 
  in each scene adam , eve and lucifer ( satan ) `` reincarnate '' in a contemporary historic figure . 
  it 's a surprisingly modern philosophical book ( although it was published in 1861 ) , touching on ethics , purpose etc. 
  the most genial parts are lucifers comments , as he intelligently but not maliciously smashes adams dreams , aspirations and struggles as meaningless and pointless and adam tries to argue and defend himself . 
  the scenes are : * scene 1 -- in heaven , immediately following the creation . 
  * scene 2 -- in the garden of eden at the beginning of time . 
  * scene 3 -- outside the garden of eden at the beginning of time . 
  adam is a pharaoh , most likely djoser ; lucifer his vizier ; eve is the wife of a slave . 
  adam is miltiades the younger ; lucifer is a guard ; eve is miltiades ' wife . 
  adam is a wealthy roman ; lucifer is his friend , eve is a prostitute . 
  * scene 7 -- constantinople , ad 1096 . 
  adam is prince tancred of hauteville ; lucifer is his squire ; eve is a noble maiden forced to become a nun . 
  * scene 8 -- prague , c. ad 1615 . 
  adam is johannes kepler ; lucifer is his pupil ; eve is his wife , barbara . 
  * scene 9 -- paris , ad 1793 ( in a dream of kepler ) . 
  adam is georges danton ; lucifer is an executioner ; eve appears in two forms , first as an aristocrat about to be executed , then immediately following as a bloodthirsty poor woman . 
  * scene 10 -- prague , c. ad 1615 . 
  adam is johannes kepler ; lucifer is his pupil ; eve is his wife , barbara . 
  * scene 11 -- london , 19th century . 
  adam and lucifer are nameless englishmen ; eve is a young woman of the middle class . 
  * scene 12 -- a communist/technocratic phalanstery , in the future . 
  adam and lucifer masquerade as traveling chemists ; eve is a worker who protests when she is separated from her child . 
  * scene 13 -- space . 
  adam and lucifer are themselves , eve does not appear in this scene . 
  * scene 14 -- an ice age in the distant future , at least ad 6000 . 
  adam is a broken old man ; lucifer is himself ; eve is an eskimo 's wife . 
  * scene 15 -- outside eden at the beginning of time . 
  my ideas on americans are formed largely through movies and reddit . 
  as the other commenter said , people on reddit suggest going to a therapist for things that could perhaps be solved having a good talk with a friend , too . 
  but the individualist society alienates people and many people do n't have anyone to talk to , so they pay a therapist . 
  of course it 's a caricature . 
  but everything is like that when we are communicating in so few lines of comments . 
  blaming substances is naive . 
  if you ca n't get access to alcohol you do n't just magically sort out your wrecked life . 
  i recommend you [ this short video about addiction ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ao8l-0nsyzg ) . 
  oh fat and sugar alter the brain well , too and can lead to escapism and unhealthy coping mechanisms . 
  is it healthy if you counter your stress and depressed feelings with eating huge bowls of chips , pizza and coke and become 130 kg ? 
  drinking a few glasses of wine or beer at social events wo n't make you an alcoholic asshole who shouts and beats his family with a belt when he gets home from the bar at night . 
  maybe i 'm not using words right , or maybe you ca n't comprehend , but i 'm not talking about binge drinking now , but the levels that are currently seen as healthy and i 'm debating whether it makes sense to restrict it to absolute zero due to negative health effects on your physical organs . 
  i 'm not talking about alcoholism ruining your life , but giving up the social culture of a glass of wine in exchange for reduced risk of some diseases . 
  organising big feasts with fatty foods can also be socially useful , while bad physically . 
  i do n't talk about getting black out drunk . 
  and it seems that many-many people drink alcohol for this chill feeling of less inhibitions . 
  i admit that wine can taste good in itself , but you can feel a slight sensation of the alcohol even after a glass of it . 
  and it can make romantic dinners better too . 
  of course you can insist on using no external substances , also never eating fatty or sweet foods for enjoyment because enjoyment must be deserved by discipline , hard work and struggle and it 's cheating to get it through such cheap methods , okay i can accept this as a philosophy , but not everyone has to act like that . 
  obviously i 'm talking about a balance . 
  not alcoholism taking over your life and being unable to function before drinking a shot in the morning . 
  my stereotypical idea is that americans can not show weakness in everyday relationships , the mile-wide american smile must be kept , everything must be awesome and you 're supposed to feel great , and complaining is n't socially accepted . 
  so there is little support from your social environment , friends , family etc. , you need to pay someone to listen . 
  based on reddit , yes . 
  feminism and transgender debates , atheism/creationism debates , college campus political correctness , circumcision , gun control , etc. 
  maybe this is just a language issue , but americans seem to wonder a lot about whether something is `` a thing '' or when it became `` a thing '' . 
  maybe it 's just a turn of phrase , but it seems to be a unique concept to me . 
  it 's also hard to translate meaningfully . 
  exactly . 
  i never understood this idea that `` the internet is fascinated by cats '' . 
  i just do n't get it . 
  not * why * people are fascinated by cats , but why people * think * that so many people are fascinated by cats . 
  it 's just not `` a thing '' here . 
  if one or two glasses of wine make you feel better at dinner and helps your social life , then does it really matter if it carries a minuscule risk of physical health ? 
  maybe it enables you to bond better with people , leading to better motivation levels , less stress etc. 
  of course i 'm not talking about alcoholism , i 'm specifically referring to the levels that we accept as normal today .

  the acceleration since then has been vast . 
  it 's not the same . 
  perhaps * complaining * about how kids do n't obey as well as the early generations and the belief in gradual moral decay has been there for a long time , but actual generational gaps were much smaller . 
  today there 's a gap in understanding of cultural references , the general activities , the jobs that people do etc. . . 
  the 20th century also saw huge social change . 
  the form of state of european countries changed rapidly , kingdoms that stood for centuries or a millenium were abolished . 
  new ideologies like communism and national socialism took ground , people started going to school in masses , then pop music was born , movies , technology , revolutions in science and our picture of humanity . 
  today ( the last ~ 100 years ) is far from `` the same old thing as always '' . 
  basically people from any country in europe will say it 's their national characteristic that they like to drink and to complain . 
  referendum on migration quota 2 . 
  bomb explosion in budapest that injured two police officers ( not related to migration ) . 
  in hungary we do n't have such complex rules . 
  the only thing is that if you take the first exit , you * must * enter in the right lane . 
  if you take the 2nd or 3rd exit , you can use whichever lane you want . 
  there are of course places where you can see `` people that are very poor , people with bad hygiene , homeless people '' , it 's parks , underpasses , perhaps public transport at certain times in certain places . 
  i do n't usually see mentally ill people anywhere . 
  we have many overweight people and it 's a serious health issue . 
  heart disease is the leading cause of death , many people have high blood pressure , cholesterol , etc. 
  our cuisine includes lots of fat , starch , meat , cakes and not much veggies . 
  still we do n't really see the kind of extreme morbid obesity that seems to be commonplace in the us . 
  [ this kind of ( quite dangerous ) pot belly ] ( http://www.szon.hu/sorhas-verseny-szavazzon-on-is/1719158 ) ( scroll down to see several pics ) is not unusual , but you rarely see fatter people than this type . 
  [ this kind of fatness ] ( https://i.ytimg.com/vi/kukr1lsje2c/hqdefault.jpg ) is very very unusual here . 
  also our homeless are different than yours . 
  hungarian homeless people are rarely aggressive , they obviously have no guns , they are usually calm and rather lethargic people , they spend money on cheap wine and cigarettes and are usually thin . 
  you mostly see them sleeping somewhere or collecting bottles for recycling , looking for stuff in garbage etc. 
  they do n't spend much time in supermarkets since they are poor and do n't have money to buy stuff . 
   what changed between you and your child with regards to ethnicity ? 
  it 's called assimilation . 
  after a family ( lineage ) lives long enough in the country and marries estonians , adopts estonian culture and identity , the descendants will be estonians . 
  tribalism is in our human nature . 
  anyway , in many european countries this is just not even a question . 
  people know what it means and it means that . 
  it 's very rare that someone ca n't decide whether they `` qualify '' as an estonian or not . 
  and just because you 're not estonian by ethnicity , you can have full estonian citizenship and everything . 
  and if you think this is nonsense , how about ethnic minorities ? 
  would you deny the right of the ethnic hungarian minority in romania to call themselves hungarian by ethnicity ? 
  would you force them to consider themselves romanian , even though their mother tongue is hungarian , their parents are hungarian , their grandparents were hungarian , they identify with hungarian history and culture etc. ? 
  would you say that the slovak minority in hungary should not call themselves slovaks because it 's nonsense ? 
  in many parts of the world , countries and nations are n't the same . 
  a country is a state , a political entity . 
  the nation/ethnicity is a social entity . 
   there is no estonian ethnicity of course there is . 
  other countries have a different concept of ethnicity than britain ( like `` white , black , asian , mixed , chinese and other '' ) . 
  for us white is not an ethnicity . 
  it 's a race ( which is pretty ill-defined already ) . 
  `` hungarian '' is an ethnicity , `` polish '' is an ethnicity , `` estonian '' is an ethnicity , `` russian '' is an ethnicity . 
  wikipedia : `` an ethnic group or ethnicity is a category of people who identify with each other based on similarities , such as common language , ancestral , social , cultural , or national experiences . '', 
   i only say hate because of the aggression it tends to bring to the discussion . 
  those who just roll their eyes do n't comment , just roll their eyes and move on . 
  this is like that in many topics . 
  everything seems like a bigger deal online than it is in real life . 
  because only those people write for whom it 's important . 
  in hungary , length up to human height is measured in cm . 
  we usually only say the prefix : deci means deciliter , centi means centimeter , deka means decagram , kil\u00f3 means kilogram . 
  they are a thing in si . 
  deci - and deca - are standard prefixes . 
  for scientific and engineering use they prefer to use only prefixes whose exponent is divisible by 3 , like kilo = 10 ^ 3 , mega = 10 ^ 6 milli = 10 ^ ( -3 ) . 
  correction : it 's written dl , not dcl . 
  why ? 
  because it 's simpler when precision is not that important . 
  when buying ham or cheese it 's simpler to say `` 15 deka '' than `` 150 gramm '' . 
  smaller numbers are easier on the mind . 
  with drinks we also say `` 2 deci '' instead of `` 200 milli ( liter ) '' or `` 0.2 liter '' . 
  much easier , sounds less overly-precise and pharmacy-like . 
  with shot drinks we also use cl and pronounce it `` cent '' , so a normal shot would be 4 or 5 cent , instead of saying `` 50 milliliter '' or `` 0.05 liter '' . 
  i was surprised to learn that germans do n't use these . 
  i still do n't fully understand how you should talk about such quantities in german in an everyday , relaxed context , and not sound like explaining a science experiment . 
  i know that 's the si standard , but in hungary we use dkg traditionally . 
  [ by population density ] ( http://sedac.ciesin.columbia.edu/downloads/maps/nagdc/nagdc-population-landscape-climate-estimates-v3/place3-popdens-1990-europe.jpg ) , i do n't know . 
  and `` sociocultural center '' is very subjective . 
  it 's the center in the sense that the economic and political power is clustered there , but then you could also say that sydney is central australia , which sounds weird . 
  you do n't seem to know much about zizek . 
  there 's a lot of irony in what he was saying there . 
  that does n't really make it the center of europe . 
  but it 's very subjective , i just wanted to point out that it depends on who you ask . 
  for people around here , benelux is definitely western europe and not the center . 
  the center is rather around poland , czechia and slovakia for me . 
  the place where students protested does n't make it the center . 
  people can protest in the western parts too . 
   put the central countries in the center : germany , swiss , benelux danmark , austria and maybe czechs . 
  these seem to be the center for you because you just listed * yourself and your neighbors * ( w/o france ) . 
  if i look [ at this map ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d1/regions_of_europe_based_on_cia_world_factbook.png ) ( note that the dark pink is still europe ) , i 'd rather put the center around ( southern ) poland . 
  christianity yes , european colonial history yes , many people of european ancestry yes , speaks european languages yes . 
  conclusion : western . 
  christianity , greco-roman foundations , the enlightenment , influenced by the french revolution , 19th century nationalism and national revivals . 
  or basically europe + colonies that are largely populated by people of european ancestry ( so australia yes , india no ) . 
  [ here 's a askeurope discussion with over 120 comments from 14 days ago ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/askeurope/comments/51tz8b/where_is_eastern_europe/ ) . 
  my comment from there : it 's controversial , because here in the central european post-communist countries , we see it as a small part of our history that we were under soviet occupation for 45 years . 
  it 's not the defining characteristic of the countries and we 're trying to get rid of the effects it left on us ( most notably that these countries became a lot poorer and there 's still a stigma on them ) . 
  historically , we are a lot closer culturally to the other countries formerly under habsburg rule + poland and germany , than to russia , ukraine and belarus . 
  this goes for historical religious affiliation ( catholicism and protestantism vs. orthodoxy ) , cuisine , traditions for christmas and easter , all sorts of everyday things . 
  as to your second question , it 's not related to the question of eastern europe . 
  `` the west '' or `` western civilization '' inlcudes eastern europe . 
  it 's on the list . 
  you managed to start the shitshow for what ? 
  for pointing out that in some countries gender roles are more pronounced than in other countries ? 
  anyway . 
  by `` traditional gender roles '' i meant general things , like being protective of women and expecting men to fend for themselves , be tough and solve their lives . 
  i know that women worked , of course . 
  my ancestors up to and including my grandparents were peasants and my grandma did hard labor in the fields because it was necessary .

  i still think it is a nice and patriotic poem , and if you think this is the weirdest or harshest part of it , keep reading it gets better . 
  its about literature . 
  this ( beautiful , i think ) poem was written in the heat of trianon by a poet who was in his very early ages . 
  it is what , like 90 years old now . 
  we simply just do n't care about * anything . 
  hungarian kings invited saxons to `` colonize '' transylvania , and also to learn stuff from them . 
  they were also granted some `` elite '' privileges . 
  the other big group of germans were the swabians , and it is pretty usual to `` find '' someone with a german name even now in hungary or romania . 
  keep in mind that the big nations with low percentage also had thousands , millions of casualties , but their population was a * tad bit * bigger . 
  now , a smaller nation to be `` competetive '' in a war , has to throw in everything . 
  the romanian offensive was a great tactical move by the entente , and they even had advantage in the numbers , but they had to fight basically two fronts , one against the austro-hungarian - german army , and one against the bulgarian . 
  most likely it has to do something with the [ 1918 flu ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1918_flu_pandemic ) . 
  only in 1918 , more people died because of the flu , than in ww1 . 
  i actually ca n't feel any pressure from the russians , in fact i think that this whole thing is pushed on us by the mainstream media , and people would n't even talk about it if it was n't mentioned every other week . 
  the thing that really can not be unseen though is the whole moral and attitude of the nation : nobody wants to work properly , nobody cares about rules , everybody is trying to get everything as easily as they can . 
  irl its more like a memorial statue for the ones who died in the military prison camp while ww1 was going on , including romanians , italians and obviously russians . 
  not really , this statue is n't for the `` heroic acts '' , but for the military prison camp of the ww1 troops , including russians , italians and romanians . 
  i still think its what the media wants to tell us , but not reality . 
  i ca n't believe that anyone in power would let an idiot clown to be the president of the us . 
  i do n't think he will be a good president , but definitely not as bad as the mainstream media hypes it , we shall see :d, 
  really ? 
  i always thought that you were ... you know , just too french to buy anything else , but i guess i could have never been more wrong . 
  looks like there are people there who think trump will destroy america and russia will conquer europe . 
  yeah , right . 
  what exactly are you afraid of , or whats your point , i think i do n't get it . 
  even though i 'm not from croatia , but can confirm , lidl is life . 
  their bakery is amazing !, 
  this might be a controversial answer , but i would n't call fighting against the su a blind fight for nothing . 
  obviously , wwii was much bigger and the other german invasions were n't necessary , but i think if hitler does n't attack the su , and europe is giving it time to prepare for their own attack , the continent would not be the same as we know it today . 
  the americans really had to make a run for it , do n't forget that !, 
  the soviets got to the elbe , they just walked through europe like a weekend tour , but what if they are properly prepared for the war ? 
  obviously too many what if-s in this scenario , and there is no what if in history . 
  and thats how spain got 1200 development , and france under pu in my game . 
  all those coat of arms are so simple ... give me back my [ monarchy . 
  ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0c/austria-hungaria_transparency.png ), 
  are those really dolphins ? 
  but why romania ... 
  holy hell . 
  this is exactly what most of the people do , however some find it difficult to return home . 
  yeah , but there are other exceptions aswell , for example my aunt won a language competition ( ? ), 
  and got a trip to the soviet union !, 
  keep in mind that in 1989 , communism was over in hungary so it was no longer mandatory to learn russian - before , it was , but in the 80 's laws got less and less strict . 
  my father is a good example , he was born in 1974 and was in school until the early 90 's ( ? 
  ) , but he can barely create you a sentence in russian . 
  my mother , however was born in ' 76 , and she had never learned russian . 
  owning a house is n't really a trend in the west though , is it ? 
  its totally different here, 
  i dont know , i 've heard you do n't really buy a house or a car , you rent an apartment and lease a car do n't you ? 
  according to hungarian sources , most of us work in london and in the area of london , which is quite surprising for me . 
  since german and english are the foreign languages mostly taught in schools , germany , austria , switzerland and the uk are our main destinations . 
  we do n't really know how many of us are there in the uk . 
  the uk has a data about how many hungarian born residents there are in your country , [ this number is around 80.000 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hungarians_in_the_united_kingdom#cite_note-2015_details-9 ) . 
  however , most of us are only going for work . 
  the estimated numbers of hungarian workers is around 200-300 thousand , but there was an article about 1 million aswell . 
  we are slowly invading you with the poles . 
  german sources said there were around 150 thousand hungarians living in germany in 2014 . 
  this number is obviously increasing aswell . 
  so we do n't actually know the exact numbers , but the estimations are around 500 thousand to 1.5 million hungarians working abroad , mostly the younger generations who already learnt english or german in school . 
  i guess thats also true , but it would be our job - the governments and the workers - to increase the way of living . 
  its not even about that you could n't live with an average hungarian wage well , its just you will never have your own car , your own house , and this is what we want . 
  some stability . 
  nobody wants to live with their parents for 40 years , or in an apartment with the cost increasing every year , but how many of us could actually build a house big enough for a family of 4 ? 
  why would you work here for the half or third amount of money , if you can work abroad and build your future ... 
  i know its not just about the country , but about the mentality of the people aswell , still its really sad . 
  just a side note : in hungary , owning a house is still one of the definitions of being stable , i know in other countries its different . 
  even in schools it became a common conversation now . 
  i think if i would do a poll in my school , around 20 % would want to live in an other country with higher wages . 
  thats 200 students , just in my school , including me . 
  this is how bad the situation is in hungary . 
  yes , but as i 've said , [ they decided ] ( http://totalcar.hu/magazin/hirek/2016/11/16/mar_csak_nehany_hetig_a_mi_autonk_a_swift/ ) to not make any swifts at hungary anymore . 
  its not like that , but i still think its just the media that hypes the situation . 
  you simply can not think of any reason why would it be beneficial to russia to control the baltics . 
  of course you could say they are controlling crimea , but ukraine itself is having a lot of financial troubles and corruption , you can easily do things with nations like this . 
  however , occupying or controlling the baltic states would be far more expensive plus it would obviously mean a war . 
  nobody is that stupid . 
  i dont know , i would drive a new clio or megane gt , they look sexy and drive well , and are ( hopefully ) more reliable . 
  suzuki is taking away our poor little swift though :'( 1994-2017 never forgetti, 
  there was , the facelifted vitara was a great deal for the average hungarian . 
  basically renault is rebadging the dacias and giving them to south africa and south america . 
  no its not , octavia is in between the golf and the passat . 
  yes , they are using the same mqb platform ( almost all vw group cars are using this , from audi to seat ) , but its a little bit closer to the golf . 
  individually , skoda is a great manufacturer , and their quality could be better than vw , but surely vw does n't want that , 
  to be honest i really thought that either the eu would give you things , or nothing would really happen for years . 
  to be honest , we have know idea . 
  some meteorologist predicted that there would be at least 5 cm 's of snow in every part of the country , but what we got for the last week or two is freezing to death , and now a bit of a rain . 
  and a tiny bit of snow yesterday :(, 
  would you recommend nice places for a summer holiday ? 
  even if its not true in this way ( hence your downvote ) , i still think it is a great idea to create this beautiful atmosphere . 
  obviously you could probably do it with modern lights aswell , but c'mon !, 
  a city with so much history behind it deserves something like this . 
  i shall really read his book . 
  my issue is that no one in the fucking world cares . 
  its not just about germany , but about europe aswell . 
  probably thousands , or millions die a day because of poverty , war , terrorism or anything like this . 
  now , i do n't care about israel , not at all . 
  i care about peace between people , between religions . 
  if my media wo n't get fully loaded with all the incidents and tragic things happening everywhere around the world , in iraq , in pakistan , in anywhere else , why do i have to read / see multiple articles about an israeli situation ? 
  i know the answer , so nobody has to tell me it , it just kinda makes me sad . 
  he kinda tried to save his own life by saying that hitler was the devil and he did not know about the camps . 
  now , i 'm not saying that these are false , but he was * very close * to hitler , [ as this comment says ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/askhistorians/comments/3myrpx/when_albert_speer_hitlers_economic_minister/cvjn9em/ ) , every plan , every management , everything , so yeah .

holy crap was it a mixed bag of people .

  i was in a queue at f\u0151zdefeszt for 40 minutes waiting for a burger , then gave up and went to montenegro gourman on blaha lujza t\u00e9r , had a huge pljeskavica with tons of ajvar .

  as far as i know all that bathing in blood and killing servants is a myth , and only appeared in the 18th century , long after her death . 
  i 'm not saying she was a saint but she was n't any worse than other nobleman of her time .

  every .

  even movie titles are localized so sometimes you do n't even know what film you 're watching .

  on the serious note , i live in britain and know that it 's not always easy to be an eastern european here . 
  but i do n't think romanians are singled out . 
  i have colleagues from romania who were here even before the the job market was opened up without any problem . 
  if someone has all the paperwork and the assistant in the bank refuses to open a current account , you call the manager or take your business to another bank . 
  this is how it works and we 've all been there , even locals . 
  the more worrying events are the current [ attacks on polish families ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/may/05/poland-envoy-concerned-attacks-belfast ) .

  it 's paprika mixed with salt in a shot glass , as i could n't find any other small container,

  according to voks 14 an interactive polling app jobbik is at 18 % , magyar hajnal is not measured . 
  this is what 's happening now in hungary . 
  hungarian medics have to sign a contract that they will practice medicine in hungary for 10 years after graduation . 
  if they do n't they have to pay back the costs of their education . 
  but at the same time more and more foreign doctors work in the hungarian healthcare too , romanians , indians , algerians . 
  thanks a lot !, 
  g\u00f6teborg porterfestival sounds amazing, 
  it looks fun from the photos , well maybe 2015 then,

  estonia , belgium and the vatican are just lazy . 
  you must be fun at parties, 
  my friend is married to a ukrainian girl and they have a child on the way . 
  he is quite sure the kid will be properly confused , because in hungary on 6th december we have the mikul\u00e1s ( santa ) coming to bring some sweets to the nice children , then at christmas the baby jesus brings the gifts and in their case grandfather snow will come in january to bring gifts . 
  what 's wales in portuguese ? 
  while the view is superb , when i drove there , i found it quite nerve wrecking to be honest . 
  in every corner there were people parking their cars , blasting manele from the car stereo , frying mici and drinking cujka . 
  ususally wandering on the road , transforming the road to an uphill obstacle course . 
  yep , that 's the one, 
  the most important thing i know is that if someone offers h\u00e1karl to me again , i will politely decline .

  soproni d\u00e9mon is indeed a great beer , but i think currently the best hungarian beer is t\u00e1voli galaxis . 
  i have to agree with him . 
  since living is wales i realised that even simple things like cwtch ca n't be translated to english and grammar is almost as twisted as the hungarian , 
  i had the pleasure to fly from stockholm to budapest with a group of swedish teens , and about 40 minutes into the journey every alcoholic beverage was consumed . 
  i have never seen anything like that , it was spectacular . 
  i will never forget the joy on those faces when they heard booze was free  but they were actually pretty civilised , so they would n't make it to my personal annoying tourist list either .

  my grandparents managed it . 
  you would call them germans , as they were danube swabians , living in hungary . 
  but they always identified themselves as hungarians . 
  they spoke the language , grandpa was in the hungarian army , grandma made very nice embroideries and they were respected members of the local community . 
  and nobody questioned whether or not they were hungarians , ever . 
  i think you 're missing the point . 
  identity is self assigned . 
  if i feel like i 'm hungarian i will identify myself as one . 
  that 's it . 
  yeah , i 'm not a linguist . 
  but funny enough for the brick people use both words where i grew up,

  next to leo szil\u00e1rd there was also [ ede teller ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ede_teller ) working on the manhattan project , who is known mostly as the `` father of the h-bomb '' .

  can confirm , `` v\u00f6r\u00f6s '' is the more emotional version and `` piros '' is more descriptive . 
  how come all romanians i know and strangers on the internet like yourself see the situation of sz\u00e9kelyf\u00f6ld totally reasonable , but still politicians talk nonsense ? 
  there 's a hungarian phrase `` s\u00edrva v\u00edgad a magyar '' which means hungarians cry while having fun . 
  and this is so true .

  i am travelling so can not type much but you are completely wrong about merkel , the numbers did increase significantly after she announced that all syrians are welcome . 
  i saw it in budapest , youtube is also full of migrants shouting `` merkel merkel '' and pictures of her are everywhere in their camps . 
  the rest of your comment is even worse, 
  so that is the `` thank you '' from 2015 's western europe for trying to defend europe from the turks for centuries . 
  i guess then we should have just let them through to rape your grand grand grand mother and then i could call your people `` quasi-turkish '' tribe . 
  you were just lucky to be too far from real danger , the mongols , turks ... the mongols could have easily annex all of europe back in the 13th century , you were just lucky the khan died so they had to move back right after they attacked hungary ... 
  jesus what a poor comment, 
  thank you - i already confessed on reddit several times that i fell in love with croatia instantly back in 2012 \u2665, 
  like an american fellow just noted here , many states would secede from the usa right now if they could get away with it . 
  i know texans openly dislike and go against the federal government . 
  yes merkel does have a huge responsibility in the current crisis . 
  i believe her actions were reckless , emotion based , dangerous and flat out stupid . 
  immigrants in the usa are a totally different story , you can not compare to the current european migrant crisis . 
  the usa would have never let in these migrants ... 
  you can imagine i was relying heavily on the car 's gps so i went through a lot of `` old roads '' as well , but eventually you need to use some highways in croatia . 
  on the plus side the roads themselves are in good condition . 
  in any case i have been spending the summers for the last 4 years in croatia and not planning to give up this habit soon ... 
  they call us continental europe . 
  but if the english do n't consider themselves part of europe why not just call us europe ? 
  mainly because he is drunk all the time, 
  yeah we get that but the amount of money they get from tourism - and you should see those endless lines of cars not moving while the sun is beating down heavily . 
  not cool croatia !, 
  in hungary you can pay with your phone for the toll road and it 's done , no booths stopping you anywhere . 
  or just buy a sticker on a petrol station if it 's easier for you ... 
  calm down , no need for that language . 
  the refugees/migrants move ** away ** themselves from italy and hungary , their goal it to get to germoney . 
  it is their decision , not ours . 
  germany invited them anyway so why do they want to send them back to us now all of a sudden ? 
  mutti is waiting , no ? 
  this german quota system is stupid as we do n't even know how many there are/will come , but regardless it would force some of them back to hungary . 
  that is a nazi move . 
  we hungarians feel it would be against basic human rights to force any refugee to stay in any one place when he wants to go to another . 
  we are happy to even pay for their travel , just get the hell out . 
  we could still veto that ( like texas would say fuck you to obama ) . 
  but we would have common fiscal and foreign policy . 
  we need to strike a balance here, 
  it is beautiful , when i show pics to friends they think i was in hawaii or something . 
  nope , just drove down south a couple hundred kilometers , that 's it . 
  an advice : avoid croatian highways as long as you can ( go through slovenia ) as they have toll roads causing incredibly long traffic jams on their highways . 
  i mean i love croatians but if your main income is from tourism how can you do this to tourists ? 
  the problem is you are nothing on the global market as romania or transylvania . 
  even germany is too small to matter . 
  only together can we attain serious bargaining power on the global market - the total eu gdp is bigger than that of the usa . 
  so while i agree with your point and do not want brussels to dictate how i should live in budapest , a common eu government would be okay by me if we can still decide our small matters locally . 
  exactly . 
  asians feels so alien , europeans do n't . 
  i had this strange revelation this summer in croatia where people from all over the eu go down to to enjoy the great weather and the beautiful beaches . 
  i can only describe briefly the overall experience as this : we are like a huge family , we know and respect each other , have more or less the same values , our conversations are effortless . 
  suddenly a united states of europe did not seem naive or weird at all , on the contrary , it seemed obvious and necessary . 
  `` people going through croatia-slovenia-austria are welcomed with open arms '' http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2015/09/refugees-stuck-croatia-slovenia-border-150921061001663.html, 
  for hungary the standard of living started to rise after the soviets finally left our country in 1989 and we became independent . 
  a lot of investors came , we had jobs and gdp was increasing . 
  the eu membership did not really influence our standard of living much . 
  i am sorry but you are just flat out stupid in that comment : 1 , please note that i did not say we should let anyone die , ** on the contrary , i said we should rescue people who fall into the ocean ** 2 , if we keep bringing them to ashore then ** it is ** a message that you can just get on a shitty boat anytime and the eu will take care of the rest . 
  i believe this is a very irresponsible message indeed and this is the current situation you are just as mawkishly emotional now as merkel . 
  i also have a feeling that this last `` comment '' was what you wanted to tell anyway and you just got tired of me giving you sensible answers so now finally you gave up by just putting words in my mouth i did n't say and then yell `` ok shut the fuck up '' . 
  you , sir , are fucking pathetic . 
  say he comes back and kills your family with a bomb ? 
  would you still be so understanding and held no grudge ? 
  but was he wrongfully detained ? 
  really ? 
  i did not use it before . 
  just read about it yesterday and was in my mind . 
  i like how everyone either does not get my point or replies with something totally irrelevant crap like this, 
  another one that does not understand a simple point ... 
  they need to get the message that getting on shitty boats and then crying for help - the current modus operandi devised by the asshole people smugglers openly taking advantage of the eus morality - no longer works . 
  if they fall into the ocean our coast guard can rescue but then bring them back to where they came from . 
  the key problem is the number of people coming to the eu . 
  of course we should help people who are genuine refugees but then not just the eu and turkey but the whole world !, 
  saud arabia , quatar ... why are they not helping ? 
  they did n't . 
  the coast guards brought them to ashore . 
  dont do that . 
  do it like australia , give fuel to the boat and turn them back, 
  the wall keeps them out or at least reduces the flow down to a managable size . 
  then we check and register and decide what to do . 
  if they are not eligible for asylum they will be forced to leave the country, 
  merkel does not consider the migrants a problem at all . 
  that is the problem her living in a bubble we had a solution , keep them out . 
  the migrants want go to germany anyway so there is no point asking countries like hungary to accept quotas, 
  this problem was caused by merkel that is why germany has the responsibility to solve it . 
  she invited refugees whilst many other eu contries do n't want them . 
  building a wall is party a solution , at least for the short term . 
  hungary is not a first safe country . 
  the migrants arriving to our borders were all in greece days before . 
  i do n't understand why germans keep saying that and blaming us for not registering them . 
  the fate of the politician depends on whether he gets elected or not . 
  it is in his financial interest to be a `` chameleon '' i.e. 
  change his views to the majority opinion to maximize votes . 
  in a democracy those with firm belief would be eliminated soon by natural selection . 
  however , no one lives in a democracy today . 
  hence the sentimental leader , merkel ... 
  why should they still be in hungary when the first safe eu country they reached was greece ? 
  please tell me . 
  according to doublin regulation greece needs to register them , not hungary . 
  yet merkel demanded first that we register them . 
  later she said we can send them all to germoney . 
  why is greece not criticized at all ? 
  why do you all blame hungary ? 
  by the way , how is it fair that a bankrupt country like greece has to handle all the mass immigration flood that merkel caused ?

  yeah we seem to have forgiven franz joseph i , in exchange for the economic boom , but that does n't carry over to his descendants . 
  funny thing is , for the reasons stated above , there was no king from 1920-1946 but hungary was still called kingdom of hungary , just without a king . 
  since we now know this is a ridiculous state of affairs we just went along with the european default of having a president of the republic and a prime minister . 
  average wage is actually higher than the average doctor 's wage if my the hungarian sources are right ( this seems a bit suspicious to me though ) . 
  but anyway , being a doctor in hungary is not that big of a dream as in the us . 
  yes , also in hungary . 
  less than 10000 usd/year * before * taxes . 
  and taxes are a lot higher than in the us . 
  no wonder that most young doctors move to sweden , germany , uk , etc. , often right after graduation . 
  the average age of doctors is getting very high now , an nobody knows who will replace them when the die/retire . 
  but still , the so called `` doctor barons '' ( `` boss '' doctors ) get a livable wage , but they are a minority . 
  you also have to consider that there is a custom that patients give `` gratitude '' money to the doctors ( similar to a tip , almost like a bribe ) . 
  the main ones are : * `` reform\u00e1tus '' ( calvinist ) - approx . 
  12 % of population * `` evang\u00e9likus '' ( lutheran ) - approx . 
  2-3 % of population ( by contrast catholics are about 38 % ) there are also some smaller ones like baptists and unitarians etc. 
  and there are obviously also some more modern micro ( business - ) churches , like the pentecostal `` hit gy\u00fclekezete '' ( faith church ) , who own a major commercial tv station where they have their televangelist show every sunday . 
  * primary/elementary school ( ages ~ 6-14 , 1st through 8th grade ) : approx 8x3x20 = 480 students ( pupils ) * secondary/high school ( ages ~ 14-18 , 9th though 12th grade ) : approx 4x4x35 = 560 students, 
  yes . 
  * cellux - transparent adhesive tape * stift - glue stick * technokol - liquid glue * flex - angle grinder * mirelit - frozen food * dzsip ( jeep ) - jeep-like car * rotring - mechanical pencil * kuka - garbage bin ( origin : `` via czech , from german kuka , short for keller und knappich augsburg , a german firm which was manufacturing and supplying orange refuse collection vehicles . 
  today the company kuka is producing industrial robots and automation technologies . '' ), 
  * hungarocel - polystyrene * matchbox - small toy car * walkman - portable cassette player * hypo ( hip\u00f3 ) - sodium hypochlorite ( bleach ) * polyfoam - thin ( ~ 1cm ) matress-like thing you put under your sleeping bag in a tent, 
  these few decades were indeed a golden age for hungary compared to our other history . 
  basically after 1526 , hungary disintegrated and was taken over by the ottomans and the habsburgs . 
  after the ottomans were kicked out , several revolution attempts against habsburgs have failed . 
  and after austria-hungary we had trianon , wwii , german and soviet occupation ... 
  compared to all that , the compromise of 1867 is seen positively in that it gave back a good chunk of hungarian sovereignty and enabled a lot of development , catching up to the most modern tech inventions ( railways , subway etc. ) . 
  while franz joseph is widely considered a `` bad guy '' in the context of the 1848 revolution , somehow as an old man , after the compromise , his image is quite positive and a symbol of the steady economic progress and peace of those times . 
  we are definitely also taught about the problems of minorities and we learn that some version of a trianon-like treaty was an inevitable thing due to the demographic makeup of the country . 
  rather the main problem is with how unjustly the borders were drawn , leaving many very high majority ( 85-90 % + ) hungarian areas right on the other side . 
  never tried it , never seen it , only read about it online . 
  many people were seen negatively during communism and then positively , like anti-communists or the 1956 revolutionaries . 
  no , because almost everyone knows friends or family who moved to western europe to work and they have a good life . 
  the most common perception is that salaries are very high and life is much better ( which is quite true ) . 
  this whole terrorism and violece idea is very recent here , and the government pushes it quite heavily through the media , but the people 's perception originates from a much longer time and western europe has always been envied here . 
  swiss salaries are much much higher ( even if you compensate for the price differences ) than serbian/hungarian etc. 
  salaries . 
  the [ battle of moh\u00e1cs ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_moh\u00e1cs ) probably . 
  king dead , ottoman occupation for ~ 170 years , depopulation etc. 
  hungary never recovered from that . 
  in hungarian culture the word `` moh\u00e1cs '' is synonymous with catastrophic defeat . 
  also * trianon * wwii * soviets crushing the revolution of 1956 * russia and austria crushing the revolution of 1848 * mongol invasion ( 1241 ) and more, 
  the existence of this whole topic was basically unknown to the general public before about ~ 5 years ago . 
  still today , it just comes up when conservatives talk about how liberalism is destroying the west with gender theory and the bathroom stuff . 
  a real pool only for the rich , but the plastic or inflatable one is quite popular , especially for families with small children . 
  we did n't have such a system , we had to ask . 
  but as classes only lasted 45 minutes ( not sure if it 's the same in the us ) , it did n't happen too often that we could n't wait ( i mean in higher classes , not as very small kids ) . 
  i do n't remember it being such a big issue to create an elaborate system with clipboards . 
  a question back at you : were you allowed to eat during class ( sandwiches etc ) ? 
  we were n't , although there was one teacher in high school who did allow it , but he was a bit of an odd one . 
  about the bathroom thing , do you mean going to the bathroom during class ? 
  obviously students ( before university ) ca n't just walk out whenever they please ( during class ) , they have to ask . 
  but during the breaks , when you 're out in the hallways why would you need permission ? 
  bathrooms are not locked , you 're in the hallway and just enter a bathroom . 
  i do n't understand what scenario we 're talking about here . 
  are the breaks between classes also so closely supervised in the us that they are trapped in the classroom and ca n't even walk in the hallways ? 
  it 's not usual at all . 
  not sure if it 's just a reddit demographic thing , but i get the impressin that `` getting tested '' for stis ( quotes to express that it 's a `` thing '' ) is very usual in the us . 
  like it 's an encouraged habit , like brushing your teeth . 
  it gets thown around a lot . 
  in hungary , it would be weird . 
  we consider it a `` serious '' medical examination , you ca n't just walk in and get tested . 
  a gp needs to refer you in , just like he would to any other special examination , like lung x-rays etc. 
  and only if he suspects that such a check is medically necessary in your case . 
  of course you can go to a private hospital and pay a lot , but that 's quite expensive and only been available recently . 
  also i think , stis are not that widespread in hungary that you 'd really need to be concerned . 
  sounds like shitty , borderline ( or totally ) scammy restaurants . 
  tips are never mandatory . 
  there may be service fees sometimes expressed as a percentage on the menu . 
  those are not negotiable , they are n't actually tips , they are part of the bill . 
  not listing it in english when they otherwise translate things on the menu may be against consumer protection laws though . 
  how does that look in practice ? 
  how do they express that they expect 20 % and not just 10 % ? 
  [ budapest ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_w2qub79htc ), 
  that 's a very popular saying in hungarian too . 
  depends on the country . 
  in hungary it 's 10 % at a restaurant with a waiter . 
  if you give much less or nothing , then it means the service was bad . 
  as for including it in the bill , i find that awkward personally . 
  in some restaurants they explicitly add an extra service fee to the bill . 
  i 'm not sure what is the norm in that case . 
  i usually still give some extra tip , but less than normally . 
  but this is rather rare . 
  generally i find that the us and hungary ( perhaps others too ) are quite different in this regard . 
  just like we do n't donate much ( yeah also because we 're poor ) , as someone asked lately ( about donating to one 's alma mater university later in life ) , we also do n't tip excessively . 
  except when it comes to doctors and nurses . 
  there you must tip ( bribe ) , otherwise they 'll treat you like crap . 
  we call it `` money of gratefulness '' . 
  i never tip at wardrobes . 
  it 's not a long and personal interaction , like a waiter at a restaurant or a hairdresser . 
  if someone tips the employees at a wardrobe , why not tip the cashier who sells the tickets at the theater ? 
  or the cashier at the supermarket ? 
  what language ? 
  it 's mandatory to learn two foreign languages in secondary school . 
  i chose german and since then i got to c2 level . 
  reasons for german : jobs , culture , history . 
  it 's an advantage whether i want to work in germany/austria/switzerland or in hungary ( many german companies in hungary require or prefer those who can speak german ) . 
  and germany is the most important country in terms of economy in this region . 
  also there has been a long history of germans and the german language here ( think danube swabians , austria-hungary ) . 
  but i think english is definitely more important to know . 
  so i 'd definitely recommend english if someone only wants to learn one foreign language .

  prosine\u010dki . 
  he was a great player . 
  you were great in the 90s . 
  look at the map . 
  not just us . 
  there is a whole region of despair around you . 
  wait a minute ... maybe it is because of you . 
  either the romanians are dumb or everyone else on the balkan . 
  hidden and dangerous 2 . 
  thank you czechia . 
  as a hungarian my answer is ** no ** of course . 
  this whole topic proves that it was a brilliant pr decision to name the aircraft ` eurofighter ' . 
  i suggest the following names : eurofighter-15 , eurofighter-16 , eurofighter-18 , my favourite , the retired eurofighter-14 from euronimitz , the eurogrippen and of course the eurogurevich-29 . 
  you can find the contracts on the nfa.hu . 
  but that wo n't tell you anything about the background of the recipients . 
  if you can read that amount of data you wo n't be wiser , because you ca n't decide what was the logic behind the pointing system . 
  here is an [ article ] ( http://vs.hu/kozelet/osszes/szinjatek-az-allami-foldpalyazat-itt-a-bizonyitek-0702 ) about the pointing system and the kishantos lands , but it is `` accusation and speculation '' . 
  all checks and balances are destroyed in hungary after 2010 , the public administration , the police and the prosecutors are govermental tools , those who are not , were fired long time ago . 
  i am afraid you wo n't find the credibility you want . 
  edit : [ejatlas.org ] ( http://ejatlas.org/conflict/land-grabbing-in-kajaszo-hungary ), 
  and what is the problem ? 
  it 's totally true . 
  considering what happened to the baltic states , which became independent also after 1918 finland fought for a reason . 
  it 's better lose 10 % than 100 % . 
  here is an [ example ] ( http://ejatlas.org/conflict/land-grabbing-in-kajaszo-hungary ) for the land tenders which led to such situations . 
  what happened there was not an exception but rather typical . 
  most of the voters who do n't work in the agriculture was not understand or was not interested in these scandals . 
  if someone won 1200 ha land on a tender ( which was the maximum to win and also the typical size for an insider ) that means 60 millions huf ( 200k euros ) pro year for 20 years in agricultural subsidies without doing anything . 
  it 's because they get rid of one of the most entertaining kings . 
  why do n't they shut up ? 
  it 's like a gay guy 's wet dream : 110 000 assholes and a dick in one place . 
  ukrainian red marlboro . 
  stronk people 's choice . 
  iraqi t-72 was not the top of the line , they were ( just like any russian tank outside ussr ) monkey versions . 
  i understand if you hate hungarians or the op , but i am sure that you have never heard the cattle cry . 
  you 're an asshole , my dear sir . 
  this is not the place for this cheap whatever you did . 
  just google foldmutyi or hortob\u00e1gyi foldmutyi . 
  there are plenty of sources just choose one . 
  mutyi means shady business under the table . 
  the goverment gave national lands not for the local farmers but to their own chosen ones . 
  if you consider that 1200 ha of arable land means cca . 
  60 millions huf pro year from the agricultural funds and they got these lands for 20 years , that means these people who barely saw arable land earlier became rather wealthy . 
  even the dep . 
  secretary of agriculture left the goverment because of that as he was unable to stop it . 
  it is very concrete that the tenders were unfair just nothing happens . 
  just some background [ music ] ( https://youtu.be/-zpjquk0cpq ) . 
   where local gorals identified themselves as slovaks . 
  according to what i know about the politics of the era , i am sure that the local gorals was informed in no time that they are poles and they are proud of it . 
  that is the way how `` liberation '' worked those days . 
   insert troops and officially declare oneself as an international peacekeeping force just search yourself some unbiased infos about the present state of the ukrainian armed forces and about how it got to its present state ( which is struggling ) over the past two decades . 
  show me how the citizens of ukraine join the army as volunteers to defend their homeland and show me the refugees in camps in ukraine keen to return to the occupied territories . 
  show me how the resistance movement harassing the russian columns in the crimea . 
  after that i will support the idea of a war against a possibly weak russia , without that it seems to me that you want someone else to fight your war . 
  i am afraid you wo n't show me these things , i think you will just call me pro-russian and downvote this comment . 
  did you heard about the guy who said that `` i will kick in the door and the whole house will collapse '' about russia ? 
  do you know the end of his story ? 
  dude , never told them that the king is naked . 
  it would be real informative to attach production numbers . 
  like how do you compare a leopard , an abrams , a t-90 or a merkava to a leclerc or a challenger or an ariete . 
  many shermans kill tigers . 
  one should think that you have other problems now , then to retake transnistria , which is moldavian by the way . 
  for example not to lose your whole black sea coast in a year . 
  when the one-eyed cowboy walks in the saloon and somebody shoot out his only eye : `` that 's right boys !, 
  always shoot the lamp first ! '', 
   it would be odd to close if that 's a historical custom . 
  you know when our forefathers forced to gather to hear a mass on sundays by stephen i , they decided to do some shopping either . 
  if the ww2 broke out in 1938 , it would be much easier to the western allies to win . 
  they had the resources , they did not have the will to fight . 
  the german army of 1938 was not the same as the 1940 army . 
  there was a reason for the unpopularity of chamberlain and stanley baldwin under the war . 
  they gave up an entente stronghold and let eastern europe slip out of their hand at munich . 
  they lost czechoslovakia , poland , the possibility of a soviet support in the east , they made romania an axis power , made hungary a staunch german ally and above all gave the czech industry to hitler . 
  who makes the distinction ? 
  the elders ? 
  all opinions are equal , but some opinions are more equal than others , right ? 
  and what a pity that he fights the soviets with a 25 years deferment . 
  i really hate to look like someone who speaks against poland , but ...  it 's unfair to only present 1938 events , without telling about 1919-1920 . 
  it is true in the case of germany and hungary either . 
  simply the best solution is not to take an other country 's territory . 
  let there be peace , freedom and cooperation . 
  true , not all germans were nazis , but hitler 's main trick was to win the elections and after that to make the democracy to pig 's breakfast by following the rules of democracy . 
  he got that 40 % . 
   i think that any pro-soviet is an uneducated asshole ... let the pluralism reign . 
  you have your own opinion , others have other opinions . 
  most of the countries in europe was austria or hungary at some point in their history ... the habsburgs will rise again , fully bearded !, 
  first of all , i like poland and i held it 's part in the war in high esteem , but ...  yeah , but we `` only '' took disputed areas ... hungary only took disputed areas either . 
  kingdom of italy and the third reich also . 
  putin also disputed some sovereign territories of ukraine . 
  so many disputed territories and so many countries . 
   we had two options - letting hitler annex zaolzie , which was inhabited mostly by poles , or annex it ourselves ... hitler and horthy had two options - letting their compatriots remain under czechoslovakian opression or `` liberate '' them . 
  in hungary you get 100 % bonus if you work on sunday . 
  that is a special feeling either . 
  we have the same in [ tescos ] ( http://mandiner.hu/attachment/0104/103382_sc.jpg ) , but robots does n't matter when a party wants to prove something . 
  like curva grande and curva parabolica in monza . 
  i met the first , but do n't know the second . 
  epic and true . 
   people really forget that about any nation would have worked with hitler if it benefitted them . 
  the germans voted for hitler because they were badly beaten in versailles , not because of his beautiful brown trousers and fancy mustache . 
  with the noteble exception of japan if a country was an entente or entente ally country in 1918 , then it is a good country with acceptable national goals and proud heritage .

  i really do n't like such photos . 
  this artistic/longing/melancholic / romantic/drab style is just so fake to me . 
  photographers often use the same for poor families and neighborhoods in hungary as well . 
  it really does n't capture the atmosphere `` correctly '' . 
  it seems like a fairy tale version of eastern europe for consumption by rich western europeans who want to feel some naive compassionate feelings . 
  it 's hard to pin down what i mean , but i ca n't stand this style . 
   the bible is notoriously contradictory . 
  most religious texts are . 
  exactly . 
  its most important purpose is that it lets you lull yourself into feeling like you are fulfilling your moral obligations . 
  it relieves you of the anxiety of not knowing whether you 're doing the right thing . 
  just interpret the verses in the right doublethinky way and you can go on doing mostly what you want to do , while still feeling morally in the safe zone . 
  the quality of reddit posts varies greatly and i mean ** greatly ** . 
  there are subs that give top quality information by real experts on things like science , history etc. 
  and then there are things that are upvoted a thousand times but are nonsense . 
  the problem is that you ca n't simply say `` reddit stuff is bullshit '' , because a lot of it is good ( not percent-wise ) . 
  also , just talking to your family and friends is n't representative either . 
  you have to take their opinion with a grain of salt as well . 
  but i think comment sections can at least point out some biases in articles . 
  if i read an article in a physical newspaper , then there 's just me and the author involved . 
  i either believe it or not . 
  but if there 's a comment section , maybe the top voted comment will explain in detail and with references where the author uses misleading arguments . 
  does it mean that the rebuttal is always correct ? 
  but at least i can get a feel for what points can be contested . 
  of course there 's no way around using your own judgement , experience , common sense , education , intelligence etc. 
  and following a few references , when evaluating how plausible the different arguments are . 
  you have to accept that you 're misinformed to some degree . 
  either by your upbringing , biased education , biased news , non-representative circle of friends and colleagues etc. 
  but it 's also true that things are usually not black or white . 
  but this does n't mean all gray is 50 % gray and that the truth is around the middle either . 
  really , no way around using your own judgement and no guarantee that it will work . 
  well , if you 're willing to share a flat , student-style , it 's certainly less than 500 $ . 
  in germany , you can certainly get a place for about 300 if you do n't want to live in your own apartement . 
  by the way , you ca n't really live off the 300-400 $ salaries in budapest either . 
  but uttering the words `` i ca n't live '' does n't help , so people do something . 
  like they do n't move out of their parent 's place until they are like 35 . 
  or team up with random people and share a flat . 
  or do n't rent in the city but farther out and then travel hours each day by train or bus . 
  i mean , whether you `` can live '' is a pretty relative term . 
  i know you ca n't live * well * or even comfortably on 800 $ / month , but that 's also not a big issue because dutch people make many times more than that . 
  that 's how humans work . 
  it 's extremely quick and easy to incorporate `` luxuries '' , like random caf\u00e9 / restaurant visits , wearing branded clothes , going to vacations on the mediterranean , going to ski etc. 
  into your life . 
  if you do these things often enough , you do n't even realize anymore that these are luxuries . 
  it becomes part of the baseline . 
  most people do n't consider themselves rich , unless they live in a huge palace , have their own island and private jet . 
  also it seems like w europeans do n't like to face this reality , like they are actively trying to deny that there is a huge divide in quality of life between western and eastern europe . 
  it 's * always * the `` but the prices '' . 
  as if they were ashamed of living well . 
  german supermarkets are really cheap . 
  some things are more expensive but it 's partly about higher quality products ( for example in bread ) in germany . 
  other stuff costs basically the same . 
  sea related stuff ( fish cans etc. ), 
  is also cheaper in germany . 
   i can get a beer for 21 cents in germany ah , those are n't really good . 
  i do n't like to go lower than `` 5,0 original '' ( ~ 40 cents ) . 
  hungarian low-end acceptable beers begin around 60 cents . 
   i am really humbled how people with an income of 500 $ manage to live there in relative comfort . 
  people do n't go to restaurants/caf \u00e9s / bakeries/clubs/vacations / skiing etc. 
  nearly as much as germans . 
  going to a restaurant is not like `` hey what is a good restaurant that you know in this neighborhood '' , but more something you do for a special birthday or anniversary . 
  also , regular , affordable bars are not as fancy as in germany , where there are waiters and fancy decorations and you can even order food etc. 
  also , people do n't buy as many fancy , branded clothes , they buy cheaper cars ( or none at all ) , lower quality stuff you do n't even think about like shittier furniture , flooring , bathroom appliances , beds/matresses etc. 
  in hungary ikea is considered posh and expensive by many people , while it has exactly the opposite connotations in germany of cheap `` throwaway '' - ish furniture . 
  there are many little things like that . 
  a better metric would be to subtract basic expenses from the average ( or median ) family income to cover utilities/rent/mortgage on a livable-sized similar quality home ( say ~ 70 m ^ 2 ) and basic food ( nothing fancy , just simple non-branded stuff ) and then see how much is left for entertainment/enjoyment / `` luxuries '' . 
  this would still show a big gap between western europe and eastern europe . 
  see , when a w european comes to budapest , for example , they think it 's all so cheap , but many locals ca n't afford to go to the same restaurants and caf\u00e9s that you find cheap . 
  many locals have no savings whatsoever and live from month to month ( meaning that their bank account balance literally goes to zero or negative at the end of the month ) . 
  i hear it so many times from w europeans that the salary difference does n't matter because prices are lower ... really , open an excel spreadsheet and try to budget with 500 euros . 
  look up prices at numbeo.com . 
   you ca n't live on that since things are also much more expensive here . 
  you ca n't live a danish lifestyle , including all the entertainment , going out etc. 
  i 'm not very sure about denmark , but in germany you can definitely * live * on 800 $ / month . 
  sure , you wo n't go to restaurants , you wo n't buy bio/organic food etc. , but you 'll live . 
   the practice kind ( nincs j\u00f3 szavam r\u00e1 , gyarkorlat volt no ) exercise session / tutorial, 
  at least in hungarian , we differentiate between `` lengyel '' ( `` polish '' , referring to nationality/ethnicity ) and `` lengyelorsz\u00e1gi '' ( adjective meaning `` from/in poland '' ) . 
  and while i understand the sentiment , i ca n't support punishing different interpretations of history . 
  it just leads too far . 
  i also do n't support laws that punish denial of the holocaust and the denial of communist crimes ( as we have in hungary ) . 
  there 's no shortcut ; one must eduate and inform people . 
  now , if a goverment does it , then it can be appropriate to take diplomatic steps . 
  but just because a foreign journalist has some anti-polish agenda , i do n't think it 's appropriate to imprison him/her . 
  no , i just said it as a trivia thing . 
  i like geography , maps , flags and such things . 
  the only thing i got to see in my life was serbia and montenegro splitting and then kosovo ( although it 's not fully recognized so it does n't fully count ) . 
  i always cheer for stuff like scottish and catalan independence so we can get new countries on the map . 
  now i say this less than seriously , obviously , but i find these things interesting for some reason . 
  i see further fragmentation possibilities !, 
  bosnia and herzegovina could split , then each could also split based on republika srpska vs federation thing , so we could have 4 countries there !, 
  well the dual citizenship question was 51.6 % yes vs 48.4 % no , so it was barely approved by those who `` got off their butt '' , thanks to the socialist ads and campaign saying that now 23 million romanians will be able to come and they will take our jobs , pensions , healthcare etc. 
   the average person in hungary imagines them to live 50 years in the past and like to point at them , quoting how we should ( have ) really live ( d ) , pining for times past . 
  these are the right-wing average people . 
  the left-wing average people think they are romanians/slovaks who ca n't even speak the language right and they will come and take our jobs . 
  for example when there 's a hungarian contestant from romania in tv shows like x factor , there 's an inevitable online storm of comments like `` what is this romanian doing here , they should go home '' etc. 
  there are people who are totally ignorant of history and will say `` oh , how nice that a romanian learned our language , he still has some accent , but it 's pretty good '' or something . 
   while with the ethnic hungarians all they have to be reminded is that they gave them the citizenship , something that was not on the table by the previous socialist government and boom fidesz fans for life . 
  it * was * on the table and the socialists had the opportunity , but instead they gave them the middle finger in the [ 2004 referendum about dual citizenship ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hungarian_dual_citizenship_referendum,_2004 ) . 
  this was a big blow for the hungarians outside the border , mostly emotionally . 
  this was definitely remembered and talked about for years , also between ordinary people , when someone from hungary visited a hungarian-populated town outside hungary or vice versa .

   autocratic behaviour is not necessarily connected to dictatorship , it merely means behaving like one a key difference imo is that a dictator will not tolerate any dissent and will move to physically remove dissenters . 
  very good point . 
  on one hand i fully agree with you - one should know the local laws and follow them , on another hand i ca n't deny someone a new chance just because he got a conviction at some point in his life . 
  geez dude , chill . 
  in other words , the reason he was convicted in us might be a reason he would n't get convicted in a european country . 
  edit : the only drugs i do are cigarettes and alcohol . 
  sorry to tone you down a bit . 
  in order to secure a work permit , you need a signed contract with a company . 
  very few companies will sign a contract without meeting you first in person . 
  once you have a work permit , after a while ( it 's country dependent ) you can apply for a permanent residence permit . 
  once you have that you can go independent/freelancer - i know some native english speakers who do this in budapest . 
  the good news is the generally speaking , in europe , companies do n't ask for a background check nor for a drug test . 
  i 'm not disagreeing with you but do n't be so harsh without knowing the details . 
  maybe he lives in the wrong state and got caught with few joints in his pocket . 
   see this is more about critizing hungary 's decision to close the border and entirely and put a fence is one thing this is just not true !, 
  borders are open , schengen visa holders can enter , anyone can apply for asylum at any border crossing . 
  we just stopped uncontrolled migration !, 
  shall we tear down the fence and tell all migrants germany 's that way btw ? 
  again , any country can defend their borders by choosing whom to allow in . 
  this is written basically in all international treaties related to the borders of a country !, 
  if i may say , this is even higher than geneva convention because all countries ( except russia ) recognize inviolability of other countries borders !, 
  also , if you check eurostat you 'll see that hungary ( like any other eu countries ) has accepted asylum requests since eurostat exists !, 
  yes , they are much less than for germany ( i agree ) but stating that `` hungary rejects all asylum requests is plain wrong ! '' . 
  we are not the only country in the eu considering that someone coming from a safe country can not get the refugee status . 
  good , bad , this is our law - and sorry , i do n't want germany dictating our laws !, 
   i think most people get at least by now that you have to reduce the flow of refugees somehow welcome to reality . 
  i guess it did n't made it to german news but orban declared in august that `` it 's useless to talk about quotas unless we agree how to stop the inflow '' ( or something like this ) . 
  my advice is to check at the embassies of prague ( you meant czech republic ) / poland . 
  i seriously doubt you can transfer probation to any other country . 
  on another hand they might not care that much about your past . 
  you drunk ? 
   ( typos intensifying )  well that simply wo n't happen . 
  i think germany willa ctively workto reduce the flow but not saying that we ont take in people i thought so . 
  but i call hypocrisy on one hand showing the moral superiority and on another working with the countries and solutions that you criticize ( e.g. 
  fences , turkey & human rights , etc ) . 
   austria also took in massive number of people ( the same number as germany per capita ) do you have the number on how many of the asylum seekers in austria are still there ? 
  because last month hungary still had the highest number of asylum requests/capita in the whole eu !, 
  ( none stayed here ) . 
   you know there was already a prediction for 800k people for germany before there was any statement or willkommenskultur ? 
  germany as a economic superpower is a very strong magnet . 
  willkommenskultur just magnified the attraction ten fold . 
  that 's why i am saying that unless it is publicly denounced and you go full denmark for example , you will still be the migrant magnet of the planet . 
   no but hungary declined any responsibility so if hungary and austria do the same thing but austria agrees with germany on the `` german solution '' austria is cool and hungary sucks ? 
  btw : wan na bet that the 160k distribution will never be implemented ? 
   it does n't work under strain sorry to say , but as long as you do n't publicly denounce repeatedly the #wilcommenkulture there will be a strain on your country . 
  otherwise , as i said in other posts `` you welcom 'em , you keep 'em '' . 
   it 's not like austria had much of a choice and hungary did ? 
   because letting people apply for asylum is their right according to the geneva convention sure thing . 
  but letting people cross 7 borders in order to apply for asylum in germany is not . 
   also as for the solution with turkey at least here on reddit you see a ton against that . 
  i prefer to form my own opinions , reddit is just a source of information . 
   have you seen the outcry over the 3 billion that aresupposed to be paid to turkey ? 
  hungary 's original proposal was actually higher if i remember well . 
  also the outcry was more wrt removing visas for turkey and promises to fast track their membership rather than the 3b which is peanuts . 
   but apparently that was just interpreted as `` send everyone to germany '' . 
  we sent them to the austrian border , btw . 
  is it now our fault that austria let them in ? 
   then what is the solution for those people coming to apply for asylum ? 
  current european solution - involving turkey ( to which no one objected ) seems to me like a step in the right direction . 
  also i do n't understand why germany seems to consider that unless they let everyone in ( and the dog and the kitchen sink ) that 'll be a violation of the geneva convention . 
   then why does hungary not accept any refugees according to the geneva convention . 
  it does . 
  all asylum requests are handled in accordance to geneva convention . 
  now ex-fucking-scuse us if we do n't consider refugees those who refuse to apply for asylum . 
  also my deepest apologies for applying the hungarian law in hungary . 
   also how is funneling refugees from one country to another not pushing the burden on that other country . 
  kindly reminding that merkel asked us to do it to `` avoid a humanitarian catastrophy '' when you had 4000 people marching on highway towards austria . 
   also how is funneling refugees from one country to another not pushing the burden on that other country . 
  see above with the humanitarian thing . 
  also ask the same question to greece , macedonia , serbia , croatia and austria . 
   what i would have liked if hungary worked closely with the rest of europe towards a solution funnily , the current solution is much closer to hungary 's original proposal . 
  also i/hungary do n't consider the initial `` european solution - aka let 's distribute everyone '' a solution at all . 
  can we agree that every country on this planet has the right to decide who crosses their border ? 
  orban repeatedly said that our fence is the second best option . 
  also there is no `` pushing of burden '' unless you count `` put them on train from one border to another '' as a burden . 
  anyway , what would had you liked us to do ? 
  stop them from exiting ? 
  nobody is pushing except maybe for the migrants themselves . 
  hungary cried out loud countless time about common eu border defense . 
  when others were kindof meh we said fuck this , we do it ourselves . 
  at least for now , for us , it seems fences do work . 
  they were ww2 collectors - unearthed some ww2 stuff after searching it with a metal detector . 
  the anti terror police made fools of themselves with this one . 
  the judge declined to arrest them ( case so week ) . 
  ok then , feel free to occupy us two times and integrate both hungary and magyarorszag , 
  i thought porto rico ? 
  reminds me of the joke from communist times that we shall declare war on us then surrender immediately and become the 52 ` nd state . 
   for the month of october 53.5 % percent of asylum applications in germany were from syrian citizens this ignores people who do n't bother to register and also people whom do n't speak arabic but still claim to be syrian . 
  anyway , assuming 53.5 % is right , does it justifies calling them en masse `` syrian refugees '' . 
   almost all went to western europe because kempinski is better than mcdonalds ? 
   anyway , i was not debating who is right or not , just explaining why ee people have this attitude . 
   but how do these people differ from people coming from syria ? 
  demographics and proximity ( if i 'm followed by thugs i 'll enter the closest mcdonalds and not keep running till kempinski ) . 
  also i thought less than half are from syria . 
  in public view they look something like this : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4bba9ronvi also come from a neighboring country . 
  it 's as bad as an idea as increasing taxes - i was joking . 
  i can understand why the average folk feels that way . 
  but it 's a asymmetric thing : contributing citizens feel directly they give something from their pocket ( via taxes ) , receiving citizens get no money in their pockets . 
  as of refugees , the general attitude is that `` you welcomed 'em , you keep 'em '' . 
  otherwise it 'll sound as germany said `` refugees are welcome ... in ee ''  trust me , noone would have a problem of receiving `` real refugees '',

  actually [ most of the eu accepts ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/multiple_citizenship#eu_countries ) dual citizenship , at least in cases of people with foreign descent ( for immigrants not necessarily ) . 
  like , all your neighbors , for starters . 
  i understand it may create loyalty issues , but bureaucratic issues ? 
  bureaucratically it is very easy : just ignore all other citizenships . 
  it 's the language law that makes people sore around here . 
  everything else looks about ok now . 
  the funniest part is that it is not just about minority ( magyar ) language use , but e.g. 
  theoretically a fireman or ambulance would not be allowed to talk to a tourist in trouble in english . 
  at least that was the possible interpretation of the legal text at one point , i know it had many changes and reinterpretations . 
  i actually find serbs culturally closer , because they have good red paprika and use it in sausage etc. 
  so generally their food is really familiar . 
  fish soup etc. 
  also skiing . 
  ca n't think of a single one . 
  i think mostly because we do n't really have that strong city level identities . 
  may be wrong , though . 
  do they serve cold beer ? 
  if yes , the other 50 % is also covered . 
  let 's be realistic , as they are not going to introduce that , it is the lesser evil than doing nothing - i certainly feel my wife and toddler would be safer in a train car like this . 
  but you know what is shit ? 
  if a man with bad intentions still gets access , there are no men around to protect the women . 
  that could make it worse . 
  my preferred solution is simply buying first class . 
  it is really rare that troublemakers would take that . 
  the occasional drunk rich kid but we all know they are not the big problem , but ... 
  in fact , i would really like if normal city transit , subway , tramway would offer a first class car , free from homeless-smell . 
  sometimes i wonder if it would be a good idea if there would be on a normal subway or tramway mostly second class cars , one first , and one standing only third for the poor which would be free and paid for by the first-class . 
  win-win . 
  once i was in tokaj , the wine cellars . 
  it 's 35c summer outside and like 22c nice cool in the celllars . 
  wine , more wine etc. 
  tokaji can be very convincing to order more and more . 
  i stood up , felt fine , a bit floaty but okay , went up/out . 
  as the 35c and the sun hit my head , i got suddenly so drunk i was almost walking all fours . 
  i still do n't understand it . 
  probably it is about the blood circulation . 
  this is why i think those in the uk who hope the brexit could solve this are wrong . 
  in many ways the uk is farther down this path than the continet . 
  on the other hand , `` social media pressure '' ( twitterstorms ) is generally stronger in the us so it kinda balances out . 
  ... and by the evening women end up getting about 20 different kids of cheap shit cologne on them and smelling like a chemical factory . 
  that is why my mother made a rule anyone trying anything but her own - borrowed for the occasion - gets a triple dose back . 
  sometimes i wonder we should the reverse occasion for equality when women chase men with nasty ass old spice , axe and malizia uomo . 
  not my homecity , but i think birmingham does extremely well out of being twinned to frankfurt . 
  during most of the day , the inhabitants are condemned to eat british food , although the wiser ones eat indian . 
  but about a month before xmas the frankfurter markt opens , and compared to british food even the german one is a godsend , because everything is relative , after all . 
  so everybody fills themselves up with bratwurst , k\u00e4sekreiner , roasted ham with horseradish , bohnengoulash , drinks cold beer and j\u00e4ger , and feels fantastic . 
  of course it is also when continental expats gorge themselves fat , too , and feel a bit like back in civilization . 
  then from january again , it is fish and chips with vinegar on it . 
  cold reality knocks the door . 
  but overally this is a very good idea and could be copied elsewhere . 
  and it is not costing taxpayer money , all this is done by entrepreneurs , the city just gives the place . 
  from paul graham 's website , essays . 
  technological trends ( silicon valley ) are far easier to follow , because they actually make sense . 
  thought it must be the jaime lannister guy ... 
  `` persze '' is a shorter form of latin `` per se intelligitur '' i.e. 
  `` self-evident '' , i wonder how it did not get popular in more languages . 
  but then again , we used to publish laws in latin only up to 1836 and most countries not . 
  that 's also an east german thing . 
  it 's an acceptable approach , but only for people who invested time in discovering their own country first . 
  if they go for the holiday abroad all the time and have n't seen e.g. 
  szelidi or tisza lakes i am going to assume they are going for the status symbol effect ... this was pretty common in my school when i was a teenager . 
  i know , and it is not even that i am 38 - i stopped liking the way the trends were going around 2000 and i was 22 . 
  the nineties was so simple . 
  music was techno , and people mostly focused on looking good and kinda rich as well . 
  then guitar music made a comeback with oasis and there were again bands , not djs everywhere , and things became far more complicated , people started to dress scruffy again , stop lifting weights , stop getting a tan , girls cut back on the makeup , boys were looking like elton john and it all was so very ironic . 
  it did n't make sense anymore . 
  the nineties generation just looked like liking the simple things in life : sex , beauty , money , strength , and sometimes getting high . 
  the 2000 's generation is all about trying to look smart and special . 
  the perfect place would be tripadvisor , seriously , it does not even need to be asked , just go for high ratings . 
  how about neither , just one of the many countries that the communists left poorer than they deserve to be . 
  this is szimpla / ruin pub type of thing is exactly where i as a native budapester ( suburbian ) - although i moved abroad - would never go . 
  so i assume it is similar with the natives of other cities as well . 
  the problem is twofold . 
  one is that it is for people who have a lot of friends there and thus have fun with socializing with them . 
  but if you go there alone there is not much you can do . 
  sit , drink , watch other people talk but you can not really butt in the discussions of strangers . 
  you are better off in a music disco where you can dance at least . 
  or if you go with a friend and a coworker and just want to have a chat , there is little advantage in taking the suburbian train to these cool places , you might as well stay in suburbia like in the corners pub out in the 16th district . 
  the second issue is that these `` hipsters '' tend to define `` cool '' very differently than e.g. 
  suburbian or otherwise `` normal '' locals . 
  for me , the idea of `` being cool '' evokes being muscular , putting on hair gel , and wearing an expensive looking diesel t-shirt . 
  i would not do it all the time but this is what the people who are in my vocab `` cool '' try to do at a saturday night . 
  for girls , it 's cosmetic tattoos and sunbeds tans . 
  and the point is , the `` hipsters '' have a entirely different definition of `` cool '' . 
  for example they like to look rebels , while we normal people try the opposite and look `` aristocrats '' . 
  so they like using `` rebellious '' imagery like a lenin grafitti . 
  they do n't like to dance much , do n't know why , maybe less interested in sex , and they just tend to sit and talk all the time . 
  do n't know about what . 
  they are rarely muscular , never seem to have a tan and look like their clothes are from charity shops . 
  really different people . 
  hungarians flock to the croatian beaches for at least 20 years now . 
  cheaper than italy and about as good . 
  there is even a certain stereotype of the hungarian lower-middle class family vacationing on the adria , driving a suzuki ignis , packing canned food and homemade fried chicken because restaurant food is expensive , their only expense being the apartment rent . 
  ( this is actually rare to do it this way but the idea is to ridicule people who want to look like a high status by telling people they vacationed abroad and yet they can not actually really afford it . ), 
  i have n't been to croatia yet because when i saw my friends beach boots ... apparently they sell a kind of boots on the adria beach because it is too stony , not a sand beach . 
  that was a `` no thanks '' kinda feeling for me , that is something i really do not want . 
  however recently i have heard about the stunning national park and the renaissance italian style locations , so i might reconsider . 
  the thing is we now have a 2 year old and thus very , very rarely travel so we must really focus on just the best possible places otherwise it does not worth the trouble . 
  what is the point in living in eu but not western eu ? 
  ( assuming that living in place with a different language and all is always difficult and people usually do it only with a strong reason . ),

  ** i asked if there is any such decision , and i was told that i will be informed . 
  so far , i did not receive any formal notification . 
  i do not have sleepless nights because of that , i am not planning to travel to ukraine in the near future . 
  ** bit strange to say , that you are not planning such trip . 
  where were you last time ? 
  not in ukraine ? 
  ** i was in donetsk , in the donetsk people 's republic . 
  what donetsk exactly is now , it is difficult to determine , i think even ukraine ca n't define his connection with those areas . 
  there was a referendum last year and the inhabitants decided where they want to belong . 
  the donetsk people have decided they do not wish to belong to ukraine , which is attacking them with regular troops . 
  i think that 's understandable . 
  if we respect the democratic values , we can not use double standards . 
  it is strange and perverse , that we respect democracy and the people 's decision and their right to self-determination in some cases , while in other cases we does not . ** ( ... 
  ) ** ** from exactly whom did you receive the invitation to travel to donetsk ? 
  ** the invitation came from russia , moscow . 
  there was obviously a lot of attention for the donetsk and luhansk elections there , a number of organizations and parliamentary parties sent observers . 
  since i could n't travel to donetsk from ukraine , just from russia , we entered donbass from there . 
  i travelled through rostov . 
  ** but from which organisation did you receive the invitation ? 
  ** i can not remember their name , but it is a news agency specialised in the events and news of donbass . 
  novorossia press , if i remember correctly . 
  this organisation sent me the invitation and they organized my travel . 
  ** there were only representatives of pro-russian parties , or the mps of mszp and fidesz also received such invitations ? 
  ** i do n't know you should ask them . 
  i met the representatives of the bulgarian ataka , the belgian vlaams belang and the fp\u00d6 , but there was also the polish mateusz piskorski . 
  i was in donetsk , but there was also a contingent in luhansk . 
  this affair brought us together , the similar view of the ukrainian events and of course the desire to be independent of the one-sided western propaganda and see with our own eyes the situation in the civil war zone . ** ( ... 
  ) ** ** well , let me put that this way : a western-style democracy is not better than what we experience in the east like in turkey or in russia ? 
  ** there are people for whom it is better and there are people for whom it is not . 
  during boris yeltsin 's ten years , the oligarchs and the west almost ruined russia and the russian people suffered terribly . 
  russia experienced one of the most serious crises in its modern history under the ten years of yeltsin . 
  interestingly , in the west , russia received only positive reviews during that period . 
  what we have now it can not be compared to the period marked by boris yeltsin 's name , what the whole west ballyhooed as a transition to democracy . 
  obviously , a weak leader served the western interests much better than putin . 
  and it 's not my job to determine whether putin is a good or bad leader of his people , it is the job of the russian people . 
  let the russians decide if they prefer the system of putin over anything else . 
  as long as 70 to 80 percent support president putin on the elections - we surely could talk about that elections ... it is hard to tell what could be better for the russian people . 
  if they believe that they want to live not in a democratic system , which washington sees ideal , but in a system marked by the name of putin , erdogan or li kuan ju , or in a china , as we know it , they have every right for that . 
  if that system is able to raise living standards , can show economic performance and prosperity , and the people happy with that system , then they will support that system . 
  believe me , the people of singapore is not thinking about the criterias of the american liberal democracy . ** ( ... 
  [ what is this scandal ? 
  ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/30d6nb/hungary_pm_orban_and_the_brokerage_scandal_of_the/ ) ** the man to solve the usd 1 billion financial scandal in hungary ** - [ 444 . hu ] ( http://444.hu/2015/03/31/ennek-az-embernek-kellene-megoldania-a-legnagyobb-magyar-penzugyi-botranyt/ ) tibor ibolya chief prosecutor of budapest district , said such things about the quaestor affair this tuesday night on atv 's straight talk , that viewers could be astonished and scared the same time . 
  the full video can be viewed online ( [ in hungarian ] ( http://www.atv.hu/belfold/20150331-ibolya-tibor-eb ) ) , but it is worth to take the most serious allegations . 
  ibolya opened with the statement , that he do n't think that there was a change in the ownership of quaestor ( but there was , when the core company , the questor financial consulting ltd. on march 16th was acquired by its subsidiary financial hrurira ltd. which issued the fake bonds originally , and with the acquisition they converted the debt to properity with a fake capital increase , which step was quite rearranged the order of compensation ) . 
  according to the chief prosecutor , responsible for the case , when bela orgovan the ex-convict public worker took over the company last week , that does n't matter ( `` it 's like a grocery store changes its ' seller '' ) , moreover it supports the investigation , as it proves that the suspicion is well-founded . 
  orgovan 's career as a executive director was not even happened according to ibolya , since his appointment was invalid because in order to become manager , one should need five years of clear criminal record , which orgovan does n't have . 
  according to ibolya csaba tarsoly has a good defender and he was certainly not advised these steps on the march 16 meeting of quaestor . 
  ibolya also suggested in the interview that the prosecutor 's office did not know of the quaestor 's general meeting of 16 march , so they did not know about the change of the management and the owner . 
  ( although ibolya denied the latter fact in the full length of the interview , inexplicably . ), 
  but it does not matter , because according to the prosecutor it is unthinkable that csaba tarsoly would try to hide evidence , like transfer of documents , because of `` objective reasons '' . 
  that what are these objective reasons , he was not willing to talk about , but dropped a reference about the interception of phone calls . 
  however , he assured that tarsoly was not able to get rid of any evidence with that step , because he could do that before march 11 , before the documents of quaestor was seized by the investigators . 
  why did nothing happen for so long ? 
  because it can `` ruin a criminal investigation '' if the suspect was taken into custody too early . 
  information may be leaked from the investigation before it become proof , said ibolya . 
  `` uncle gyuri magyar '' ( gy\u00f6rgy magyar , the lawyer of the aggrieved investors ) spoke an `` orbital silly talk , '' when urged that csaba tarsoly should be arrested asap said the capital 's chief prosecutor . 
  and by the way , they had to ask account informations from two unnamed large bank , which took a lot of time . 
  the complaint of the hungarian national bank , in which they spoke about a huf 150 billion in notional bonds at quaestor is not enough to raise suspicions , according to the prosecutor general . 
  according to ibolya it is also not interesting , that the policemen worked on the case was replaced in mid-march with an other detective team from a rural area . 
  the point is , that whoever is working on it will do a professionally work and this is what happenned in this case . 
  how many prosecutors are on the case ? 
  must be many as there are several thousand pages of documents and 800 gigabytes of data and the plot is complicated and witnesses are many . 
  well the answer is no , there are 3 , i repeat three prosecutors working on the case . 
  it is not a problem that three prosecutors trying to put together an indictment about a decade of sophisticated financial practices ? 
  according to ibolya , it 's all right , though it was important to note for him that he is very dissatisfied that more than 25 percent of the prosecutors are on permanent leave . 
  did you hear that prosecutor ladies ? 
  stop making too much babies . 
  [ testimony of former director of the hungarian tax authority on the court : senior management covered up a fraud of $ 135 million .

  the head of the tax audit department , ms. marianna davida started a personal privacy lawsuit against the publishers of [ nepszava ] ( http://nepszava.hu ) and [ nepszabadsag ] ( http://nol.hu ) because these two newspapers claimed that she is on the entry ban list of the us goverment . 
  atlatszo.hu was there on the first day of the trial . 
  mr. zsolt hegedus deme , former director of the main cases directorate for a year between 2010 and 2011 was the defendants ' witness and he presented a 90 minutes testimony . 
  ( hungarian video on the link ) he spoke about an audit in his testimony , where after two years of investigations they found an euro 135 millions tax deficiency at an unnamed big company . 
  according to the testimony of mr. hegedus the investigation was in its second year when ms. marianna davida and ms. katalin somos ( another leader of nav ) sent clear signals to him that they are dissatisfied with the findings of the audit . 
  hegedus said that in january 2011 , the deputy of ms. katalin somos , melinda r\u00e1kosa called the involved directors for a meeting to the central office of nav . 
  according to hegedus on that meeting it was made clear that they have to let it go and finish the audit .

odds of orban going to a farm life and leaving politics forever ? 
  2 to the power of 2076775949 to 1 against . 
  sure . 
  and i assume according to them this is the way to win an election and change things . 
  again i assume running parties want to win elections , and they are not doing it for participation seats in the parliament . 
  i doubt they can gather enough support , if any . 
  may i ask what makes you consider them ? 
  i ca n't really take them seriously because of that ` acid spitting weasel ' performance . 
  they try to sound funny i assume , it does n't work for me . 
  it makes me wonder who their target audience could be . 
  the whole incompetence of our opposition makes me sad . 
   employment issues have been the main reason causing the refugees to leave latvia  the main reason for the problem is the refugees ' poor knowledge of latvian , differences in work culture and a desire to maintain the status they had in their country of origin what a surprise , we do n't speak their language and they do n't speak ours ( eastern europe ) . 
   there are also teachers , physicians and very many entrepreneurs among them i 'm sure of it , golgafrinchan ark fleet ship b.

   you know in advance what you are going to pay ( no funky surprises ) i admit , i do n't really use either taxis or uber , but after a quick search , i could find 5-6 taxi companies in budapest , who have price calculator on each of their own websites , so this would n't be the case ( atleast here , in hungary ) . 
   they are generally nicer there must be nice taxis and ugly uber 's too , i have no idea . 
   convenient ( i do n't know if other taxi services are that flexible ) in my experience , taxis bring you door to door . 
  is that what you mean by flexible ? 
   even if uber charged the same price , it would still be a better service .

   he does it for free exactly what a paid soros shill would say !, 
   there was two big parties in hungary after soviet occupation . 
  mszp which was the former communist party , and fidesz ( orb\u00e1n ) the other big . 
  not exactly . 
  during the first elections in 1990 , [ fidesz and mszp both were under 10 % . 
  ] ( https://hu.wikipedia.org/wiki/1990-es_magyarorsz%c3%a1gi_orsz%c3%a1ggy%c5%b1l%c3%a9si_v%c3%a1laszt%c3%a1s#/media/file:1990mandatumaranyok.png ) fidesz only got strong after 1998 . 
   you need economics sure , but we have bigger places for that too . 
  orb\u00e1n simply just flexes his muscle against the weakest target ( as usual ) , portraying himself as a victorious saint who protects the country from outsiders . 
  nothing major will happen , i expect ceu to find a legal loophole by the end of summer , so they can keep operating next year too . 
  when women in islamic countries get together to discuss their worries about islam , but they end up sitting in silence , trying to figure out which one of them is a man in a niqab . 
  that 's not what i wanted to imply . 
  right now in our country we have car factories ( need for mechanical engineers ) , and lack of doctors and nurses , but i do n't think we need gender studies advocates ( or whatever they 'll work after gradating ) . 
  i think fidesz has this in mind , that 's why they wo n't harm `` le stem masterrace '' . 
  fidesz never harms the majority , or a big foe . 
  if you compare the number of students at ceu and ( the possibly ) biggest stem university in hungary , bme , you find that ceu has 1400 students , while bme has 21000 . 
  attacking bme would be a fatal mistake , and orb\u00e1n knows this , so people in stem have nothing to fear . 
  funding is a different issue , than the fear of closure because of political reasons . 
  scientists in stem have nothing to fear , because they 're not after them . 
   have you actually interacted with anyone involved in any type of academia ? 
  interacted ? 
  yes , i have . 
  i can only imagine how the mechanical engineer and medical scientists are trembling in fear ... 
  without any real opposition , yes , orb\u00e1n and his friends will stay . 
   a lot of their supporters are anti-semitic i do n't think so , that sounds more like jobbik . 
  as far as i know fidesz has at least a couple of jewish representatives . 
   ceu has been seen by the nutcases as being riddled with jews there are n't that many nutcases , to make it worth in my opinion . 
  fidesz managed ( yet again ) to create a topic out of thin air . 
  i think i 've read in an interview that some of them studied there . 
   completely undemocratic process while i agree it 's not necessarily right to go against a university like this , the parliament voting on laws is as democratic as it can get . 
   quashing opposing ideologies was it common knowledge then ? 
  ceu = the opposing ideology of fidesz ? 
  to be honest , i did n't even know what sort of courses they had in ceu before this drama . 
  his voterbase is pretty much secured already . 
  i do n't think he needs this to convince anyone in hungary . 
   yeah , `` not sure '' ... it simply shows how much of a bigot you are . 
  they are targeted , because of their actions ... 
  they are targeted because illegally entering through the green border . 
  if thinking breaking the law makes me a bigot , sign me up . 
   ignoring the facts of the real world , wo n't make your point any more convincing . 
  you misunderstand . 
  i 'm not trying to convince you , i just want to make sure you understand my point , and exactly my point , not something else because of your assumptions about me . 
   so you are not sure how having a political agenda can be a problem though , but lecturers at a university should n't have one . 
  i 've never said lecturers should not have a political agenda . 
  i 've said they should not push it or discuss it during lectures . 
    i do n't say individuals or groups or institutions should not form their political opinion . 
    all i 'm saying is , lectures themselves should be free of the personal political opinion  yeah yeah ... moving goal posts again . 
  lectures . 
  not lecturers . 
   circlejerk you , a fan of definitions should know , a circlejerk requires multiple people in agreement .

  think he was using formal . 
  if there was an i at the and then it would be pronounced like that as well in english . 
  also i speak italian , do n't need to explain this to me, 
  `` never miss a good opportunity to swear . '', 
  summarizes it well, 
  jesus christ man , chill, 
  t\u00f6k also means testicles . 
  also many types of vegetable are called t\u00f6k anyway , [ here 's a wiki link ] ( https://hu.wikipedia.org/wiki/t%c3%b6k_ ( n % c3 % b6v % c3 % a9nynemzets % c3 % a9g \\ ) ), 
  trump is basically a putin, 
  there 's no way there 's gon na be 50 % . 
  barely more managed to show up for the elections , and here there 's a whole big ass movement campaigning for people to not vote or vote invalid . 
  unless fidesz bribes the entire countryside , there is simply not gon na be enough people interested, 
  that is real hungarian , it 's also fucking hilarious . 
  `` bazmeg ez s\u00f3s '' ( fuck , this is salty ),

  just to use an example i witnessed personally - hungarians in slovakia barely ever interact with the slovaks and vice versa , that does n't mean hungarians are n't integrated , it 's just that they form another community . 
  you ca n't force people to talk with people they do n't want to talk with . 
  but the `` expatcrowd '' limbo is integrated, 
   if you speak the language is n't speaking english good enough in the netherlands tho ? 
  because it 's better to be protected by a competent army than by a useless army . 
  * odabasz/bebasz/odak \u00far / bek\u00far * - literally `` to fuck something somewhere '' , which basically just means to put something somewhere violently . 
  obviously this is a great opportunity to use swearwords for no reason , which is something you ca n't really do in other languages sadly . 
  * r\u00e1ngat * and * cib\u00e1l * - to try to make part of something move using quick ( sometimes violent ) bursts of movement . 
  this is just too useful . 
  and also a great euphemism for masturbation ( faszcib\u00e1l\u00e1s - * cib\u00e1l * ing the dick ) i could probably find way more but i 'm too lazy, 
  * t\u00f6kfej * , literally `` testicle-head '', 
  gendered pronouns make exactly zero sense . 
  hungarian has only one pronoun as well : * \u0151 *, 
  day before yesterday : tegnapel\u0151tt day after tomorrow : holnaput\u00e1n, 
  it should n't count if it has more than one root word . 
  yeah , but for example m , n , u , r , h , k , g , e , i are rarely ever like in print , and even the s you mention is often cursive , such as in sz i usually write it like that . 
   so most people drift to something closer to print letters eh , i would n't say most people . 
  usually capital letters are drifting towards the print ones , but the small ones do n't . 
  bit like hungarian ty but less affricated, 
  i 'm 90 % sure that it 's just a direct translation of his irl name ( ` black ' is a pretty common name in hungary ), 
   a p\u00e1rizsi mer\u00e9nyletet bev\u00e1ndorl\u00f3k k\u00f6vett\u00e9k el  ( the attack in paris was committed by immigrants ) that 's just a straight up lie . 
  i 'm not eligible to vote but i 'd vote invalid, 
  orb\u00e1n is also a trump supporter , corrupt as fuck , he also controls almost all the media ( except rtl ), 
  this is annoying as hell , coming from a learner of italian . 
  in hungarian you would * definitely * use the conditional and not the subjunctive in that case . 
  it 's actually not as bad as one would expect . 
  * ami k\u00e9t h\u00e9tig n\u00e1lad van az a ti\u00e9d * ( if you have something for two weeks , then it 's yours - the eternal rule of borrowing things ) * csak az a csaj foglalt amin fekszenek * ( a girl is only taken if someone 's lying on her - basically , unless the bf is present you can flirt ), 
  there 's also cookie - kuki ( childish term for dick ), 
  \\  not keeping a room reserved at home for the emergency alcohol supply, 
  pfft , so you do n't get hammered in the morning already ? 
  how do you even survive the workday ? 
   their flag is a big plus hah , and they say they 're neutral . 
  since theres still no motorway here ( fucking centralist bullshit ) , i do n't really see foreign trucks at all, 
  there 's such a thing as diacritics . 
  if there ai n't enough letters you can always make more - \u00eb or \u00f6 would do the job for \u042a, 
  yeah i knew that , i think most people know it too, 
  what i was saying that his name too , is a region in hungary so his name is confusing as well, 
  [ chokito - nem dugn\u00e1m de megenn\u00e9m ( 1:02 ) ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qyvylgx9ly&amp;ab_channel=g%c3%a1borgyebn%c3%a1r ), 
  fortunately that was n't as prominent in hungary because the successor of the communist party was in parliament too , and from 1994 it was also in power, 
  yeah , we are usually not that crazy on the whole `` omg muh country so gud !!! '', 
  circlejerk, 
  i really do n't understand why the scandinavians feel so good about themselves with this . 
  this was the case since ever in all of the eastern block . 
  hungary had it since 1938 for cryin out loud, 
  hopefully montenegro and albania would be the next group of countries , followed by serbia , bosnia and kosovo . 
  if there 's trouble in the uk then we might see applicants from that general direction too, 
  i would say most transdanubian major cities would qualify , gy\u0151r , p\u00e9cs , kaposv\u00e1r , sopron , veszpr\u00e9m these are amazing cities , contrasted with the post-soviet industrial places , like miskolc , \u00d3zd , duna\u00fajv\u00e1ros or tatab\u00e1nya, 
  we have that word in hungarian too , ` cs\u00e1v\u00f3 ' is just a synonym for boy though, 
  yeah i know , ally france . 
   obviously you can develop your provinces if you want , but you do n't have infinite mana , better to start out in the lowlands or northern italy that already have high dev if you 're doing that . 
  no because you wo n't even be able to take a single province before being coalitioned back to the stone age . 
  not to mention nicolas [ s\u00e1rk\u00f6zi ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/ca/hu_microregion_1.1.24._tolnai-s%c3%a1rk%c3%b6z.png/1280px-hu_microregion_1.1.24._tolnai-s%c3%a1rk%c3%b6z.png ), 
  this is actually hilarious . 
  do they do it on like fidesz-y facebook pages or what ? 
  i genuinely never saw it, 
   lmpvs / l\u00e1mpavas = `` lamp pole '' usually for political news implying to hang them from the lamp poles do they actually use this ?

  your link is misspelt . 
  it should be [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/and_quiet_flows_the_don ), 
  the poem * nem tudhatom * ( i ca n't know ) by mikl\u00f3s radn\u00f3ti . 
  it was written during ww2 and it basically talks about how the outside powers who will eventually occupy hungary know literally nothing about it and how all of his reality and everyday life is just a map for all those people, 
  ` thou ' is actually not formal . 
  of ` thou ' and ` you ' , ` you ' was the formal one . 
  and the proper form you 're looking for there would be * thy * anyway, 
  actually many people just say `` eks !, 
  '' , because eg\u00e9szs\u00e9gedre is a long word :p, 
  that is very common tho, 
   minimum age is 18 what the hell are you talking about ? 
  there is n't a minimum age . 
   if you are underage you probably wo n't be offered a drink in public . 
  just bring someone over 18 if you go to a bar with a dickhead of a bartender  also in rural areas it is quite common to start the day with a shot of p\u00e1linka . 
  older folks do it in cities too, 
  southwest definitely has it too, 
   the point is usually just to show their respect by trying this is so true . 
   if they are just making no sense \\  implying you ca n't just use your hands to make it understandable ... :p, 
  hungary was a republic in 1848-49 tho ( ok maybe constitutional monarchy , idk actually ), 
  lol he got btfo 'd, 
  there arent that many right wingers here . 
  nono i mean the people who are seriously fanboys of this stuff . 
  did n't say those did n't exist . 
   or this stuff , which is often used as cover pictures for books about hungary . 
  it 's a fake tradition , these clothes were never widespread , and more importantly there are n't any people who live like this today . 
  idk if this is just me but that always makes me think `` these are almost certainly jobbik supporters ''  or they might believe we 're slavic .

  hungarians intermixed a lot with pretty much everyone , yeah . 
  as i already mentioned . 
  hungarians basically pillaged all of europe in the 10th century , which naturally meant lots of rape as well , aka , genetic mixing, 
  \\  hungarian conquerors ravaged europe right up to andalusia \\  most of europe has some hungarian blood \\  europe shits its collective pants \\  ` de sagittis hungarorum libera nos domine ' \\  pope-man is literally begging hungarians to stop \\  `` puny horse lords '' k, 
  inb4 erdogan is overthrown when tunisia is on geography now, 
  it 's secular the way north korea is democratic, 
   lowercase roman numerals ew, 
   eastern europe is slavic fite me irl m8, 
  1956 was about reforms to communism and getting out of the russian sphere , not ditching communism altogether . 
  the guy who was the leader of it was a member of parliament , and of the communist party . 
   how 's venezuela doing ? 
  how do you enjoy having a minimum wage in your country ? 
  you realize that 's breaking the free market by the government , right ? 
  enjoy having workers rights ? 
  that 's right , that is also against the principles of the free market  negative income tax now you 're just insane . 
  literally . 
  that means you give more tax money to the rich than to the poor . 
  literally an inverse robin hood at that point, 
  close enough, 
   all across the internet leftists take a shit on anyone who disagrees with them ever been to / pol / ? 
   how the free market is bad it is bad though for pretty much everyone , except - you guessed it - the bourgeoisie who get to exploit to the workers as much as they want, 
  got lots of places we can export to , the uk is n't exactly special there . 
  pretty sure we do n't export much to the uk anyway, 
  because as i just said , the uk is the country that just betrayed an international system of cooperation , left it without contributing to it . 
  why would anyone sane want to start a new international cooperation with it without something to gain ? 
  fucking cancerous uk companies can go there and profit from it . 
  tesco , ever heard of them ? 
  sure , if you feel like bribing officials . . 
  but then you 'd have to bribe every election cycle for every country , does n't look like a good investment to me, 
  could say the same the other way : sure there were some disloyal slovaks , but most of them really just wanted to live their without disturbance, 
   the left has been a bunch of self righteous bourgeoisie  the left  bourgeoisie now i 've heard fucking everyone , jesus christ you realize that it was farage who was an extremely rich cunt , right ? 
  did n't the judges say he was n't a war criminal tho ? 
   completely the opposite `` after betraying an entire continent worth of countries , i 'm sure other countries will be keen to align themselves with us '', 
  `` we really hate the left but do n't really know why '', 
  some war criminal , who cares, 
   voting some way because ooohh someone hurt my feelings topkek, 
  referendums are dumb about any subject . 
  if you 're gon na ask stuff from the people , then why tf do you have the representative parliament ? 
  and why are you paying them money, 
   makaveli well , that 's almost macchiavelli, 
   we shared everything as good brothers do between themselves . 
  reminds me of the old joke where the teacher asks a kid to list the `` friendly countries '' ... 
  so he quickly says poland , czechoslovakia , east germany , romania and bulgaria ... 
  teacher says `` good good , but you left out the most important one : the soviet union '' ... `` but the soviet union is n't friendly , it 's a brotherly country '' ... `` why 'd you say that ? '' ... 
  `` because one * chooses * their friendships '', 
  slovak nationalism was actually the weakest in the ah empire i think . 
  cf slovaks literally participated in atrocities against slovak nationalists, 
   it 's all plains not really . 
  i 've been to the plains like once or twice in my life, 
  we also have it that way ... also you have to leace them on in the city when the weather conditions require it, 
  you guys do n't have that in romania ? 
  you only have rights because the state protects and enforces it . 
  if they are not willing to enforce it , then it 's called tyranny, 
  still better than romania tho, 
   afro-semitic afro-asiatic *  semitic is a branch of that family , which includes maltese , also arabic and hebrew and aramaic and lots of ancient languages, 
  i suggest siberia, 
  this is an extremely common scenario . 
  the answer is : no one will give a shit about what people want , much like it 's been the case since the dawn of time . 
  not really , they just started selling the eastern quality to the west now, 
  relevant username, 
  because country = / = government, 
  seeing as phoenician is n't an indo-european language , that 's not exactly relevant . 
  also , just fyi , there are exactly three original writing systems in the world : cuneiform , ancient egyptian and old chinese . 
  everything else is derived from one of those . 
  phoenician from egyptian for example, 
   has to be a tipping point eventually . 
  problem is , when they do reach a tipping point then what ? 
  it feels like its gon na get really violent, 
  it 's pretty safe to assume that romania will join as soon as it can afford , as it would help its economy . . sweden on the other hand is just being a uk, 
  you mean 1956 ? 
  also just south from here , the whole balkan thing . . 
  which is pretty much irresolvable , though the same is true with the hungarian situation . 
  also catalonia , basque country issues , south tyrol and so on . 
   because you guys dont have a shared identity . 
  do n't have any less than with some of my compatriots from some godforsaken shithole hundreds of kilometers from here . 
  also , why would i care if my place is being treated like shit from budapest or from brussels ? 
  there is no difference . 
   the artificial borders of europe have to a pretty big degree succeeded in this , no they havent lol . 
  so why would it matter in the end , if they can be overruled by a country worth of people or a continent worth of people ? 
  same thing, 
   some of us are really billionaires those motherfuckers, 
  according to my parents they usually just put 3-4 gypsy families to live in the palaces . 
  that said though hungary was pretty much the best of the communist countries, 
   then claims that you are equal with everyone well , i mean , you * were * equal with everyone, 
  we 're all just temporarily embarrassed billionaires , right guys ? 
  totes, 
  a protest is very much not a riot, 
  you 're the real mvp, 
  presentation in elementary school ? 
  i looked at the first part mainly . . that said though it still seems like there 's a correlation, 
  many of these are the autonomous national republics ' capitals , it seems, 
  no they do n't, 
  no , the state does n't get to give conditions . 
  there 's the problem . 
  the host country 's duty is to protect all its citizens , no matter their nationality . 
  belonging to a different nation = / = being hostile to said country, 
  yeah they were right wing , classical liberalism is right wing today . 
   how could the other delegitimize that standpoint if the data proves otherwise ? 
  there 's this thing called lying , politicians do it all the time . 
  nowadays they call it `` alternative facts ''  liberal nationalism by itself is something new on the table .

  hey , hungary has it all forgiven  just do n't invade again, 
   i dont like how people use english/german words instead of slovak ones , it denies our culture that 's not true , it simply shapes your culture . 
  people here too are upset that hungarians use german/english loanwords , but if you really think about it , this is our culture really , what loanwords we use . 
  hungarian has loanwords from iranian , turkic , slavic , romance , german , greek , gypsy etc. 
  if you go through all the words , you can see the outline of our culture , our history , and i think this makes loanwords a beautiful ( that and the fact that literally 70 % + of the hungarian language is loanwords )  slovakians use 1000years and more when they talk about oppression problem is , that is simply not true . 
  magyarization started with the start of the 19th century , and in the end it was probably greatest mistake in the whole hungarian history . 
  before that , it 's safe to assume that slovaks were considered equal to hungarians , or simply a subgroup of hungarians . 
  i 'm fairly sure neither hungarians nor slovaks learn about this in school , but slovaks fought with the hungarians in [ 1703-11 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/r%c3%a1k%c3%b3czi%27s_war_of_independence#mercenaries_and_minorities_in_the_kuruc_army ) and probably many more times before . 
   slovakia is viewed sometimes as `` felv\u00e9dek '' like it should belong to hungary . 
  * felvid\u00e9k  among reasonable people ( the non-jobbik ones ) it at most applies to the southern strip of slovakia . 
  the reason it 's viewed like that it would be better if it was in hungary is exactly the language laws  lets eat some er\u0151s pista sometime  definitely :d, 
  seriously . 
  stop with your bullshit language laws . 
  stop with the hypocrisy of `` omaigahd hungary forced us to learn hungarian '' when you 're pulling the exact same shit , but in the 21st century instead of the 19th . 
  the us english pronunciation sound is n't even the same as the ipa transcription next to it, 
  you get that the correct pronunciation is always what native speakers use , right ? 
  so for american english it would be the one they use, 
  seriously , do you think the students care when they are getting ready to their final exams in 12th grade ? 
  or you know , any classes where you have to do anything other than show up to pass ? 
  no we dont . 
  source : am a student right now, 
  got you again , romania  :d, 
  he did n't when i commented . .

  what country are you from ? 
  flair up , 
  yeah , i guess you 're right . 
  no , i mean , lets say an islamist from france starts a company , gets rich , then starts funding mosques from his money . 
  what are you gon na do then ? 
  the process will be completely legal, 
  well , id love to see them learn hungarian even more . 
  i wonder what their reaction would be to the fact that the language has absolutely no gender distinction . 
  problem is , they might start something in the eu and then fund from the inside, 
  well , depends . 
  the word can apply either to all slovenes or to only prekmurje slovenes . 
  most people today would definitely use `` szlov\u00e9n '', 
  `` t\u00f3t '' is [ distantly related ] ( http://www.szokincshalo.hu/szotar/?qbetu=&amp;qsearch=t%c3%b3t&amp;qdetail=11488 ) to `` teuton '' , like the germanic monastic order , and `` vend '' is [ apparently ] ( http://www.szokincshalo.hu/szotar/?qbetu=&amp;qsearch=vend&amp;qdetail=12047 ) from the name of venice ( veneti ) ? 
  i ca n't even, 
  both are but this makes it sooo easy to differentiate , today it 's szlov\u00e1k ( ok ) , szlov\u00e9n ( ek ), 
   forever is a long time . 
  it 's also probably the same amount of time it will take for the victim to be through their actions emotionally, 
  / u/hungarynothungry, 
  `` slovak '' in hungarian : ** t\u00f3t ** `` slovene '' in hungarian : ** vend ** ez, 
  i live closer to slovenia but i know more about slovakia . 
  obvious reason is history class , but it 's also because of the amount of hungarians living there , and the fact that i 've actually been there . 
  in that case , sentence them to social work or military service ? 
  if neither , what do you think would be an appropriate punishment for this crime ? 
  montenegro, 
  there are eastern europeans here too, 
  the teacher should get suspended/fired but at least get a criminal record , and the rapists should get to prison forever in a room of 2x2m and no windows, 
   a picture of prime minister recep tayyip erdogan , altered to look like adolf hilter  hilter the author apparently ca n't into spellcheck, 
  ooh , so that 's what the name `` kalmar union '' comes from, 
  wow , this is some romania-hungary level of football hoolinganism, 
  the real question is , did \u00dajpest win ? 
  yup , it comes from byzantine greek '' \u03b5\u1f30\u03c2 \u03c4\u1f74\u03bd \u03a0\u03cc\u03bb\u03b9\u03bd '' ( eis t\u1e15n p\u00f3lin ), 
  okay , it just left me with ambiguity with ` x ' , because i 've also seen \u03c7 -  x transliteration recently . 
  the hunger for power is strong, 
  flair up , 
  shockingly , italians love pasta a lot . . 
  thanks  i wrote `` kh '' instead of `` h '' to emphasize that it 's not quite the same sound as english `` h '' , and the same sound in for example russian is also transliterated as `` kh '' . 
  i did not imply a `` k '' sound being there , atleast i didnt mean to, 
   joke, 
  looks like something i 'd build in minecraft , but with amazing shaders, 
  would n't the letter ksi be transliterated as `` ks '' ? 
  because the x in transliteration would be the letter khi , like in oxi back when there were those campaigns for nai vs oxi , no ? 
  that 's our motto, 
  why , what do you guys learn in school ? 
  hungary has a rusyn school too , in koml\u00f3ska, 
  many times . 
  they still did n't realize that hungary did n't close off everything coming from serbia, 
  i 'd emigrate if that happened here . . gg everyone who 's responsible, 
  sorry i didnt spot the `` continued below '' on the article, 
  germans are the second biggest minority here already . 
  many towns have german street signs and you 'd most likely be able to do administration in german . 
  you would be considered a `` sv\u00e1b '' ( swabian ) though quick edit : sv\u00e1b is not at all derogatory btw , just the general term to germans living in hungary, 
  how dare you make fun of that sexy [ bety\u00e1r ] ( http://huns2huns.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/sobri_j%c3%b3ska.jpg ) [ bajusz ] ( http://huns2huns.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/leadpic1_3496.jpg ),

  europe is writing its history right now , lets hope we dont fuck it up . 
  anyway it 's nice to see this happening, 
  this reminded me of the hungarian film `` a tan\u00fa '' ( the witness ) , where the communist politician would constantly say `` a nemzetk\u00f6zi helyzet egyre fokoz\u00f3dik '' ( the international situation is increasing constantly ) . . 
  you realize the most well-known events of the balkan wars was the massacre of muslims , right ? 
  who is decebalus ? 
  so basically what they are in ck2, 
  citizenship is not in any way even related to nationality . 
  seriously , is there a country to which `` moscow 's confrontational policy '' is n't a threat to ? 
  ninja edit : besides russia, 
  the gypsy is praying next to the road . 
  suddenly a car shows up and the \u00c1vh guys ( secret police ) get out . 
  they say `` what are you doing here ? 
  why are n't you working instead ? '', 
  `` i am praying for comrade r\u00e1kosi , i swear '' `` yeah , i 'm sure you used to pray for sz\u00e1lasi ( basically hitler ) too ! '',

  moral bankruptcy , sounds like . 
  the motivations are absolutely worse with humans . 
  animals do it out of nature , for the most part , and even the ones that savor kills do n't come close to the kind of darkness a regular human mind can conjure up . 
  well you can annex without a core , it just wo n't be very fun for anyone . 
  not that i believe this is justification for treating humans poorly , but animals are far more innocent than any human could ever be . 
  some countries do n't want immigrants . 
  if the eu begins to dictate these kind of things , those countries will stop supporting the eu project . 
  also ironic that germany is the one edging on dictating immigration quotas when they 're one of our wealthiest fucking nations and still ca n't work past their war guilt and have a real military to help protect europe with . 
  i 'd take germany and more seriously if they did n't just rent out the job of protecting europe to the us . 
  socialism works just fine . 
  some nations just are n't very good at it or have some developing left to go before they can attempt it realistically . 
  well , capitalism is exploitation at its core . 
  i do n't say that as a commie , it 's simply the truth . 
  i 'm finishing my education here , and potentially building some good base of wealth so i can move back to hungary and get into some position where i can do good . 
  i 've considered politics for a while now , the urge is getting stronger with time . 
  good preference for when we bomb each other to shit yes ? 
  the issue is that if everyone ran to the greener grass , the good countries would immediately become shit and the countries on the downturn would collapse completely . 
  if you want to look out for you that 's totally your decision , but i 've lived many places and i 've come to realize that money and luxury only matter as much as the television tells you . 
  i 'm actually considering moving back to my native hungary and leaving a lot of potential money behind here in the us . 
  it 's just not worth it for me , i need to be with my people and help them deal with our problems . 
  if we ca n't do that , we do n't deserve the sovereignty our ancestors fought for . 
  to be fair , paris is a bad example of france and turkey is a bad example of abroad . 
  jesus christ man , working minimum wage at my retail job here in california i only need to work eleven and a half hours to make that much money . 
  how hard is it to immigrate to a western european country ? 
  i 'm hungarian and i 've done that , but that 's because my mother was german and i had citizenship . 
  either way , with that suicidal attitude i 'm sure you 'd fit in somewhere in the west !, 
  i kid of course . 
  well , about the suicidal bit . 
  if the rapist has good taste he 'll see the habanero bottle and try to rape some wings at buffalo wild wings instead . 
  wait , we do n't have that in europe , do we ? 
  because they stand in complete contrast to everything me and my people have ever believed in . 
  also , most stated goals of anarchy always lead to a utopia-like state of things , which simply would not work . 
  someone always takes power , there is no way to abolish the state or any social structures like it without something coming up in its place . 
  it 's nothing personal , but i hate anarchy , and i often find myself hating anarchists the moment the start talking about anarchy . 
  i just oppose the very core of their beliefs . 
  he does that indeed . 
  the major issue with him is that he 's corrupt , but that 's not so out of the ordinary in my part of the world . 
  does it matter ? 
  it 's not our problem . 
  i feel like we 're kind of lucky though . 
  even though our leader is a dick , at least he 's right about some things . 
  i hate anarchists even more now . 
  i say this every time someone throws the hungarian refugee situation after our failed uprising in my face . 
  they undermine their own democracy . 
  democracy is not the magic answer , if the polish people want to trade freedoms for securities , that is their choice . 
  not all cultures desire the same things . 
  there 's a very large line between warmongering and making it illegal for your citizens to fight in foreign wars . 
  it 's hard to get into special forces , that was my initial point . 
  it 's a bit tyrannical to arrest a man for joining a recognized military force to fight unrecognized terrorists . 
  if you disagree with that then you 're part of the problem . 
  you having a weak stomach for war should n't bar other from fighting for what they believe in . 
  you 've completely missed the point and forced a completely different point into your response . 
  kind of cheesy tbh, 
   it 's not like you can hate them for doing it , but why not try to join the intelligence services ? 
  or the special units of the military ? 
  there 's far more people who want to fight for a good cause than there are people eligible for intelligence and special forces . 
  also , few european countries are active in the middle east . 
  i 'd love to roam the deserts of syria with a band of hussars and find some extremists to fight , but the hungarian government is n't exactly funding that kind of field trip right now . 
  but war is bad , m ` kay ? 
  unless nato says otherwise , of course . 
  this complete aversion to war in all forms from european leadership is just trying to put a lid on the problem instead of trying to solve it . 
  the legitimacy of the catholic church as an inheritor of rome is up for question though , due to its split with the ere over the iconoclasm . 
  the orthodox church is technically more `` roman '' in the cultural sense , and i say that as a catholic . 
  which parts of europe though ? 
  britain and france are n't europe , they 're just parts . 
   the best we ever got was idiotic populism many times we said too many would come , and that they would n't integrate . 
  lucky for us it 'll be germany paying the biggest price , no matter how much merkel wants to force her fuck up on the rest of us . 
  finno-ugric people just seem to get each other the best . 
  the czech and slavs can come too . 
  i agree completely . 
  we owe nothing to them . 
  we did n't destabilized the region repeatedly , and we 're not the ones with the most resources to do it either . 
   bad weather , rough seas and regular drownings have failed to deter people from making the potentially fatal journey . 
  obviously , they come from a culture where the police and soldiers are much harsher . 
  same issue we had in iraq and afghanistan , our troops treated them like toddlers compared to how saddam and taliban troops treated the locals , and not only did they not respect us for it , they took advantage of it . 
  hungary here . 
  need more slavic votes , pls join, 
   unless there genuinely is some sort of code of conduct i 've not heard about !, 
  it 's called sharia law my friend, 
  it was all bullshit . 
  the western members of the eu do n't care about the eastern members , and our solidarity in protecting the peace and well being of europe crumbled the moment it came time to make good on our words . 
  i was fiercely pro-eu before the ukraine war and this whole immigration crisis , but i 've been disappointed too many times . 
  i wo n't vote against the eu or anything like that , but i do n't think we can ever be one nation of people with a common belief . 
  too much disparity in wealth , values , and fears . 
  soooooo i take it that circumventing the eu and getting a pipeline through turkey probably is n't going to ever happen for sure now , huh ? 
  [ * rubs hands together * ] ( http://thewealthwatchman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/paris-5.jpg ), 
  you 're very right , our current government is quite corrupt , unfortunately . 
  on a related note , abolishing the monarchy seems fairly pointless to me . 
  we 've traded people that did n't need to lie and steal to gain their wealth and power for people who do need to lie and want to steal everything that is n't bolted down because they 're only elected for so long . 
  i honestly do n't think eastern europe was ready for western political systems , we still respect strength too much and will overlook bad things if we think a leader is strong . 
  ie putin . 
  i hate the man but even i have trouble not feeling respect for someone that will go so far to get something done , even if it 's immoral . 
  then again , putin just does n't hide things as much as other world leaders . 
  i try not to think about these things too much : /, 
  * a chorus of bicycle bells builds up in the distance *, 
   well , sorry , but helping refugees from conflict zones is part of what means being a `` western '' country . 
  my point exactly , you 're defining what it means to be someone you are not . 
   not an unlimited number and not in a chaotic manner , sure . 
  seemingly endless and chaotic is what it 's been . 
  the least the eu could do is send help to the nations that have to manage the flow of migrants .

  like its orban 's fault that about half of registered voters do n't care enough to cast their ballot, 
  thanks for the in-depth analysis . 
  on the positive side we will be at least very much dead by then . 
   but man is this guy annoying as hell . 
  great thing he needs to be reelected here . 
  he started this rhetoric long before trump arrived to the scene , in fact exactly one year ago he was the first leader to predict a gop win . 
  amazingly though he achieved unprecedented fame with his ramblings , i 'm not sure if this is unconscious or he is playing some 478d korean mahjongg . 
  seriously , people normally not know the name or discuss the opinions of the political leaders of hungary-sized countries , but orban somehow shattered the glass ceiling . 
  most definitely . 
  nevertheless he is also the epithome of technological illiteracy and has the delusional thought that forced reindustrialization and artificially created blue collar jobs can fix the problems of the underclass . 
  even a broken clock is right twice a day , just saying . 
  its more ore less a necessity , what other kind of establishment is open at 4am other than the standard fast food drive thru 's , greasy pizza takeaways and d\u00f6ner eateries ? 
  i also do n't write in cursive , where 's my green card ? 
  one guy from genova told me it 's literally the naples of the north . 
  that being said i do n't like most of the eastern part of hungary with the exception of cities like debrecen . 
  boring landscape , very parochial , mostly protestant people still salty about the `` papal '' catholics . 
  then you would be interested in our new `` deus vult acres '' gated community housing development directed at wealthy clients fleeing the decadence and the no go zones of the west . 
  condos !, 
  onsite fitness center and complimentary escort service !, 
  i beg to differ its also beneficial for me . 
  one of those places that are better on pictures than irl . 
  just stick to the amalfi coast of you know what 's good for you . 
  viktor really knows how to stir up the discussion when things are getting slower . 
  who knows , maybe he is shitposting on / pol in his free time . 
  edit : ah almost forgot its tusvanyos again , that 's when he brings out the heavy artillery , last year he went full maga , before that there was the concept of the illiberal state there 's always some amazing bon mot in these speeches . 
  we have come very far from the original topic here . 
  but this thread supports my first hand experiences ( and i 'm well travelled when it comes to spain ) that you really do n't have your shit together and are plagued by tribalist mindset . 
  of course its ultimately your problem and your job to figure out , but pointing at others that reeeee you ca n't do that is not exactly a headstart towards a healthier public discourse . 
  with that i 'm also forever out of this discussion . 
  did i imply that they were the only victims ? 
  but as a nation they likely suffered more . 
  i ca n't believe but only marvel at the hostility directed against me here . 
  i unironically had this feeling while traveling through spain . 
  in the northern parts of castile y le\u00f3n castile is meticulously spray painted over on almost all road signs . 
  i did not mean to offend anyone you are completely offtopic . 
  but the catalan people do have the right of self determination especially after franco and his funky bunch oppressed them for decades . 
   eat halal do my early morning doner feasts count ? 
  words to live by , i guess . 
  thanks but no thanks . 
  all this shit-flinging at catalonia while it has clearly given more than what it got is nauseating . 
  hardly anyone denies that this has nothing to do with race ( but quite a lot with the inherent flaws of certain religious beliefs ) . 
  besides stop complaining about downvotes in advance , ever heard about self-fulfilling prophecies ? 
  a lot less savage than a midnight walk around the outskirts of paris . 
  be glad that the vikings did n't invent inflatable boats - we would be all eating surstr\u00f6mming now . 
  as i highlighted , catalonia contributes more than what it gets . 
  if they give the spanish govt . 
  100 bucks but get back 60 while the rest goes into some central fund or to the renovation of sheep stable in el castilo de bumblefuck ( population : 85 ) in la mancha then who is generous with whom ? 
  agree entirely . 
  there is no redemption for crimes against humanity . 
  well if she is sentenced in iraq then there will be only a very short movie about her , most likely on liveleak . 
  fast forward a year and she will be at home and possibly out on parole . 
  next thing she ghost writes a book exposing the secrets of isis and is touring all over doing `` motivational speeches '' . 
  i unironically think this will happen . 
  yeah , this time it was very subtle though . 
  considering that catalonia is literally one of the most developed parts of spain , and a net contributor to the central budget it is a tad ironic move at best . 
  wew lad , you are surely bringing some heat here !, 
  yes its open to the public and the audience can ask questions . 
  also the thesis has to be made available online well before the defense . 
  that 's a good one , we need to have it here but with palinka and the small modification of not putting it back but drinking it during your presentation for stress relief . 
  are you some kind of reincarnation of ayn rand ? 
  has science gone too far ? 
  that was a super risky move though - unsolicited authorship is a serious issue and the other guy could have make the editors retract the paper with mininal effort . 
  i think we need to abandon this ivory tower approach personal statements need to have their place in academic papers . 
  never forget that if you are not at the table then you are on the menu - and the general public wo n't be bothered much if funding for basic research is siphoned away ... 
  that 's rookie approach , a real professional like me reads the abstract , the first and last paragraph of the discussion and the conclusion , taking a brief look at the figures if they are nice . 
  unless of course i 'm reviewing a manuscript in which case i will search meticulously for even the tiniest methodological errors . 
  i 'm not a bona fide scientist but have a phd and do research and i think that we are already too sheepish and need to make our voice heard . 
  agreed , i know a spanish researcher who lost her status after more than 20 years - she had a world class track record but was n't tenured . 
  now what can someone do in her forties she 's too old to be just a mere posdoc in someone else 's lab ... 
  acknowledgements are the infamous easter eggs of scientific papers . 
  there are people thanking their dogs or the secretary for the coffee , literally everything is possible since hardly anyone reads them . 
  thanks i knew we can count on you !, 
  lengthy list of things like what ? 
  helping elderly grandmas cross the street ? 
  its still crime and comparisons across groups are still valid . 
  airbnb is ripe for regulation tbh . 
  we see it daily in budapest how it makes downtown less and less livable for locals and how it is driving out less affluent people to the suburbs . 
  who cares but fine here are the actual countries : backwardistan and shitholia . 
  i 'm having some thoughts but as i 'm merely a parochial backward hungarian ( in fact i am writing these very words from the middle of the friggin * puszta * while making goulash ) i need to page our in-house statistical maven u/vernazza to explain the hidden meaning of these data, 
  one glass of water for each drink is the most useful advice i ever heard to avoid a situation like this . 
  staying hydrated alleviates the worst parts of a hangover and helps your body removing those nasty aldehydes . 
  drinking copious amounts of beer can fuck up your stomach though no matter what . 
  hungarian police is brutal in this respect , they are mandated to check every driver they stop for anything with a breathalyzer no matter what , no exceptions . 
  most people forget about it though it can get you in trouble . 
  i usually do n't drink alcohol after midnight if i need to drive in the morning afterwards . 
  was there in 2012 , it was hilariously overcrowded with , an incredible amount of us tourists marvelling at every stone slab . 
  its not bad but way overrated tbh , would not visit again . 
  this . 
  the pena palace was almost boring for me after it . 
  sucks for them because unlike spewing hatred against central europeans that would be considered racism . 
  i guess more pakistanis less poles is yet another facet of the brexit reality check . 
  we defend our borders because thats our only true obligation here . 
  providing b&b for window shopping `` refugees '' doing the grand euro tour '17 is unfortunately not exactly top priority . 
  also free movement has never been offered for residents of third world failed states . 
  well , he is n't wrong, 
  with muh brexit making many eu workers leaving already the share of non-europeans will increase further rapidly . 
  but thats what brexiteers wanted amirite ? 
   thratens a special form of threatening which also implies the imminent release of the krakens . 
  besides better remember the day v4 started a war over shitty fish fingers which is a junk food by default . 
  `` generic classicist building which is either a museum or a university starterpack '' edit - fun fact : classicism is based entirely on a misinterpretation of greco-roman architecture .

  my upstairs neighbors have a small dog ( french bulldog ) , a small child , and a not-so-small housewife . 
  the kid keeps chasing the dog . 
  the mom keeps chasing the kid . 
  pure bliss down here ... 
  yesterday , the kid apparently had a birthday . 
  pitter-patter of little feet ? 
  more like a fucking stampede . 
  with screaming for no reason mixed in . 
  oh , and the dog sounds like a vacuum cleaner that is trying to start but is failing . 
  but compared to the rest of the noises coming from there , that 's nothing . 
  there are a few superstores in the netherlands owned by albert heijn . 
  they are called `` ah xl '' . 
  still not as big as a tesco though . 
  they are n't , there is even less overlap between japanese and hungarian vocabulary than between hungarian and estonian / finnish ( a grand total of 2 `` very basic '' words are similar , the word for `` good '' and the word for `` salt '' , whereas with finnish there are dozens if not hundreds ) . 
  you do n't have to go as far as norway . 
  i have once stayed in a high school dorm that looked worse than a hungarian prison cell . 
  like the old joke says , politicians will gladly cut the budget of high school and college dorms because they sure as hell wo n't spend any time there , but they ca n't say the same about prisons ... 
  most people do n't bother learning hungarian . 
  ca n't blame them if they are only there for a semester or even for a full bsc , but when someone who lived there for a decade still ca n't order a damn beer , it gets annoying . 
  interestingly , japanese people tend to have a much easier time learning hungarian than europeans . 
  probably because the logic of the languages is so similar , even though they are n't related . 
  most foreigners who do bother to learn hungarian have a strong accent even years into living in hungary . 
  it 's not particularly bothering since 1 ) at least they actually learned it and 2 ) some hungarian dialects ( esp . 
  ones from the borders ) sound just as different ( to an ear attuned to the budapest dialect , at least ) . 
  beginner mistakes are mostly caused by people trying to apply indo-european logic to hungarian ( believing that our suffixes are a case system then using latin or german case rules is a very typical one , not dropping pronouns is another one ) . 
  this might also explain why japanese learn it faster : they do n't have these preconceptions , and speaking hungarian with japanese grammar results in mostly correct hungarian anyway . 
  nope , that 's a moka pot . 
  some are alright . 
  but for the rest , i have seen nicer prison cells . 
  most places outside budapest . 
  but to mention a few concrete locations : * eger , a city in the northern part of the country . 
  popular among hungarians because the final battle of the most popular hungarian novel takes place there , but not so popular among foreigners . 
  notable things there : the castle , the minaret , bull 's blood ( a strong and bold red wine ) and generally the natural environment . 
  * the northern coast of the lake balaton . 
  less popular than the south because the water gets deep quickly , but lots of people had at least one school vacation in z\u00e1nka . 
  the nearby hills are nice too . 
  * fert\u0151d . 
  next to the fert\u0151-t\u00f3 ( maybe better known as neusiedler see , we share it with austria ) , and home to the eszterh\u00e1zy palace , our smaller , cheaper but still really nice version of sch\u00f6nbrun . 
  yeah , orb\u00e1n , our cunt of a pm . 
  being able to cast a variable with suffixes . 
  or simply more fluent apis . 
  if the `` void '' return type was banished from a language ( except for static functions ) and every function with a void return value would return the object it 's called on instead , then you would be able to chain a bunch of statements together as a `` sentence '' . 
  c # 's linq is pretty great for this . 
  as a hungarian , i feel your pain . 
  even = is only available with a shift ( unless you 're using a full-sized mac keyboard ) . 
  but i got so used to programming with this layout that i ca n't code effectively with an english layout . 
  except when an ide 1 ) has a hotkey for ctrl + alt + some letter , usually f ( which is [ on a hungarian layout with altgr ) and 2 ) does n't differentiate between altgr and ctrl + alt . 
  fuck those ides . 
  ( hungarian living in nl ) wake up . 
  hate the world , hate this fucking job , hate the fucking morning people running this shitshow ( and mornings in general , and people in general ) . 
  snooze until i can no longer put off getting up if i want to be able to get a coffee , take a shower , and get in for the first useless motherfucking morning meeting about a doomed project . 
  make one french press of coffee to drink . 
  while drinking it , make another for the thermo flask . 
  read the webcomics on feedly . 
  realize that i 'm fucking late again , exhaust the swearing vocabulary of every language i speak ( 6 , though japanese does n't have too much in the way of swearwords ) . 
  take an expedited shower ( cursing the shower head and the water pressure in my apartment ) only wetting my hair enough to get rid of the bed head . 
  brush teeth , throw on the first temperature-appropriate set of clean clothes i can get my hands on , take some vitamin c because i 'll spend 2 hours today in a rolling petri-dish , then start out for said petri-dish in a dead sprint . 
  i really miss working in the same city and being able to bike to work . 
  ( i can always hope that it will be a few minutes late , but it never is when i 'm running late too . 
  public static boolean istrainlate ( ) { return amilate ( ) ^ ^ isnskut ( ) ; } public static boolean isnskut ( ) { return true ; } ) then i try to find a seat , whip out my phone , start some particularly hateful metal , start up relay for reddit and write a fairly accurate description of this morning . 
  happens in hungary once in a while , either in july or august . 
  it 's usually spent either inside or at a beach or a pool drinking something cold ( lemonade for the kids , beer for the grown-ups ) . 
  did i want to invoke duverger 's theorem ? 
  yup , definitely . 
  bottle of p\u00e1linka . 
  it will probably send you into a coma , but still . 
  supposedly . 
  our phoneme sets show a lot of overlap , we just have different orthography . 
  i 'm aware that there are district-based voting systems that are not fptp . 
  however , almost every time a voting system moves towards districts , it also moves towards fptp ( because it 's generally the big parties who have the power to change the system , and fptp favors them ) . 
  i also consider geographical districts antiquated . 
  modern society is segmented differently , for example , the priorities of a university student align more with those of a fellow student in the other half of the country than with those of the blue collar worker living across the street , or the pensioner living in the apartment above his . 
  yet , since university students are not a populous group and certainly are n't the majority in any district , they are ignored . 
  no , i meant what i wrote . 
  a two-party system is the consequence of an fptp election system , because fptp can easily translate a relative majority of votes to an absolute majority in the legislature , eventually leaving only those parties in the running that can achieve a relative majority of votes in the absolute majority of districts . 
  tactical voting and the spoiler effect will ensure that this will be reduced to 2 parties unless some third parties have a strong local support . 
  of course after a 2-party system is already established , relative and absolute majority are the same . 
  in such a system there are other problems . 
  the two-party system is only the consequence of the winner-takes-all fptp electoral college . 
  any country without an fptp element in their election system is more resistant to a populist , simply because the relative majority they might have does n't translate to an absolute majority . 
  maybe in the rural areas . 
  i 'm 28 , and i went to high school in budapest . 
  of my class ( of 28 people ) there are maybe 3 people who have kids , 6 who are married or engaged ( mostly women ) , and maybe another 5-6 who live in a serious relationship . 
  i do n't think so , we are not our government . 
  `` hall\u00f3 '' is the most common ( different from the usual hello ) . 
  i 'm fond of `` v\u00e9tel '' ( receiving ) with friends and family . 
  i tend to use some radio slang because my family 's house had a shitty landline back in the day . 
  as long as she is from a culture that accepts dating for purposes other than finding a husband and the father of her future children , idgaf . 
  yeah , but he politicians who want to increase birth rates are extremely shortsighted . 
  how would a baby born today help with the pension of the pensioners of today ? 
  no way , that 's how . 
  in fact , encouraging more childbirths would have more harmful effects than good , because it would keep more parents ( mostly mothers ) out of the job market as well . 
  and in 18-25 years when the children born today would start working , automation will likely take over a lot of jobs . 
  it would be saner to encourage automation and a higher productivity and efficiency ( thus higher wages ) in every job where that is possible . 
  oh , and not stealing the private retirement funds . 
  yeah , that would have been nice . 
  western never completely fell out of the fashion in hungary thanks to the bud spencer - terence hill movies . 
  i enjoyed reading may 's books as a kid ( it 's telling of his popularity that even his name was sometimes used as `` may k\u00e1roly '' , something reserved generally for popes , kings , and jules verne , sorry , verne gyula ) , but they might be a tad racist for 21st century sensitivities . 
  as a hungarian i find the swearing a little lacking . 
  it 's not a single party , it 's a congregation of most non-authoritarian parties rhetorically left from fidesz who are not funded by fidesz in the background ( probably ) .

  they never went through that . 
  they are still operating in the warlord system of the middle ages . 
  of course not every single one of them , there are engineers and scientists etc there as well , of course . 
  but the whole political system is just not ready for the system we have in europe . 
  i was referring to [ hartz iv ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hartz_concept#hartz_iv ) . 
  i 'm not sure how much time must pass before a newly immigrated person/refugee gets it . 
  would * you * do that ? 
  i certainly would n't . 
  i would n't risk my family 's ( or my own ) life to go against isis and terrorist organizations . 
  fuck that . 
  i 'd bail as soon as i had the opportunity . 
  maybe you are a combination of rambo , batman and the terminator who has balls of steel and the necessary national idealism to do it , but it 's just not as simple . 
   there is a `` brain drain '' ( for lack of a better word ) happening this is true , but what can we do ? 
  it 's just how things go ... 
  what 's up in the netherlands , any refugees going there ? 
  it seems that these people are very much focused on the size of countries , perhaps feeling that a really powerful country would have a large territory . 
  in interviews they often say they want to go to germany of uk because they are `` big countries '' . 
  for the uk they also said they want it because it 's a kingdom , which they again , probably equate with power . 
  we should tell them the netherlands is a kingdom , too . 
  anyway , what i want to say is that they are n't very conscious about why they want to go to a specific country besides following the crowd and using heuristics like `` big country '' ( they also skip austria for this reason , probably ) . 
  maybe many of them do n't even know the netherlands exists . 
  sure , i know . 
  but if they are against it , they should make their voice heard . 
  because right now news show that germans are very enthusiastic and have a `` can do '' attitude towards taking these people , integrating them and proving for all skeptics that it can be done , if done right , with tolerance and help and solidarity . 
  i 'm not sure it will be that easy , but it seems to be the sentiment now . 
  it 's not really the people personally , but the mentality , the ideology . 
  we need to make clear that no fundamentalist muslims can enter europe . 
  if you make the slightest attempt to enforce religious rules as if they were laws , you 're out . 
  there are many sane people living in syria , normal people like you and me , who are just fed up with the bullshit happening there . 
  the chaos , the fear , bombing , ruined building etc. 
  but they are not used to the european life yet . 
  europe has to teach them the values of european society : secularism , freedom , humanism , etc. 
  if you ca n't accept these , you 're out . 
  want sharia courts and sharia punishments ? 
  out . 
  beat/force your wife to do stuff ? 
  out . 
  at the same time , we have to make a safe environment for the sane people , so they do n't have to resort to joining the radical groups . 
  often these newly immigrated people can not find any other place to belong than mosques and muslim communities . 
  we have to avoid creating such insular societies . 
  go to syria with a global sane-countries alliance and force them to live in a civilized way . 
  there 's no other way . 
  leaving them to their own devices does n't work . 
  there 's no tradition of democracy there . 
  developed countries must colonize these lands again and enforce order . 
  then maybe after 2 centuries they 'll be capable of handling freedom . 
  i 'm exaggerating a bit , of course , because the middle eastern conflict is just so freaking complicated with so many sides and parties that you ca n't just `` fix things '' that easily . 
  but i really do n't see any other solution . 
  germans are cutely kind in a naive way . 
  nice people and i would like to be friends with them . 
  but they ca n't see beyond their nose , ca n't see the secondary effects . 
  it 's really nice to be welcoming to people in need , but this encourages more and more people to go on the journey . 
  it makes refugees/migrants angry who are stuck for example at the budapest railway station and are n't let forward . 
  germany must officially open the borders for all refugees if they want to keep up the welcoming rhetoric . 
  otherwise they are doing it at the expense of the south-eastern european countries . 
  demand from your government to open the borders and not to make the refugees pile up at budapest train stations . 
  we are happy to help them go to germany , but eu regulations do n't allow for it . 
  germany needs to clarify its position because this double-speak is not sustainable . 
  refugees are angry and protesting by the thousands in budapest because they can not get to the trains . 
  hungarian minimum wage is 4.000 $ / year . 
  ( [ source ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/documents/2995521/6652357/3-26022015-ap-en.pdf/42097ff5-231b-4116-b0cf-8a28ca316f84 ) ) and no , groceries are not that much cheaper . 
  only the rent and housing is cheaper . 
  exactly . 
  we have an expression for this in hungarian : `` to beat the nettles with another guy 's dick '' ( `` m\u00e1s fasz\u00e1val veri a csal\u00e1nt '' ), 
  month . 
  compared to the average salary of around 490 $ / month ( after taxes ) in hungary , it 's a pretty good amount , considering that it does n't even include rent . 
  you see , you can actually * live * on welfare in germany . 
  germans do n't realize that this is not normal all over the world . 
  in eastern europe welfare is just a bit of help , it does n't cover your living expenses . 
  you * can not * live on welfare alone . 
  hungarians get unemployment money for a maximum of 90 days , and it 's crap money , then good bye , look for a job . 
  how are we supposed to give germany-level welfare to refugees if we ca n't do it for our own poor people ? 
  i think they should print 50 % of the ballots with the options reversed , both in the question and in the listing of the possible answers . 
  exactly . 
  but then do n't make statements that confuse the refugees saying germany welcomes them all . 
  sure , it was more nuanced than that , and did n't mean that all can go , but you have to communicate responsibly in this day and age . 
  if the chancellor of germany says a sentence about refugees they know about it instantly , no matter where they are on their journey ( or still at home ) . 
  they ca n't travel to other eu countries to the same extent that they could n't travel into hungary from serbia . 
  they still did it . 
  but if we try to stop this and close the border with a fence and increased patrolling , we are xenophobes and far-right . 
  but austria can declare that they do n't accept them without being xenophobic . 
  who understands this ? 
  we should also realize the we are setting a precedent here . 
  the middle eastern crisis wo n't stop soon , but what if more civil wars break out for example in africa in a couple of years ? 
  africa is expected to double its population in the next few decades . 
  overcrowdedness and the crappy colonial borders and ignorance , warlords etc. 
  will cause problems for sure . 
  so then , will europe take them too ? 
  will europe become the default place where you can dump millions of people from war areas ? 
  it sure sounds nice and compassionate to take them all , and you can flash some applause lights in the brains of the leftist elite , but is this sustainable ? 
  how ? 
  we have a fence . 
  got shit for it . 
  if we catch them it 's inhumane and brutal . 
  then what ? 
  we are refusing most of the refugee claims as unfounded , but i do n't knew the latest percentages . 
  every country just pushes them further and further . 
  austria is the next one . 
  they are stopping trucks now , causing long traffic jams on the motorway , hours of waiting times . 
  they do n't let the trains through today , although they let 3600 people through yesterday , but today the chancellor of austria bashed hungarian authorities for letting refugees get on board of the train .

  yes we know nazis are bad , can we move the fuck on ? 
  not having choice but a phony democracy is a problem, 
  how is germany a democracy if there is no one else to choose but one person ? 
  would not have been easier just to be honest from the beginning and not let these migrants in ? 
  now western eu is playing a game of muscial chairs with them ... it is really pathetic, 
  i never understood how hiding facts would help anything ? 
  the first step to any solution is getting the facts straight . 
  if we are denied access to facts how are we supposed to make good decisions ? 
  what is your point ? 
  `` frustration with the country , which signed the schengen agreement in 1992 and joined the area in 2000 , had mounted after it refused eu help in controlling its external borders and curbing the migrant influx . '', 
   and nobody except the germans and swedes actually support it . 
  almost all eu countries voted yes for the redistribution of refugees ... 
  eventually all who spat on hungary will do exactly the same ... 
  that 's exactly what my country did last summer and was interpreted as `` closing the border '' by western eu we just wanted to control who comes in, 
  they refused eu help on border controlls ... honestly ? 
  i am fed up with them, 
  merkel did, 
  in reality they are just afraid of competition . 
  the customer comes first , they should have learned that and now they would n't be hated by them, 
  my wallet was stolen in a crowded bus in warsaw like a year ago ... guy took it out from my samsonite handbag , zipped it out and took off in the next stop ... the shitty feeling as a foreigner , i didn t mind the money , but my id card , driving license , residence card ( hungarian ) ... 
  he 's right , `` d\u00e1n geci '' is much more vulgar and offensive compared to `` d\u00e1n gazember '' which feels mild knowing what you have in mind, 
  hmm , i was taught ( in helsinki university ) that the germans got that word from us actually ... 
  what if we would invest in actually being able to control our fucking eu borders ? 
  instead of any external country deciding who comes in ... and then blackmailing us with it, 
  yeah it 's the opposite in poland . 
  i left my sweater in a toilette in warsaw airport , went back only 1-2 minutes later and it was already gone, 
  does n't have to work 100 % it 's still very useful at say 93 % . 
  or we can just bus them to netherlands if you do n't feel multi kulti enough ? 
  it is still a judgement in western eu . 
  it ' s okay to talk shit about ee people . 
  double standard - try to do the same with blacks or jews, 
  orban is a capitalist maffia leader . 
  it 's just like in the us - if you have money , you will have an awesome time . 
  if you do n't you 're fucked, 
  maybe they got lost in time and think it 's still austria-hungary, 
  not if the other schengen border countries had followed suit too . 
  they let them in it 's not our fault, 
  i worked for big corporations in hungary : never ever was it expected from foreigners to speak hungarian . 
  it always went without saying that we switch to english even if there was only 1 foreigner in the room . 
  so do n't worry foreigners love budapest very different from my experience in warsaw , poles switch to polish and does n't give a f.ck how many foreigners are in the room . 
  and then push you to learn their language ... 
  the chaika looks badass, 
  i wana help - my partially german blood boils reading this, 
  because in western culture men are viewed as disgusting monkeys while women are all angels . 
  feminist brainwashing over 50 years, 
   you simply said you did n't want any brown people . 
  where did you read that , the german press ? 
  can you please link your source ? 
  for your information hungary has a gypsy ( `` brown people '' ) minority of around 1 million . 
  we have a lot of problems , we spent enormous amounts to help them integrate to society ... there are some success stories , but mostly it did n't work out unfortunately . 
  so we are cautious . 
   you also did n't suggest any viable solutions , the best we ever got was idiotic populism . 
  we suggested taking it seriously defending our borders ( why is that idiotic ? ) . 
  you said arrogantly it would n't work and we should find another solution ... as a result now innocent german women are getting raped by these `` refugees '' ... bravo !, 
  this is the price you pay for your arrogant ignorant hypocritical pc high horse, 
  no they stopped once we started physically protecting our schengen border with serbia . 
  not letting them in is possible you know ... if we decide to have the balls to do it, 
  double standard, 
  why is it that arab muslims are okay to be radical , but germans are n't ? 
  for us hungarians germany ( and austria ) have always been like a big brother . 
  our current opposition to merkel 's refugee policy does not change an iota in that, 
  they plug something else intsead apparently, 
   it will happen again because your politicians do n't give a shit the rights of the local population . 
  thing is west eu politicians are just as bad as east eu politicians , they just steal less . 
  welcome to your new reality !, 
  orban basically said `` fuck off '' to all of these new `` immigrants '' . 
  it seems different from merkel 's reaction to me and i do not expect these problems to happen in hungary in my lifetime , while a german will live with this forever from now on ... 
   no , your closest language relatives are khanty and mansi peoples from siberia . 
  you 're splitting hairs now . 
  does anyone know those khanty and mansi ppl apart from linguists ? 
  their population put together is around 50k people . 
  unlike the finns i never spoke to those people but if they understood hungarian the same way russians understand polish then definitely we must have some deep cultural ties , no question . 
  why do you assume i would deny that ? 
   oh , i was quite sure we were talking about language relatives and now suddenly you start with cultural ties ? 
  those are two entirely different things . 
  language is a huge part of culture , many would argue the biggest and most relevant part . 
  are you seriously denying this fact ? 
  i never said culture is only language though , of course there are many other factors . 
  but it is definitely part of it - to what degree , that can be open to arguments . 
  if russians understand polish - not 100 % and perfectly , i never said your language and culture are identical - then it shows a deep cultural relationship that only an unhealthy/distorted mind would deny . 
  i am just curious why are polish people so desperate to deny these ties that are obvious to any outsider . 
  i know a russian girl who i witnessed can talk fluently to polish people and she told me she never learned any polish . 
  my dad when he visited warsaw could understand many things based on his vague russian he used to speak when he was young . 
  i am telling you , from an outsider 's point of view ( who does n't speak any of the slavic languages ) the ties are obvious . 
  our closest language relatives are the finns . 
  i spent a semester in helsinki and studied finnish . 
  i could understand 0 % based on my hungarian you guys are ridiculous for denying your cultural ties with russia . 
  it s not a european problem . 
  it s a german problem . 
  snowden was so right, 
  i understand that we signed a bad treaty but since we all agree that the treaty is unfeasible and unrealistic we should revise it and adjust to reality . 
  trying to enforce an admittedly stupid and unfair treaty is damaging to all parties involved . 
   wtf . 
  those are people and no trash . 
  please do not twist my words , i did not mean those people are trash . 
  what i meant was germany ( merkel ) created a problem while amazingly insisting it was n't a problem at all and also blaming bigotry on countries who had to courage to call it a problem and now when it is clear to everyone it is a problem ... she wants those very same `` bigoted '' countries to clean up after her . 
  i do n't think at this point people trust the eu treaties anymore . 
  you can have rules , but if no one follows them because there is no consequence for disobeying them then the rules are meaningless . 
  suppose i am an entry country . 
  if i am realistic , all the people i let in will end up staying in my country since no other country ( or very few ) will be willing to accept them .
