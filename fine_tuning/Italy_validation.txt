they have families there . 
  why do n't steal their money then our military is stronger so obviously everything we do is acceptable . 
  the human traffickers did , you are basically admitting that you have the same moral of a human trafficker . 
  so let me get this straight you propose to abandon people in the middle of the sea on a sinking ship ? 
  because north african countries will obviously let you do that . 
  it 's not racist it 's just stupid . 
  [ amnesty : australian officials paid people smugglers ] ( http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2015/10/amnesty-australian-officials-paid-people-smugglers-151028230421588.html ),

  and if someone try to stop you ? 
  where they receive full medical attention with the ok of the local government unlike libya, 
  so if someone need urgent medical attention he should be left to die if i understand you right when you say you do n't care about them ? 
  so plese repeat to me what would you do if someone try to stop you and if there is some medical emergency . 
  you say drop them in a random port i explained why it is n't possible nor right and the you responded saying i want to help zimbabwean kids while never addressing my point . 
  so you admit you have no solution then ahahahah, 
  i will point out that you have n't addresed any one of them , while you are resorting to use slippery slope more and more . 
  serious objection are not fact but massive slippery slope are ? 
  australia put them in camp with awful condition in an isolated island in the pacific , we do not have similar island and we have much more migrants.do you have some actually realizable proposal ? 
  the inhabitants of the port ? 
  the local independent militia ? 
  and the children on board do they have responsabilites ? 
  what happen if someone need intense medical care ? 
  so you admit that your solution does n't make sense ? 
  who 's responsible does n't matter this is the reality of the situation . 
  so you take people and drop in some random port ? 
  and if someone try to stop you ? 
  if there is some medical emergency ? 
  and bring them to who ? 
  the non existing libyan government ? 
  you are right we should let the drown, 
  i 'm the only one who see the problem in giving the state the power of deciding what is culturally acceptable and what not ? 
  she is right again, 
  well she is right, 
  why do n't judge the individual then ? 
  well it 's not like eritrea is much better, 
  no because there were no proof at all, 
  because there is nothing to answer we do n't tm decide how many decide to get here, 
  a political choice rendered inevitable by economical reality, 
  many jew are going to germany instead [ http://zwst.org/cms/documents/383/de_de/zwst_mitgliederstatistik_1955-1985.pdf] ( http://zwst.org/cms/documents/383/de_de/zwst_mitgliederstatistik_1955-1985.pdf ), 
  yes until you have proof of the countrary i will, 
  i mean if they did n't recive welfare they would be forced to resort to crime, 
  i mean this happened only 3 months ago [ thirty nine year old gay man attacked on a train in berlin , the attackers were polish . 
  is purposefully exaggerating the number until its in realistic and stop having sense, 
  it 's impossible for such number of african refugee to go to germany beacause there are n't so many refugee and the large majority of them stay in africa, 
  even if we did n't help them they will simply try to reach the coast, 
  but are n't violent crimes diminishing in western europe ? 
  yes and ? 
  fuck other people if they do n't come here ? 
  patrolling a border cost much more manpower than simply let them come here by plaine with their papers already checked , and your solution still ignore tha non-enforciability of a closed sea border, 
  why people alwais exagerate when i explain the reality of the situation alwais `` you obviously want gorillions of people to come to europe2 always the same exagerated bullshit, 
  the traffickers will simply use better boat and try to reach the coast like they did before , probably more dead because a longer crossing means more risk, 
  yes risk killing thousand people for the lulz, 
  it 's not that he did n't have enough proof he literally did n't have any, 
  i mean lybia ports are surely not safe, 
  you are just saying some mulsim want to conquer the west you must proof that all muslim immigrating to the west want that it 's a much more difficult thing to prove i must say, 
  putting them in camp with terrible conditions and them try to hide that by banning journalist ? 
  we barely have 18 % of all world refugee while being one of the richest part of the globe, 
  yes clearly refugee and the ottoman empire are the same thing lol, 
  so you have no proof that a plan exist or that migrant come to europe to act that way ? 
  s how can you say that muslim adhere to declaration of those so called islamics leader ? 
  are you saying that all muslim are terrorist and follow their plan ? 
  `` islamic leaders '' prove that you do n't know a shit about islam it dose n't have a unified clergy , `` terorist '' is not a good source to know what would people do and i really really want you to point to the part of the koran where there is a detailed plan for the colonization of europe or proof of the existance of this mythic no-go zone, 
  i still do n't see armed man forcing me in reservation , panting refugee but even migrant as a foreign army with intent of conquest is stupid at best, 
  well i welcome them so it 's not unwelcome, 
  invasion \u026an\u02c8ve\u026a\u0292 ( \u0259 ) n / noun noun : invasion ; plural noun : invasions an instance of invading a country or region with an armed force . 
  `` napoleon 's disastrous invasion of russia in 1812 '' synonyms : occupation , conquering , capture , seizure , annexation , annexing , takeover , appropriation , expropriation , arrogation ; more overrunning , overwhelming , storming ; attack , incursion , offensive , assailing , assault , onslaught ; foray , sortie , raid `` the invasion of the islands took place in april '' antonyms : withdrawal, 
  but the number of illegals coming from mexico ad been deceiving for decades, 
  i 'm waiting, 
  are you seeing armed muslims troop forcing christian kids in madras ? 
  lol, 
  like 20 % of israel population is arab muslim lol, 
  i mean you made the original claim that it was an invasion present you your proof, 
  i mean you consider their immigration policies good and the rest bad only beacuse you like the immigration one and not the other , it 's not an objective position for example i consider all their postition bad on immigration and in other subject, 
  so your solution dose n't work ? 
  at least mine would save thousand of life and cost many less resource, 
  so the position ** you ** like are n't nutcase but those you do n't are ? 
  is n't it a bit egocentric ? 
  well but how would a wall help people with legitimate cliam to asylium ? 
  or people who quite easily climb over the wall ? 
  and how do you propose to build a wall in the middle of the mediterranean sea ? 
  yes fuck human rigths lol, 
  well you 're analysis is wrong our standard for asylium are rather stric and even then i do n't known how you can think that all of africa population will come here, 
  well yes it takes year but following my idea we will reduce significatl the people arriving and with more resource ( by having to handle less people ) it should be much easier ; and there are way to know from were a person come even without document for example by the languge they speak, 
  the didd n't choose to stay in lybia they ** must ** pass througt lybia to get here and please inform yourself the civil war is far from over tha country is still divided in vaious territory controlled by 2 different government but in reality very autonomus, 
  yes but the problem is what is the populus , populist politician say that the people are with him but how we can say it 's true ? 
  should n't the fact that they continue to lose election prove otherwise ? 
  i 'm sorry if i offended you i did n't know you too faced similar opprssion and violation of human rigth in you daily life, 
  the influx by boat like i said the statistic ca n't show that, 
  yes but what you know of the opinio of the average joe ? 
  how can you be so sure it is in accord with you , and event then `` these people '' are many times people of the same country so the are part of the populace too, 
  yes but why ? 
  i mean you surely do n't know even 0,001 % of all european citzien personally why must they be valued more ? 
  thaks i prefer to not change human righths they are part of the european value that many here think must be defended, 
  maybe beacuse that position ** is ** nutcase firebrand ? 
  i mean with do n't have dictators and similar shit because we respect human rigth and one of these human rigth is the rigth to asylium, 
  well yes but if they have limited resource is the most logical choice, 
  so data and expert are useless and we should base every political decision on personal feeling ? 
  so feels  real, 
  no the famili do n't take the same path they come by plane once the asylium claim is accepted, 
  it 's not the same trip if they accept the asylium claim they can safely come by plane, 
  the fist if the man complete the crossing they are safe if the do n't the can send the other man in the family , and you must consider tha many time young man are focefully conscipted in militia so taking the crossing is a way to escape that,

  nah , i was referring to the biggest current issue . 
  somehow it 's always berlusconi , since 20 years ago . 
  i do n't understand why it 's allowed to have so wildly different tax regimes in europe . 
  when all the main financial institutions are based in luxembourg it 's clear that there 's something wrong ... 
  the answer is berlusconi , usually . 
  it is now too . 
  the communist party never really seized power in italy , so there are always some ` idealists ' who want to give it a shot . 
  the party still had parliament members until the last election , but now it 's almost extinct . 
  neo-fascist parties are instead quite alive , unfortunately . 
  i know some very intelligent people , with good education and all in all more than decent and honest people who voted and will still vote for berlusconi . 
  why ? 
  `` because otherwise the left wins '' . 
  maybe they were probably deeply upset by the workers ' revolts and the terror regime of the '70s , maybe they can not distance themselves from that concept of left , but that 's how it is . 
  there definitely is a subset of italians who match your description . 
  but i think that they are - also - the byproduct of 20 years of brainwashing by berlusconi 's brand of tv . 
  i was a kid , but i remember that before then we had tv channels who tried to entertain but also keep a minimum level of ` culture ' and engagement . 
  we had ` serious ' documentaries and talk shows focusing on divisive topics or political issues - i loved the science documentaries of ` quark ' for example , thanks to my parents enjoying them with me and explaining stuff . 
  berlusconi 's tvs turned the tables : mostly shows devoid of any content apart from dancing girls and silly scripts . 
  mini-starlets were generated continuosly , so lots of girls had the dream of getting in there . 
  there message was `` hey , studying is for losers , come here and have fun and be famous ! '' . 
  i 'll mention the name `` uomini e donne '' shuddering ( a gym rat guy sitting on a literal throne as several girls had to woo him so he could pick one - the ` courtship ' would last weeks and the various characters would make the rounds of all tv channels being interviewed as bringers of important truths . 
  they would earn lots of money just by touring around and posing - how can you convince a kid that it 's worthwhile to pursue an education when they see that ? ), 
  once he got in charge he also had control of the 3 state channels and pretty much all became the same . 
  the most blatant example was the news program of rai1 , the leading and most respected state channel , which started devoting half of its time to issues like how to solve your dog 's digestion problems or what will stupidbimbo24 wear for her marriage - it truly became a parody of a news program . 
  i 'm not saying that it 's all his fault , as of course there must have been a receptive audience for that to work , but he created and exploited a kind of ` perfect resonance ' and we now have the harvest : lots of people who do n't appreciate culture , do n't read books and have trouble understanding non-basic written texts , ready to follow who shouts louder and that forget what happened two days after they stop seeing it . 
  i might seem to be exaggerating , but i have a friend that works as a tutor in a school to prepare people for the national lawyers state exam . 
  she is constantly shocked by the fact that the majority of these aspiring lawyers , with law degrees , can not write using correct grammar , let alone understand complex matters of rights . 
  and they do n't want to learn , they do n't care about being good : they want a shortcut across the exam . 
  we have to start rebuilding , and it will take long . 
  he lies constantly and convincingly . 
  he pulls stunts like the tax reimbursement letter `` or i 'll give you the money back from my own pocket '' without a shred of shame , and people fall for it . 
  he also supports the kinds of policies that some people like . 
  for example lots of houses in the south were built outside of regulations , as it was ` tradition ' that sooner or later the government would allow everyone to get ` lawful ' by paying a small fine . 
  so people kept building wherever and waited for the inevitable condonation law . 
  berlusconi has promised a mega-condonation , so he ensured a bunch of votes for himself . 
  then you have tax shields , media restrictions masked as privacy laws and lots of stuff that a section of society actually likes , and there you have it . 
  the best one is probably `` eternal sunshine of the spotless mind '' that became `` se mi lasci ti cancello '' ( break up with me and i 'll delete you ), 
  fuel in italy is the target of many emergency taxes . 
  only that they never get revoked , so , among the others , we 're paying to support the following : * abissinian war since 1935 * suez crisis since 1956 * vajont disaster since 1963 * florence flooding since 1966 * belice earthquake since 1968 * friuli earthquake since 1976 * irpinia earthquake since 1980 * lebanon mission funding since 1983 * bosnia mission funding since 1996 and this is only a part of the taxes on fuel ... 
  for italy i guess we can use the [ anthem ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqtswch2s7y ) . 
  patriotism became very unpopular after mussolini , however , who forced it on people , and any vaguely nationalistic song will likely get you bad glares . 
  many people prefer songs like [ bella ciao ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ci3lhynkfo ) , talking about the resistance fighters who fought the fascist regime . 
  such songs , however , are known to elicit vigorous political discussions ( and the youtube comments are a blatant example ) , so for most people it 's better to leave ` charged ' songs alone . 
  # 3 is common in the south ... 
  it 's the chin scratch that means i do n't give a damn . 
  i think i have seen # 8 as well , but it 's much less common . 
  i went on holiday in australia last year and i was amazed at how expensive everything was , including basic food , with some exceptions . 
  i met lots of italians who went there for work who were paid over twice what they would get here , even for manual work ( waiter , mason , etc. ), 
  but they also said that expenses were correspondingly higher , especially housing . 
  most of them planned to live in shared houses or in hostels for a year or two so they could set some money aside , then maybe go back if things improve or try to land a better job and stay there . 
  apparently it 's also not uncommon to get paid ` off the books ' to save on taxes - just like at home !, 
  in italy the classical ` victim ' for jokes is not really from an area , but from a profession : the carabiniere ( a member of a sort of police branch of the army ) , which is stereotypically considered a simpleton or straight dumb . 
  there are also several area stereotypes : * genoa/liguria area people are held to be extremely stingy with money * milanese people are snobs , somewhat racist and fixated with money * veneto people swear and drink a lot * tuscans swear a lot and are mostly socialists/communists * romans are rude and noisy * neapolitans are scammers/shady and generally love to turn any discussion into a major drama act * sicilians are ` touchy ' about ` honor ' , as in look at my girlfriend and i 'll knife you * sardinians are stubborn , tough , and ` love ' sheep . 
  in italy such episodes would be seen as examples of a tragically sad family . 
  granted , there are probably excesses in the opposite directions here , even if some behaviors are slowly decreasing . 
  some examples : many young people from the south move in northern cities to attend university . 
  this means finding a place to rent and starting to leave on their own and managing their own stuff . 
  well , you see entire families visiting apartments to ensure the kid is n't getting scammed . 
  then there are the care packages : big boxes of home-made food , including jars of pasta sauce and cakes , sent by mail every couple months . 
  if you by chance feel slightly sick you might have medicines and extra comfort food air dropped to your door ... also it 's very common to have phone calls with your parents almost every day , if only to say hello , and even if you 're in your 40 's with kids . 
  i think the trouble comes when you want to reach an advanced level and have to contend with all the irregular verbs and the dreaded conjunctive mode !, 
  italy has ` accademia della crusca ' , but they mostly concern themselves with grammar rules . 
  italians do n't really like to use words for new meanings , so they 'd rather adopt foreign words . 
  this also works in marketing , so you see all sorts of foreign words on products to make them seem cooler or better , as anything that comes from abroad can only be better than local . 
  ( this is valid for anything but food : with food anything vaguely foreign is only a ridiculous imitation ) . 
  as more people learn english , also , it 's becoming ` hip ' to stick english words or expressions in the middle of a sentence , i guess to show that you speak it , as it 's usually followed by `` as you 'd say in english '' . 
  i personally would like to throw them a dictionary in the face , but well ... 
  i can only guess ... 
  but a simple explanation could be this . 
  elections are coming very soon ( a few weeks ) and most of the vote will be split 4 ways : the left parties ( with a good lead , but maybe not enough for a clear majority in both houses , due to crappy law ) , the center party ( monti + various ` moderate ' and catholic people and some of the right wing that rejected berlusconi ) , berlusconi 's right ( which is basically berlusconi and his remote controlled drones ) and grillo 's party ( or the fuck them all party , proposing housewives as ministries and other crazy stuff ) . 
  berlusconi 's goal seems to be preventing a clear left-wing majority in the senate , so he can stall some laws and keep being influential . 
  monti rejected all of his alliance proposals , so he must now find other sources to gather some more votes , and he can only go further right . 
  so , maybe , such proclamations have a clear goal ... 
  i believe a recent poll has italy at 51 % support now . 
  same-sex couple adoption instead is much lower , like 20 % i think . 
  `` corrente '' in italian , where it 's also held responsible for all sorts of illnesses . 
  headache , sore throat , flu , cold ... they 're the minimum you 'll get if you expose yourself to the dreaded corrente . 
  i had an old lady shout at me in a bus when in sweltering heat i dared open a window in the back of the bus while she was sitting in the front . 
  `` do you want to kill me ? '', 
  bonus fact : yesterday was the final day to register candidates for the upcoming elections . 
  thanks to the screwed up electoral law this also means listing them in election order : voters do n't pick candidates , they just throw votes onto parties and candidates are elected in list order . 
  this means that there 's ** a lot ** of bickering , blackmailing and negotations between the candidates and the party leader , who prepares the lists . 
  given the climate of distrust towards politicians almost all parties started publicly claiming that * their * list would not have questionable individuals in them . 
  that is , no people with pending sentences/judgements or ongoing trials . 
  berlusconi is party leader and several of his party members have trials for mafia connections with imminent sentences . 
  they have fought hard to be put into the lists , as who 's elected gets trial immunity . 
  one of them was not put in the lists , as he 's considered really bad publicity . 
  he fucking ran away with the lists . 
  the party had to reconvene to sign them again . 
  i have no words . 
  tuscany is both the most left-leaning and least religious region in italy , together perhaps with emilia-romagna . 
  it 's also considered the blasphemous swearing capital , together maybe with veneto . 
  as for why i really have no idea . 
  the only thing that i can say is that historically it has been pretty independent from other states and nations ( as granducato di toscana ) , whereas northern and southern regions where often under foreign domination ( spain , france , austria and so on ) . 
  it was also the seat of the medici , who strongly encouraged art and science . 
  but i 'll leave any reasoning about that to someone more versed in history !, 
  that 's exactly the risk . 
  the senate seats are assigned according to a complex rule that depends on regional votes . 
  some of the largest regions tend to be more right leaning and/or lega holds , thus potentially earning lots of senate seats for berlusconi . 
  this would mean that the senate might not have a clear majority .

  are you assuming we do n't exist ? 
  & nbsp ;  [ ... ] their land used to be part of austria before it was given to italy after italy switched sides in wwii . 
  & nbsp ; south tyrol had already become italian in 1919 . 
  and for your information it was the austrians who had already gleefully invalidated , multiple times , their own * defensive * treaty ... first by pushing for a pre-emptive strike on italy ( 1908 ) , then by annexing bosnia without consideration for its allies ( 1908 again ) and finally by declaring war on serbia ( 1914 ) . 
  we had no obligation to join them . 
  that place was n't even among the reasons we 'd gone to war in the first place ; at versailles our government realised that trentino , one of the provinces the entente promised in the pact of london , had in fact a very precarious strategic position . 
  therefore italy needed higher mountains in order to ~ ~ build a wall and make austria pay for it ~ ~ have a more defensible border . 
  and in case you really meant ww2 - it was the allies themselves who , having seen through the bullshit the newly-formed austrian government was putting up , refused to take action in that regard essentially allowing both parties to resolve the issue amicably .

  by ` catholics ' i mean those christian parties which , despite the formal prohibition of the church - the various popes still being salty about the annexation of rome in 1870 - had nevertheless chosen to engage in italian politics . 
  apart from that , ours was mostly a catholic country with pockets of home-grown jewish and protestant ( like the waldensians ) communities scattered around . 
  basically the last step of the * risorgimento * after which most italians were finally united under the same flag and within the same kingdom , but a bloodbath nevertheless ; cadorna was a monster with a penchant for frontal assaults who used incredibly brutal methods ( decimation , barrier troops machine-gunning deserters ) to discipline his own and almost cost italy the war until somebody in parliament woke up , had him sacked and replaced with the much more humane - not to say competent - diaz in 1917 . 
  catholics and socialists opposed the war whereas many intellectuals pushed for intervention but they either regretted it or died in the trenches . 
  the world war in question later led to a bunch of other shenanigans such as the red biennium , the rise of fascism , etc. 
  almost every town has a plaque or memorial with the names of the fallen but apart from the vittoriano , rome does n't have a single monument ; rather , each [ ward ] ( https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-maurrx6clpa/vu07v7jboti/aaaaaaaacdi/avv8nk2coba/s1600/img_4327.jpg ) and [ district ] ( https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-qxwiocdmxcq/vyge4pjomdi/aaaaaaaaczw/lzobii4wrcu/s1600/img_5864.jpg ) has [ its ] ( http://www.festadenoantri.it/images/luoghi/targhe/caduti_i_guerra/targa_caduti_i_guerra-01.jpg ) [ own ] ( https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-skgmznhociu/vx1tvfv5j2i/aaaaaaaacs4/_e25cs3_lqi/s1600/img_5095.jpg ) [ memorial ] ( https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-ghyvgpa5jb4/vyophqc7sti/aaaaaaaaeis/zvnjeudwtzs77y7hhpravjmz4lhgl4bpqclcb/s1600/img_3632.jpg ) with the [ names ] ( https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-g8blsitme-y/vyrgqy03udi/aaaaaaaacx4/qay1la9xyoq/s1600/img_5812.jpg ) of the residents who lost their lives in the war . 
  there are also a few specific monuments lying around . 
  [ this one ] ( http://www.gdf.gov.it/multimedia/foto/anno-2014/giugno/deposizione-di-una-corona-di-alloro-al-monumento-al-finanziere/06.jpg/image_large ) for example is dedicated to the fallen from the guardia di finanza ; [ this one ] ( https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-q3runftnda4/vscw-bzsrzi/aaaaaaaadaw/h4lqpjuzroe/s1600/img_1504.jpg ) is dedicated to those from the army 's engineer corps ; [ this one ] ( https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-fimsa7esrpw/vu__jnq4evi/aaaaaaaads0/4a6i0los_h45cx7sm07uz4hqhytq3cvsg/s1600/img_2539.jpg ) is dedicated to the workers of the city 's electrical company . 
  yeah , but feyenoord fans did n't like them ... 
  huh !, 
  come think of it we used to have a poorly-photocopied , a5 format school pamphlet with terrible drawings and unfunny jokes every ... sometimes a year . 
  probably . 
  but then again we did n't have a gym or toilet paper so that does n't surprise me in the least . 
  not quite . 
  actually , st was n't among the lands promised with the pact of london ; it was only added in 1919 when the italian high command realised that newly-acquired trentino was hardly defensible , and needed the new border to be pushed as further north as possible not least because a line of fortifications - the [ alpine wall ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/alpine_wall ) , whose bunkers deserve a visit btw - was then being planned . 
  it was pretty much an afterthought in that regard . 
  wrong world war ( i 'm referring to the one which got a shiny new battlefield game ) . 
  this is more how you spot non-italians , though . 
  invicta backpacks . 
  uh-oh , i stand corrected !, 
  we surely would have been better off if he stuck with his teaching career anyway . 
  but sure , the years of lead were pretty shitty too ( not least because of all those cia shenanigans ) . 
  & nbsp ; there 's just too many parts of our history worth being angry over !, 
  especially anything from 1494-1870 and 1922-47 . 
  & nbsp ; * like every time a pope called foreign kings to invade and stomp all over the peninsula because he felt threatened or tried his damnedest best , by way of getting even more foreigners involved , to prevent italians from uniting ( lookin ' at you , pius ix ! ) . 
  * whenever we had the misfortune of being ~ ~ squeezed ~ ~ ruled by the spaniards ( thanks for helping turn the southern third of the peninsula into the economic powerhouse it is today ; and let 's not forget about those advanced social mores you imported ) , french ( when they were n't looting they were too busy spreading venereal diseases ) and austrians ( whose love for secret police , censorship , gratuitous repression , executions , discrimination and absurd tax rates endeared them to the locals ) . 
  * what about that traitor , wannabe-frenchman napoleon b ** u ** onaparte ( i , not iii - even though the other guy was n't blameless ) who invaded italy , turned against the revolutionaries who supported him , dismembered venice plc-style , gave northern italy away to the austrians and then looted the hell out of us so that the louvre could be well-stocked on masterpieces ? 
  * what about the bald idiot from ~ ~ emilia ~ ~ romagna who marched on rome and proceeded to send our country down the shitter at the cost of a few hundred thousand lives ? 
  this goes without mentioning : 1 ) the death of italian democracy ; 2 ) the creation of that meddling theocracy smack-bang in the middle of rome , thus reversing a century of risorgimento ; 3 ) the racial laws , the persecution of ` suspected ' homosexuals and other minorities ; 5 ) our participation to the holocaust ; 6 ) the regime 's [ war ] crimes ; 7 ) the nazi/allied occupation and civil war ; 8 ) the partition of italy 's borders with the humanitarian drama that followed ; 9 ) the fact that the same fascist cadres who brought italy to ruin in the first place were allowed to stay in power and retire peacefully as if they had rendered our country a great service . 
  no one was brought to trial . 
  collaborators even got pardoned in 1948 . 
  & nbsp ; tl ; dr - italians lost the war and paid for it ; the fascists pretty much did n't . 
  probably the roman one ; most of those who do n't hail from the capital seem to have an issue with it . 
  does n't help that the dialect itself can come across as un-belly-evably crass and rude ... 
  ca n't be worse than the italian ones !, 
  to sum it up with an old joke - `` the crisis is so bad , shopkeepers started treating customers properly !, 
  the old anthem i was referring to , the * canzone del piave * , has been the provisional anthem of the republic for a few months in 1946 before the current one was chosen . 
  it does n't have absolutely anything do with either fascism , fascists or the regime . 
  yeah , the royal march would indeed make more sense if we were still a monarchy but as far as the association with fascism goes it 's pretty null - the party 's anthem was in fact * giovinezza * and we 've had the march since 1831 . 
  not to mention the fact that we 've fought three wars of independence and two world wars since it was adopted so it 's fairly significant !, 
  by that logic germany 's current anthem , which predates the nazis by a long stretch , should also be changed because it was used by them . 
  why ? 
  last time i checked , we lost a world war . 
  then our post-war governments realised there was a shitload of money to be had so we officially ` lent ' those bases to the americans who , afaik , pay their rent and generally bring some monies into the local economy . 
  but as it turned out , citizens do n't quite like having foreign bases anywhere near their homes and some soldiers tend to be the kind of troublemakers with a less-than-stellar attitude . 
  also , [ shit like this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cavalese_cable_car_disaster_%281998%29 ) is another good reason for not wanting u.s. troops on our soil . 
  this goes without mentioning the blatant oil-grabbing in iraq , afghanistan , etc. 
  brb going to france to steal some women, 
  & nbsp ; there are too many things to list !, 
  wish i could share them all . 
  here 's a few personal favourites of mine : & nbsp ; * until 1889 the death penalty was enforced throughout italy save for tuscany , which had abolished it in 1783 . 
  * it was then scrapped in 1890 , reintroduced in 1931 , partly re-scrapped in 1948 and abolished for good in 1999 . 
  * the country got its very own version of hong kong with blackjack and hookers at [ tientsin ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/italian_concession_of_tientsin ) ( 1900-1946 ) . 
  * the last stand of the duke of aosta and his 6000-men-strong italian/somalian/eritrean garrison at the amba alagi , in which they managed to hold off some 41000 commonwealth troops during a two-month siege in april/may 1941 . 
  * amedeo guillet led a few thousand italian colonists [ in a guerrilla war ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/italian_guerrilla_war_in_ethiopia ) against the british and ethiopians . 
  * did you know ? 
  italy 's fascist-era civil ( 1942 ) and penal ( 1931 ) codes are still in force ; what 's even more surprising , so are most royal decrees despite the country having been a republic for some 70 years now . 
  those born in 1985 were the last cohort to be drafted afaik . 
  draft has been * suspended * in 2005 but still , most ( 30 + ) adults had to go through it . 
  being in the military does n't carry much prestige though it is certainly a cushy state job !, 
  do you guys worship the ladies at the dmv ? 
  soldiers are little more than civil servants in uniform here . 
  plus everyone and their dog has been conscripted at some point in their lives so ... no . 
  should 've specified `` here in italy '' ... in the 1990s serious proposals were made to replace it . 
  oh you 'd be surprised by how many people here would disagree . 
  i do n't have a preference in styles but i happen to really like russia 's !, 
  they 're just [ better ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=th-z6le3bha ) at propaganda . 
  as far as the current italian anthem is concerned , well ... it 's a pathetic tune better suited for a circus . 
  either we get the [ old one ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynqck2bozlm ) back , stick with the [ royal march ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxjfeodl8le ) or choose [ something ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ooyau0nurg0 ) [ else ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1jkhnocxgo ) . 
  anything is better than that unsingable piece of crap with operatic pretenses . 
  bonus points for the royal march not having words , thus sparing us the sight of footballers faking their way through the anthem . 
  & nbsp ;  a weird tradition that russians have is putting photos of the deceased on gravestones . 
  & nbsp ; huh ... to be honest that 's not weird at all , at least in my country . 
  99 % of gravestones have the deceased 's picture ( [ example ] ( https://encrypted-tbn3.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:and9gcs-tzneamy2ndrnntvxyeeq1kru4idywbd5vgn-femi_tl1ri9ffq ) ) , as well as a little space to put fresh flowers . 
  personally , i 'd be more inclined to put the blame on the italian government . 
  but it 's not like we were going to take those urns home anyway ...

  martyn myst\u00e9re is love, 
  alright , i 'll ask on r/outoftheloop, 
  american sports are actually very followed . 
  there are a lot of basketball fans that follow every year the nba , and also the nfl is followed but a big amount of people . 
  personally i like swimming so it happened that i watched the swimming trials . 
  hockey and baseball are not popular in italy , i think hockey is popular in northern europe but i 'm not sure , but the us is well seen in sports especially in basketball , i ca n't describe how many people walk around wearing a basket jersey . 
  it 's funny though that for a country as big as europe you ca n't form a strong football team , but you would probably beat us in a basketball game so that 's fine . 
  is it the same if i do that with training wheels on ? 
  we tend to support every sport , especially at the olympics , but the most followed are : 1 . 
  football ( soccer for you ) 2 . 
  basketball ( less than football but very followed ) that 's it , i would also add swimming , rugby , cycling and tennis but it all depends on people . 
  one thing is certain , everybody here loves football . 
  for an average italian the year is scheduled in this way : ** autumn : ** the serie a is starting ** winter : ** the serie a is started ** spring : ** the serie a is ending ** summer : ** * my team won , let 's celebrate !, 
  * my team lost , fuck it , it 's all about corruption * champions leauge !, 
  ( occasionally world cup and euro cup ) + football market is starting !, 
  ps : serie a is the italian football championship , cheers, 
  i prefer the less patriotic , hilarious ahah, 
  that 's interesting, 
  that 's a classic, 
  god , is this heaven ? 
  i did this when i answered on askreddit : http://i.imgur.com/fxr9i12.jpg, 
  you asked for it : * pizza , frittata * espresso , cassata * grissini , lasagne , rag\u00f9 * focaccia , ricotta , * and the panna cotta , * pandoro e tiramis\u00f9 * cannoli , bruschetta * and the cotoletta * parmigiano e canneloni * grissini , piadina * and the fiorentina , * torrone e maccheroni, 
  why ? 
  pff i do n't know , there 's a long list of things that are not available . 
  i had skittles for the first time in the uk and i loved them , but they do n't sell them in italy . 
  also you wo n't ever find brands like milky way , wonka , cheetos or hersheys . 
  although this the thing that makes me angry is the variety of oreos you have . 
  we only have the classic ones . 
  anyway we have nutella bread sticks so i am not completely desperate . 
  i immediately wanted a pizza after i wrote this, 
  no you are right , i think it 's the norm in southern europe, 
  that 's how it works in italy . 
  the limit is 18 even for beers but usually at shops they sell alcohol to underage people including vodka and gin . 
  it 's definitely not good , but it 's a common thing . 
  the majority of the times when kids want to buy alcohol they say : `` you are all eighteen right ? 
  yeah , of course '' without asking for id . 
  well maybe the second , or fourth considering macarons and cr\u00eapes, 
  i do n't know but i do n't think it 's true , i mean , wikipedia does n't talk about this, 
  the italian flag is derivated by the french flag after napoleon brought it in the peninsula . 
  then the blue got replaced by green because it was the colour of milanese soldiers uniforms . 
  then they gave this meaning to the flag : * green represents hope * white represents faith * red represents love it 's the only think i have to thank france to because i really like my flag, 
  i personally wo n't ever kiss someone in the cheek if it 's not a very close person . 
  we also shake hands obviously but for example nobody would kiss his teacher o work boss in the cheek , unless you have a certain type of relationship that makes it legit . 
  i understand a bit of sardinian language but i ca n't speak it , i have to say though that technically sardinian is not a dialect but a language , it 's the closest language to latin , even closer than italian that is the second one . 
  i also speak and understand a bit of `` sassarese '' that is the dialect spoken in northern sardinia in the city of sassari and it 's basically a mixture of corsican and sardinian . 
  i do n't know that much but when i talk to someone i usually say something in my dialect . 
  sardinian dialect is very strong because we tend to pronunciate consonants way harder than the other italian speakers , when i have been to milan they immediately understood where i came from . 
  also we tend to put verbs at the end of the sentences and that 's a thing i often do when i get angry and i let my dialectic spirit come alive , example : * ho mangiato una pizza ( i ate a pizza ) * italian * * una pizza ho mangiato ( a pizza i ate ) * sardinian *, 
  i just wash them with tap water, 
  wait , what ? 
  then search yung lean ( sweden ) , salmo ( italy ) , cro ( germany ) , supreme nmt ( france ) , sido ( germany ) , martoria ( germany ) , fabri fibra ( italy ) , marracash ( italy ) , mc soolar ( france ) , fedez ( italy ) , seeed ( germany ), 
  ~ ~ stockholm ? ~ ~ ~ ~ berlin ? ~ ~ ~ ~ oslo ? ~ ~ ~ ~ reykjavik ? ~ ~ spain ? 
  ~ ~ portugal ? ~ ~ ~ ~ italy ? ~ ~ ~ ~ france ? ~ ~ ~ ~ vienna ? ~ ~ we have a winner !, 
  ~ ~ stockholm ? ~ ~ ~ ~ berlin ? ~ ~ ~ ~ oslo ? ~ ~ ~ ~ reykjavik ? ~ ~ spain ? 
  portugal ? 
  ~ ~ italy ? ~ ~ ~ ~ france ? ~ ~ ~ ~ vienna ? ~ ~ it 's rainy in northern italy , rome and milan are n't sunny in november, 
  here it 's the normality , when you see a relative , after you said `` hi '' to them , you greet them by kissing them on both cheeks . 
  also girls usually say goodbye to boys by cheek kissing them . 
  you do n't do that to everyone just to very close people . 
  i honestly find more weird russians that greet people by kissing them on the lips although i think nobody does that now, 
  we are classy , bread with [ salami and fontina ( italian cheese ) ] ( http://www.manifestazionesanfioranese.com/content/sites/all/images/menu/panino-salame.jpg ) or ham and fontina . 
  these are the most common . 
  why do you think that ? 
  alright , where do i have to sign to go there ? 
  i 'm not used to this . 
  people go to work around 8/8 :30 , lunch is around 13/14 , and dinner is around 21/22 . 
  with two breaks at 11am and the other at 17/18 . 
  also beer , very good beer, 
  that 's basically how it works in italy too, 
  it depends , only english or even in another language ? 
  i mean what 's the best country for living , i 'm not talking about changing country just what 's the best place for a teen to live in, 
  also why have you dinner at 18pm ? 
  i usually have a snack at that time and then dinner later . 
  man , i have no clue . 
  it is a soft cheese that has a spicy flavour and i can confirm it is very very good but let 's be honest you wo n't ever find a cheese with bugs inside european supermarkets . 
  but if you want to try it , you wo n't regret it !, 
  it depends on the territory , some add ricotta , some add milk , some add chocolate , it changes throughout the country, 
  they are alive , that 's the problem ahah . 
  serious question , have you ever thought about sending the winner of x factor uk or of the voice to the eurovision ? 
  you would have won way more times , seriously you have very talented artists !, 
  [ emma marrone - la mia citt\u00e0 ] ( https://youtu.be/8w5zlalamv8 ) ( 2014 ) she even did not partecipate to fucking sanremo festival but rai thought she was perfect for the esc . 
  i honestly think she had way better songs than this one before joining the contest , however , they thought the song was good apparently . 
  she arrived 21st making it the worst result ever in the eurovision song contest for italy and gave us one of the most awkward perfomances ever , thank you emma !, 
  i think it 's made only in sardinia , that is basically the land of unusual foods in italy . 
  it 's very good , i can confirm, 
  same thing here especially for cheese and cold cuts, 
  well corsica and sardinia are very close to each other , they just speak different languages, 
  here , i do n't remember exactly how it 's made or how it 's called , we make cheese inside the goat 's stomach, 
  here we also have this thing called [ `` cordula '' ] ( http://www.sardegnaricette.it/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/img_2945.jpg ) made with lamb 's intestines and stomachs then laced together to form a big twist , then it is [ cooked around a spit ] ( https://sardegnaremix.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/000000012.jpg ) or [ cooked with tomato sause and peas ] ( http://www.ricettesardegna.it/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/cordula-piselli.jpg ) . 
  one of the best things we have here !, 
  well ... 
  i forgot about that ... we still cook everything though, 
  god that stargazey pie with the fish heads outside was strange ahah , i hope it tastes good at least . 
  oh yeah , i love sea urchins !, 
  they do n't know how delicious they are , where i live we put them in everything , spaghetti , pizza , bread ... 
  the only bad thing about them is that they are incredibly expensive, 
  raw fish is very good , anyway that must give you one of the worst breathe ever in your mouth ahah, 
  i had lamb 's head several times and i 've even eaten its brain so this does n't seem too weird to me, 
  here too we have blood sausage and it 's called [ sanguinaccio ] ( https://it.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/sanguinaccio_insaccato ) . 
  about the pig chips i 'm curious about them,

  you can always force them to pay to import their goods and services . 
  this is how tax where enforced before, 
  because they do n't care about you . 
  they care about the big money, 
  we where talking about castles not temples, 
  not if you do them right, 
  by walking up i expect you talking about using public transportation . 
  because actually walking there takes around 1 hour and a lot of sweat, 
  is the the initiatic well in regaleira ? 
  why not ? 
  close enougth but still not there, 
  finn are somewhat confortable close to each other if they are naked and the room is hot . 
  for unknown reason they call that kind of room a sauna, 
  you can keep your raindeer . 
  we have food over here . 
  / u/korplax the finnish doge, 
  we used it with a meaning . 
  not like this, 
  we can use our postal service so that the letter will be received sometime in the next century, 
  i think i need to refill the tank of my flametower . 
  it 's clear that many sweden are beyond salvation, 
  remove all form of ketchup from your kitchen before touching the all mighty pasta, 
  can / r/spain send the inquisition to sweden please ? 
  that 's because they do n't know how to taste food . 
  we are clearly the top dog when talking about food, 
  this is why this is a punishment for putting that ugly murican tomato based sauce on our glorious masterrace pasta, 
  i will close you in a tiny room with other people , and that room is not a sauna . 
  is this a war declaration ? 
  it 's not that hard . 
  she is over 90 but the ice keep her young forever ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ / s, 
  we have a deal, 
  yeah but now she have to show us that she 's able to master the making and the cooking of those spaghetti . 
  but then can the russian people read it without the font ? 
  like comic sans, 
  i 'm fine with it . 
  can we import some ? 
  we have good food, 
  can you keep two people in the same room without feeling awkward ? 
  your historical party are n't historical at all . 
  di you remember the fusion of forza italia in pdl ? 
  yeah it does n't even have 10 years . 
  it 's not a chicken vs egg story . 
  the answer is both . 
  in the last century nationals investment in the south has been more than the one in the north . 
  but the north had more total investment due to the private sector and for the regional investment . 
  in the south almost no private investment has been done and very little on the regional level . 
  we can give you the south of italy . 
  our economy will skyrocket, 
  wich was the opposite of what he said he would have done during the campaign to be secretary of his party, 
  because the referendum had nothing to do with economic stagnation, 
  not really . 
  but they are very populist . 
  the article the other reddittor posted is about somone that i think has been kicked out, 
  best case scenario . 
  nothing happen worst case scenario nothing happen . 
  more likely scenario . 
  another pm is elected in the pd and we go on or a technical government is elected until the new elections in a couple of years, 
  the north is very productive , i ca n't speak for the whole country but in milan you can see people making new companies and being business oriented all the time , events almost any week , and people pushing for more infrastructure . 
  in the south they are `` a lot more relaxed '' does n't want to take the initiative to change the things around them . 
  those who do after a while decide to move in the north where the different logic allow them to try with their idea . 
  how long have you stayed in both ? 
  because we tried for over 50 years to reduce inequalities , the problem is the difference of mentality between north and south . 
  in a place milan ( the biggest richest city of italy ) you can see a totally different logic from a place like naples or palermo . 
  in 2011 there was no 5 * your analisys is flawed . 
  also this is nothing compared to the crisis of 1993 . calling it the biggest crisis means that you have no idea of what you are talking about, 
  not really . 
  we voted towards having a system that allow the people to choose who represents them . 
  see , since the first berlusconi government they tried in many ways to make sure that people could n't elect directly the people , because this would put on faces that people trust and not the one they want to put ( the yes man ) . 
  nowdays they ( political party ) can elect who they want , but this referendum wanted to shove up the italian asses new rules to limit once again democracy attempting to sell us a system similar to the one in the us . 
  we answered with a big no . 
  nope , zero . 
  i do n't think . 
  he lost most of the credibility in the country . 
  very few people still support him . 
  but last time i tought it he won again so ... 
  `` i 'm not your friend '' - darkness, 
  he also wanted to change how the senate is elected and it would have ended in a fashion more similar to the us that what we have now . 
  the right wing was strongly against it because it would have made almost impossible for them to end in the government as things are now . 
  that 's the last 10 years . 
  also , sorry we do n't have a queen . 
  we are talking about brexiters and trumpers . 
  what else could you expect ? 
  he use of logic ? 
  sais the one called flappy boobs and no national flag, 
  like it is meant to be, 
  nope . 
  pandoro is winning every year . 
  like it is meant to be, 
  get out of europe you panettone lover . 
  oh , british flag . 
  take all the panettone before leaving , k thx bye . 
  you are welcome to join us on / r/italy and wear the proud flag of the supreme pandoro, 
  what did you say ?!?!?!?!?!, 
  team pandoro will win the christmas war , this year and all the years to come, 
  i 'm surprised that somebody is worse than us, 
  considering the number of people that upvoted it the question is , why ca n't you understand when a joke is a joke if you do n't like it ? 
  by making the north poor and the south rich ? 
  i 'm all against it ( i 'm fine with both rich tho ), 
  well ... from rome to naples i 've seen the worse driver in the peninsula . 
  but it 's like the rest of italy follow the rules , we are simply good at avoiding crashing against each other .

  in italy we have a thoery called of the `` mountain of shit '' . 
  it says that it is easier to shit than clean . 
   the holocaust is a joke , and the war was started by the uk and the jews . 
  it took me 10 seconds to type that . 
  but confuting what i said it 's going to take at least 5 minutes , which is 30x the time and effort it took me to write that . 
  i think that these rules looks a decent sets of guidelines for any decent society . 
  i ca n't think of a single case where one of those rules could cause problems to any civil guy . 
  the old lady in this post sent a letter to the president of the central council of jews in germany which said  i warn you . '' ... 
  `` if you continue as before , then a new pogrom could result , which would be horrific . '', 
  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/laws_against_holocaust_denial at the germany section  whosoever , in a manner capable of disturbing the public peace : [ ... ] assaults the human dignity of others by insulting , maliciously maligning an aforementioned group , segments of the population or individuals because of their belonging to one of the aforementioned groups shall be liable to imprisonment from three months to five years . 
  you can whatever opinion you want , it 's not illegal . 
  you can not , however , disturb public peace by : incite hatred against an ethnic or religious group or call for violent measures against them ; insult the dignity of others by insulting an aforementioned group ; publicly approve , nelittle or deny criminal acts ( listed under code of international criminal law ) commited during the nazi rule ; disturb the public peace in a manner that violates the dignity of the victims by approving of , glorifying , or justifying national socialist rule of arbitrary force ; disparage the memory of a deceased person . 
  believing that the holocaust is not real is n't a crime , but publicly saying it is a crime covered by these articles . 
  so in your fantasy land of free speech it should be ok to shout '' every people of this ethnicity should gtfo of my country because if they do n't they are gon na get lynched '' ? 
  it 's not about being weak , it 's about mantaining a decent degree of civility . 
  not everywhere in syria is wasteland of terror and despair , certain zones are pretty safe apart from forced recruitment and the occasional skirmish . 
  of course most of these people may have lost their home , or may be under a rule of extremist warlords . 
  older member of the family usually remain behind to help , and the journey to europe is more dangerous to a woman . 
  there you go , he was a native swedish . 
  if you 'd just have waited a few hours instead of ranting you would have saved face and time . 
  do you really think that you could build a tent camp for 20k people wuth a decent hygenic standards ? 
  that 's cattle like treatment , they would just run away and try their luck somewhere else , like the eu . 
  and good luck mantaining order in a camp with 20k people that just want to live in a decent way . 
  while beggars ca n't be choosers , i think that refugees should at least have clean water and a real roof on their heads . 
  what you 're suggesting is a prison camp . 
  this tragedy happened 5 hours ago or something like that . 
  instead of ranting about migrants and government , wait a second too see if the aggressor was n't a native . 
  a year to build 2.000 camps for 1.000 people each ? 
  and provide order food and healthcare/hygene ? 
  good luck with that . 
  to do something like that you would have to build camp of the dimension of cities , you 'd have to mantain order in them and be sure to not let the refugees escape . 
  it would take years to build something like that , if it is even possible , and it 'd have a huge risk of becoming a bunch kowloon cities . 
  the situation in sirya is going to last years . 
  while refugees have no right to jobs , you ca n't seriously expect that any country could host 20 % of their total population of jobless refugees living in containers , you would be creating slums of city-like dimension . 
  no country would accept that kind of deal , they 'd just say `` we ca n't host anymore people . 
  good luck '' and close the borders , or , even better , just ship them to eu . 
  as i said , people are crying that a 1-2 % of refugees in eu would wreck havoc on our economy and crime rates ... 
  ca n't you keep your mouth shut for a few hours ?? 
  this tragedy happened like 2 hours ago , at least wait a day before going full tinfoil mode . 
  you look as happy as a child eating his favorite dessert , ffs . 
  they have more than 10 % of refugees in lebanon and jordan , and 5 % in turkey ... how will they find jobs ? 
  healthcare ? 
  are you going to build entirely new towns to accomodate them ? 
  or sonething 20 % of a country population is going to be jobless and homeless ? 
  for a quick comparison , note jow people in this sub are saiyng that 1-2 % migrants in the whole eu will destroy healthcare and the job market ... 
  both lebanon and jordan are hosting respectively like 1 million and 600k siryan refugees , while their population are 5and 8 millions . 
  they are pretty full . 
  in turkey there are 2 millions refugees on a population of 78 million , but it 's still way more than any eu country . 
  sending money to those countries and help them better prepare against the crisis would have helped a lot , but still ot 's not like they could take in all the refugees . 
  you do n't even know if the aggressor is a migrant or a native ... 
  however those countries are already full of refugees and their camps are underfunded . 
  and how does that contradict any of my statements about siryan refugees ... ? 
  i 'm not talking about acceptance or red carpets . 
  these are facts , nothing more , nothing less . 
  statistics are easily found online , i took mine from the unhcr . 
  where are you living ? 
  i have never seen any main stream media suggesting something like that , and i 've never seen anyone believing that most refugees are women and children . 
  where i come from litterally everyone know that most refugees are males . 
  siryans do n't walk through spain or portugal , they are on the otger side of europe . 
  they do gowever come to italy and greece , and both of these conutries already feel the burden of heavy migration ( lesbo and lampedusa are good example ) and both of these countries would like to have someone that could help them . 
  if the other eu countries helped italy and greece at the beginning of the crisis , migrants could have been evenly and easily distributed across europe . 
  btw hungary has had an absurd amount of asylum requests in the last months , so a lot of refugees are just doing what you said , find the first decent country and settle down . 
  about eastern europe , migrants do n't want to stay there because these are poorer countries and quite frankly are n't exactly welcoming them , no one wants to live where you 'd be more heavily discriminated . 
  firs of all , this has nothing to do with any `` red carpet '' argument . 
  this is an answer to the question of why so many refugees are young males , something that gets repeated no-stop on this subreddit , like if it was such a great secret . 
  for the rest of your questions : refugees do n't stop at the first safe country they find because camps are overcrowded by refugees : jordan hosts over 600k siryan refugees with an 8 million native population , lebanon hosts 1 million and they only have had 5 million people in the country pre 2015 . 
  turkey hosts 2 million refugees on a population of 78 million , but that 's still way more than what any european country is doing . 
  this means that most refugees just went to the first safe zone they could find , but they are already full . 
  what would you like to give to your family , a temporary home in an overcrowded and underfunded refugee camp with no hope of finding a job , or would you try to reach europe ? 
  please keep in mind that not all of sirya is a permanent war zone : however most sides have mandatory recruitment . 
  http://data.unhcr.org/mediterranean/regional.php pretty much the same statistics , it 's a pretty well known fact , i fail to see how could these be hot news . 
  males also risk being forcibly recruited to fight in local conflicts . 
  16-30 males living in relatively safe zones risk to be forcibly recruited to fight . 
  they also leave their family behind because the journey as illegal migrants is really dangerous , `` risk of getting sold to human traffickers or die by dehydration or drown '' kind of dangerous . 
  to top it off , it also costs a lot of money . 
  then your unpopular opinion is n't `` most migrants are male '' but it is `` do n't let everyone in '' . 
  even the most pro-immigration activist will admit that most migrants ( most = 70 % , not 90 ) are young males . 
  saiying that most migrants are male has the same meaning of `` most migrants are dark skinned '' or have short hair , or are muslims , or are n't vegetarians . 
  it 's not ( or at least should n't ) be connected with being pro or anti migration . 
  still , i do n't think that anyone is going to call you a racist if you say that most migrants are male aged between 16 and 30 . 
  while photos and videos on the migrant crisis are more focused on children and women , yours is not an unpopular opinion ... of course that depends on how you say it . 
  most people usually just go saiying : `` most migrants are young males ! '', 
  and the answer usually is '' ... and so what ? 
  should we let them drown ? '', 
  also , there are quite a few of children and women , it 's not like they are the 2 % . 
  no idea where you live , here in italy and on reddit everyone knows that most migrants are males 16-30 ... ofc there are children and women among the migrants , but they have never been the majority . 
  i 've never seen anyone saying that most migrants are elderly , women and children ( although that depends on your definition of children , there are a lot of minors ) . 
  i do n't understand how your second opinion is impopular . 
  everyone knows that most refugees are young males , and that 's because 1 ) the trip is difficult and dangerous , young males usually go first and try to grant their families asylum rights 2 ) while their families can be pretty safe in certain zones , males can still get forcibly recruited to fight in civil wars . 
  either he held those views and he 's now free , or he did n't and acquired them while in prison , my was point was that if he went to sirya to fund isis or get trained by them he will probably be able to shoot or aid someone shooting some americans , westerners , or west-aided traitors . 
  in any case , the illegal detention and torture did more harm than good . 
  if he went to sirya to get trained as a terrorist and infiltrate himself in some western country . 
  or maybe he 's just happy to kill every western-backed faction in sirya . 
  i was making an asumption . 
  either he did n't likei it , or he just wanted to show the prince the original palazzo , i have no idea . 
  one thing i can say that if the prince gets offended by dick marbles he would have had a cardiac arrest in palazzo vecchio . 
  that statue is an exhibit but hardly the main one . 
  the building is quite big and every room is decorated with marbles and frescoes , the koons statue is hardly the main thing in there . 
  here you can see something from the museum : https://www.google.com/culturalinstitute/collection/palazzo-vecchio-museum?projectid=art-project&amp;hl=it, 
  do i really have to say it again ?

  do i even want to know ? 
  they sell it in italy , too , usually to make pastries because it 's just faster . 
  carrefour does n't , either . 
  hell you can chose the eggs you want . 
  generally , the eggs in the refrigerators are there because strictly `` we do n't have space to put them anywhere else '' reasons , usually in smaller supermarkets, 
  in italy , you get taxed on illicit gains , too . 
  no , that would be completely irrelevant . 
  if anything , it would help by forcing a common standard everywhere , therefore making the south more interesting, 
  the only way ecj could give way to unilateral revoke of art50 is by introducing the `` if it 's not explicitly forbidden , it 's legal '' loophole in the eu laws . 
  which would annihilate eu in a very short time because everybody and their mother would try to abuse it . 
  therefore it 's extremely unlikely they 'd ever do that . 
   i hate football . 
   good riddance !, 
  iirc ecj is historically more a `` if the law gives an way and does n't gives other options , there that 's the only way '', 
  eu had no problem ignoring a not binding referendum . 
  eu can not ignore the official explicit request of the government head asking to get out of eu using article50, 
  italy does n't have an universal minimum wage , but most jobs have national collective contracts which define the minimum for the involved categories . 
  we tried to keep gheddafi alive as long as possible , actually . 
  tipped him about a few attempts on his life over the years , among other things . 
  libyans at last gave us the permission . 
  you 're right . 
  ** fans with the scapers and greetings at sea . 
  `` with italy we do not cooperate '' ** * the role of an undercover agent embarked on with save the children . 
  shadows on the libyan coast guard . 
  an activist : `` volunteers 10 thousand euros '' * by grazia longo rome the 147 pages of the iuventa preventive seizure decree , signed by the emanuele cersosimo gip , are the mirror of their collaboration with traffickers of humans - from which they took migrants instead of intervening only in cases of danger - , their poor collaboration with the italian coast guard and the hostility towards the italian maritime rescue coordination center , confirmed by the placard `` fuck imrcc '' placed in the bow . 
  but the intercepts also represent an alarm bell on the `` interests '' of ngos and the complicity of the libyan coast guard . 
  the iuvventa crew helped the skeptics bring back the inflatable boats in order to be able to use them again : `` the iuventa operators have allowed not to locate subjects near the border with libyan territorial waters to recover three boats used by migrants to leave them coasts , one of which will certainly be re-used next june 26 for a new landing . '', 
  a photo immortalizes the `` two wooden boats of traffickers previously linked with a top of the iuventa operators . '', 
  the photographic sequence is unmistakable : `` at first they met in international waters with libyan traffickers on their boats , so they returned momentarily to the iuventa motorboat ( while the libyan traffickers headed for libyan waters again ) , and lastly , they met again with the libyan traffickers who this time flew a boat with aboard migrants who were then transferred to the iuventa motorboat . '', 
  the retrieval of migrants , in agreement with the traffickers , also took place `` at 1.3 miles off the libyan coast '' . 
  scoopists and operators of the eng say hello to being photographed by the police officer infiltrated on a nearby boat . 
  and one of the operators of save the children , intercepted by the police to verify the genuineness of their complaints , said : `` if you take the stuff from them , it means that there is a complicity between you and them , understand ? 
  that is , she goes to pick them up , bring them to you and bring them back . '', 
  the agreement was so strong that on june 26 last year at 17 o'clock on the stern tree of the german ngo jugend rettet , `` the libyan flag was hoisted . '', 
  iron-strong the unwillingness to dock in italian ports `` even made full diesel fuel to malta , but did not come close to italy . '', 
  the lack of cooperation with the italian coastguard also emerges from the words of a woman from iuventa , monitored by the investigative ear , who said that she and her co-workers would not `` provide photographic video material to the police relief and image of subjects conducting migrant ships as they could be arrested . '', 
  and always the same woman talking to a collaborator , referring to another ngo , mentions a complicity with the libyan coast guard . 
  he says , `` they work with the libyan coast guard on board or with them . '', 
  the interlocutor wondered , `` with the libyan coast guard ? '', 
  and she : `` yes , there was cooperation for something ... ( incomprehensible sentence ) '' . 
  from the interceptions of the two collaborators of `` save the children '' , it is then shown love for the gain of some ngos . 
  one asks one another : `` what were your strange things you saw ? '', 
  and he replies : `` first of all , the fact that they were paid so much , the fact that they made these pictures ... '' . 
  the friend asks : `` because of them , why did they expect them to be paid as you say ? '', 
  surprisingly , the answer : `` well , yes , that is ... the one who does the volunteer who gets 10,000 euros seems to me ... '' lapidary , in a subsequent interview between the two young people , judgment on another ngo . 
  `` type those others , those there . 
  those who were bandits of the sea were not rescuers of the sea , eh ? 
  those were really banned !, 
  that is , that was really scandalous ... they made them dead more than they did with their own boats . '', 
  and on all the `` real rendez vous between iuventa operators and alleged scapers aimed at the delivery of some migrants . '', 
  the traffickers , the judge writes , `` after having had a conversation with the operators of the iuventa , they went away aboard their own boat , making a gesture of greeting to the ship . 
  you do realize we are talking about military activities on foreign soil do n't you ? 
  except the other is supported by russia and france ( because france wants the oil italy is getting ), 
  the main problem is libya , not eu . 
  as long as the political situation in libya is n't stable enough to actually let a foreign military work in their waters , there is n't much to do . 
  breaking news !, 
  liquid water is wet !, 
  it has always been just a political issue . 
   she says they fill a vacuum left by priests reluctant to do the job : the `` church has , for too long , neglected exorcisms , despite strong demand from the public '' , she says . 
  well , duh . 
  99 % of the requests are for psychological and psychiatric issues , they do n't require exorcism but medical doctors . 
  of course if there are people drowning right in front of them they must go help them . 
  half of the rules are just to give a specific framing , many times the ngos were accused to meet with the migrant ships even when they were still well and floating, 
   this seems completely useless . 
  so the ships can still get 5 or 12 miles from the shore , then wait for the sos call , and then they can enter as far as they want . 
  no , they must coordinate with the libyan coast guard , too , which means they can not enter libyan waters unless they get ok 'd by libya also they must , whenever asked ( read : always ) , get italian coast guards agents on board , and keep the transponder always active . 
  why do you think we kept him alive so long ? 
  the law already says that . 
  he also said brething is good for your health ? 
  wait , we 're talking about brexit , the obvious is most likely obscure to them , so good idea !, 
  i 'm just saying using switzerland a example of `` doing well without eu '' for uk is not really honest due the massive differences between the two situations, 
  cute europa doing cute europa things . 
  art by milo manara . 
  the fact switzerland spent decades to reach this point , and is currently seen as the perfect example of what not do with nonmembers by the eu . 
  we did n't kill everybody back then because it would end with a giant-ass mess . 
  sadly , the current long-running smaller messes are much better then a full-on civil war it would have been . 
  it 's going to be france 's alitalia , is n't it ? 
  priests are n't necessarily male . 
  it depends on the religion . 
  do you even forza nuova ? 
  you quite obviously know nothing of italian politics . 
  yes they 'd prefer their knowhow in chinese hands than in italians, 
  it 's sadly not irrelevant , but we know well it would just fuel the neo-fascists instead of curb anything . 
  homeschooling in italy is extremely uncommon for a number of reason . 
  but most parents will cave and vaccinate because it 's just more bothersome to do n't . 
  homeschooling means money and effort , most anti-vax parents are n't rich in at least one . 
  and given homeschooled children still have to take yearly exams in public schools to make sure they are , in fact , schooled , it 's quite possible they 'll be forbidden entry in the exam unless they are vaccinated . 
  and yes , there are exceptions for medical reasons, 
  if one wants to stall , there are endless way to do it while looking legit : most of the time the difference between `` stalling '' and `` preparing thoroughly '' is only in the intent . 
  no doubt the leadership does n't want to stall . 
  they did n't even tried to prepare , though , which make them look a band of fools, 
  yeah , that 's why everybody thinks brits are complete morons . 
   the blocking factor is not a legal one , but a political one : after having had a leave referendum , how can a government politically manage to ignore it ? 
  at very least by buying time `` studying the situation and the social-economical consequences of acting on the result '' then , if there has been an election that lets the new government ignore it , by buying more time `` laying down the groundwork and the preparing the legal framework necessary to make the transition as seamless and painless as possible '' and then if the whole thing is still politically relevant , having another referendum to make sure people still think they want out . 
  not less than 10 years of work and nothing done , italian style . 
  perfectly acceptable because everything used to gain time is actually necessary and would have been done even with the full political will of the governments . 
  applicable to any consultative referendum without breaking any rule , law or constitution article . 
  various nations like denmark , nordic nations , belgium , switzerland ... generally speaking , anything except italy, 
  great , that means the country of the ship . 
  because by law , ships in international waters are part of the country they have the flag,

it 's happening a bit everywhere , not only in portugal . 
  dont forget about that sweet sweet welfare we 're giving them . 
  just to be clear . 
  i m not complaining about athens not having a piazza navona or baroque architecture . 
  athens went from being basically a village to a modern metropolis in the arc of a few decades . 
  i m complaining about the ugliness of the buildings that they built to house all these people . 
  according to my foreing friends we 're all southerners here in italy . 
  i m talking about proper cities . 
  syros and hania i 'd put in the island category . 
  nafplio is very pretty indeed , maybe the only pretty city in the peloponnese . 
  it 's funny how when things like that happen the left is always surprised . 
  we do n't really have beautiful cities in greece . 
  we have great nature , a lot of beautiful islands and mountain villages but the cities feel . . i dont know , as if they dont have an identity . 
  you see a picture and it could be athens but it could also be belgrade . 
  we need to invent a time machine , go back in time , find the father of the guy who designed the first shitty polykatoikia and kick him in the nuts , really really hard . 
  and then go kill hitler or something . 
  i grew up in an isnignificant little town near corinth ( not a wonderful sight either ) and often went to athens , mostly on daily trips . 
  for me and my friends it was awesome - malls , cinemas , fast food chains ( yeah , we didnt have any of those in my town ) - but as a city it still felt pretty decadent and ugly . 
  then , when i was 18 i had to stay there for two months and i absolutely hated it . 
  it happens in most touristy places of southern europe . 
   oosterhout lem me check where that is . 
  oh , the netherlands !, 
  it sounded danish . 
  well , i grew up in a small seaside town in greece and now i live in a big italian city . 
  there are pros and cons for both but in turin i definitely have more stuff to do . 
  i live in turin , the situation is definitely better here . 
  yeah , traffic . 
  it was soooooo bad :d, 
  i ve always found it pretty dirty and the architecture is horrendous , gray blocks for as far as the eye can see . 
  sure , there are little ( or bigger ) gems here and there ( churches , neoclassic buildings etc ) but the overall image i have about athens isnt that great . 
  you can say a lot of things , that it has charm , character etc but i never liked it esthetically . 
  it has been quite a bit of time since i visited rome , i still remember the chaos . 
  still , do n't get fooled by the italian flag , i was born and raised near athens and i stand by what i said . 
  the video is nice but in my opinion athens is far from beautiful . 
  if i 'm not mistaken some time ago there was a fire in a warehouse where chinese workers were working andit resulted in a lot of dead people because the doors were closed and the windows barred . 
  he probably means the belgian terrorist responsible for the paris attacks . 
  i think there was pizza involved in his arrest as well . 
  worst superhero ever . 
  something tells me i 'll be paying for them as well . 
  it 's going to take a lot of time . 
  gallons of it . 
  it 's pretty hard but i 'm sure someone will find a way ... and he 'll also add that it 's really the west 's fault for not giving the murder a better house and more benefits in the first place . 
  our ancestors were imperialists and we sell firearms ---------  we need to maintain masses of uncultured subhumans with our welfare ? 
  yes , people 's documents are controlled in the italian-french border . 
  travelled there a couple of weeks ago on a bus , they stopped it , took our passports/id cards and in the end 3 africans and one romanian werent allowed entry to france . 
  true , i feel bad for belgium being considered a terrorist training ground because it 's actually very pretty country and both those cities you mentioned are absolute jewels ( agree about brussels ) . 
  i agree with you - and i 'm not even sure it 's a conspiracy-fetish either . 
  they 're perfectly fine with doing nothing while getting paid . 
  which of course would be a lot of people 's ideal life , until you realize that it only takes you that far and that if you want to live better you have to get off your ass . 
  i 've seen unemployed moroccans here in italy complain about free housing . 
  seriously ? 
  what do you want ? 
  a central condo ? 
  they dont care . 
  western retards pay . 
  sending 4 kids to school ? 
  western retards will pay . 
  healthcare ? 
  it 's free , let the western retards pay . 
  and they 're still busting our balls . 
  racism , islamophobia , `` our rights '' ... and the western retards who pay for them have to feel bad about it too ? 
  what an edgy 20 year old hipster this pope is !, 
  you forgot that sweet sweet welfare . 
  third word lazy-asses realized that in europe you can actually do jack shit and get paid . 
  me too . 
  `` march against fear cancelled because organizers are scared '' would be a perfect onion article . 
  as far as italy is concerned , some of the mosques arent even official . 
  it 's just a big room or a garage with a self-professed imam . 
  go have a tartiflette instead of taking pictures of dicktrees you savage !, 
  dude , dont even bother talking to the lefties . 
  these people have no perception of reality , they have no idea that there 's a war . 
  it 's all `` open borders '' and `` give more rights to immigrants '' for them , they dont care for anything else . 
  writing comments instead of exploding in an airport makes him approximately 100000 times better than a terrorist , you deluded leftie . 
  holy shit man , i live in italy and almost every moroccan i have talked to ( not too many , i admit ) seems to have a cousin or a sister with some kind of health problem living in belgium and getting welfare . 
  no , mostly for choosing to remain gypsies . 
  rumors and word of mouth , yes , that come mostly from the smugglers.they have all the interest in the world to describe europe as the place where refugees will be getting welfare , houses etc. 
  they only have to reach lampedusa after all , which is significantly closer to africa than people think . 
  we have a lot of romanian gypsies here but i also see some proper romanians that are just illiterate or barely educated . 
  maybe they come from rural areas of something . 
  i will never understand the romanians . 
  the ones we have here are either kind and incredibly hard working people or homeless illiterate alcoholics/criminals . 
  nothing in between . 
  `` open the borders '' because aziz says so . 
  ffs . . 
  beard consultant ? 
  anarchists and communists do it all the time . 
  literally `` good appetite '' . 
  it 's school material where i come from . 
  hmm . . that 's xactly what someone who works for soros would say ... 
  anarchists ... they 'll do anything to avoid getting a proper job , wont they ? 
  the outer space ones or the hollow earth ones ? 
  thanks for clarifying . 
  i checked the online deifinitions too , most of them seem to think the two terms are the same . 
  tbh it was a recent article . 
  i just cant remember the goddamn place they were brought into but my scottish friend implied that even the locals would probably prefer to move to somewhere else , 
  yes , i guess it 's not really used as a term in english . 
  it 's the same as illiterate . 
  being italian i went straight for the english version of the italian word `` analfabeta '' . 
  i didnt drop any bomb and i didnt push any agenda . 
  i m sorry if i offended your prickish self righteousness .

  i also got propositioned by a u.s. army general ... 
  so do we , so do we !, 
  :-) glad we got our differences sorted out . 
  have a nice evening . 
  wheter it is debatable , this is not for us to establish . 
  that 's the deal we got handed , whether we like it or not , so if you still want to take revenge on the rest of us italians for whatever one of our grandparents might have done to one of yours , i encourage you to read the findings of the slovenian-italian cultural-historical commission ... and pray - better yet , make it so - that neither you or i or our families have to go through such horrors ever again . 
  never again . 
  & nbsp ; u/quirite over and out . 
  & nbsp ;  i mean you kinda did lose a war ... & nbsp ; yessir , damn right we did - and paid for it dearly , in case you did n't notice !, 
  ( just not the actual fascists but that 's another story . 
  you can thank the cold war for that ) . 
  & nbsp ;  [ ... ] also all villages around the city were majority slovene . 
  so italians might not be majoritly in the land . 
  & nbsp ; this is true , but then how would you handle such a situation in a way that does n't involve throwing innocent civilians down a sinkhole and telling the others to pack their shit if they do n't want to get the same treatment ? 
  how could anybody claim with a straight face to be any better than the fascists you so rightly despise ? 
  do two wrongs make a right ? 
  if so , when does it end ? 
  where do you draw the line ? 
  this line of logic is scary and , frankly , fucked up . 
  by those standards so was ceding capodistria , portorose , and a whole bunch of other towns to yugoslavia - but i hardly see anyone getting worked over it apart from my grandparents . 
  why are we having this discussion , again ? 
  i might also argue that trieste has been , for most of its history , a city with an italian majority * as well as * a very consistent slovene presence . 
  tell me - why should my family not live there and consider themselves italian ? 
  why should they , or the other inhabitants for that matter , become slovenian ? 
  just because you guys are butthurt ? 
  have we really learned nothing from history ? 
  i was referring to both periods . 
  besides ... 
  i do n't consider the period from 1919-47 an occupation but i can see why a croat , or a slovene , would regard it as such . 
  it is a very delicate topic to which i also happen to have a very personal , familiar connection . 
  istria was/is fairly significant to our history not just because of its venetian past but also because - to put it mildly - a friggin ' world war was fought for the sake of it . 
  a world war whose shenanigans led us to fascism , then another world conflict followed by more humanitarian tragedies and associated trauma * for all parties involved * ( gonars , arbe , the holocaust , the * foibe * , the istrian exodus , you name it ) which somehow leads us to the very kind of basket-case nationalist dick-waving hysteria you can see in the comments above . 
  and yes , it 's [ current year ] . 
  if that is n't significant then i do n't know what it is !, 
  seems like you 're not the only one ... 
  the sack ( s ) of rome ? 
  the gothic wars ? 
  the italian wars ? 
  the war of the mantuan succession ? 
  do n't put yourself down ... you 're second to none when it comes to it , i can assure you . 
  i 'd rather not . 
  unless you 're up for some genocide olympics ? 
  i hear it 's a popular pastime on both sides of the border ... 
  * istria ( and zara , which is in dalmatia ) . 
  no other words needed . 
  * corsica was never part of italy but the genoese , being the stingy bastards they are , sold it to the french . 
  * nice used to be italian until 1860 , then we gave it to the french in exchange for military assistance to unite the rest of the peninsula ; the ligurian inhabitants were promptly expelled and garibaldi was understandably not pleased . 
  then there 's briga and tenda and the sham referendum but now we 're talking about hamlets . 
  * i 'd also add savoy but it was so irrelevant no one 's ever given a fuck about it - not even the king . 
  i mean , he supported bourbon royalists during the revolutions of 1799 and had [ francesco caracciolo ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/francesco_caracciolo#trial_and_execution ) hung from the mast of one of his ships . 
  not exactly the nicest of guys , at least if you get to see him from our side of history . 
  `` attractive '' and `` strong '' traits give you 40 points when interacting with characters of the opposite sex . 
  however , if you 're `` brawny '' or `` gregarious '' you only get 5 ... 
  it 's tor bella monaca , a slice of medellin just past the ringroad . 
  he is actually fairly good with money ... his own , that is . 
  it 's the son who 's a terrible boss and is driving daddy 's empire to the ground . 
  thankfully , berlusconi did not have a nuclear arsenal at his disposal !, 
  or he would 've gotten the rest of us very , very tanned in no time . 
  well , i 've seen a serbian film once . 
  but only once . 
  `` political correctness '' is very much not an italian thing , i 'm afraid . 
  any hint of pc usually gets mercilessly mocked by italians who , as a rule of thumb , tend to make fun of everyone and anything . 
  and i really mean * anything * . 
  in all fairness we do have a couple of politicians ( boldrini , kyenge ) who tried to open a `` serious '' debate on political correctness , and look how it ended up . 
  boy what a cheeky bunch we are !, 
  and the mockery gets amped 100x whenever politicians are involved ... 
  nope . 
  i mean - here in rome we have something that might ( somewhat remotely ) classify as such but it 's a former housing estate full with druggies , hookers and thugs . 
  plus it 's so far out in the boonies not even romans have any reason to go there or stumble on it by accident . 
  there are unsavoury neghbourhoods in naples and palermo but that 's pretty much it . 
  besides , in every single one of those cases da mooslims are not involved so ... 
  i do n't think most people know anything past the first couple of verses . 
  it 's a long-ass slog of an anthem . 
  & nbsp ;  also does hearing your anthem give you some specific feelings ? 
  & nbsp ; yes , it 's called `` second-hand embarrassment '' . 
  please bring back the royal march , or at least something cooler than that damn circus tune , so that 1 ) no one has to sing it and 2 ) i do n't have to suffer through the sight of football players trying to maintain a dignified appearance while pretending not to have forgotten the lyrics on live tv . 
  buffon always tries so hard , it 's painful . 
  for the same reason you do n't remember about that guy who blew himself and a few other people up in baghdad ... 
  well ... huh ... no . 
  at least not to the same extent as the u.s. . our * carabinieri * do , in fact , road-checks with submachine guns - and they can be somewhat trigger-happy at times . 
  but the few times `` that '' happens it becomes national news . 
  in the past ( 1940s-1970s ) however we * did * have an issue with rampant [ banditism ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/salvatore_giuliano ) , [ kidnappings ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sardinian_banditry ) , [ terrorism ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/years_of_lead_ ( italy ) , mafia shootings , bombings and whatnot so this kind of things used to be a relatively common occurence of daily life . 
  thank god we live in such enlightened times . 
  shamelessly plagiarising my own answer from another thread , here 's a few reasons as to why 2016 may not be all shit : & nbsp ; 1 ) the new [ general data protection regulation ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/general_data_protection_regulation ) was approved . 
  2 ) an eu court struck down the uk [ snooper 's charter ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/law/2016/dec/21/eus-highest-court-delivers-blow-to-uk-snoopers-charter ) and [ other data retention programmes ] ( https://www.accessnow.org/victory-eu-court-rules-indiscriminate-data-retention-not-permissible/ ) . 
  3 ) that same court [ ruled ] ( https://web.archive.org/web/20161027225130/http://arstechnica.co.uk/tech-policy/2016/10/eu-dynamic-static-ip-personal-data/ ) that dynamic ip addresses constitute personally identifiable information . 
  4 ) the eu passed a very important directive on net neutrality ; it 's not perfect , granted , but it 's good . 
  5 ) italy finally recognised civil unions , and it was fun to see the crypto-fascist scum in parliament getting triggered !, 
  6 ) matteo renzi got kicked out of office and the mayor of rome seems eager to follow his footsteps ( hopefully ) . 
  7 ) duuude we were , like , * this * close from actually legalising weed !, 
  better luck next time . 
  8 ) at least we 're a little step closer to viable nuclear fusion tech ?

  of all the italian writers - whom i largely despise - gabriele d'annunzio definitely resonates with me the most ; and he 's nowadays very much underrated , almost forgotten as an author . 
  never understood the appeal of writers like calvino , montale ... they seem to be famous just because our school curriculum and the intelligentsia wanted them to be . 
  hate dante and his bullshit with a passion . 
  i would also include giacomo casanova , even though he chose to write in french . 
  his memories are very good . 
  as far as foreign authors are concerned , i like some of joseph conrad 's works ( heart of darkness , an outpost of progress ) as well as stieg larsson ( the millennium trilogy ) .

  they honored the dead and made a good face in front of the world and still sue the ones who broke our law and survived . 
  smart move , letta . 
  what the lybians start to put holes on their ships ? 
  i would never give such order to my men . 
  they will be escorted to the african mainland with our ships , and the lybians wo n't dare to shoot . 
  once we leave the vessel on the land whatever . 
  and if we 're denied access to lybian territory , the lybians will have to care for them . 
  and if they deny we 'll just play the caesar/vercengetorix game . 
  and if the lybians decide to put holes in the boats the blood is on their hands . 
  and you are right . 
  this situation is far more serious than the gallic wars and we must find a way to end it . 
   the dead have been posthumously awarded italian citizenship , while the survivors have been charged with illegal immigration . 
  only in italy folks . 
  i confiscated the vessle . 
  and you know if they continue to try it 's madness . 
  einstein said that a mad person is whoever does the same thing all over again , fails and continues . 
  after they fail every time , eventually they 'll stop . 
  besides escorting them back would be much cheaper than the food , accomodations and money we give them anyways . 
  meh that 's what you get for having spineless politicians . 
  may be the most ffective but i do n't like it . 
  escorting them back to africa would work as well . 
  i doubt that . 
  the name has been in the top 5 or 10 for a long time . 
  i know plenty of francescos . 
  as i said i 'd rather escort them back to the african mainland . 
  then maybe the lybian wo n't accept them and this reminds me of a story . 
  you see julius caesar had the city of aleysia under siege . 
  the rebel against roman rule , vercengetorix , tried to use a weapon-the fact that the romans may have hearts , so he sent all of the old people , women and children ( anyone unfit to fight ) out of the city . 
  caesar had built a wooden wall around the city to help the siege . 
  the gaulic women and children reached caesar 's wall . 
  vercengetorix hoped that he would a ) save them due to caesar 's assumed compassion and b ) spare himself resources . 
  but caesar was a smart man . 
  so he did n't let them pass . 
  and they wandered between the romans and the gauls for a few days . 
  untill vercengetorix broke . 
  he could n't take it . 
  so after many of the people who were supposed to escape died vercengetorix took them back . 
  now , can you guess who eventually won the battle ? 
  the heartless romans or the gauls ? 
  you know the `` learn from history '' thing . 
  well might as well do it . 
  i ** do not ** want to kill them . 
  i just want them not to come here . 
  at which we 're going to respond by just escorting them out of our waters , so they 'll consider being clever . 
  a.k.a chicken soup . 
  as it should be . 
  well it will change something . 
  it will reduce rapidly the number of imigrants we 're getting and that 's all i care for . 
  where did i say lybia should take people not from lybia . 
  since they departed from lybia we get them out of our territory . 
  lybia is free to do the same . 
  escorting them back to afrcan shore and confiscating the vessle would work though . 
  no , i would rather mean the whole political `` elite '' . 
  not just him . 
  he is just an example , and the most famous one , of what italy 's politicians and bureucrats are like . 
  he has become the nominatvive for them all . 
  the whole problem is that italy was very unlucky . 
  it had the worst possble leaders in the worst possible time . 
  i 'll go as far as to say that people like berlusconi are the sole reason behind italy 's problems . 
  but then again , who 's fault is it that people elect him ? 
  it will help us because unlike the us we are separated by sea . 
  we can put guard on every shore of the island , not so easy to guard . 
  plus some boeats to go around . 
  it 's much much easier to guard than the us borders . 
  eventually they will learn that traspassing the sea is n't a good idea . 
  best thing is the us ca n't bitch about human rights because they do the exact same thing . 
  jewish is not a race , it 's an ethnicity . 
  is chopping off parts of the penis covered by the health care institutions ? 
   circumcision gained rapid popularity in western countries for varying reasons . 
  no it did n't . 
  oh yeah i forgot the fear and insecurity . 
  next is were you not hugged as a child and sometimes , were you abused . 
  still no argument though . 
  and we are ? 
  how dare you not allow cutting bodily parts from babies . 
  you are all a bunch of nazis ( especially the germans ) today you ban circumcision , tomorrow you put auschwitz back to work . 
  of course . 
  the typical liberal `` i feel sorry for you '' or `` you 're so ignorant '' or `` you 're a bigot '' presenting absolutely no argument and yet living in the deep belief you 're enlightened about the world , and how fluffy the world is and how butterflies fly around and everyone loves each other , and the only problem are evil people like me . 
  because in your little world things like rape or murder are products of social inequality . 
  right ? 
  of course some people lost it . 
  you see when you buy a house , you work on it . 
  you paint it , you clean it , you buy furniture . 
  when you inhabit a country , you work on it . 
  you make infrastructure and social structures . 
  so what is the difference between a random stranger coming to your house and starting to use your rooms and a bunch of immigrants coming to your land , starting t use what you already made . 
  i 'm all for some kinds of immigration . 
  if some will come here and be a valuable contribution to society-a rocket scientist or a doctor , or a magistrat , or whatever i will be the first one to put the red carpet under his feet . 
  but not someone who comes here to do a useless job and often not even pay taxes . 
  as far as to abuse the social system and commit crimes against the same people that accepted him into this society . 
  and sadly , most of immigrants do n't become like the very few described in the former paragraph . 
  of course not . 
  but . 
  italians have been here for long enough to create our own culture in this place : long enough to call it home . 
  because the mountains and seas of italy are mixed with italian blood and the land on the fields are soaked with italian sweat . 
  because from the alpes to sicily wherever legnano is every man has the heart and the hand made for this land . 
  yeah . 
  same goes for , you know , everyone . 
  norwegians did that , brits , germans . 
  italians as well .

  of course , that because the wages in most countries ( including mine ) are shit . 
  you ca n't really consume if you produce but you get shit in return . 
  also , immigration + unenployment only contributes to more `` competition '' . 
  which means even lower wages . 
   the war was not defensive hence they would not be part of it and stay neutral . 
  and how 's that `` changing sides '' ? 
  we were not bound to austria-hungray ( which was our historical enemy , btw ) , the `` alliance '' was merely a defensive pact . 
  a defensive pact that was stipulated to spite france when they invaded tunisia . 
  besides , you are forgetting the plans from conrad von hotzendorf of a preventive strike on us way before ww1 and the fact that neither germany nor austria-hungary informed us of their war plans . 
   in wwii italy under musolini was allied with hitlers germany but ended up switching sides as well . 
  you are also forgetting that it was germany who invaded us , and started killing civilians ( not that the allies were better in that regard ) . 
  resistance was but a natural consequence of it . 
  [ resistance that was formed by civilians ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/four_days_of_naples ) you are also forgetting that we were on the losing side of the paris treaties , that we lost the colonies , istria which went to jugoslavia and two villages which went to france , plus monetary reparation . 
  as such , `` changing side '' is an insulting simplyfication . 
  expecially when it 's made to mock our grandfathers , which is something i ca n't stand . 
   we do need immigration no , we need jobs . 
   realistically the less have it , the better . 
  the better for france and murica , you mean . 
  that is not true . 
   but around ww2 when mussolini put many libyans in concentration camps it was before ww2 , between 1922-1932 . 
  and not against the `` lybians '' in general , but against the senussi and the tripolitianians rebels . 
  it begins . 
  they look better with the sun . 
  mah i 've seen worse in italy . 
  the dead trees also make the entire image look bad , i guess in summer it is a bit better . 
   long vacations , early retirements , constant over borrowing and a general unwillingness to address and correct the problems that your own country has created themselves that is your real problem lol wtf, 
  so the solution is for greece to become a german colony ? 
  what is that ? 
  ussr is not communist , for christ sake . 
  diplomatic immunity should involve actions done in the ambit of diplomacy and politics ... and road accidents are hardly a diplomatic action . 
  let 's just say that trash talk is a bit different from physical assault . 
  he was not liked , but i was talking more about the moment france committed suicide . 
  best moment in football . 
  you mean byzantinians ? 
  lol she 's a schiappa . 
  lol , wtf , they build a fence at the italo-austrian border . 
   can you ~ ~ right ~ ~ write something in my language ? . . 
  fixed . 
  no , i 'm implying that the women are n't there because they are qualified , but because they have a vagina . 
  which is exactly what happen when you have quotas , because there is no competition between men and women . 
   that 's assuming somehow the women chosen are less qualified . 
  yes , of course . 
  it 's a fucking legit assumption since they did not compete against men , but only against other women . 
  it does n't , but it matters when you have quotas that force you to chose women that are there not because they are better than men ( which does not mean that they are worse ) but because they have a vagina . 
   we should expect representation on average and over the long term to be 50/50 . 
  why ? 
  if there are more qualified women , you should n't have 50-50 representation . 
   my assumption is that society ca n't be represented well by an assembly with 75 % of men . 
  and a society ca n't be represented well by an assembly 100 % rich and privileged . 
   so why not just pick people that better represent the population ? 
  and this is not a bullshit argument ? 
  if you want to make the parliament to represent the population , a good chunk of it should be poor . 
  besides , a man can represent a woman , and viceversa . 
  gender parity is bullshit . 
  you should n't make gender distinctions in the public aministrations ( and in the workplace in general ) , you should hire the most qualified people . 
  gender parity means equal treatment , rights and opportunity , and not 50-50 representation . 
  it 's the l law . 
  w-we do n't talk about that . 
  ehm ... no . 
  u20 competitions have little to no relevance . 
  no one really care about them . 
  [ greek ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/magna_graecia ), 
  and there was a need to give a name to this behavior ? 
  bad manners is enough . 
  he was canadian . 
  do n't be silly . 
  yeah , no . 
  that is actually what you are doing with palestinians . 
   some of those regressive ass regimes we have in the union nowadays wat, 
  odeh !, 
   what would happen if germany had called article 5 in 1966 ? 
  nothing . 
  germany existed back then as a buffer state . 
  the americans and the brits would have bomb the entire country and reduce it to ashes if it was needed to stop a possible russian invasion . 
  without a second thought . 
  well , the sanctions from the international community played a role in the scarcity of raw materials . 
  mussolini at first said to hitler he need to wait at least until 1943 to be ready for a war , but then he saw how he crushed poland , and decided to enter to war on his side betting on a quick german victory to strip some land from france . 
  we did . 
   i 'd rename english to european and use it for this purpose no . 
  we do n't . 
  we call it repubblica ceca . 
   you do n't have to go back to work in the afternoon during the week ? 
  yes , during the week , not on sunday . 
  no one drinks if you have to go back to work in the afternoon . 
   you must be alcoholic , jobless or on holiday if you dring wine to your dinner at noon here during the week . 
  so you are alcoholic if you drink during your launch but you are cool if you drink for the sake of getting wasted at night . 
  this makes no fucking sense . 
  how ? 
  if they start to arrest you and throw you in prison , your only solution to continue the `` revoltuion '' is to take up arms . 
  if you are few , you will be labelled as terroristsm if you are many , you will be rebels . 
  in any case the escalation of violence will be up to you . 
  quite a few , actually . 
  one of them targeting venice , it was also published here or r/europe . 
  have you people already forgotten it ? 
  and fuck it , i 'm jinxing ( ??? ), 
  it now . 
  to create your own country you need institutions . 
  either you need to create them from scratch , or they are already there but under the control of a superior institution . 
  so , to reach independence you need the superior government to agree to lose power and sovereignity over a part of its territory . 
  it 's unlikely this will ever happen in spain , as in france and italy .

  it 's up to you guys choosing whether you wan na keep east germany or not . 
  there 're still croatia , hungary , romania , greece and austria easter than us . 
  '' polish culture '' ahaha, 
  i honestly do n't even really consider poland '' european '' . 
  it 's that just the slavic culture in general it 's not even barely similar to the latin or germanic ones . 
  yes i do : ,, 
  also , commas exist, 
  exactly, 
  i know , i know , but if they keep acting like this chances are they 'll be attacked by either russia or china or both of them . 
  or they 'll find a casus belli to start a war . 
  what the fuck are you talking about ? 
  our armies are well maintained and we have enough supplies . 
  considering their average iq , themselves . 
  you say that our armies are at best mediocre but the european armies/navies/airforces beat the shit out of americans pretty much every year the the military games . 
  but yes we should dissolve nato because i do n't want to be dragged into a war because of america 's need to be in perpetual war . 
  firstly , it might taste extremely sweet to you because , considering you 're probably american , you ate the whole jar while drinking ( diet ) coke and sniffing sugar . 
  we usually spread a thin layer on a piece of white bread , but degustibus non disputandum est. 
  secondly , we do n't eat peanut butter because we are not a bunch of bloody elephants . 
  if you have any more questions please feel free to ask . 
  ahahahahahahahahahahaha i love you, 
  considering the new laws that just passed , it 's pretty much legal here now . 
  actually because your country does n't let in any immigrant that does n't study , have a job or that is there for vacation . 
  sadly yes, 
  said slovenia eh ... 
  he said '' warm weather and beaches '' . 
  it depends whether you want to have a city or a small town life . 
  probably the south of italy , like puglia or sicily . 
  great food , gorgeous women and beaches , and it 's cheaper than most of europe . 
  and at the same time you get to live in a country that is richer and not as fucked up as greece , croatia or spain . 
  also italians understand spanish and english . 
  i think it 's a great idea !, 
  i 'm not from milan but i do n't live far from there and i 've been several times there . 
  milan is way better than florence ( less dirty , full of models , more stuff to do , bigger , ... ) , there are some of the best discos in the country , hell maybe in europe . 
  it is very beautiful at night and pretty much wherever you go ( as long as you stay in the city centre ) you 're gon na find discos/pubs , etc. . . 
  i doubt there are any coffee houses open at that time tho and generally they 're not a thing here . 
  unless you go to the very shitty suburbs you wo n't have any problems , there 's a very low criminality here . 
  good luck !, 
  so ... nowhere ? 
  * sigh *, 
  word . 
  probably london . 
  every city that has more than 100 thousands inhabitants surely has a ( usually posh/intellectual ) cinema that shows films in their original language with the local language subtitles . 
  you may not be able to find it right away , but i 'm sure there are . 
  truth is , it 's not an european problem , it 's a greek problem . 
  greece needs to adapt itself to a modern world . 
  appetizer 5e , pasta 14e , coke 2.50 e , coffee 1e . 
  20-30 euros, 
  when i wrote long texts in italian i sometimes make this kind of mistakes . 
  but in the spoken language , probably never . 
  i 'm glad to hear it 's not a common thing . 
  true fucking story , germans on vacations on the adriatic coast . 
  you should be arrested for doing something like that . 
  yes, 
  oh , so when talking about such a precise and defined cultural area as stereotypes my personal experience is worthless because not extensive enough . 
  got that !, 
  i 'm calling bullshit on the punctuality , i had 3 german friends in my life and they were always late . 
  while me , the italian , was always there 10 minutes earlier . 
  wearing sandals with white socks and eating spaghetti with jam . 
  yes . 
  europe is much more beautiful during the summer , and you can swim in the sea and sunbathe . 
  during winter most of europe is so cold and grey it gets kinda depressing sometimes . 
  but i doubt you can really enjoy more than 2-3 cities in one month . 
  and if there are any they 're not positive . 
  is this for real ? 
  i think that the only reason that the middle east is getting such media coverage is because of the fact that the countries in that region have huge amounts of oil . 
  this is also the cause of the problems in the area . 
  israel 's actions since its creation classify it as a warpig and the international community ( or at least the eu ) should cease every economic and diplomatic relation with it . 
  the people are fine , there 's a visible lack of education , but that is related to each country 's economical situation . 
  i 've seen naziskins wear tshirts and jeans . 
  personal experience vs people 's thoughts . 
  if you 're a guy most people will think you 're a naziskin . 
  even here in england it 's the same thing . 
  but if you go for slightly longer hair nobody will notice . 
  if you want to really enjoy rome and do n't just do tourist shit , get lost . 
  seriously , start walking and do n't stop until you 're lost , that 's how you find the best restaurants and them most peculiar attractions/places . 
  wait for the americans to bomb every city . 
  eventually die . 
  it 's unusual , like seeing someone wearing a pijama in the street . 
  i 'm more likely to avoid them because i believe people who are religious are less keen on deepen into their thoughts , but that 's just me . 
  i mean i have some religious friends , but still . 
  i 'm in my 20s and it has always been weird to find someone that was actually religious . 
  most people our age say they 're agnostic or atheist . 
  those who say they are most of the times do n't even practice . 
  the only people you see in church are either old people or families that want to look perfect . 
  well , it 's very hard to say . 
  america is all kinda the same compared to europe , so there 's always gon na be a country that is better at something than the us . 
  for example , as an italian , i 'd say that the american government is better organised , but a swedish for example might not agree on this . 
  surely not american express . 
  mastercard never let me down once . 
  is n't netherlands extremely poor compared to the other two states ? 
  they 're fucking dumb, 
  no because you 're 6 million people country , like a german , italian or french region and your military pretty much does n't exist . 
  i did n't include the uk because it 's so bloody weird and puts a lot of effort in not integrating with the rest of the eu . 
  compared to the big 4 absolutely , by an objective point of view . 
  no proper europe it 's 7 countries : france , germany , italy , netherlands , sweden , belgium and spain . 
  the others either do n't want to have anything to do with europe , are irrelevant , too eastern or weird . 
  outsiders . 
  france , italy . 
  sorry compatrioti . 
  girls are not as easy as they are in the us or in australia ( except for the uk ) .

  if i may ask , why are you considering italy , as an australian ( apart from your italian anc estry , i guess ? 
  the main issue here is not getting a job , but getting a decent one . 
  the problem with italy is that the most prosperous areas are extremely expensive compared to the wages they offer ( high-end consultant job are hellish and they do n't pay well at all for the first 5-10 years ) . 
  1500k are n't remotely enough to live where i am . 
  there are people with great careers ( there 's lot of rich people after all ) , but it 's really hard to get to that point , while australia is on a complete different level if you are a skilled worker . 
  moving abroad is a choice of personal dignity . 
  one does n't study so much ( because italian stem faculties are extremely and senselessly hard and punishing ) only to get offended by their ridicolous wages . 
  i 'm definitely gon na give a chance to my country and city , but i 'm ready to depart for better economical enviroments should i feel unconfortable . 
  just looking at the salaries my parents had makes me blush . 
  i do n't know of unemployed stem people ( we get job offers even before graduation here in milan ) . 
  most likely your friend was from the south and did n't even consider bad paid job . 
  i guess it 's the old gold mini jobs ( basically unemployment doping ) , like always . 
  i guess there 's a valid reason you do n't find drunk people dragging themselves around the major italian ( and south-european ) cities at 12am like you do in \u00c5rhus or aalborg . 
  i suppose it involves being able to spend more quality time with your beloved ones even if your monthly income is n't great , or perhaps having stronger bonds with the place and the context you 're born in . 
  but ehy surveys say denmark is the happiest european country , that must be true . 
  only if you are a stem & economics graduate you are 100 % certain to find a job ( in the north ) in a very short amount of time . 
  actually in spain and italy very few people go to university , compared to other countries . 
  even in spain and greece , regardless to what they say , it 's very uncommon ( i 've been there on vacation and did n't manage to find one ) , while i 've yet to find ( or hear of ) a single home/hotel without the beloved bidet here . 
  it may surprise you , but camorra does n't control every single thing . 
  we are well equipped against mafias . 
  someone is gon na buy them anyway, 
  it 's completely free here . 
  most of the museums are free for under18 ( in my city , at least ), 
  do n't trust too much economical data coming from high-evasion economies . 
  for example , some of the richest italian categories are often propertyless according to official data . 
  those are some unfortunate ( and very uncommon ) consequences of a specific disease ( there 's no generic `` cancer '' ) . 
  some people actually die of fever : you would n't never say that fever kills people . 
  certain kinds of cancer do affect your vision ( e.g. 
  the cerebral ones ) , most do n't . 
  i hope your mother gets the best treatments out there . 
  you deserve nothing more . 
  it does . 
  we have everyday examples . 
  some tumors have higher chances of coming back , some disappear completely . 
  you 're considered `` cured '' ( by the chemo ) after 5 years ( which is not randomly chosen : it 's proven that you basically get back to normality after a certain period ; some people are unfortunately prone to host cancer because of genetics , this is a problem you can not address with medicine right now ) of `` cancer inactivity '' . 
  also some recently found and used drugs ( i 've mentioned one before , it 's not the only one ) specifically kill cancer cells . 
  you get it partially wrong . 
  first , chemotherapy ( combined with other specific drugs , e.g. 
  rituximab ) work . 
  it 's not 100 % effective , but nowadays a great variety of cancer can be cured with little to no consequences in the long term . 
  we still are n't able to properly fight the most wicked ones . 
  second , cancer is basically a genetic disease . 
  there 's no way to avoid it by eating rare plants or practicing sports ( i 'm not talking to you specifically ) , you can improve your diet but you 're still gon na get it if you 're destined to . 
  still your advices are gold because an early-stage cancer is way easier to best than an advanced one . 
  according to the official datas , jewellers in south italy ( even in the north ) earn significantly less than a part time working student . 
  this is what you get when your knowledge of a certain country is based on forcedly standardized datas . 
  nobody can prevent you from thinking that italian hotel managers are sensibly poorer than they own employers ( this happens in the whole country , actually ) , but this may be not correspond to reality ( this is why the south , while not rich , is n't as remotely poor as they say ), 
  i think italy 's performance on dropouts is biased . 
  i was in a class of 30 people in my first year of high school . 
  we were reduced to a mere 16 a couple of years later - that is because you do n't simply change courses : you have to change institute ( therefore drop from one ) if you want to pursue a different educational path . 
  basilicata is n't poor ( it 's the only place in italy where they found oil !!, 
  ) , just irrelevant . 
  i wish this were true . 
  in milan that 's the ( average ) price for a peripheral apartment . 
  average wages are too low compared to the cost of living . 
  this is the sole reason . 
  why should a person live in england , germany , sweden or similar when you have everything ( food of immense variety and quality , infinite different landscapes , friendly people ) ? 
  it 's not the unemployment . 
  unless you are very poor , every educated person gets a job , but it often does n't allow you to live properly . 
  you work a lot more and receive less than your swiss colleague . 
  does it make sense , when you 're a skilled person ? 
  i am not sure whether an `` exitaly '' could really hit their interests , but they are not able to influence a vast majority of italian people . 
  also , they 're not killing politicians and/or civilians anymore . 
  they would attract too much attention ( the killing spree in 90s turned out pretty detrimental to them , very strict countermeasures were taken ) . 
  italian government is very serious about mafia hunting . 
  italy is not ruled by camorra . 
  let me state it clearly : mafia does n't exist in sardinia . 
  i 'm not joking . 
  you were simply unlucky . 
  a sudden change of prize of a similar extent would have make me ( and everyone , since salaries are still the same ) significantly richer . 
  it did n't happen , unfortunately . 
  i some bigger cities ( torino , milano , bologna ) you have excellent and cheap internet . 
  i 've got a 500 mbit/s now . 
  they are really pushing the internet right now . 
  lots of rural places in the north have the 100 mbit/s . 
   does n't need to observe the mean to know where it is . 
  how delirious . 
  italy is still a top exporter : you do n't achieve that by relying on `` cheap labour '' . 
  on the contrary , the backbone of italy 's industry are the high skilled manifacturers - not exactly something china can compete on . 
  most of the bigger industries have already delocalized their factories in turkey or similar places ( lower wages , acceptable standards ) , and that 's pretty much what has happened in every country . 
  we do have problems , we do suffer from a frequent lack of modernization and massive `` balkanization '' of our industry , our taxes are high and our justice is slow , but i do n't want to discuss the corruption topic . 
  it 's utterly false ( just specious propaganda ) . 
  in milan and rome you ca n't even rent a small one-bedroom apartment ( you can , actually , but it 's mostly outside the city ) with 800 euros , let alone the monthly costs of living . 
  i do n't know where you have extracted those statistics . 
  furthermore i do n't know anyone who earns that wage ( 800 euros ) , it would be impossible to live here . 
  the south is much less expensive but the bigger cities are n't . 
  pizza has never costed 10 euros . 
  it did ( in milan , lake of como etc. 
  ) , more specifically , but it costs as much as ( or a little bit more ) before pretty much everywhere . 
  the gypsies thing is also a bullshit . 
  actually it 's more like : north european women : beautiful women other south european women : beautiful women east european women : beautiful women ( who like money ) . 
  uk/irish women : beautiful women . 
  turkish women : beautiful women . 
  italian women : overrated, 
  it 's a private operator . 
  often `` private '' equals `` shitty '' in the south . 
  it surprised me too . 
  because of symbolism . 
  they did try different capitals , but no one could compete with the scary church centre ( back to when the pope was more influencial ) . 
  both my parents had the financial status to support a couple of children , yet they did n't have a single one until their late 40s .

thanks for the explanation , i need to read more about it . 
  well supporting russia sometimes means going against the us , and god knows how much the left wing love going against the states , at least in italy . 
  btw , did n't a referendum in spain show support for nato membership ? 
  i understand you are trying to explain their pov but you are just backing up what op said , that russia does n't see baltic countries as independent sovereign states . 
  and especially relations with estonia after 1991 do n't seems too friendly to me . 
  the real point is , baltic countries see russia as a threat to their security , and that 's all russian fault , not nato . 
  you ca n't blame them if they try to defend themselves . 
  imagine you own a mall , a couple of the shops inside your mall decide to quit and open their shops outside your mall . 
  so using unfair competition you keep bullying them , they do n't accept it anymore and not wanting to keep relations with you they ask to join this the giant supermarket chain that will defend them and treat them better . 
  so maybe , on your next directors meeting you should discuss why your shops choose the competition . 
  i almost cried when o'driscoll retired . 
  we ciao !, 
  yep ... 
  even if in the city it 's not so common , i actually think a big city like rome or milan have more homicides than reggio calabria . 
  it 's just the countryside that it 's totally fucked up , at least they are mostly mafia related and it 's just them dying and not `` good people . '', 
  source : i live there , just at the end of italy . 
  we are no so much dependent on russian gas , yesterday in chat i posted this link that cover the subject pretty well : http://www.eprg.group.cam.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/binder13.pdf, 
  cheap for sweden , right ? 
  not italy . 
  in italy a pint goes around 4,5 $ , even if there are stupid places that seel them for 6 $ . 
  btw , what is the deal with sweden and alchool ? 
  i 've been to stockholm and the alchool was really expensive . 
  i also dont ' know if they have different standard for coktails or i just went to shitty places , everytime i ordered one in a club i had to ask to make it double just to get an amount close to the one we drink in italy . 
  not a real crime but a bit of `` trivia '' maybe . 
  there was a terrible earthquake in south italy in 1908 and a lot of foreign military ships in the area approached to help . 
  some of them were imperial russian navy ship , they helped a lot as a first response unit , and the russian captain , trying to stop thieves from stealing stuff , set up some quick tribunal and execution system . 
  unfortunately , with the language issue and all , some of the people who got executed were just citizens trying to retrieve stuff from their destroyed houses . 
  [ yep , shit like this happen .

  until it stays alone he does n't have any chances , 25 % is a bit accomplishment but it 's not worth anything if a different faction formed by 3 or 4 parties get the 40 % for example . 
  it 's been decades , probably , that the country is governed by many parties together , a single party ca n't get enough votes to rule . 
  grillo ? 
  if he keeps staying alone he does n't have any chance thank god . 
  point is , i do n't think he wants to win the election , it 's easy to stay on the opposition but it would be a political suicide to governate . 
  his party is a populistic one , so he just does n't care , yesterday immigration was n't a big problem for the people and he did n't care , now it is and he jumped on the wagon . 
  at the same time he needs to give something to the right wing and to the left wing of his party . 
  for example , he voted to abolish the crime of illegal immigration some time ago , but now he is yelling against the immigration . 
  it 's just a populistic clown with a shady buddy behind him . 
  silvio was pure shit , but it was probably 10 times better than this clown . 
  it just show you how bad we have it here .

  yes you are right , i actually counted those populist parties because many neo fascist switched to vote for them . 
  you are also right on the second sentence , they are surfing that wave and that wave come from the financial crisis , when there are no jobs and people have financial problems , many start blaming the `` others '' . 
  such a shame . 
  we always had a little neofascist movement since the birth of the republic , unfortunately it is getting bigger because of the financial and immigration crisis . 
  i 'm sure it will lose strenght once , and if , the crisis ends .

  instead of complaing about reddit , you should look up the definition of genocide and stop acting like this is some sort of football match and you are rooting for a team . 
  thank you , good luck with that !, 
  for russian language are you following a `` real '' or an online course ? 
  i ask because i want to learn russian too . 
  well i 'm kinda like you , i prefer the cold , but something like the snow in the city would be completely new for me !, 
  thank you i really appreciated !, 
  i 'm gon na contact you if i have more questions , thank you again !, 
  nope mate , i 'm italian , north european languages are almost impossible for me . 
  :p even a shitty job in a kitchen would do it for me if it give me the possibility to study . 
  yes , that is really perfect !, 
  the only requirement for me would be to work at least 12hrs a week , it would n't be hard to find a job in a pub/restaurant i guess !, 
  thank you !, 
  meh , i ate in milan a couple of times , the food is n't that tasty there . 
  * * i do n't really think what i just said , but i 'm from south italy , i 'm forced too criticize the food of the other italian regions , especially the northern regions , by a contract signed when i was born . 
  well not so cheap then , at least compared to italy . 
  that 's the range in north italy too . 
  well man , do n't know what to say , thank you so much , really !, 
  i had no idea something like that existed , that could help me a lot !, 
  wow , that is nice !, 
  food does n't scare me , i like to try new things and i can cook , what scares me the most is the cold , i live in the deep south , we usually do n't even go under 10 \u00b0 thank you all guys for your help , i really appreciate it !, 
  that would be nice , i guess is merit based on the grades right ? 
  i worked during the university , that did n't help with my grades at all unfortunately . 
  thanks , i would like to study political science , i see there is a faculty there !, 
  yeah , living in a flat is my dream !, 
  right now my choice are : italy : close to home , only some university taxes . 
  baltic states : got ta pay the university for the master degree but it should be cheap . 
  poland : same as above . 
  denmark : university is cheap but cost of living is way to high . 
  i come from the deep south , no idea how i would resist in the cold , but we will see !, 
  edit : also , germany !, 
  well yeah , that would be awesome but probably too expensive for a student . 
  alright , thank you so much !, 
  i guess life is cheaper outside warsaw , right ? 
  thank you for your replies !, 
  thanks !, 
  i read that is doable to live with 500/600 $ monthly , rent included , is that right ? 
  i 'm thinking about going to study there , suggestions ? 
  price of life ? 
  cost of the university ? 
  [ he knows how to play rugby too ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yspb0vg87s ), 
  it 's not always easy as it looks , the way sleeper cells work it 's really complicated and most of the time really hard to discover when done right . 
  for example , it could have been that the men involved did n't even know each other until the day of the attack or a couple of days before . 
  or maybe they knew each other but the cell has been asleep for years , it could be that the guy passing with the migrants flow was bringing the order and the last part of the plan , if it was like this it would have been impossible to discover an oral command coming from the middle east . 
  some units may be asleep , than they will be contacted for some support and go to sleep again , not even knowing what plan they are supporting . 
  also the cost of the weapons etc was n't probably so high , and even if it was noticed who knows how long those weapons were stashed on european soil , probably lost years ago in the huge mess that the black market is . 
  if who was known disapperead just before the attack it would have been almost impossible to link all together and preven the attack with such short notice . 
  or maybe the national security just fucked up eh , it could be , just trying to say that it 's not easy as it sounds . 
  yeah exactly . 
  i 'm in madrid and while is a huge capital that should n't have nothing in common with my little southern italian city , i still fell at home . 
  oh yeah , in my dialect we also have some words that are close to spanish/catal \u00e1n !, 
  exactly like italy .

  i 'm not saying they should n't but it 's all nice until something is done to us . 
  i also think the cartoon is really bad but i personally do n't care that much , it 's just an ugly cartoon . 
  i think it 's not even related to the victims , more to the corruption that still exists in italy . 
  they have the right to say it sucks , but they still have the right to do it . 
  i do n't want to defend them but here there are tons of people who express `` their opinion '' based on what the majority says , some always cry wolf without thinking and follow the mass . 
  one day they are in favor of freedom of speech , one day not , one day they are pro-immigration , one day not . 
  that 's it . 
  edit : you keep downvoting me while i 'm not doing it to you , i just express my opinion, 
  i just reported what 's happening . 
  anyway , the accusation is referred to those people who first have defended them , stating everybody can express their opinion by using satire , and then they get mad because they make satire about us . 
  so it 's fine about the others but not about us . 
  that 's not how freedom of speech works . 
  the image is provocative and shows that we as a country should do more to avoid these tragedies because this wo n't be the only earthquake that will ever happen in italy , and also , many buildings that were rebuilt according to our laws to avoid the seismic risk fell down during the cataclysm . 
  in the end , the image is really ugly . 
  the french journal has dedicated a cartoon to the italian quake and many people got mad about it on facebook during the all day . 
  the image is obviously provocative and many people started complaining about it calling it bad and inopportune . 
  on the other side , many others are now accusing these people of being contradictory because , after the terrorist attack in france , a big number of italians had `` je suis charlie '' as a profile pic and everybody was defending it . 
  `` amatrice '' mayor has recently blasted it : http://www.ansa.it/english/news/2016/09/02/quake-amatrice-mayor-blasts-charlie-hebdo-cartoon-rpt_4e9baa5b-9c48-4726-a94d-ffb87e8cdbbb.html, 
  yes , it 's that . 
  it 's provocative rather than funny .

  honestly reading because someone says you must do that makes reading even worse . 
  i 'd prefer that teachers instead of imposing a book they gave a list and then everyone chooses his favourite , at least it would be less boring . 
  i read `` animal farm '' by george orwell and i liked it more than some books i had to read for school . 
  that does n't surprise me , i 'm the first that does n't like reading,

  good translation, 
  the fun fact is the nobody really wants to stay here . 
  they use italy as a harbour to go to france , germany or sweden . 
  actually , they consider it `` an american creation '' , but i personally love it ahah, 
  what about our beautiful [ leader ? 
  italy is probably one of the most beautiful places in europe but i 'm in love with scandinavia . 
  i like pineapple pizza and i put mayo on my chips pizza .

  it looks like a big mess of everything , also , the bacon looks very raw . 
  not shocked about the ketchup on pizza , if not used to replace tomato sauce , many people do that do , especially if the pizza has chips on . 
  i hope at least it was n't that bad compared to its look . 
  they do n't even know at this point, 
  ** translation ** * sudanese and italian authorities are working together to tackle the migrant crisis . 
  some 48 people in ventimiglia have been deported as human rights organisations protest against the move . 
  the migrants , who were hoping to cross the italian border into france , were flown to the sudanese capital of khartoum on a chartered egyptair flight . 
  * in a bid to avoid protesters expecting the flight to leave from milan malpensa airport , the migrants were actually flown from turin-caselle , an airport over an hour away . 
  the deportation , the first of its kind in italy , has been met with outrage . 
  speaking to local media , protesters said : `` we knew well two of the guys that were on that plane . '', 
  `` until yesterday they were in the red cross centre , they felt safe and they were preparing everything to ask for asylum . '', 
  * italian officials are yet to comment on the deportation . 
  alessandra ballerini , a lawyer in caritas ventimiglia and expert in immigration law , said : `` this is a mass deportation to a country where fundamental rights are violated and where their lives are in danger . 
  `` with this operation , our country becomes an accomplice . '', 
  in 2015 , 60 per cent of sudanese asylum seekers were granted humanitarian protection in italy . 
  * but sudan and italy signed an agreement earlier this month to work together on migration and border control issues . 
  a team of sudanese officials have been sent to the italian-french border to identify migrants to be repatriated . 
  amnesty international says human rights abuses have taken place during conflicts in sudan . 
  president omar hassan ahmad al-bashir is wanted for war crimes and crimes against humanity . 
  * amnesty international said : `` the authorities repressed the media , civil society organisations and opposition political parties , severely curtailing freedoms of expression , association and assembly . 
  `` armed conflict in darfur , south kordofan and blue nile states continued to cause mass displacement and civilian casualties ; human rights abuses were perpetrated by all parties to these conflicts . 
  `` government forces destroyed civilian buildings , including schools , hospitals and clinics in conflict areas , and obstructed humanitarian access to civilians needing support because of the ongoing hostilities . '', 
  * eu chiefs are working with sudan in an effort to stop boatloads of migrants reaching southern europe `` to solve the root causes of migration . '', 
  sudan is a major route for migrants moving between east africa and the libyan coast on their way to italy and greece . 
  but the legitimacy of the deportation has been questioned . 
  members of the italian chamber of deputies have demanded proof following speculation the authorities broke the law by allowing sudanese officials to choose migrants to deport . 
  it 's just for this weekend , i think op should have mentioned it in the title, 
  the problem is that the plates are in arabic , i mean , i might be wrong , correct me if you know more this is what i saw : http://www.report.rai.it/dl/report/puntata/contentitem-3adfd917-cf6c-411b-9990-9cd08f2f2fc6.html it is in italian but maybe you can get something told in english , anyway this shows what i 'm talking about . 
  you need to watch the first minutes, 
  i saw a report about this on national tv , they said it 's hard to catch them because they go away so they ca n't find them . 
  they also said it happens many times . 
  my knowledge is related to what i saw , these people are usually very rich , they drive lamborghinis and ferraris around the streets of london . 
  for them # 1000 are nothing . 
  for our security everybody should be indentifiable . 
  stop . 
  honestly the only reasonable is the hijab , at least we can see you , the other two do n't make anyone see your face and also do n't make you recognizable so if you do something illegal we ca n't identify you , and for all that we know there could be a man inside it . 
  it 's illegal wearing carnival masks for that reason , you ca n't walk around rome without exposing yourself , we must know what you look like . 
  i totally agree , you must be recognizable in case you do something illegal . 
  it 's like the arabic teens that violate speed limits in the uk but ca n't be arrested because they have vehicle registration plates written in arabic . 
  you are basically wearing a mask . 
  the people there are doing a great job , they are saving as many people as possible , more than 200 people have been saved . 
  so sad what happened, 
  i think they have n't , they are now searching people based on what they hear . 
  they use dogs that can feel the presence of a person under the ruins and they pay attention if they can hear someone talking or breathing , they are also removing the pieces of the buildings that fell down to see if there are dead bodies . 
  they said temperature was around 13 \u00b0 c , it 's cold in the mountains , even in summer . 
  fortunately it 's not raining and it probably wo n't . 
  then it 's time to found new colonies, 
  they said the number can still rise , there are still people trapped under the buildings , some still alive , but a big part is dead ... 
  what 's a russia ? 
  italy is in the contact line between the african plate and the eurasian plate , but sardinia and corsica are far from this contact line . 
  starting from the mid atlantic ridge this rift follows the border with northern africa and then it goes up to sicily , goes through the appennines and in the end in veneto and in friuli venezia giulia . 
  the earthquakes are generated by the movements of the following plates and because sardinia and corsica are far from this line , they are n't seismic zones . 
  also many studies have said the sardinia has been being stable for 7 millions years , i think for corsica it 's the same . 
  few people live in the towns where the earthquake happened , they were full of tourists and it happened at night . 
  the buildings were all old so not earthquake proof . 
  in the last ten years many earthquakes happened in italy but obviously you ca n't rebuild every house in central italy because it requires a lot of money . 
  the new buildings are earthquake proof , or at least they should , but it happened , for example in l'aquila , that they are not well built because sometimes there are people who get rich with this activity without paying attention to do a good work , so they use cheap materials and it obviously happens what it happens . 
  it 's not the first time this happens , they are calling firemen from all the country and many volunteers are coming as well .

well , thank you . 
   the next world cup you win i guess that you 'll have to forgive somebody else for the next, 
   that should have been enough to understand the pattern as said below , the common pattern is the `` question mark '' . 
  crazy , but true . 
  guys , guys , guys . 
  i know that this will blow your mind , but that is ... a ** question mark ** . 
  i know , it seems crazy , but everytime it 's used there is a question mark , and every time there is a question mark you can use it .

  i think you do n't have the big picture untill you do n't understand also this unpopular point of view . 
  1 ) problem with justice ? 
  he is just a victim of persecution of the left wing judges . 
  look how much ex-judges there are in the left wing of the parlament . 
  he had a lot of proceeding , but he never found guilty for anything . 
  this is just a political issue and we should stop to waste public money for this . 
  2 ) the media ? 
  he may own some tv channels , but nonetheless most of the media are againist berlusconi . 
  de benedetti ( he is old bitter enemy ) owns a bigger media empire , most of the newspaper are againist him , the main media events of the year ( es . 
  : festival of sanremo ) typically are againist him , there are comedians ( es . 
  : benigni , crozza , etc. . ) and journalists ( santoro , travaglio , etc. . . ) who made a fortune just because they are againist him ( and they are also very famous just because of this ) , even in the show schedule of his 3 tv channel you can find very different journalists and opinin leaders with a wide variety of point of view : you ca n't say they are all supporter of berlusoconi ( actually few of them are ) . 
  did n't you remember how berlusconi was badly pictured by all the media just 6-7 months ago ? 
  stop sayng that berlusconi is voted because he can influence the media !, 
  3 ) the italian politic was even worse before berlusconi : governments were much more instable and also after the election you could n't know which prime minister would have been elected . 
  with berlusconi this changed and he made the italian democracy a little more modern . 
  he was one the best enterpreuner we have ever had and he is one the few modern politician in italy , all the other would bring back the old politic . 
  4 ) taxes . 
  berlusconi want to keep taxes at minimun , he had some difficulties to do this in the past , but also he had several success and he is the only one who is talking about this issue . 
  monti and the left wings know how to lead italy just by raising taxes . 
  5 ) promises . 
  he respect them . 
  as somebody who had berlusconi as pm for a decade , i do n't see how you can enjoy this . 
  it 's not funny to be so unprofessional if you have such an important role . 
   not some type of eu tourism board exactly . 
  and probably there would n't be enough budget for such a video . 
   one family , 2 cameras , 30 countries , ** 60 flights ** , 1000 + time lapse videos , 200,000 + images - almost 20 terabytes of data !, 
  hello everyone , i 'm from taiwan . 
  this is a compilation of time lapse videos shot over the last ** two years ** when i travelled europe with my wife and son, 
   there 's nothing of present worth mentioning which should be worrying of course there is . 
  and it 's mentioned in any other thread where it would n't be off-topic . 
  it 's few months old , but gold : article : http://www.cbsnews.com/news/twitter-users-laugh-off-isis-threat-to-invade-rome/, 
   best to leave behind our nationalism and consider the number of unesco sites in the entire eu agree . 
  wait a second ... following that logic ... 
  i should be proud because in europe we have the best beer and '' * friet * '' of the world ? 
  i did n't open your link , but i do n't think that 's the issue . 
  that 's the same requirements we have in italy and street view is correctly compliant . 
  the color scheme seem confusing untill you realize there was not traffic light in 1914, 
  the trial happened , but they were not `` on trial because they failed to predict an earthquake '' , that 's common misconceptions you always read in reddit . 
  just carefully read the sources you provided . 
  do n't forget that almost any small town is half hour away from a bigger city , and at most 3 hours away from one of the main capitals, 
  guys ... can you believe the karma you could get if we talk them about the erasmus project ? 
  they have no idea, 
  what ? 
  italy has money to pay the debt , but an higher growth would make everything easier . 
  the italian debt is something like 2.000.000.000.000 $ ( not exagerating ) , and without growth italy ca n't make significant investment , becasue it can only slowly pay the interests, 
  classic r/italy meme are best meme, 
  italian fascism is probably the most prototipical kind of fascism . 
  here a list of excellent definitions : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/definitions_of_fascism and something more specific about the italian version of it : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fascism_and_ideology  can you describe it in your own words ? 
  it 's what we look for when we are scared , threatened , confused , hungry and uncertain . 
  it 's subtle because you think it ca n't happen to you and you do n't recognize it because it proceeds slowly and gradually . 
  it gives you safety , unity and strength , they say it will change everything and save your country , but it 's rude , violent , brutal and it needs your obiedience . 
   i do n't understand why mussolini 's contribution to ` nazifascism ' does n't seem to be properly represented in this celebration . 
  do you expect us to be sad because italy lost the war ? 
  we are happy because the fascist italy lost the war , and a new republican , democratic italy was born . 
  celebrating the end of a regime , does n't mean denying the responsibility of the war . 
  to be honest , i am not sure you could understand as a british . 
  please read this again in the most polite way possible , because i do n't mean anything to say anything bad or rude , and give me a chance to explain in my broken english what it `` should '' mean to be italian . 
  your country existed for centuries . 
  i would not be surprised if you perceive to belong to the same country you were 200 hundreds years ago . 
  i would not be surprised if something the united kingdom did 200 hundreds years ago would be described by you using the term `` we '' . 
  this does n't apply in italy . 
  italy as a country did n't even existed 150 years ago . 
  do you think i may ever use the term `` we '' to describe what the holy see or the republic of venice did 200 years ago ? 
  as an italian i perceive that the kingdom of italy in 1940 was my country as much as the holy see in 1860 was my country . 
  it was not . 
  no sense of belonging at all . 
  some land , and some people , i know ... . 
  but it 's something very distant from a cultural and institutionally point of view . 
  everything we are today , everything related with our identity ( culturally , politically , institutionally , etc ... ) is a rejection of those dark days . 
  being italian today , means rejecting any form of totalitarism . 
  i do n't use the term `` we '' to describe what fascist did , but `` them '' . 
  as a country we are/were accountable , formally and institutionally , for what we did . 
  but today ? 
  today is a great day , because we were liberated from that heavy identity of a fascist regime . 
  that 's way it does n't feel a contradiction for us to celebrate the liberation of italy , because modern italy and today identity was born with the end of the fascism . 
  ok , so the probem is the name of the celebration . 
  it seems that it 's like judging the book from the cover , but if it 's that important let 's discuss about the name , then . 
  wikipedia : italy 's liberation day , also known as the anniversary of the resistance , or simply april 25 is a national italian holiday commemorating the end of the [ italian civil war ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/italian_civil_war ) and the end of nazi occupation of the country during world war ii . 
  2 years of civil war . 
  italian vs italian . 
  democracy won . 
  today we are grateful to the allied troops and to the italian resistance movement .

  we 're still having summerlike temperatures here , in the day . 
  but god help you if you have to get out of your home at 6:30 am . 
  you 're going to have to carry with you all day a shapeless mass of no longer necessary sweaters an jackets, 
  yup . 
  the main reason is that she wants to let everybody in . 
  the other reason is that she is black . 
  but mainly because she wants to let everybody in . 
  oh , everyone spewing this shit all the time . 
  i watch his channels , and i must say i see many more subtle attacks on him than obvious support . 
  also the obvious support is so exaggerated it becomes a joke . 
  oh i know it 's basically just a ping from the tower to the phone that also happens to contain text . 
  and i am in no way condoning the practice of spying . 
  i was just pointing out that an sms is n't ( and should n't be considered as ) metadata, 
  the content of an sms is n't metadata . 
  it 's data . 
  sender/receiver number and date are * meta * data , that is , data about data . 
   the final sentence it 's expected by september weird . 
  usually it takes more than three years to get to that point . 
  and for him , it just takes 3 months ? 
  looks like the whole justice system sped up , just for him . 
  maybe , just maybe , if they really all were on his side , they 'd drag it as long as possible so he 'd never be actually judged ? 
  just saying . 
  svezia e norvegia amando il progredir questa nazione progredisce nell ` arte del poltrone sweden and norway this nation loves progress so much it only progresses in the art of laziness, 
  no , but it makes no sense to hate on them so specifically when surely your country does the same, 
  like they 're the only eu country doing that .

  easy . 
   say someone visits italy and i will say ... where ? 
  which part ? 
  because there are extreme differences between north and south  say someone visits northern italy and i will say ... where ? 
  which part ? 
  north east and north west are different places and different traditions . 
  you can never be specific enough . 
  heck if you told me you went to masone ( 2000 inhabitants ) , my friend from there would ask you `` you did n't go to cu ( 20 houses about 400m from the town ) did n't you ? 
  those are inbred backward idiots . 
  still better than campo though ( other town of 1500 inhabitants , 2km away ) '', 
  `` we just upgraded our roaming pack from 2 $ per day for 20 mb to 3 $ per day for 25 mb ! '', 
  word for word message i received a while ago . 
  that 's not an improvement . 
  that 's 25 % more data for 50 % more money, 
  i have a friend who goes to check out his local lidl three times per week . 
  he never buys anything edible , just stuff from those bins . 
  and because those offers are so short , he is always full of awesome stuff that now one ca n't find anywhere . 
  bike lights , drill bits , solar panels , bugscreens ... 
  anything . 
  remember a few years ago ? 
  berlusconi went up to gaddafi and said `` yo stop sending us niggers 'n shit '' immigration to lampedusa decreased from a few thousand to like 2 people per year . 
  then they killed gaddafi . 
   voting is limited to single ip * three people , all redditors , living in the same flat * an university dorm these are just two examples of why you ca n't do that edit : redditors , not redactors . 
  took me over 24 hours to see it . 
   i have no problem with immigration but if you come to france ( or any european country ) , you must be grateful and integrate  if an immigrant commits a crime then kick him out fascist !, 
  in all seriousness , it seems that anyone who says that is labelled as far-right fascist racist negro-hating scum oppressor shitlord . 
  it 's nothing more than asking to behave . 
  sigh . 
  used to be so . 
  butchers ca n't sell bread , but apparently , if you brought it to them , they 'd happily cut it for you and put whatever you asked for , in it . 
  well , apparently up to 25-30 years ago you could bring bread to a butcher shop and have them make you a sandwich . 
  we just went the other way around . 
  possible . 
  though supermarkets do n't sell cups of coffee , here . 
  just fyi, 
  i realise there are people in very bad economical conditions , but do you realise we are talking about 4 cents per sale at most ? 
  to make it one euro you would need to go to the store 25 times . 
  that 's probably three months . 
  one euro every three months makes all this difference ? 
  i am sure beggars can get one whole euro in less than 20 minutes, 
  i am not talking about 100 euro products . 
  i am talking about a cart of stuff adding up to 100 euro . 
  you do not get the rounding for every single product . 
  \\ / \\ / \\ / \\ / \\ / \\ / \\ / milk 1,30 ham 5,61 spaghetti 0,73 cheese 3,20 rebate -10 % -0,32 partial 10,52 rounding -0,02 total 10,50 thank you have a good day / \\ / \\ / \\ / \\ / \\ / \\ / \\ edit : now that i think about it , i do n't think they round * up * . 
  they only round * down *, 
  a whole one percent !, 
  aside from the fact that the x , x9 market strategy is n't really used here , you do realise that on a total of 100 , 130 euro ( which is n't uncommon to see ) it 's a whopping 0,00045 % and 0,00038 % difference ? 
  think of the savings , if you manage to end up with an exact total of 130,02 $ !, 
  whoa . 
  you had a 200 $ note in the last 3/4 years ? 
  last i 've seen them was 2004 . 
  at most . 
  they have disappeared completely . 
  not even banks have them . 
  my supermarket already does it . 
  not to single products , but on the final total . 
  if it 's 0,52 euro , it becomes 0,50 . 
  0,53 becomes 0,55 . 
  on the receipt . 
  edit : now that i think about it , they only round * down * . 
  so both 0,51 and 0,54 become 0,50, 
  1/bis for a long time it was weird * to not live with parents *, 
  i 'd much prefer the cold rainy weather over fucking hot one, 
  i have just completed two cisco certification courses . 
  everything is in english . 
  textbooks , class slides , end of chapter exams , everything . 
  that did not stop us from doing all the lessons in italian , our language . 
  want me to write in english ? 
  fine . 
  want me to study on english books ? 
  fine . 
  but if neither the teacher nor the students are english and/or of another language , there is no point in speaking in english . 
  makes everything more complex . 
  same for sicily,

  past the ring-road there 's no civilisation anyway !, 
  oh licio , now that 's some weak-ass trolling !, 
  a shame , truly , for you used to be so much better . 
  it was fun bantering with you ... now enjoy heaven , and teach angels how to p2 . 
  what ... ? 
  do you seriously believe pfizer and amazon get any money out of them northern taxpayers ? 
  or that latium is n't actually among the few regions that gives more money to the state than it actually receives ? 
  you surely do seem detached from reality ; that 's the very kind of baseless crap post-stroke bossi from 2001 would spout . 
  if anything it 's * us * who are subsidising the rest of the country and their extravagant autonomy bullshit . 
  without ever getting anything back , at that , except for more and more taxes . 
  & nbsp ; edit : guess which company did actually get some 200.000 billion lire in state aid for over 30 years ? 
  fiat . 
  as i said before all of this happened between 1928-35 , not the punic wars . 
  most of those settlers - believe it or not - are still there , by all means do visit and check for yourself if you 'd rather not trust a random internet stranger . 
  oh , and some of them ( most elders that is ) still speak their own dialect ... 
  venetian settlers as in `` the guys who actually drained the pontine marshes , were granted the land they managed to reclaim and moved there with their families '' . 
  there 's plenty of emilians/friulans too and this happened in 1934 , not the middle ages . 
  personally , i know quite a few of them - one happens to be my own gp . 
  you obviously have never seen latina and all the big pharma whatchamacallits down there , eh ? 
  not to mention the logistic hubs scattered throughout the region ( orte , pomezia , civitavecchia , etc ) . 
  nope . 
  latium is still * central * italy ... no matter what them fog-breathing pinkos say . 
  reeeeee how dare you lump rome and latium with the south ?!, 
  fyi the lower third of the region is full of venetian settlers ... 
  since when are liguria and emilia-romagna considered part of the centre ? 
  whoever draw this map must suck at geography . 
  also , how can trentino , valle d'aosta and south tyrol be considered productive when all they do is to syphon money from the rest of italy ? 
  and how come latium is n't considered central italy but umbria is , they 're very similar regions ( especially viterbo and its environs ) . 
  no thanks , you can keep ticino ... really , that 's rightful swiss clay and we do n't want anything to do with it . 
  hey , half of it was british too !, 
  and somalia used to be an ok place ( by african standards that is ) before the ussr backed the coup of 1969 . 
  not that i know of , no . 
  :-) but there really are a few catalan speakers left in alghero ... in parts of the city centre , that is . 
  afaik they 're an ungodly mix of short-tempered genoese , pisans and sardinians who happen to speak their own tuscan dialect as well as french ( albeit reluctanctly ) . 
  they also like knives and have a thing for terrorism , or at least that 's their reputation here . 
  `` by the end of the game , rousillon will be french '' . 
  ( also , `` spain is not the emperor '' ) . 
  fair enough . 
  it 's war , and war has no winners ... 
  i agree that we got spanked hard at caporetto but there 's more to it ; namely , the war did n't just end there ( see below ) . 
  no functional army to fight against ... then please , enlighten me . 
  who got their arses handed during the ironically-named `` punitive expedition '' of 1916 ? 
  who lost three consecutive battles on the monte grappa ? 
  2nd piave ? 
  who did so generously provide us with 400k pows at vittorio veneto , therefore triggering the collapse of the empire ? 
  who lost three warships to motorboats ? 
  it was n't us . 
  & nbsp ;  [ ... ] and italians took way too much as they should if we look at the ethnic borders . 
  & nbsp ; i 'd suggest complaining to clemenceau or to whomever else it may concern - always assuming there 's someone alive left . 
  as you can see , none of us has anything to do with it . 
  plus the borders got pretty much `` rectified '' after ww2 , those pesky italians residing in what is now slovenian clay are no longer a nuisance and personally i have no intention of furthering our participation to this round of the genocide olympics ( `` hurr durr the fascists were bad but the accusations are coming from such paragons of virtue ! '', 
  enough ) . 
  history happened . 
  period . 
  now we 're in this all together and * perhaps * it 's high time we get over it . 
  do n't forget that the a-h command also had plans , and lobbied hard , to pre-emptively strike italy in 1908 . 
  this is back to when we were actually still allies ... who 's the backstabber , again ? 
  polling stations are located within public buildings such as schools , town halls , etc. 
  ( but it 's classrooms mostly ) . 
  the city centre 's also a theme park for tourists so no wonder you did n't see anything referendum-related , let alone actual romans ... 
  renzi 's opponents were so weak even hitler would 've won against them . 
  of course he is . 
  but winning a race against a 90-year-old , bed-ridden paraplegic is n't that great of an achievement ... 
  & nbsp ;  [ ... ] not so much domesticly . 
  & nbsp ; * understatement of the century *, 
  afaik they are , the reform will only remove the so-called shared competences . 
  any revision of devolved powers has to be negotiated with the regions first . 
  oh please ... if you think i 'm some turboneocon of the likes of reagan and thatcher then you 're way off the mark . 
  what i was proposing , and i 'm no expert , was simply to ease the burden on smes and to redirect it - at least in part - toward homeowners . 
  i think berlusconi ( now he 's the one worthy of your epithets ! ), 
  did a great disservice to this country by removing the ici for purely electoral gains back in 2006 . 
  guess what was the result ? 
  money had to be found elsewhere , and that somewhere was smes ( the true backbone of this country ) . 
  imho such a proposal , coupled with the reform of the land registry , may bring some actual benefits and might be what we need right now ... hit the brick to make life easier to those who actually create jobs and wealth . 
  homes stay where they are . 
  most jobs , sadly , do n't . 
  and what did renzi do ? 
  made private-sector workers even more easy to fire , slave and replace while not touching civil servants or cutting some slack to enterprises . 
  what about the partite iva ? 
  there 's a reason if no person with a functioning brain would ever dream of opening one if they had the choice . 
  and after the recent , draconian amendments , if you make a small mistake you 're now liable to pay one hell of a fine . 
  oh , and no help whatsoever for young entrepreneurs . 
  we do n't need those anyway . 
  it is my belief that if this administration continues with its current budget policies - namely , emitting even more debts in order to cover for the old ones and willfully ignoring the fact that our only hope to kick-start some actual growth ( that does n't involve cooking the books ) is de-taxation of labour - italy will almost certainly fail regardless of the referendum 's outcome . 
  and the purported savings touted by supporters of the reform wo n't be even nearly enough to prevent this from happening . 
  granted ... italy is too big to actually fail !, 
  but this means that instead of an implosion , we 're going to be put on life support just like greece was . 
  see ya in 2019 . 
  how very surprising . 
  but let 's put it this way : & nbsp ; * `` no '' wins , renzi resigns , and we 're bound to declare bankruptcy in a couple of years . 
  * `` yes '' wins , renzi stays , but we 're bound to declare bankruptcy in a couple of years . 
  & nbsp ; totally different outcomes you see !, 
  now do your duty and vote `` yes '' to save the fatherland from imminent collapse . 
  allright , but there 's two things i do n't agree with : 1 ) still , this is not a change that should be made imho . 
  what 's a school system 's purpose if you ca n't fail students ? 
  and since the high school exam is such a bad joke , was there any need to make an even bigger one out of it ? 
  2 ) you should 've had a closer look at all the shit marino 's own party ( who backstabbed him ? 
  26 councillors from the pd with renzi 's approval ) , with the connivance of * repubblica * / * l'unit\u00e0 * , was throwing at him . 
  and on a daily baisis , at that . 
  you surely have noticed just how slavishily pro-government both tabloids ( now renowned for their factual inaccuracies ) are , right ?

  we imported santa claus from the united states and we call him `` babbo natale '' ( `` father christmas '' ) . 
  before babbo natale , baby jesus himself brought gifts to children on christmas . 
  however , some pre-existing traditions survive from ancient times : on december 6th , san nicol\u00f2 ( st. nicholas , the original santa claus ) brings gifts to children in some parts of italy ( apulia , trieste , trento and bolzano ) ; in other parts , on december 13th , gifts are brought by st. lucy . 
  in sicily , children receive gifts directly from the dead , on november 1st .

  although some suspect that this is the reason why the pardon has been proposed in the first place , the ministry of justice has assured that berlusconi is outside the scope of this general pardon . 
  yes , of course , but i first check who is by looking out of a window . 
  but if i see a couple of middle-aged women holding pamphlets i do n't answer , because they are jehowa witnesses . 
  i 'd add that hundreds have escaped today from an improvised center in sicily , and i am under the impression that the authorities are not exactly bending over backwards in their efforts to bring them back . 
  a friend of mine is a carabiniere ( military police ) and he was sent to guard one of those camps in the south once , during the libyan crisis : he told me that sometimes , when there are too many immigrants and they start rioting , the police receive orders not to stop them if they want to leave , to release the pressure on the camps . 
  so i do n't expect that those who escaped today will remain in italy for long , because they want to reach northern europe . 
  ** italy ** * while boats with immigrants keep arriving in sicily , the parliament has started the process of wiping the criminal status of illegal immigration from italian books . 
  the crime was introduced by one of berlusconi 's governments in 2002 and its removal is strongly favored by leftist pro-immigration parties and by the integration minister cecile kyenge , an african immigrant herself .

  [ a new shareholder , the state-owned postal service group , poste italiane , is going to provide the necessary liquidity ( $ 300m ) for the short-term survival of the company ] ( http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/931e3432-3299-11e3-b3a7-00144feab7de.html#axzz2hbjod4wj ) , while a long-term solution could include a take over by air france . 
  the italian language was for centuries only used in literature and written texts in general , so its idioms are mostly literary , biblical , or taken from classical latin authors . 
  the funniest idioms then come from the languages spoken by the people , i.e. 
  the local dialects , although movies and tv have contributed to the creation of new italian idioms in the last decades . 
  what follows are some idioms in the trieste ( a city in north-east italy ) dialect : `` no gaver alba '' - lit . 
  `` not having a dawn '' : not having a clue about something , being ignorant . 
  `` go fuck the pussy of your mother '' `` tu mare grega ! '', 
  - `` your mother is a whore ( `` greek '' ) '' , used as the english `` fuck ! '' . 
  `` you are dumber than the pussy of a female donkey '' ( note how `` mona '' means at the same time `` vagina '' and `` dumb person '' ) . 
   agree . 
  all of the southern states should n't have come in . 
  are you talking about the euro or the eu ? 
  because italy is one of the founding member of the eu , it 's not like it was let in at a later stage . 
  i do n't think this map takes dead languages into consideration . 
  i studied latin and ancient greek in school , but they were n't considered foreign languages , i still had to take english as my `` first '' foreign language . 
  same here , i speak some german , but i 'm far from proficient . 
  alitalia ( again ) . 
  he lost the elections because he raised taxes . 
  he is hated by berlusconi 's press . 
  well before the unification : italians have been screwed over the centuries by popes , spanish viceroys , borbon kings , savoia kings , mussolini , etc. 
  that they have developed a contempt for rules and authorities . 
  there 's always been mutual distrust between the italian state and its citizens , a national trait that probably goes back in time several centuries . 
  berlusconi posed as an outsider to the political establishment , a friend of the little man and an enemy of the powerful and greedy state bureaucracy ( not that he actually ever delivered any of his promises , though ) . 
  but the tax problem is real , and until it is fixed the populists are going to take advantage of the situation once again . 
  absolutely . 
  libya under gaddafi was a police state and the immigrants were kept in horrible conditions . 
  italy had an agreement with libya 's gaddafi , and it worked , but when he wanted to get the upper hand in some negotiations he just released hundreds of refugees on the italian coasts . 
  oh , i always vote , and i also think that ep elections follow the same rules everywhere . 
  however , while i like to consider myself a reasonably informed person , i ca n't remember who i contributed to elect to the european parliament with my vote ( while i know exactly whom i voted for at the national elections ) . 
  weird . 
  the problem is that i have no idea who my mep is , let alone of what she/he thinks about the cap . 
  in italy , the eu parliament is regarded little more than a retirement home for failed politicians .

  this is bullshit . 
  berlusconi is just the tip of the iceberg , our problems are n't going to magically disappear when he leaves . 
  we have an entrenched and self-serving bureaucracy that is at the same time hugely expensive and a hindrance to competitiveness ; we have ineffective regulated professions that are sheltered from competition ; clueless politician that are just puppets in the hands of high-ranking bureaucrats ... until this changes , we wo n't be competitive , berlusconi or not . 
  this issue has the potential to bring down the entire schengen agreement : if the migration flows increase , i think we 'll have border checks again within the eu by the next 10-15 years . 
  i know . 
  i was just pointing out that the rbs bailout was one of the biggest in history , and that rbs is a uk bank .

  yes , but $ 50 are much more common than $ 100 . 
  i would n't forget [ royal bank of scotland ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_royal_bank_of_scotland_group ) , whose bailout cost the uk taxpayers # 45 billion in 2008 and 2009 ( the state still owns an 81 % stake in the bank ) .

  personal experience .

  they want to change the electoral law yet again , so we 'll have to see . 
  during the summer gallipoli becomes the capitol of sin & vice in puglia ( in a good way ) . 
  they might get the most votes , but it is highly unlikely they will have more than 40 % .

  and they said they wo n't .

   it goes without saying that these brits in europe are going to generally be wealthier and better placed to remain in europe after brexit than the 916,000 polish people alone for example that currently live in the uk . 
  why ? 
  because the british are * by nature * more intelligent or better at life than the polish ? 
  because they are * expats * while the polish are * migrants * ? 
  my girlfriend just came home after a gp appointment .

  if m5s wins they would n't be able to form a government on their own . 
  there 's hope . 
  it 's not just about the ideas , but the mindset . 
  their supporters always say `` we '' , `` us '' , `` our '' . 
  they support their party as if it were a football team . 
  for the most radical m5sers it 's almost a cult . 
  there are n't that many lega nord voters around . 
  since some m5s party officials are sane , voting for the m5s allows those who would like ln 's policies to not feel ashamed . 
  their pm candidate just went full retarded recently ... 
  it 's so funny reading what they are saying in the equivalent thread over there .

  this is an actual thing ? 
  wow !, 
  til romania worships the grecoroman pantheon . 
  praise jupiter !, 
  i guess they want to retain their perceived superiority . 
  a united eu would be too big to compete with . 
  what was the kindest thing you heard them say about the european * project * , besides the economic aspects ? 
  so the counter-argument would be that since italy ( or people who lived in what is now italy ) created so much art , it should be distributed all over the world ? 
  maybe they could come up with their own art !, 
  that would be a great way to solve it !, 
   does it mean the shroud ought to go back to chamb\u00e9ry ? 
  i would n't be that proud of a forgery . 
  if it was up to me you could have it back !, 
  as said in another part of the thread , axum 's obelisk was returned to ethiopia in 2008 . 
  so i guess it would not be out of the question . 
  do n't you think that it would be fairer to have these artworks reside where the artists have lived and worked ?

  ultimately , as i see it , a `` good deal '' is one that it is as economically beneficial as possible for the eu . 
  i think that having the uk as a prosperous , friendly partner would be ultimately beneficial ; having it as a poor , disgruntled neighbour , not so much . 
  we have enough enemies already , no need making more . 
  i do n't think that what you say is a danger . 
  the very best deal that we can offer the uk , i think , would be something along the lines of the one we have with norway , which * is * beneficial to both partners ; but that deal is nowhere as good as the one that the uk used to have as a member of the eu . 
  norway has to pay contributions to the eu , to follow its regulations about some specific sectors ( * without * being able to vote on them ) , and has to allow freedom of movement . 
  in exchange , it gets access to the single market and free movement of goods and people . 
  objectively , this is quite a good deal for norway as well as for the eu . 
  but compared to what the uk used to have , it 's * nothing * . 
  so no , i do n't worry about `` fostering anti-eu sentiment '' by not going out of our way to damage british economy . 
  if anything , i think that doing that would foster it , and rightly so as we would have revealed ourselves vindictive and tyrannical ; and in fact , it is one of the few things that might make me reconsider my current rabidly pro-eu position . 
  ruining people 's livelihoods ( because this is what we are talking about ) as an act of punishment would not sit well at all with me . 
  agreed . 
  if there are good chances that taking one more year will result in a good deal , i think that we will go for it ; if instead it will seem that the uk is just wasting our time , we 'll live with not having a trade agreement with the uk ( and if they want to , they can always negotiate one later on ) . 
  this climate of uncertainty about the future relationship between the eu and the uk is not good for anyone . 
  the sooner it is dispelled , the better . 
  on the other hand , a good deal with the uk would be very much in the interests of the whole eu . 
  if the deal fails only because of a spanish point of pride about the ownership of gibraltar , the other countries will be * peeved * . 
  i guess it will depend on how the rest of the negotiations will have gone until then . 
  italian here , would you like us to ally with you and then switch sides when you start to lose ? 
  we could even declare war on france after you have already defeated it , just to say that we won too - it 'll be like old times !, 
  ( no more invading russia though plz ), 
  that 's a very good point , i did not think of that possibility . 
  perhaps such an ultimatum would affect the opinions of the other eu countries towards spain too badly for it to be considered ; but at the very least , spain might insist on guarantees that gibraltar will stop being a tax haven and damaging spanish economy . 
  * unless * it is unanimously decided to offer an extension . 
  which i 'd bet it will have to be the case , two years would have been a very short time to hammer out all the details even if the uk had not wasted so many months in aimless posturing . 
  ultimately , a deal is in the interests of everyone involved . 
  if progress is being made ( that is , if things go differently from how they have been going thus far ) , i would not be against offering one further year of time to make sure that everyone involved ends up as happy about the agreement as possible . 
  it was not a coup . 
  they just meant to have a surprise blimp parade in honor of erdogan , and there was a tragic misunderstanding . 
  well , an `` everyone but the conservative '' alliance would work ; and having sinn f\u00e9in , dup , liberal democrats , snp and labour all work together would be interesting . 
  as in `` the moon just put on a huge chef hat and ate the sun '' interesting . 
  are there any chances for a grand coalition between labour and conservatives , with a platform of `` let 's just take care of ordinary stuff and work on brexit negotiation , and let 's all agree to hold new elections in a couple of years '' ? 
  the [ wording of the treaty ] ( http://europa.eu/european-union/sites/europaeu/files/eu_citizenship/consolidated-treaties_en.pdf ) says that  the treaties shall cease to apply to the state in question from the date of entry into force of the withdrawal agreement or , failing that , two years after the notification referred to in paragraph 2 , unless the european council , in agreement with the member state concerned , unanimously decides to extend this period with no provision for the member state to unilaterally stop this from happening ; and the [ european parliament 's position ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/article_50_of_the_treaty_on_european_union#re-entry_or_unilateral_revocation ) is that it is not reversible unless the other members agree . 
  if there was a dispute about the interpretation , i think that it would be up to the [ european court of justice ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_court_of_justice ) to give the ruling ; and ... well , everything could happen , but i do n't see that as very likely . 
  so whatever uk government chose to unilaterally `` go back '' would have to face not only significant internal opposition ( 50 % + of uk citizens do not want in , after all ) , but also the likelihood of not being allowed to at all ; and furthermore , if by some miracle it managed to remain against the opposition of the other eu members those would become , let us say , not very favourably disposed towards the interests of the uk to begin with . 
  in these circumstances , i think it would be more in the interests of the uk to seek some sort of external treaty with the eu : either something along the one between norway and the eu , or a more limited one if they are dead set on not having free movement of people ( but this will also mean that it will be more limited on other aspects too ) . 
  still 7 seats to call , i think . 
  if the tories can win at least 3 , which seems likely , that might be doable - unstable as hell , but doable . 
  not sure if sarcasm ? 
  no , i 'm pretty sure that the eu would * not * welcome a return to the pre-brexit status quo , with the danger ( or , i should say , the certainty ) that as soon as things get difficult the uk will trigger the exit once more , further destabilizing our project ( and , most likely , whining incessantly about the tyranny of eu regulations in the meantime , never mind that they asked to join , contributed as much to their formation as anyone else , and had been given uniquely favourable conditions to boot ) . 
  the uk was a valued member of the eu project ; but it has proven itself unreliable as a member , so i 'd rather just have it as a reliable ally if possible . 
  if , as it is the case now , the primary allegiance of the members of the european parliament is to their own home states , i am not sure that this is workable . 
  just to mention * one random and most certainly unrealistic example * , let us say that turkey starts making noise about how cyprus should be all turkish , and let us say that the republic of cyprus requests a greater presence of eu military in order to discourage turkey from doing something silly . 
  turkey , on the other hand , warns the eu that if the eu does such an * unprovoked and unlawful act of aggression * as sending troops to cyprus , it will retaliate by opening its borders and sending a ton of migrants towards , let us say , its borders with bulgaria . 
  how will bulgarian members of the european parliament vote ? 
  how will ... 
  i dunno , the finnish members of the european parliament ? 
  you are not wrong , i speak from experience  i do not think that we are as bad as we once were , actually . 
  but my point is , fighting vulgarity with vulgarity just lowers the level of the discussion , which actually ends up * helping * one 's opponents . 
  those of us who made fun of brunetta ( one of berlusconi 's main followers , and a. . . contentious ... character to say the least ) by calling him a `` dwarf '' , for instance , made the italian left no favours at all . 
  i 'm afraid that , no matter the time , using sexually charged insults towards female politicians is nothing but pointless vulgarity . 
  i do n't give a damn about how may is in bed , and i have no reason to think that she had sexual relations with trump . 
  this sort of talk will certainly not convince may 's supporters to switch sides , does not constitute a valid criticism of her policies , and contributes to normalize the type of bluster and name-calling-based politics in which individuals such as trump thrive . 
  like the euro itself ( but even more so , i think ) this is potentially an excellent idea , but unless we commit to a greater degree of * political * unity it will never work properly . 
  it 's all well and good to say let 's have an eu military ; but who gets to make decisions for it - buying equipment , nominating generals and so on , deploying it , the whole shebang ? 
  if the people who will have to make these decisions will receive their mandates from single eu countries , or anyway will be more committed to the interests of their individual countries than to those of the eu as a whole , this will be a useless shitshow and nothing else . 
  if we want to have a single eu army , i think that we also need to commit to full eu federalism ( of which , personally , i am an enthusiastic supporter ) . 
  nothing else would really suffice , i think . 
  please , * please * , ** please ** do not fuck up . 
  macron will likely have an excellent opportunity ; but if he squanders it , he could damage the eu project irreparably . 
  my point is that nowhere in the nato agreement it is stated that countries that have not met the agreement yet have to pay . 
  asking for us to increase our military spending to 2 % is reasonable , and in fact we agreed . 
  asking for payment now has no basis , and would be met with `` ha , no '' under the best of circumstances . 
  these are not the best of circumstances . 
  considering the absurd amount of harm that ** your ** military ( which is well above 2 % of your gdp , * well done * , have a cookie - heck , have two ) has done to the equilibrium of our region , do you see why such a request would be considered insulting ? 
  formally , we do not owe money to you or vice versa ; and morally , the idea that * we * owe anything to you would be laughable if it was not infuriating . 
  the purpose of nato is to protect member states from outside threats ; the us military 's recent actions have mostly been an excellent * generator * of outside threats . 
  and let us be clear also on one thing : if article 5 fails , the whole nato alliance - which , so far , serves first and foremost us interests - has no purpose . 
  among other things , this means no nato bases in our countries . 
  i suggest that you consider * with attention * if this is your interest . 
  so : we agreed on the 2 % policy , from 2024 onwards . 
  but your country 's attempt to `` put pressure '' on us by inventing imaginary penalties no one signed on are not only nonsensical , but straight out insulting . 
   we 're talking money because the language in the treaty is n't and has n't been followed . 
  the * language of the treaty * did not mention the payment of penalties of that kind . 
  asking them * now * , when the other members have actually agreed to raise the spending to 2 % by 2024 , is entirely nonsensical . 
  the reason why my counter is relevant is that trump would have us pay for the fact that the us invested more in their army than we did . 
  what the us recently did with that army is quite relevant to the topic , i think . 
  the fact that the us used its army to culpably bring about a major , enduring disaster - one in a region that is closer to europe than to it - and that , if anything , it should pay for it is not at all `` irrelevant whataboutism '' . 
  it 's as if we all agreed to set up a neighbourhood watch , and one of us ended up spending far more nights walking around and looking for possible trouble than the others . 
  however , instead of keeping the peace , this individual ended up picking unnecessary fights with some seedy guy who once quarrelled with his father , thrashing the whole neighbourhood in the process for no reason other than his `` tough-guy '' delusions . 
  then , after that , this person had the gall of telling the others that we should pay him for the fact that he spends more time in the neighbourhood watch , despite the fact that 1 . 
  no one had ever agreed to pay anything ; 2 . 
  this person 's recent actions as part of the neighbourhood watch caused an absurd amount of damage for no good reason . 
   this is no major difference to an envisioned european defence union the difference is that the envisioned european defence union does not exist yet , and even in the best case scenario it will take * quite some time * before it is as effective as required ( no need to make it as huge as the u.s. army , that would be pointless overkill ; but it would have to be able to provide a serious deterrent to would-be attackers ) . 
  i tend to be wildly optimistic in my predictions , so i 'll say that * perhaps * 15 years from now i might agree with you if everything goes as well as it can ( although at that point an argument could be made for us to remain part of nato and transform it into something less us-centric - i would actually prefer this , if possible ) . 
  but these things take time , and we can not remain defenseless until we get the european defence working properly ( which will be ** far ** from trivial ) . 
   the invasion of iraq was unilaterally decided by the u.s. and has no bearing on nato in this context . 
  ~ ~ the u.s. initially asked nato to assist the iraq invasion ; but the request was not approved . 
  look [ here ] ( http://www.nato.int/cps/cn/natohq/topics_51977.htm ) in the `` the evolution of nato 's involvement '' for details . ~ ~ ** edit : ** this part was incorrect , i misremembered and misread the source . 
  you are right , the iraq invasion has nothing to do with the topic . 
  again , i do n't disagree that u.s. dominance in nato is less than ideal ; but i do not think that it is total , and i think that for the moment being nato membership is still more useful than harmful . 
   europe has finally reached the point where nato has outlived its purpose and usefulness i disagree . 
  perhaps we will eventually get there ; but at the moment , we are not there at all . 
  nato , as a defensive organization , is still very necessary , especially for eastern europe ; and while , yes , u.s. dominance in it is less than welcome , it is not true that `` america decides how , when and where large scale operations are undertaken '' . 
  during the 2003 invasion of iraq , for instance , many nato members did not support at all the u.s. operations , and turkey for instance did not allow the us to deploy forces on its territory . 
  the 2 % was never a payment ** to ** nato to begin with . 
  it is the percentage of gdp that nato countries should eventually invest in * their own * militaries , which of course have to defend other nato members if necessary . 
  if we get an eu army , i think that it would be part of nato too , which means that we would have to defend other nato countries if they are attacked ( i do n't love that a dictatorship like turkey is protected by us ; but then again , attacking turkey would be an awful idea regardless ) and that it would count towards the 2 % requirement . 
  not disagreeing , just expanding on this ,

  it 's not about tackling extremism , imho . 
  it 's more like the burqa is a symbol of women slavery and there 's no place for that in a modern society . 
  you ca n't do some things in the west , openly oppressing women is one of them . 
  edit : a good place to remember the paradox of tolerance : * unlimited tolerance must lead to the disappearance of tolerance . 
  if we extend unlimited tolerance even to those who are intolerant , if we are not prepared to defend a tolerant society against the onslaught of the intolerant , then the tolerant will be destroyed , and tolerance with them . 
   he did n't support the falklands war as well . 
  i think he said something about thatcher using it to boost her popularity . 
  fine . 
  but that 's still a ridiculous reason not to support protecting british citizens from a dictatorship . 
  he also said that it was a mistake to admit former warsaw pact countries into nato and advocating a ukraine deal for them . 
  the left has shifted to the right a lot recently , especially in england . 
  pacifism has always been a `` left thing '' , he 's just being consistent . 
   e is the `` anti-establishment '' candidate . 
  the trump for the uk left . 
  yeh corbyn is a normal person though , not a massive cunt . 
  yeah this does n't affect people are all a part from the fact that england imports 60 % of the food they eat . 
  yeh to be honest this is the first time i hear that `` ferragosto '' is a religious holiday . 
  til `` freedom of speech '' equals `` i do whatever the fuck i want '' . 
  i do n't understand then , why is the imam 's entire response aimed at the daily mail ? 
  well they 're all owned by an australian so it 's technically not all your fault . 
  well , if you think about it the daily mail is pretty close to being one of the most reliable newspapers around . 
  just pick any news and their opposite is consistently the truth . 
  just remember to add `` not '' to every verb . 
  i remember when i was like 10 and going to school in winter wearing a baklava was a thing . 
  however , i also remember -18 c where i lived , so there 's that . 
  uh . . til any form of communication is now considered social media . 
  for the love of god can we stop using `` slam '' as a synonymous of `` has a negative opinion ? '' . 
  edit : seriously , the title is completely misleading : this is what his `` slam '' is supposedly about : `` as for the eu , he said his country , which became an associate member of what was then the european economic community in 1963 , and a candidate for membership in the eu in 1999 , has been `` played with '' : `` the eu plays with us for 53 years . 
  we consistently have been proving our honesty and expect the same from the eu . 
  it should abandon the policy of double standards , '' the turkish president said '' . 
  wow he really gave europe a piece of his mind . 
  slow clap, 
  dude , come on . 
  seriously , i have n't been on a real holiday in ten years . 
  saving up for one with a family of five is a huge deal for us . 
  if some cunt with a sign would stop me on the motorway i 'd probably go berserk . 
  i also heard that santa is real , and there 's a pot of gold at the end of the rainbow . 
   true but it was the least educated regions generally favoured leaver . 
  ftfy, 
  that 's a looooong time , most people would have forgotten about shit happened in 2016 . 
  honestly i do n't have faith in ( most ) people . 
  by then tories would have come up with some populist shit to avert attention to the crap they 've caused 4 years prior . 
   e to go to any town centre in the uk on a friday/saturday night to know it is . 
  to be completely honest i always felt more threatened by drunk chavs in that situation , but whatever . 
  yeh that 's one of the most idiotic things i 've read in a while, 
  they 're also one of the most misinformed bunch of people i 've ever witnessed . 
  i still remember years ago when m5s people were campaigning against the `` chemical trails '' wtf . 
  yeh i came to the comments to say that . 
  like , if i bury pennies in the garden and water them i 'll get money plants kind of delusional . 
  you might want to check the benefits thing . 
  first , you have right to benefits only after you 've paid taxes for 5 years . 
  secondly , they 're not easy at all to to the get . 
  the fact that england is full of migrants who get there for benefits is inflated to the point of being false . 
  yeh that 's never going to fucking happen . 
  what . 
  the . 
  in 30 years time in history books there will be a chapter just for 2016 . 
  that 's ... not the `` real italy '' mate , come on . 
  you ca n't take an 8k people town in the rural south as a sample of one of the most industrialised countries in the world . 
  it 's like going to shittertown in the highlands where you have just sheep and no internet and have an opinion about great britain . 
  i still do n't understand if this works good or bad :(, 
  i was about to warn future readers that this thread is full of idiotic xenophobic idiot twats , then i realized that it 's just one . 
  to be honest , with the fuckfest of stupidity going on i would n't rule out anything . 
  does `` being deported '' mean that england would pay for the travel expenses ? 
  i would n't mind that tbh, 
  and stick them on the sidebar, 
  ok , i 'm sure what i 'm about to say will be unpopular , but what the hell . 
  my feeling now is `` good riddance '' , and this after a week or mourning , since i live in england and i 'll have to live with the consequences of the vote . 
  the thing is , england has never been `` one of the lads '' in the european parliament . 
  its polical weight has always been used in favour of the states , rather than europe 's , it vetoed a wealth of things that were clearly in everyone 's interest but for england , and all in all i think everyone felt it like the spoilt child who stumps his feet at the playground because he ca n't have things his own way . 
  so , on one hand , i really feel for those who did n't vote to leave , including my friends and colleagues here . 
  on the other hand , this has been years and years in the making , seeing people in the streets now does bother me a bit , i see it as a bit hypocritical . 
  i remember some guy here on reddit some months ago , way before the whole brexit thing , who half-jokingly said `` yeh we do n't really feel europeans that much , we 're british , we do n't like to be lumped together with the lot of you '' . 
  and i 'm positive this has been true for many , many people , including those who are protesting now . 
  so , tl ; dr : it 's a bit late now , you 've been `` outside '' for a long time , and i think that after a bit of struggle we 'll all be better off this way . 
  all i 've been reading recently stated exactly the opposite , you ca n't duplicate the existing trade deals , because they were made with a country that was part of europe . 
  it 's not like you just copy paste a standard contract , these things take years , and england has a handful of untrained negotiators to do it . 
  i would n't hold my breath for that . 
  no , but when i eat it 's not like there 's an uninterrupted stream of food from the plate to my mouth . 
  i 'm italian , from the north . 
  the one time i drove to naples it felt like diving in some kind of hell where a chaotic vortex of cars dashed all around me with no logic or reason , mostly honking and yelling at me , every crossroad a russian roulette where i could have or could have not crashed against someone . 
  terrifying , crazy . 
  the local friend of mine told me he had the same feeling when driving in sicily , so yes i ca n't argue with that . 
  although i must say traffic , at least where i 'm from , is pretty regular and respectful pretty much everywhere , and tends to get crazy in the big cities . 
  when i first moved to england i could n't quite get that `` you all right ? '', 
  was n't an actual question , but rather a form of greeting . 
  to which i always proceeded to reply with an actual , meticulous update of my recent life 's events , which is what you 'd do in italy when asked how you 're doing . 
  people looked at me with that `` what the fuck is happening '' look and i eventually got it . 
  fun fact , in italian ( and i believe spanish ) , the word for `` i 've the sniffles '' is `` costipato '' , which is false friend with `` constipated '' , which in english is used more , well , to describe another condition . 
  anyway , a spanish colleague of mine told me they have the same attitude as italians towards the `` how are you doing '' or `` are you all right '' prompt . 
  so it happens that at some point he had a cold and when people greeted him with `` are you all right '' , for about a week he replied with `` not so much , i 'm still a bit constipated . 
  after a few days of '' what the fuck ? '', 
  he was also explained what '' you all right '' and `` constipated '' actually mean . 
  aha that 's not true , but if it 's sarcastic to indicate italians ' inability to follow rules then fair enough m, 
  is n't that ... awkward as hell ? 
  like , sound of chewing and cutlery and people pretending no one is around . 
  mind blown, 
  coomand shift 4 + select area would have avoided the piss taking , 
  yeah , i 'm shocked by how delusional most leavers still are . 
  they still think it will all be great , and europe will give them everything they want because we all need them .

  gdp ppp per capita in current prices as % of the eu-28 average . 
  i meant nominal gdp per capita . 
  anyway , to measure how much well off an average citizen of a country is you should use the disposable income ( adjusted ppp maybe ) and the median wealth . 
  gdp tells us the market value of an economy . 
  that 's gdp ppp though . 
  nominal figures would be really different . 
  paywall . 
  anyway , unless a stagnation in the last quarter which is very unlikely , you should have beaten q2 2008 's peak in q4 2016 . 
  the service sector is above pre-crisis levels since almost two years , it 's the manufacturing and above all construction sectors dragging down the average . 
  spain has very likely recovered to the pre-crisis gdp levels at the end of 2016 though . 
  eh , libyans legally residing in italy are 1.819 , one thousand eight hundreds and nineteen . 
  romanians on other hand are 1.151.395 . 
  a factory in girona is much more closer to germany than one in c\u00e1diz . 
  logistic plays a very big role in industry and therefore in trade . 
   no idea how it manages to get top 4 natural gas, 
  romania , you got a ban !, 
  so do you beieve seat 's management has not put enough effort to promote spain abroad ? 
  a brand does n't depend on a country as a whole just because it 's x country though , but on its companies and industrial fabric . 
   but that 's concentrated mostly in three fields . 
  it 's still very high by any standard . 
   since we sold seat to germans vag is not owned by the german people , it 's a multinational . 
  i can understand taking pride about having a car manufacturer with the hq in your country and not owned by anyone , but does it really matter ? 
  does it matter that much if in wikipedia seat has a german flag or a spanish one ? 
  the really important things are three : investments , added value and employment . 
  seat seems to be doing very well lately , what 's the problem if in the paper is not spanish ? 
  fca for example , three years ago , moved its hq from turin to amsterdam to avoid taxes , yet at the same time it started doing great in italy and has hired 6000 people since then . 
  and to me seat remains a spanish brand , just like lamborghini is italian or opel is german . 
   the only spanish businesses in that field are building parts , and most of them could be replaced if the production goes elsewhere . 
  why should they go elsewhere if spain 's car production does great like it 's doing ? 
   but it 's not the best situation either . 
  the best is yet to come . 
  but france is increasing its population by hundreds of thousands people a year ( positive natural balance + immigration ) and it helps a lot the construction sector and the consumptions , thus creating jobs over jobs for the immigrants too . 
  also france has n't a very big unemployment problem . 
  such phenomenon is even more accentuated in the uk and outside europe in the us , canada , australia etc. 
   foreign investors , because of the image we have sold of spain , like sun , beaches , tourism and so on , they do n't consider it seriously . 
  that 's not entirely true , spain gets a very high amount of fdis as % of gdp ( a lot of foreign car manufacturers have a plant in spain and they invest pretty heavily in them , see what valencia'a ford has done in the recent years ) and they help the gdp growth really a lot . 
  for instance , compare spain 's gdp growth with italy 's which is a country that actually gets a low amount of fdis , proportioned to its gdp . 
  exactly . 
  population increase is a main motor of economic growth . 
  it especially helps the construction sector but almost all the other ones as well , from commerce to services for people , from retail to manufacturing . 
  fair enough , but it looks like they are referring to the map about disposable income . 
  that 's gas money indeed . 
  often the gdp is inflated by other factors while the inhabitants of a certain region are n't as wealthy as their gdp per capita shows . 
  why are they misleading gdp with disposable income ? 
  also , in my opinion , using nominal constant prices when talking about gdp per capita is the most correct thing ; eurostat always uses current prices ppp in these maps which is as worse as it can get . 
  indeed , if you look at the [ gdp change 2008-2014 ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/images/d/dd/change_of_gross_domestic_product_%28gdp%29_per_inhabitant_in_purchasing_power_standard_%28pps%29_in_relation_to_the_eu-28_average%2c_by_nuts_2_regions%2c_2008%e2%80%9314_%28%c2%b9%29_%28percentage_points_difference_between_2008_and_2014%29_ryb2016.png ) ( which the author did n't even link ) and then you look at the datas in constant prices you 'll see that the map looks quite skewed , especially for spain ( letting alone that this map is gdp per capita as % of the eu average , thus the regions where the gdp per capita is much higher than the average will drop much more points compared with a region below the average even though they lost the same real gdp per capita ) . 
  but you ca n't use 2015 datas to talk about the real economy , that 's the year where eur lost about 15 % of value towards the usd , currency used to measure the economy . 
  every ez countries got a 15 % drop on their nominal current market prices gdp in $ compared to 2014 because of that , barring the `` real '' growth rates . 
  you should use [ 2010 $ constant prices ] ( http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/ny.gdp.mktp.kd?locations=it-gb ) . 
  uk 's real gdp is about $ 600 bn higher than italy 's , now remove the other countries and london . 
  ah , be careful : london is 22 % of the ** uk ** economy , not just england 's . 
  england 's gdp without london is thus a bit less than $ 1,8 trillions ( higher than italy 's only per capita ) . 
  if you remove the whole south-east you 'd get definitely different figures though . 
  anyway kudos for the effort to bring sources . 
   which is still larger than the gdp of italy including rome despite londonless england having a population of just 45m compared to italy 's 65m ... no . 
  first , italy has 60m people . 
  second , if you use current market prices take into account the gbp recent devaluation . 
  otherwise use costant prices . 
  in both case , england 's gdp without london is n't higher than italy 's . 
  and scotland has an higher gdp per capita than england without london . 
  surely , belgium has a rather big homegrown export industry ( pharma too , for one ) . 
  yet it 's mostly due to antwerp 's harbour if it 's at such high levels . 
  belgium 's intra eu exports are 72 % of the total ones . 
  antwerp harbour is the key, 
  i agree , 20-64 gives a better perspective . 
  at this point i 'd extend the age to 69 , most of people in mid and late 60s are working and they often do n't get counted considering in most of cases the employment rate is 15-64 . 
  yes , sorry , my bad . 
  the usual share for working age is 15-64 , but eurostat often uses 20-64 . 
  this is n't the employment rate , but the share of ~ ~ 15 ~ ~ 20-64 population in the total population . 
  got that , thanks . 
   a percentage of that car 's value gets added to your taxable income more or less it works the same in italy if you have a vat number . 
  easter egg, 
  eh , indeed . 
  you use your savings to buy a car , not the gdp per capita ppp ( you do n't earn it and car prices are more or less the same everywhere , unless there is a special taxation , like in denmark ), 
  yes, 
  median wealth per capita is a more useful measure in such case . 
  source : http://www.acea.be/uploads/news_documents/20170117_prpc_1612_final.pdf in the pdf you can see the datas for the car producers / brands as well . 
  the datas exclude vans , trucks , motorbikes etc , it 's just passenger cars . 
  since 2014 the european market has made a lot of growth in car sales , but the passenger car sales remain 6 % lower than the 2007 peak . 
  the negative variation is mostly ascribable to the southern european countries : both italy and spain , two of the major markets , still show volumes being about 30 % lower than their pre-crisis peak , despite the two-digits growth realized in the past two years . 
  on other hand , the cee countries have much higher volumes than a decade ago . 
  the uk has record high sales too . 
  germany is a particular case : in the last decade it showed [ stable ] ( https://www.statista.com/statistics/416827/passenger-car-sales-in-germany/ ) car sales except the 2009 monster-peak ( * in the middle of gfc * ) . 
  any dutch and swiss to explain us their countries ' negative variations compared to 2015 ? 
  economic disincentives for buying cars ? 
  public transport being always better ? 
  sorry for the shitty map , that 's the best i could make , 
  they can always refuse to eat it, 
   my citroen van jumpy or jumper ? 
  yes , months ago, 
  there is a fca plant in bursa . 
  what does australia have to do with this exactly ? 
  40 % of exports is relatively low for a small country . 
  that 's the percentuage of germany . 
  a lot of smaller countries easily go above 80 % . 
  yes , after rub was devalued by over 30 % . 
  that 's currency swings , not real economy . 
  correlation does not imply causation . 
  euro might have had a smaller negative effect , but financially speaking italy would be in worse shape than today if it had the lira considering the amount of the public debt . 
  the average italian factory is much , much smaller than germany 's though .

  of course , nominal gdp is more useful when measuring growth , trade , economic power and stuff like that . 
  i personally think that wealth per capita should replace gdp ( ppp or nominal ) per capita when measuring how rich is each country . 
  in fact , it 's being used much more often in recent years thanks to better data we have . 
  you know what 's even better ? 
  median wealth per capita but that 's probably asking too much in world where inequality is such a big thing . 
  cause most taxes are paid according to the income and taxes form the budget of each nation . 
  and the budget of each country is annual , so governments use gdp data in order to understand how this influence their budget . 
  wealth per capita fluctuates more than gdp . 
  gdp is is a monetary measure of the value of all final goods and services produced in a year . 
  as a consequence , gdp per capita is `` basically '' the income per capita . 
  net wealth ( also net worth or national wealth ) refers to the total value of wealth possessed by the citizens of a nation at a set point in time . 
  as a consequence , wealth per capita is the money of the income you have plus properties , fnancial wealth , monetary assets etc. . 
  no you are right . 
  i was making a distinction between gdp per capita ( which is basically the income ) and wealth per capita ( which includes income , properties , financial wealth , other monetary assets ) . 
  our gdp per capita is similar to that of france , spain , japan , south korea , nations that are growing more than us . 
  our wealth per capita is still higher than that of germany . 
  you are talking about gdp but when it comes to net wealth per adult , italy is way ahead ( italy is at 246,000 $ per capita , poland is at 29,000 $ per capita ) . 
  i mean , total wealth per adult . 
  if we consider median wealth , poland is at 10,000 $ we are at 140,000 $ . 
  i wish to have the growth of poland though . 
  i guess there is a reason why we are in the g7 . 
  our wealth per capita is huge . 
  you can do math . 
  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_wealth and our gdp per capita is similar to that of france , spain , japan , south korea . 
  to me all these nations are wealthy . 
  our problem is lack of growth and jobs and i hope it 's changing . 
  then of course there is the north-south divide , so you have to consider it . 
  he did resign cause he lost the majority in the parliament . 
  and he won the elections again , so this argument is weak . 
  but that 's not tsipras ' fault . 
  not even that of juncker . 
  blame merkel , former greek governments , barroso , sarkozy , berlusconi , all eu govs that managed the situation in a bad way at the beginning , etc. ... the problem started way before 2015 or 2016 . 
  every pope since thousands of years . 
  every opera singer or classic musician since hundreds of years . 
  and people in malta , monaco , albania , switzerland , croatia/slovenia and some in the horn of africa . 
  people of italian origins . 
  people already able to speak french or spanish . 
  i guess that 's why italy has a position despite being official only in italy , vatican , san marino , switzerland and istria . 
  btw same for german . 
  it 's official only in six countries and south tyrol but it 's doing pretty well . 
  the day he went to the eu parliament , there was the terrorist attack in brussels so the parliament closed when he arrived . 
  here 's the photo . 
  i can name ten terrorists ;d, 
  according to some views ... the green represents hope , the white represents faith , and the red represents charity ; this references the three theological virtues . 
  some images http://www.exoticspotter.com/ferrari-458-italia-ever\u00f6d-sweden-68651 http://www.italiamagazineonline.it/archives/7253/roma-tricolore-150-anni-dellunita http://kikka3.net/150\u00b0-anniversario-dellunita-ditalia/150\u00b0-anniversario-dellunita-ditalia-tricolore-17-marzo-2011-3-800x600/ and i also love the european flag . 
  it kinda completes our flag with blue and yellow . 
  i was ironic . 
  russia almost borders canada , canada might as well be america . 
  ussr ( united states super russia ) confirmed . 
  less power to the eu council . 
  more power to the eu parliament . 
  probably because of roman catholicism and because half of argentina population is made up by italo-argentinians . 
  for example it 's true that we use handgestures a lot and that is ok to me , but enough of pizza and mafia music : it 's everywhere . 
  i am annoyed cause after hundreds of thousands of videos depicting us that way , it 's a bit annoying . 
  if you look at the other nations ' steteotypes , they may be annoying but they change depending on the video . 
  imagine if americans were always ( movies , videos , books etc. . ) represented as obese people ... 
  i did n't take it seriously . 
  good adolf, 
  why should a native german speaking region be in austria ? 
  they do n't speak austrian . 
  `` during the g-8 summit in italy in july , gaddafi said switzerland `` is a world mafia and not a state , '' adding that the italian-speaking part of the country should be returned to italy , the german-speaking part to germany and the french-speaking part to france . '', 
  cause world war i. p.s. 
  so we should divide switzerland between italy , germany and france ? 
  oh and there are italians in south tyrol . 
  yeah i kinda want north tyrol . 
  the part about italy is so orginal , i have never seen italians represented that way , before . 
  it 's so funny omg , so out of the box . 
  oh and that 's pizza ? 
  who 'd think that ? 
  this guy is a genious . 
  no i want just one european union with different types of states . 
  who 's gon na win ? 
  who are the other candidates ? 
  `` hand him your money , he 'll build you a refugee tent , erdo-how , erdo-where , erdogaaan '', 
  `` be nice to him , since he 's holding all the cards '' https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=r2e2yhjc_mc, 
  italy has the eighth largest economy and france has the sixth largest economy in the world . 
  if the writer of the article is using ppp data ... then the whole thing makes no sense cause economic strength is understood only with nominal gdp . 
  well , italy is reforming itself and our deficit is low . 
  but our main problem is growth , not the debt . 
  the debt is a long-term problem : italy 's debt is in the hands of italians and our net wealth is four times larger than our debt . 
  the lack of jobs and stagnation is today 's problem . 
  same for france . 
  so my answer is : italy and france are too big to fail ( and if they fail in the future , all eu states fail as a consequence ) . 
  at the same time both countries have to implement reforms in order to have more growth and create more jobs . 
  recend data are good . 
  let 's hope we can have a strong economic reovery in the next months all over europe . 
  is this true ? 
  i do not understand why corbyn wants turkey in the eu . 
  i 'm a social democrat and i do n't want turkey in the eu . 
  the turks themselves do not want to join . 
  but i live in rome ( roma in italian and latin ) and no one thinks that roma people are the romans living in rome . 
  and no one thinks that as roma is a team of gypsies . 
  how 's that ? 
  :d in italian we say romani in order to say romans ... and we do not say romani people or roma people when indicating gypsies , instead of it we use the word `` rom '' . 
  is this word used also in other languages ? 
  yeah, 
  i believe in a multi-speed european unuon where each member can choose between 1 ) federal europe ( founding members : france , benelux , germany , italy ) 2 ) supranational europe ( basically eu as it is : current eurozone and schengen ) 3 ) confederal europe ( no ever closer integration , no euro : britain , switzerland ) 4 ) intergovernmental europe ( current associated states such as ukraine , the balkans , microstates ), 
  yeah that 's what i have in mind, 
  i do n't think it 's coincidental, 
  you are right .

  the alternative , proposing alternative solutions and convincing the others they are better , seems not being even evaluated by those against the current rules -, 
  eu rules are usually agreed upon by vote - which means the majority of the eu representatives believes they are fine . 
  of course . 
  they can do it by convincing the other members it 's a stupid rule and they should change it . 
  you know , like it 's done in every democracy . 
  not by the rules they themselves agreed upon . 
  if they do n't like those rules , they can just leave : nobody will stop them , like nobody stopped uk . 
   you and italy would n't have so many people on the boeders we would anyway . 
  maybe less , but still way too many to deal by ourselves . 
  well , it 's 70 years we do n't have a war at home , for us is an incredible record , so it did work well . 
  competent politicians usually know they can not make us too angry , though , as we hold the balance of power in many , many things . 
  we are everybody 's friend , so we know everybody 's dirty secrets and weak points . 
  we also have surprisingly well trained and bigger-than-expected armies . 
  in short : do n't exaggerate and make us angry . 
  it 's not worth the hassle . 
  getting a job there basically means you will not be fired unless you murder some underling on prime time tv . 
  ( murdering your boss might let you keep your job ), 
   if they transport illegall imigrant they do n't . 
  they ( usually ) answer formal sos requests from sinking ships , as they are forced by maritime laws . 
  as long as they receive a formal sos and the ship where the people sending it is sinking , everything is perfectly legal . 
  mostly because we spent the last 70 years trying to get along with everybody so we would not need threats . 
   honestly , what else can they do ? 
  trick the libyan government ( s ? ), 
  in declaring war on us . 
  frankly , that 's the faster , safer and generally better solution to the problem . 
  if the app is declared illegal in italy then google \\ apple can not offer it on their italian store pages . 
  that 's for the app in italy . 
   which is absolute bullshit . 
  somebody who has a drivers licence is qualified to participate in traffic , with or without passengers . 
  at very least they 'd need a specific insurance covering damages to their clients . 
  also , the annual check should be more deep \\ more often , as a taxi car is supposed to travel much more than a normal civil car . 
  yeah , it 's not much . 
  but it 's something uberpop drivers do n't do and taxi drivers have to do . 
  it 's many hundreds of euros the taxi driver have to spend and the uberpop drivers do n't . 
  that 's depends on the local laws . 
  i find it unlikely ... while more similar than usa 's , there are still way too many differences in laws between canada and eu . 
  i doubt canada would wholly adopt eu laws on food production , for example . 
  it `` only '' needs the 27 to agree to change it to `` any state '', 
  the answer is beer . 
  and , i think i heard your meat dishes are quite nice ? 
  in short , you want to keep an italian ? 
  give him good food . 
  also , open an italian-style bar near the bank , possibly manned by an italian barman . 
  that will help keeping them there . 
  it 's probably the ongoing abuse n the usa that make people quite diffident from giving psycho-meds to kids . 
  in italy if a kid takes psycho-meds , it 's serious , as they can not be bought without a prescription from psychiatrist pecialized in children, 
  publish hiring ads in italy making note of your beers and the fact the bank will offer czech courses as part of the first x-months contract ( passing the final exam as compulsory to get the final contract ) and that you have good beers . 
  also , make notice of the cost of life in cz compared to the offered wage . 
  medications are all good and well when used correctly . 
  i am sure there are a number of people who can live well only \\ mainly thanks to medications like ritalin . 
  they are just way less then in the usa as they are fucking crazy . 
  city of london seceding uk and asking for eu membership ? 
  it 's the eu position , no talks about the `` after '' until the `` divorce '' is settled . 
  one might not agree with it ( i am not completely convinced , for example ) , but it is a reasonable position . 
  i honestly can not see the eu position as anything but normal talks-management , stating their position and waiting for the other party to make their offer . 
  eu was basically ready the day after , it was uk who wasted time, 
   i 'm hoping that the eu is treating this as an optimistic starting point , rather than a red line . 
  it 's most likely a `` ask too much to get what you want '' . 
  no , that would imply they do some kind of work . 
  they ( mostly ) do n't . 
  this would make more sense if it 's not a show for the markets but for the voters . 
  `` look at how tough i am , you should totally tell the polls i 'm the greatest ever '' i am ... quite unsure how much the eu is willing to let her use the whole she-bang as a propaganda tool for political points inside her own party, 
   do you think the eu is really being reasonable with what i mentioned ? 
  they are asking a lot expecting to get less . 
  standard negotiating procedure . 
  please note how bottom left has been taken in a normal working day . 
  that 's more or less how many senators there are in regular days . 
  bottom right is from the time they voted to get a rise . 
  they sure will never come in italy for the nursing degree ( and the nifty `` dottore '' title attached to it ) . 
  branca branca branca !!, 
  i must have been recalling wrong about the weapons having to be disassembled , sorry . 
  and i was in fact noting how the difference is in the license , not the type of weapon . 
  i think they have been all bundled together recently in a generic `` accise varie '' but do n't bet on it, 
   then , we still pay for these highways , even though they are privately owned and operated , whether we use them or not , via taxation i 'm quite sure italy does n't pay taxes for their privately-managed highways , though they cost a lot to travel : milan-turin it 's ~ 15,60 $ for ~ 130km, 
  the difference is n't in the mechanics as much as in the license : sport and hunt firearms licenses are relatively easy to get , but they have very restrictive limits and regulations on how one can keep and transport their weapons ( in short : disassembled and locked away out of normal reach ) . 
  also , they can not be used for self-defence ( because they are supposed to be disassembled , if you have the time to assemble them then you do n't need them in first place ) . 
  i might have missed something in the article , but what exactly has the echr ruled ? 
  that doctors decide about a patient 's life ? 
  that potentially surviving while in burgerland is worst than dying at home ? 
  it does work - just look at italy post ww2 . 
  a lot of it depends on the local politicians of the moment . 
  italy does n't have an official language , though italian is quite obviously the standard * de facto *, 
  it 's sadly the complete opposite, 
  civil . 
  war . 
  hard to do : as long as they answer to rescue calls and do n't move first to get them , they can not be prosecuted . 
  not necessarily , i suspect another possibility would be claim the first country they reached was the ship which rescued them , as in international waters they are technically part of the country of their flag . 
  then getting sink by their costal guard because , you know , you did enter illegally in their waters . 
  pretty much same thing in italy , though we have much less self-defense guns . 
  also , the sport guns !, 
  it was an exaggeration . 
  also , lampedusa is around 200 ** km ** from libya , not miles . 
  you forget lampedusa . 
  it 's like 2 miles from there, 
  because their monopoly is honestly earned , they do n't face fines for it . 
  but they face stricter regulations . 
  think of them as a tax for monopolies . 
  because eu ruled they were small enough to not impact on the eu economy so italy could deal with them however they thought fit . 
  not before deutsche bank falls . 
  this lacks the vatican .

  making sure that whoever is in power has the means to enact their will , not necessarily with the support of most of the population ) . 
  personally i think we 're going into an age of increasing degradation of democratic institutions , where pressures other than the will of the people are likely to sway government action even against said will of the people ( something which my country has seen plenty of during the last few years ) . 
  i definitely , definitely do n't want a constitution that makes it easier for the government to steamroll over both parliament and local communities , and especially not one that lends itself to majority rule electoral systems of any kind ( like the electoral law that has passed together with the constitutional reform ) . 
   ti be honest it is extremely common for the incumbent party to poll behind opposition parties . 
  of course , i was simply pointing out that your statement concerning renzi 's popularity did n't tell the whole story . 
  have you tried reading the article in the op ? 
  this is the subtitle :  voters to decide between the political establishment ** and rising populist forces ** in referendum that could see renzi resign like i ** just ** said , i 'd like it if we could talk about this without resorting to automatic thinking and assuming that our position is obviously correct and unassailable and anyone who disagrees is obviously stupid , wicked and peddling bullshit . 
  thank you . 
  also : beside the economist , which foreign publications endorsed the no ? 
  more important to my argument , which had little to do with official endorsements , how much coverage followed this article 's template of casting the vote as renzi vs populism ? 
  here are a few samples : http://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/02/world/europe/italy-referendum-matteo-renzi.html http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-38155968 http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/world/italian-referendum-seen-as-populisms-next-big-test-with-worrying-implications-for-eu/article33122088/ https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/nov/27/matteo-renzi-politics-italy-european-union-brexit-trump http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/italy-approaches-its-own-choice-between-liberalism-and-populism, 
   he 's still more popular than any other political leader . 
  does n't mean much when renzi 's main opponent is a party led by three different people . 
  the m5s currently polls ahead of renzi in both a first and second turn vote . 
  i only wish that this would n't be painted by so much foreign media as a vote where there 's some kind of obviously good , smart , correct choice that might only lose because the unwashed masses are swayed by populism . 
  this is just automatic thinking , recycling narratives from the brexit referendum or trump 's election for a vote whose only similarity to those is that it happens during the same year . 
  can we stop decrying anyone we disagree with as obviously wrong and plainly unreasonable ? 
  there are perfectly sensible reasons to vote no , thank you very much . 
  hell most yes voters will admit to as much . 
  maybe learn something about the reform before reasoning on the referendum via automatic thinking ? 
  it 's nothing of the sort . 
   98 % of afghans between 18 and 39 are rejected and will be deported . 
  as they should . 
  international asylum is for people who are unable to avail themselves of the protection of their birth country , and while there are areas of afghanistan which are dangerous , there are also plenty of areas that are n't . 
  afghanis should flee to those , not to a place halfway around the world that just so happens to be fantastic should your objective be economic immigration . 
  because they believe that the european union actually is weakening european countries . 
  at least in its current form . 
   i just pointed out that it is indeed possible to be `` racist against a culture '' it 's possible to form the sentence `` racist against a culture '' , that it makes sense to do so is something that you have yet to show . 
   what is immigration ? 
  something that people oppose for , among other reasons , what / u/the-great-swiss pointed out . 
   those unsourced data the data is from [ this wiki page ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/islam_in_the_united_kingdom#demographics ) , which takes the numbers from academic sources . 
  so disliking negative aspects of other cultures is automatically racist and therefore impermissible ? 
  this is a thought-terminating clich\u00e9 , the end of intelligent discourse . 
  we ca n't be capable of criticizing our culture exclusively , while somehow infantilizing others as incapable of doing wrong . 
   you talk about white identity and ca n't fathom that there are differences within a culture i 'm yet to meet a nationalist that thinks his country is culturally uniform with no differences whatsoever . 
  what nationalists usually point out is that while there are definitely many variations in their nation 's culture , they 're still far closer to each other than to cultures of non-european immigrants . 
   his is not what the nationalists want , they want isolationism , division and weakness in europe . 
  that 's your imagined strawman , and nationalists would say that multiculturalism and mass immigration are terrific sources of division and weakness . 
  here you can find a collection of surreptitiously published polls : http://www.ilfattoquotidiano.it/2016/12/01/referendum-sondaggi-da-conclavi-e-ippodromi-lassemblage-o-san-norberto-davanti-ma-non-sicuro-di-vincere/3230292/ tl ; dr poll n. 1 has `` no '' in the lead by 6 points poll n. 2 has `` no '' in the lead by 4 to 8 points poll n. 3 has `` no '' in the lead by 6 points so i think it 's fair to say that pre-election polls have `` no '' in the lead by 6 points . 
  however the last full polls i saw had a large percentage of undecided voters , so it 's mathematically very possible for `` yes '' to win . 
   i was expecting valdid criticism  i bet if you demolished those medieval buildings and built more modern looking cities/towns , you would not have so much problems with unemployment . 
  we too . 
  added !, 
  added !, 
  added !, 
  you are factually wrong on each of those points . 
  i do n't know what to tell you besides to read the sources i provided and do some extra research . 
  i 've read through the entire article , and for something that purports to explain `` why so many muslim women find it hard to integrate in britain '' , and especially for something that cites an upcoming government report , it 's too light in data for my taste . 
  the only integration-related data they cite is occupational statistics for muslim women , which are given without context , analysis or explanation . 
  i did not come away from this feeling like i have a better idea of what 's going on than before . 
  we also had them in the form of fake horse races , for elections . 
  for example , forza italy ( berlusconi 's party ) would be called `` the stallion of arcore '' , arcore being where berlusconi has his famous mega-villa . 
  the whole problem with that mechanism is that it makes it even easier to shield corrupt people from prosecution . 
  you do n't even need to get them elected as senators in a national election , just get them a spot as regional councillor ( much easier ) and then push them up to the senate . 
  but you know , that 's not my biggest gripe . 
  my biggest gripe with the new senate is that the senators will have two jobs : senator , and then either mayor or regional councillor . 
  how can you remotely do both of those well ? 
  one will be sacrificed to the other . 
  what 's the advantage of this system ? 
  none that i can see . 
   the economist keeps confusing the electoral law with the constitutional reform the two are inextricably tied together : if the constitutional reform passes then the electoral law comes into effect , if the reform fails then the electoral law is automatically invalidated by its own stipulations . 
  it 's no kind of confusion , they are exactly right in linking them . 
   senators have no immunity from prosecution . 
  no , you are completely wrong here . 
  [ even the yes campaign 's own website ] ( http://www.bastaunsi.it/immunita-parlamentare-referendum-costituzionale/ ) admits senators will have parliamentary immunity . 
   in fact , the legislative power is in the hands of the government that uses `` emergency decrees '' to pass laws `` emergency decrees '' is a horrible translation that evokes the idea of `` emergency powers '' , extra-legal procedures and other undemocratic means . 
  what you are talking about are `` law-decrees '' , something akin to the us executive orders . 
  they are government orders , having the force of law , which come into effect for 60 days and must then be confirmed , amended or repealed by parliament . 
  in practice , they are a way for the government to force parliament to vote quickly on governmental legislation . 
  i do n't understand how the yes campaign can pretend to be scandalized at this : their reform would introduce a law-making procedure whereby the government can introduce a bill and then force parliament to vote on it in ... 60 days . 
  the reform also does not abolish law-decrees , and writes into the constitution the same limitations on their use that had already been established by the constitutional court , so in essence it does n't restrict them in any new way . 
  voting against a resolution to start a eu propaganda effort means you 're pro-russian now ? 
  this is embarassing and pathetic , and reeks of `` everyone who does n't fall in line is a traitor '' mentality . 
  one can oppose russia 's hegemonic pretences over eastern europe and still think a eu propaganda arm is not something we should have . 
  this polarization of `` you either vote along these lines or a you 're a russian fifth column '' is taking on some very worrying undertones . 
   you can support russia then as much as you like ? 
  i mostly oppose russia because i think its government has a predatory mindset regarding eastern europe . 
  at the same time i do n't like the eu parliament openly building itself a propaganda arm , no matter whether its stated aim is to counter russian disinformation . 
  i do n't trust them not to turn it against political enemies - say , european parties that most meps do n't like . 
  it 's not something a democratic body should have . 
  does that make me a friend of russia ? 
  the problem is not just unemployment , it 's loss of productive capacity in a strategic sector . 
  going into the 21st century with china owning our steel supply is simply dumb . 
  they 're not our friends and we should n't assume that our current ok relations will last indefinitely . 
  `` my friend '' is just an expression , chill . 
  for someone who keeps resorting to calling others emotional and saying that their arguments are just to `` make them feel better '' you 're getting quite irate yourself . 
  let 's stop here . 
  i 'm stating facts as well . 
  what is `` emotional '' about calling out label-reasoning for what it is ? 
  you 're assigning labels to unknown actors whose arrival you tell us we must fear , pre-emptively dismissing anything they might say because they belong to the enemy label-group . 
  * that * is emotional reasoning my friend . 
  your use of `` offended '' to dismiss my argument as an emotional complaint is also a propaganda technique . 
   post-truth  putin bots you 're using labels in place of reasoning to create a moloch of an enemy against which you urge us to rally . 
  this is propaganda my friend . 
  but that 's what i said , scotland is called `` country '' in the context of internal british politics . 
  that 's fine , they should keep doing it if it makes them happy . 
  i 'll call them `` country '' when they become one . 
   would you call yourself a tier 1 subdivision of the eu ? 
  i 'm pretty sure there 's an italian embassy in the uk . 
  probably a consulate in scotland to be honest .

  and i 'm quite afraid you definitely know anything about it and am absolutely sure you should take it less seriously ... 
  oh i care , love carrot cakes and cinnamon buns so i 'm quite pleased of starbucks opening , will be easier to find those things, 
  i take my coffee with no sugar , if that 's what you mean by black . 
  but not american coffee of course , that is just filthy water and i rather a way more flavored and creamy espresso, 
  beautiful town , great to swim in the lake . 
  the museum of animation is really nice , lots of nice places to eat . 
  10/10 would recommend, 
  i know chap would love to make a holiday there though . 
  since i was a teen i wanted to go to gucha too , for a week long crazy party . 
  maybe one day i would join the 2 things and visit the balkan region properly, 
  yep , tomorrow morning i 'll go out to buy a pack of cigarettes and , while i 'm at it , drive for those 10 hours straight to buy a 15 $ or less coffee maker, 
  definitely is personal preference , italians are split in 2 on the matter as well, 
  not even 1 $ in most bars . 
  hell , a 2,50 $ espresso would cost 0,50-1 $ more than a cappuccino, 
  [ we like variety too ] ( https://i.imgur.com/mvpwinv.jpg ) . 
  just say a name , not 23 combination of words to have a slightly different order, 
  thank you !, 
  edit : it 's on amazon !, 
  buying it, 
  ehy , if godspresso orders me to sacrifice my child on mount coffiah i comply . 
  absolutely not . 
  coffee machines for homes come in a huge range of prices , and with around 100-150 $ ( like this [ 130 $ delonghi ] ( https://www.amazon.it/gp/product/b003yc1eb0/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=utf8&amp;camp=3370&amp;creative=23322&amp;creativeasin=b003yc1eb0&amp;linkcode=as2&amp;tag=macchinadelca-21 ) or this [ 100 $ saeco ] ( https://www.amazon.it/gp/search?ie=utf8&amp;camp=3370&amp;creative=23322&amp;index=aps&amp;keywords=poemia&amp;linkcode=ur2&amp;tag=macchinadelca-21 ) ) you can have a good enough 1or2-cups coffee machine . 
  it 's not the cheapest stuff ever , moka will always be cheaper , but half of italy will say is not as good ( the other half that is better ) . 
  no , it 's not . 
  giove punish them who are close minded, 
  because bitter is good , bitter is life, 
  half the frames for a third of the dimension of the cup ( i could n't find a good long gif of an espresso making ), 
  coffee flavored coffee , on the left is poop flavored warm piss, 
  coffee is to be taken as bitter s it gets , any sugary substance ever should be treated with capital punishment as per impero romano traditions . 
  enjoy fighting some lions, 
  we have a lot of different coffee servings but yeah , almost all of them ( if you exclude cappuccino , caffelatte and friends ) are in the espresso size , the only true coffee size, 
  i 'd rather sacrifice my children than make instant coffee, 
   black piss is the only real piss , end of . 
  we agree wholeheartedly, 
  do n't be silly , a good espresso machine is another dimension of deliciousness than any moka ever , as much as i like my moka . 
  only coffee that can get near it is the one done with caffettiera napoletana, 
  if you have sediments in espresso you did it wrong , that 's why you like black piss, 
  implying `` drip coffee '' should have a dignity and being called anything but black piss . 
  that 's why you are uncivilized !, 
  it 's sugar , to sweeten the coffee ( even tho coffee and sugar is like pizza and pineapples ), 
  that 's a good coffee , what 's the name of that kind of coffee machines , balkan brother ? 
  well , first of all coffee is to be taken without sugar , whoever break the law will be sent in uk the day before brexit !, 
  anyway besides coffee grounds is also about pressure , water used , temperature and the coffee machine , all of these things are important for a good espresso, 
  still shitty sadly, 
  apparently is final and they will open it fo ' real, 
  definitely due to the lenses . 
  it 's more or less 1,3 km from the point the photo was taken to the castle at the end , while in this picture it looks nearer . 
  cool though, 
  this pic used the same trick as the one in sofia from yesterday , am i right ? 
  that should be piazza vittorio , being the end ( or the start ) ov [ via po and getting to piazza castello ] ( https://www.google.it/maps/dir/45.0641613,7.696448/45.0705393,7.6865986/@45.0672349,7.6879039,1601m/data=!3m2!1e3!4b1!4m2!4m1!3e2?utm_source=app-invite&amp;mt=8&amp;pt=9008&amp;utm_medium=simple&amp;utm_campaign=s2e-ai&amp;ct=s2e-ai&amp;utm_source=app-invite&amp;mt=8&amp;pt=9008&amp;utm_medium=simple&amp;utm_campaign=s2e-ai&amp;ct=s2e-ai&amp;invitation_id=493454522602-29907689-e58f-41ad-9dde-bac7e927f427 ) with castello degli acaja at its center ( the brick castle you see at the end of the street ) . 
  via po is actually 700m long btw . 
  oh i saw op already delivered on the location . 
  wait you do n't have them in uk ? 
  here in my country old people 's daily routine consists also of checking the new dead ones on the obituary board around the city , like [ this one ] ( https://imgur.com/nghwtza ) . 
  so kentucky , what are you like ? 
  whatcha do in your spare time ? 
  then i 'm really sorry for you as a human being . 
  you 're totally brainwashed and dehumanized , i really have pity for a person that enjoys become more and more like a caged animal controlled 24/7 by its own fascist country . 
  i hope you 'll start using your brain and hearth one day , cheers . 
  no , i do n't make it sound like that , it is like that . 
  proof is the countless users ^ check ^ just ^ in ^ this ^ thread ^ to ^ see ^ it ^ by ^ yourself and [ politicians ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/brexit-minister-david-davis-eu-referendum-single-market-free-access-article-50-negotiations-a7220191.html ) still claiming the right of having free market . 
  it 's full here on the internet , it 's full in the [ real world ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/nov/16/uk-voters-want-single-market-access-and-immigration-controls-poll-finds ) since you voted that stuff , but maybe you 're starting to get what exiting meant . 
  you were a burden when you were in the eu ( and never forget , you begged to enter the eec , which became the eu decades later , and were a founding state in the actual eu , so you were literally a part in every decision that led to the eu of today , but you have short memory ) , now that you 're out we finally do n't have to deal with you anymore . 
  also i see how much you like to be in control , you just passed some protofascist laws that limit your personal liberties and privacy rights lol , you got brainwashed and buttfucked and did n't even notice . 
  mamma mia to you too, 
  i 'm not british, 
  page 3 girls are gon na have a fun time though . 
  maybe they 'll start watching themselves in the mirror, 
  quite so , since eu were crystal clear since the beginning . 
  the little crying and spoiled baby was the country you 're from , not who stayed by its word during all these months . 
  even more of a confirmation of how delusional you are is how you cowardly avoided to answer to the way more articulate post of / u/manthew , but replied to me right after my post . 
  laughable . 
  it will be real bad , expecially if they wo n't be able to make new deals with other countries and institutions , now that the eu is lost . 
  yeah , but a successful negotiation for both parties happens when the two parties are even . 
  they are not . 
  but they wanted a scapegoat and found it in the eu . 
  now that they got rid of it they will have to face reality and it wo n't be easy , so they still have to tell themselves some fairytales . 
   it 's about being adult about the situation , not a petulant little brat . 
  wow , that is just delusional, 
  we 'll get over it, 
  nah , he 's just being pedantic, 
  i did n't say it 's only like french , has a lot of terms in common, 
  piedmontese is also a lot like french , not only valdostano, 
  fine by me, 
   defend your rights to be humans . 
  ftfy but yeah , in your egoistical society it 's fully understandable how you forget that . 
  take your altright , racist bullshit out of here please . 
  it only sounds pathetically funny from a country full of such cowards that first ruin other countries with made up reasons or their own interests , then refuse to help them and leave them in ruin after doing whatever they please and even feel the right to bitch about other countries policies when they decide to not be miserable pussies and let other human beings die . 
  grow a pair and learn to deal with the problem you created before talking . 
  then people undestand it 's said by an australian , and not any aussie , but the one which designed some of the ( if not the ) most inhumane and criminal immigration policies among the 1st world and disrespectful towards human rights and one has only to laugh . 
  conceding anything to the uk would mean mining the foundations of ue . 
  even if that is of the 5th economy in the world , forgetting that the ue got anyway the 4th , 6th , 8th and various positions under that making us as a whole the second biggest . 
  and what uk buys you say ? 
  please . 
  to take on your example ( which was made many times already and debunked many more ) uk buys almost all his gears and components for cars from ye old europe and the market of imported cars is as big as the one of uk cars to the ue . 
  even in only just that sector uk would have way more to lose , bad example . 
  what uk offers is not fundamental , what buys is anything that could n't be sold elsewhere and its supposed requests are absolutely nothing ue can accept without saying a big `` fuck you '' to each and every one of the other member states . 
  sorry but i only see seek of protagonism and naivete from the english people , a constant seek for attention and a way to say `` hey , we 're here , we matter , look at us !, 
  '' , fact is what uk has to offer after exiting is of no importance compared to the importance of the eu . 
  we understood it 's the 5th biggest economy , that 's what you ( those ? ),

  i guess he was arguing on whether estonia is even a country . 
  which it obviously is n't .

  if you 've something of value to add yes , if not move on . 
  empathy for those who suffer indirectly because of our actions is though . 
   unfortunately you do , so i 'm sorry if some brit stole your significant other when they did a bit of travelling . 
  could n't blame them to be honest because you seem boring mate i 'm not saying you 're terrible people , you 're some of the most polite people i 've ever met among other things . 
  just your women are ugly and your food cancer . 
  you 're a big boy you should be able to cope with criticism . 
   you must 've used it because you like to try and shit on other people , because you could n't even amount to a ` pile ' of shit . 
   also rome did fall but what it did never will . 
  it 's just banter lad . 
  banter which happens to be 100 % true . 
  indeed , and this pluralism of women is ugly as shit . 
  beauty is subjective but a pile of shit is a pile of shit .

  you can cross our borders whenever you want , 
  if sharing european core values is being a far left hippie then pass me that reefer and let 's ball , flower child . 
  yes but at the same time we need the other countries in order to be large enough to impose our will on others . 
  maybe we could have first a military union of the original members ( without the need for approval from the whole eu ) and then other countries will join in for fear of being too weak . 
   my favorite candidate for french election want that , he 's not likely to be elected tho . 
  macron ? 
  i know right . 
  we should say adieu to to nato and join our armies .

  i refuse to believe it , i have too much trust in humanity . 
  italy is one clear example , we 're the only country in europe where a far-right party was n't able gain more than 5-10 % of the votes at the last elections . 
  even though we 're one of the most affected by the refugee crisis and the economic crisis . 
   why are you so quick to assume that any punitive measure against a nuclear power will escalate to nuclear war ? 
  i really doubt it will . 
  but remember we really believed the great war was the war to end all wars . 
   no , just somebody who got stalked by a maniac . 
  obviously she wo n't get murdered , she should worry about getting struck by the lighting instead . 
  you said it 's a maniac , it 's obviously a more urgent threat . 
   it affects the friends , family , co workers , neighbours , children and so many others of the victims . 
  which are still 30 ' 000 people at best ( given 175 victims in 2015 and applying a basic exponential personal ties model ) so it 's 0.006 % relative to the total population . 
  it 's human lives , but statistically speaking , nothing really . 
   you think they twisted their ankle ? 
  these are people who probably got no hearing , who is missing limbs , maybe are paralysed , who are filled with metal scraps in their body who they ca n't get out , people with ptsd , maybe blind people and much more . 
  oh c'mon cut the bullshit already . 
   if a young girl walks through some dark alley , i wo n't blame her if cancer is n't the things that makes her bones rattle . 
  but we 're not walking in some dark alley , we 're at home sitting in literally the safest house in the world ( the eu countries have the lowest murder rate in the world , even after accounting for terrorist attacks ) . 
  it 's also the period of time with the lowest number of terrorist attacks in europe since wwii . 
   there will always be people more susceptible to manipulation than others . 
  and that 's why it 's our duty to promote discussion and celebrate factual information . 
  we do n't want to apply long-term solutions to short-term problems . 
   it 's easier to take punitive action against another state or organization than to convince millions of people why and how they 're being misled . 
  easy solutions create more problems . 
  i 'd rather stay as far as we can from nuclear war as i can . 
  in order to do a cross-sectional analysis you do need to gauge different sections of the population separately in order to achieve a more realistic randomised sample . 
  this is feasible mostly because we already know how population ( and not just sample ) indicators ( mostly national censuses ) are distributed . 
  i studied statistics for three years and majored in econometrics . 
   because she got stalked by some maniac i 'm not blaming actual victims . 
  do n't be ridiculous . 
   it 's about a foreign group forces down the absolute worst parts of war down civilians throat in the safest places on earth which affects so little people it 's basically as if it did n't happen . 
   if i ever got into contact with a venoumous snake that 's the point , you have n't been bitten , you only know there is a snake somewhere . 
  in a 50km radius . 
  go ahead , cry for help , but do n't get mad if i call you stupid . 
  it would be incredibly hard to crunch statistics from a 500 million continent asked in different languages if everybody could answer however it pleases them . 
  are you alright mate ? 
  certainly not for those in maastricht . 
  not my kind of humour . 
  it was everywhere on the eu bodies pages , i thought a fair amount of people saw it . 
  also i could n't be bothered . 
   it 's something that have a scarier effect on peoples life but it should n't . 
  it 's like when everybody was scared of flying in a plane , until it became a known fact how unlikely that is . 
  sharks are fucking scary , but as long as i know that it is virtually impossible for me to be attacked by one i will swim peacefully . 
  or at least not check it as the greatest threat on a eu survey . 
  or global warming . 
  there were actually more than 10 options . 
  but this does n't make sense , far-right parties gain momentum if people are afraid of terrorist attacks regardless of these happen or not . 
  still , not really something we should be worried about .

  if you do it anyway , then it is a subversive action which , i bet , is punished by law . 
  arrests and state of emergency would follow , and if you resist it , then it 's a rebellion . 
  which means civil war . 
   like free speech , gay rights . 
  i do n't think an overwelming majority of italians support free speech and gay rights . 
  we have a lot of people who want the monarchy back or who think the dictatorship would be better for us . 
  we do n't have jus solis . 
  as a matter of fact , we have a lot of second generation without citizenship . 
  did the uk risked a us sponsored coup ? 
  yes , because belgium and sweden are more politically relevant than us . 
  or maybe our intelligence is just better than the british one . 
  splitting a country means war . 
  totally useless . 
  to you maybe . 
  we actuall expell who spread islamist bullshit or express isis simpathies on facebook . 
  and the sources are us reports . 
  lol, 
   he would not comment on whether or not the attackers were known to the police or intelligence services , citing ongoing efforts to confirm their identities . 
   however , a woman who lives in the block that was raided told the guardian she had expressed concerns to barking police about the man 's extremist opinions . 
  erica gasparri said she had gone to the police two years ago after she feared the man was radicalising children in a local park . 
   `` i took four photographs of him and gave them to the [ local ] police , '' gasparri said . 
  `` they rang scotland yard when i was there and said the information had been passed on . 
  they were very concerned . 
   `` they told me to delete the photos for my own safety , which i did , but then i heard nothing . 
  that was two years ago . 
  no one came to me . 
  if they did , this could have been prevented and lives could have been saved . '' now everyone knows her name . 
  i 'd say it would be acceptable as dessert . 
  33-45 was pretty stable . 
  was it nutella ? 
  or maybe british armed forces and intelligence are just that bad . 
  fucking bitch . 
  she 's worse than tatcher . 
  and in italian . 
  that 's not true . 
  i 'm left winger and i do n't support self determination . 
  the spanish goverment is your goverment, 
  uhm , in 1674 messina rebelled against spain allying itself with france . 
   pasta is from china no , it 's not . 
  nedved, 
  the room with a backstory got sacked and destroyed by the allies . 
  how is this even a thing ? 
  actually , pricing something at 9.99 $ instead of 10 $ has an influence over the mind of the consumer . 
  remove pita !, 
  i hate sand . 
  the fuck we are behind germany . 
  a military occupation is not a conquest . 
  no , which also bothers me a lot . 
  both terms go completely against our grammar . 
  good point , tho . 
  even if you are right and there is a differentiation of meaning when used in italian , we should write it as `` selfi '' , not `` selfie '' . 
  pay attention to the media , expecially the journalist . 
  in the last years they are introducing a series of loanwords that are ultimately useless because they do n't introduce a new way to communicate something , but just replace totally acceptable italian words . 
  like selfie , when we could say `` autoscatto '' . 
  and that 's one out of many . 
  also , the italianization of foreign words is disappearing . 
  no , publication is in english . 
  or better , if you want to have some visibility , you are recommended to publish in english . 
  but you can also hire someone to translate the research you want to publish . 
  no , not italian students attend separate courses . 
  normally . 
  because you ca n't translate academic articles , you must read and write in them in english otherwise all the knowledge would be lost . 
  ah , shut up . 
   the number of people who can speak it is rising . 
  sadly . 
  not true at all . 
  it happens in some universities , like the politecnico in milan , but it 's not a rule . 
  language is not just a tool for communication . 
  you hate your country so much you want it to lose its culture over another dominant language , like it happened in ireland or the american continent after the european colonization ? 
  are you fucking serious ? 
   your country 's a fucking embarrassment when it comes to speaking any kind of foreign language . 
  thank god , at least my cultural identity is safe . 
   we 'd much prefer never to be associated with your inbred level of education . 
  lol , this is the dumbest thing i 've read in a while on reddit . 
   today the language of academics is english we are talking about university classes . 
  about dutch students having to receive their education in a foreign language . 
  in the world . 
  farmers are among the lowest of social classes . 
  people like to think that jobs useful to society makes you earn money and respect . 
  one thing is investing money and living off the revenue of the farmer 's work , another thing is to work the soil and watching over the sheeps . 
   you can only see so many of your fellow soldiers disemboweled before before they bomb the shit out of you , turning the soil unfertile and not allowing life to grow again in latvia . 
  the number of times citizens have managed to defeat an organized army are ... very low . 
  and you will never have enough money to improve the quality of your life , to afford ... i do n't know , a nice car ? 
  a nice tv ? 
  a nice computer ? 
   get respect from people wat . 
  it 's also a life of sacrifices and no rewards . 
   salman abedi such a typical english name . 
  some scenes of star wars i the phantom menace were shooted there . 
  the royal palace was the setting for the naboo palace . 
  the mountain behind it should be the mt. 
  tifata , where hannibal camped during the siege of capua . 
  floki , not loki, 
   killing infidels is an act of war yes . 
  terrorist is the name we gave to them . 
  but they are jihadists . 
   you better be `` trigger happy '' if your fellow nato ally comes under attack ... or else ... ? 
   i have little doubt that america would answer the call to arms . 
  and you should n't doubt germany . 
  you are the only country to have ever triggered the nato article 5 .

   but i still have n't understood what happened there was a riot at a german refugee shelter . 
   who was fighting who some of the refugees in the center were generally vandalising the place and at times were throwing furniture at the police , who shows up in several scenes . 
   what were the reasons allegedly , the defacing of a qu ` ran . 
   i might gather more if i 'd understood german or arab . 
  i agree op should have provided a translation of the video title and description , and i would have agreed with a temporary delisting until that was done ( or a perpetual delisting if that was n't done ) . 
   i obviously jumped to the completely unfounded conclusion that if you want something removed then it is because you do n't want it to be there . 
  no , you jumped to the conclusion that if i want something removed it 's because i do n't like it ( do you like cake ? 
  would you want half your desk covered in cake ? 
  then you do n't like cake right ? ) . 
  right here :  because you do n't like seeing it . 
  so now you 've gone from inventing what my position is supposed to be to retroactively reinventing what you said ? 
  sorry , i do n't have time to waste arguing this way . 
  several people , including many who disagree with me , have been able to have a discussion with me without constantly misunderstanding my position , so there clearly is n't a problem with how i write . 
  good bye . 
  did you mean to reply to someone else ? 
  your post seems to be an answer to a question , but not the one in my post . 
   how can a lot of different people wanting to discuss different aspects of a topic be described as flooding ? 
  it can be described as flooding when that content takes up a majority of the space on the front page , to the detriment of the visibility of other content . 
   having around 4-5 try 8-10 . 
   it 's all voted on so these are the things people want to talk about . 
  because reddit voting is optional , at most you can say that this is what people who are interested in immigration-related content want to see . 
  which is not a very good guidelines about the entirety of the subreddit . 
   because you do n't like seeing it i 'm not interested in defending what you keep making up as my argument . 
   one suspects that you would n't call having multiple articles on the front page on any other topic such as tourism , local customs/culture or politics as flooding . 
  you keep inventing what i 'm supposed to believe rather than challenging what i 've actually said . 
   complaining about the fact that there is the rule about content flooding and it 's not being enforced . 
  it 's literally exactly what i wrote , as you quoted :  your anti-flooding rules are widely disregarded the rest is your own elaboration . 
  i do n't think that only immigration-related content should be restricted if there is an anti-flooding rule in effect , but rather all content that is flooding the frontpage . 
  at the moment , the flooding comes from immigration-related content , so it 's what i brought up . 
   i never mentioned nazi 's in my post . 
  and ? 
  context matters . 
  the only anti-immigration people shown in the video are nazis . 
  posting a top-level comment saying that `` being anti-immigration is not racist '' immediately implies that according to you the people in the video are not racist . 
   i was unaware of and i was unaware that you were unaware . 
  but now you know that the people in the video are nazis , so how does it surprise you that people are bringing it up in reply to your comment ? 
   by taking the sarcastic part seriously no , genius , it 's precisely the implication of your sarcasm that i was criticizing . 
   ok then i admit i have no idea what you meant by this in the context of reddit and similarly organized boards , a thread is a specific sequences of posts , each one replying to the other . 
  within reddit , each top-level comment starts a thread , which has its own subthreads . 
   regardless my point still stands , you ca n't handle reading posts you disagree with your point does n't stand because you have n't made it . 
  you 've stated twice now that i ca n't `` handle '' reading such and such , but you 've provided no argument to support this . 
  my arguments for removing racist content are there for anyone to read in this very thread , and i 've now suggested it twice that you do so . 
   how do we know they are racists because they are literally nazis . 
  you know , nazis ? 
  the guys who built their entire ideology over the idea that their race was superior and all others should be exterminated or made subservient ? 
  who started a war over the idea that their race should be unified within their empire , and that they should colonise eastern europe and exterminate its population of inferior slavic subhumans ? 
  yes , these are supporters of those guys . 
  that 's how we know they are racists . 
   i 'm living in the twilight zone !, 
  in the usa , blacks in the street doing the exact same thing are glorified as protestors you are indeed living in the twilight zone if you think that black rioters in the us are not massively despised and widely condemned . 
   whites doing same thing in europe nazis , not whites . 
  they do n't get to claim a representativeness that they do n't have . 
   a dozen of skinheads throwing stones like the antifa and spout some slogans . 
  oh dang , let 's organize a candle march and dance against nationalism !, 
  so it 's ok to throw stones and shout nazi slogans , but we need to deride people who organize candle marches against nazism ? 
  cognitive dissonance much ? 
   titles and descriptions can be editorialized . 
  which goes for any sort of content at all . 
  any page linked here could lie or misrepresent information , hell major newspapers sometimes say outright bullshit . 
  is this the case though ? 
  if it is , then the post should be removed for containing false information . 
  but that 's not why it was removed , nor was it what you were arguing originally . 
   til it 's now racist to be anti-immigration . 
  it is in fact racist , and has been for decades , to be a neo-nazi . 
   so you want the story most people on this subreddit want to talk about to be impossible and stuck in a smaller subreddit no one uses . 
  you must have read someone else 's comments because i 've never once mentioned a smaller subreddit . 
   well , it really does not provide a lot of information though . 
  come on now . 
  in any other case , unfiltered footage of some momentous event would be considered prime quality content . 
  i understand why it is n't seen the same way now : because while in most other cases the video would be balanced against some other assessment or point of view of the events , with the particular topic of immigration and islam a lot of the reaction is simply `` see ? 
  fuck those savages !, 
  it 's not because it did n't provide a lot of information . 
  we 've had months of combat footage from ukraine which provided just about as much context as this , oftentimes even less ( with people wondering who those in the video were , where they were operating , what exactly was happening ) , and it was all fine ( at most , a megathread was started because there was so much ukraine-related content on the front page ) . 
  content should be removed on its own demerits , not because of the reaction it might provoke . 
  this video does show something that most people have never seen , which as far as i know was n't shown in news articles . 
  is it likely to incite anti-immigration people , and also racists ? 
  yes , of course . 
   it provides literally 0 information about the where , what and why . 
  except it literally does n't . 
  the `` where '' is right there in the title , the `` what '' can be seen in the video , the `` why '' is apparent from the video description ( of which i think op should have provided an english translation , yes ) . 
   that does n't justify censorship though . 
  who 's talking about censorship ? 
  i 've explained why mods do n't have time to link all the duplicates when removing a post for that reason . 
   the post in itself is just an excuse for the racists to come and spout their shit and flood the sub with their propaganda . 
  in which case the racist comments should be removed ( i reported several myself ) , not the post itself , especially not under as unrelated a rule as `` low quality content '' ( unless we want to establish a rule against low-quality video , which i do n't think makes sense on a non-video subreddit ) . 
   as a future mod , that should be obvious to you . 
  i have my opinions about why a 0-day account posted that specific video and followed it up with decidedly , let 's say , clear-minded comments . 
  that does n't mean that i think moderation should prosecute intentions rather than actions . 
  i think racist comments should be removed ; i think flooding should be stopped ; i think brigading should be dealt with . 
  i do n't think we should at all remove content on the sole basis that it might incite racists ( unless that content is breaking some other rule , of course ) . 
   what is the alternative there 's an entire subthread right within this one where i discuss precisely this . 
  it 's not a shitpost . 
  99 % of people have never seen what a riot like this looks like , and religious intolerance within and among refugee comuties is a relevant topic no matter which side of the debate you are on . 
  and that 's all good but there are only so many things you can do with a limited amount of man-hours . 
  the mod team is currently heavily understaffed . 
  i 'm probably the biggest complainer about racism in / r/europe and i was again the recent moderation change , but even i do n't find anything wrong with that submission . 
   in italy asking a solution for the immigration problem mean to be racists the leading party in asking for a `` solution '' to the immigration problem has high ranking members who unashamedly call black people `` bingo bongo `` s , so you might see where one could get the impression that there 's a racism problem with the anti-immigration front . 
  also :  it 's probable probable my ass , the people throwing stones at the refugees were literally neonazis . 
  it 's `` probable '' that neonazis are n't racist ? 
  lol,

  at the olympics for example , we win at least 1 medal in judo . 
  british grammar at school but i know a lot of american slang words so i sometimes do a mixture of both . 
  when i write anyway i prefer the `` british '' words . 
  maybe , but at least we directly go to the final, 
  san marino is a bunch of italians who do n't feel italians and that sends bad songs at the eurovision song contest, 
  it depends . 
  police may be seen as a bunch of men who do n't really care about doing their work , who sometimes abuse of their power , or as a good and trusted force . 
  personally , many police officers do n't really do a good job , but that happens in every job i guess . 
  non-practicing christian , who does n't pay attention to religion that much , confused about the existence of god , so i like to consider myself an agnostic . 
  do n't be disrespectful to the monuments or to the museums . 
  writing your name into the colosseum or taking a bath in the trevi fountain it 's not cool , it 's a dickmove . 
  that actually does n't surprise me , only about hospitality or even about other things ? 
  oh god this definitely sounds like italian-english ahahah, 
  sardinia . 
  you would be surprised to know how many people think that and how many times i 've heard someone saying that if we kept the lira our economical system would be better . 
  i was thinking about it but i honestly watched it and i found it really boring ... 
  i mean , it also won an academy award but , i do n't know , it 's very hard to watch . 
  it depends . 
  we are very hospitable if you are a good person , be an idiot and you are screwed . 
  the ones you said are also beautiful films !, 
  personally , i really love [ the intouchables ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_intouchables ) . 
  it 's probably not the best french film ever but it 's pretty genuine , clever and funny . 
  i always watch it when they broadcast it on tv . 
  i love it too , it 's different from the other holocaust films , it 's both sad and funny . 
  it talks about a hard topic with simplicity and sweetness . 
  it shows the cruelty of that time to jews but without making it too harsh . 
  it 's beautiful . 
  * [ ** life is beautiful ** ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/life_is_beautiful ) ( 1997 ) it 's a comedy-drama film directed by and starring roberto benigni , who co-wrote the film with vincenzo cerami . 
  the main character is a jewish italian book shop owner , who employs his fertile imagination to shield his son from the horrors of internment in a nazi concentration camp . 
  the film was a critical and financial success , winning benigni the academy award for best actor as well as the academy award for best original dramatic score and the academy award for best foreign language film at the 71st academy awards . 
  * [ ** la dolce vita ** ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/la_dolce_vita ) ( 1960 ) it 's a comedy-drama film directed and co-written by federico fellini . 
  the film follows marcello rubini , a journalist writing for gossip magazines , over seven days and nights on his journey through the `` sweet life '' of rome in a fruitless search for love and happiness . 
  la dolce vita won the palme d'or ( golden palm ) at the 1960 cannes film festival and the oscar for best costumes , and remains one of the most critically acclaimed films of all time * [ ** the good , the bad and the ugly ** ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_good,_the_bad_and_the_ugly ) ( 1966 ) i think you know this for sure . 
  it 's an epic spaghetti western film directed by sergio leone , starring clint eastwood , lee van cleef , and eli wallach in the title roles respectively . 
  it 's one of the most influential western films and one of the greatests of all time . 
  its soundtrack , composed by ennio morricone , is one of the most iconic film 's score ever made . 
  should i add anything else ? 
  does `` one '' list count as `` one '' thing ? 
  1 ) the influence the church and christians have to our political decisions . 
  2 ) the fear of diversity against homosexuals and black people . 
  3 ) the corruption and the mentality that it 's cooler not paying taxes than actually paying them , also the fact that if you do n't do that you are doing a sort of `` rebellion '' against the government . 
  4 ) the freedom of the press to talk about certain topics . 
  5 ) the educational system that literally stresses the shit out of kids without preparing them to the world of work . 
  also , the way some teachers prefer and tend to help more the sons of rich adults , discriminating the others , how some people are completely inadequate to teach , and how studying is considered `` stupid '' and useless while copying is clever . 
  6 ) how our national tv is focused too much to an old audience and does n't pay attention to younger generations . 
  7 ) how eu is seen as a `` trap '' and how many people think that the situation would be better if we did n't join it . 
  also , how many people think that when there was `` him '' italy was better than now with a democracy . 
  8 ) how many people do n't care about the environment , pollute the beaches and throw the garbage in the streets . 
  9 ) the general ignorance . 
  10 ) final thing , how many people complain about everything that happens in italy when they are the first to not do anything to improve our situation , maybe making it worse . 
  honestly at the moment i think we have n't done anything `` bad '' . 
  we had problems before and we still have problems , we did nothing worse or better . 
  when someone dies they usually put the body in a coffin without closing it , then they bring it inside a room called `` camera ardente '' , literally `` burning room '' ( do n't know the exact noun in english , sorry ) , where the relatives and close people of the victim can `` visit '' the gone person and say a last goodbye . 
  at the end of the day they close it . 
  the funeral is held in a church of choice where it 's celebrated a mass to remember the dead , everybody brings flowers and place them near the coffin . 
  when it finishes everybody goes outside and waits for the coffin to be brought inside the hearse . 
  the hearse goes directly to the cemetery and everybody follows it with their own car . 
  at the cemetery the body is buried by the gravedigger and all the people stand near to it waiting for it to be covered by the ground . 
  at the end of it , everybody goes maybe at a caf\u00e9 or everywhere else because it 's tradition that after a funeral you have to go into another place to `` ward off evil . '', 
  then everybody goes home . 
  for the first months a ceremony is held the day the person died to remember him/her . 
  than each year it 's celebrated an anniversary . 
  what 's more european than an european rock group called europe ? 
  [ love love peace peace ] ( https://youtu.be/amgw54hbos0 ) has a special place in our hearts also : [ marc-antoine charpentier - te deum ] ( https://youtu.be/iwu37osokqa ) this is the official ebu theme song, 
  i never bothered about it but i have friends that watched me like a weirdo when i told them . 
  i wish it was a bit more like that, 
  walking naked , maybe after a shower , or only wearing underwear in front of your parents or siblings . 
  when i was in spain the taxi-driver started talking about politics while driving . 
  that 's understandable and not surprising though , also here everything the government does is considered bad and gets criticized , also on facebook there are two types of people : * the ones who offend italians * the ones who offend who offend italians many people think that we have one of the most beautiful cultures in the world but we are the first to hate it . 
  i think it 's just the theory that the grass of the neighbor is always greener, 
  it looks like you have never been to italy, 
  what you said is really helpful !, 
  i know it 's not easy but it 's the only thing i 'm sure i 've always liked doing . 
  now i 'm continuously trying to improve my english , that is the essential , and then i would like to study ( apart from french and spanish ) maybe german and russian . 
  asian languages are also very interesting although they are way harder to learn , but chinese and japanese will be more important than they are right now , as well as arabic . 
  who knows , i still have a couple years to decide what to do but i 'm almost completely sure this is what i want . 
  thanks !, 
  i have always liked studying english since primary school and that 's also why i use reddit a lot , it 's a good way to improve my skills, 
  i mean , it depends . 
  it 's not only that you would not do that in front of an elderly couple or in a restaurant it 's also the way you do . 
  if you for example are in a bus and start screaming bad words everybody will think you are rude . 
  swearing , if used in the right moment is not that big deal , honestly when i 'm in a restaurant and i speak to someone , if i want to , i swear . 
  also with all the beautiful dialect words we have , why not use them ? 
  do n't know right now , i love foreign languages so i would definitely like to study them and maybe become a translator but i still have time to decide . 
  aargh , i forgot them . 
  i spent almost 30 minutes trying to cover the image with `` pizza '', 
  the comments ahah , poor dude , hope he had a nice stay in ireland, 
  yes we have them . 
  wiki says they were introduced into the us from china and then they were spread around the world . 
  i think that after all germany is the worst victim of ww2 . 
  the following years were frightening . 
  ah yeah , the dude that thought he was hercules, 
  italians descend from every population that lived in italy , not only lombards . 
  i do n't get the downvote anyway, 
  i was waiting someone to notice it, 
  holocaust obviously and the italian colonies in africa . 
  a stupid waste of people . 
  i 'm mainly ashamed of what italians have done to italy itself , all the domestic terrorism like the murder of giovanni falcone and paolo borsellino , two judges that were fighting the mafia in sicily , or the terrorist attack in bologna held by neo-fascist that is the fourth deadliest terrorist attack in western europe . 
  the after war was sometimes worse than the actual war . 
  brutus that killed julius caesar destroying our lovely roman empire,

  we retire at 67 . 
  i doubt that william knows this but we are going to be lazy anyway for him . 
  we are paying more than the uk since forever . 
  do n't know why . 
  i just know we have bad pr since everyone here thinks we are a receiver . 
  why the hell ? 
  he is the president of the european council . 
  his job is about the whole eu . 
  on the international stage yes , inside the eu not at all . 
  it seems to me `` the eu '' does n't want to give debt relief no matter what , with or without cuts . 
  he is too old . 
  our prisons are full of people so we have a law that prevent really old people to go in prison ( except mafia stuff i think ) . 
  lol, 
  yes , that criminal . 
  probably the worst president we ever had . 
  it is . 
  i would take berlusconi over grillo ( 25 % according to the polls ) or salvini ( 15 % ) anytime . 
  about the gdp . . if he lives in the south the gdp is the same of greece . 
  probably because of the popularity of english . 
  yes i 'm pretty sure a job at prada or ferrari is safe no matter what . 
  you know right that italy did n't receive any bailout and is a creditor ? 
  yes it is the point . 
  the amount of refugees in calais is marginal but is receiving a lot of attention only 'cause it 's about the uk and so the english media are pushing this . 
  italy , like france , is a south europe country . 
  same here . 
  he is saying this only since 4 years ago . 
  'cause a lot of italians do n't realize that we put around the same amount of money of germany per capita . 
  the storytelling is that germany is the only one who have credits . 
  unfortunatly it 's not only in italy that this storytelling is going on . 
  i really do n't get why people downvote you . 
  seems people really do n't get what up/downvote means . 
  anyway that `` everyone '' is a bit extreme . 
  let 's say 70-30 . 
  compared to uk/france/spain it is really not . 
  a bureaucrat extremely boring . 
  do you know right that since the birth of the eu the transfers go from west to east and not north to south ? 
  who was the runner up ? 
  draghi or juncker ? 
  so where should we place them ? 
  with what money ? 
  we send them in madagascar ? 
  this is your carefully thought idea ? 
   i mean i am from poland , my country was never a colonial empire , we did no harm to africans and we have no moral obligation to help them . 
  why should we pay for them now ? 
  i am from italy , my country never had any conflict with russia , my country has never been helped by any eastern europe country so we have no moral obligation to help them . 
  why should we sanctions russia and lose tons of money/jobs ? 
  the asnwer to both of these questions is : we joined the eu so we could be part of a larger entity , if one of his component is threatened by an external threat all the countries should help it or what 's the whole point of an union ? 
  and it 's not even french . 
  aahahah yes so reasonable . 
  thank you !, 
  this explain a lot and i think you are right . 
  mafia is a big problem in italy , no doubt , but it would n't affect a tourist or a retired man in any way . 
  it 's not that they are going to kidnap or threat a british . 
  i also doubt the cost of living in andalusia is lower than the one in puglia/sicily . 
  south italy is poor . 
  when you see a gdp/ppp per capita map of italy you should think '' +40 % in the north , -40 % in the south '' . 
  the third reason seems a good one . 
  i never understood why you guys like go there and not in south italy in retirement . 
  the weather and the sea is just the same . 
  we are the only country that did n't put himself `` most compassionate '' too . 
  it seems we are the most objective . 
  without an industry . 
  we are the country with the highest consumption of television ( thank mister b ) . 
  the reason is that italy was unified only 150 years ago . 
  we had a huge history of little realms with different cultures . 
  take for example the republic of venice , it lasted for centuries . 
  this does n't go away in 40 years of tv . 
  we have corsica back !, 
  no or we would have already done that . 
  no we are not talking about 40k . 
  40k were just the start . 
  more than 70k already arrived here from libya and the summer has just begun . 
  well , if those were the numbers you are right . 
  the point is that it really does n't seem that your country wants to accept the number proportionally with the rest . 
  it seems your country just does n't want even one of them . 
  ok but i think you agree with me that the eu as a whole has more power to change these conventions than italy alone . 
  i would like the eu start paying for the centers where we have to keep them , bureaucracy/rescue/health costs . 
  i would like that the eu decide if we can send them away ( we ca n't now ) or if not i would like the eu provide a common solution ( quota ) . 
  i would like renzi to veto sanctions on russia , not because i believe they are wrong but because it seems the only `` weapon '' we have . 
  eastern europe countries are blocking any solution 'cause they belive it 's not their problem . 
  well , too easy pretend the others help you and then never help others . 
  it 's around 70-30 for the civil unions . 
  60-40 gay marriage . 
  40-60 adoption . 
  are people from the italian speaking part less in favor than the one from the french or german part ? 
  or do you think is the same ? 
  is eritrea a country where the boats can start their journey ? 
  spain does n't have any burden . 
  france & the uk did n't bomb marocco . 
  how can we change the law if half european countries veto it 'cause they prefer the status quo ? 
  do you have another brilliant comment ? 
  is it really so hard to understand that , by international law , we ca n't ? 
  i know . 
  but if nothing will come from the eu he will have to decide between play hardball or no longer being the prime minister of italy . 
  well after yesterday i just hope renzi will remove sanctions on russia . 
  unbelivable the level of selfishness from them . 
  ahahah yes i wan na see they closing the border with the third economy in the schengen area . 
  we do n't like also destroy our export with russia , still we did it . 
  it 's not that you do only what you like in this world . 
  i think only the second one but i could be wrong .

  or perhaps i see the hypocrisy in all of this ? 
  99.9 % of the population is just too poor to afford living in such a city , and the remaining 0.1 % is just * too rich * to such peasant lives . 
  also , you do n't seem to take into account the special geographical , industrial and economic position of uae http://www.thegazelle.org/issue/4/opinion/chumley/, 
  city is going to be 100 % complete in another decade indeed . 
  but first inhabitants were scheduled to arrive [ 6 years ago ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/masdar_city ) . 
  said when populace think the opposite . 
  when their view supports your position though it 's called democracy , right ? 
  a * ghost * city built by slaves http://www.fastcoexist.com/3035446/eerie-video-shows-masdar-city-the-sustainable-city-of-the-future-has-no-one-in-it, 
  also known as [ omert\u00e0 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/omert%c3%a0 ), 
  http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/regions/data/database ^ ^ under ^ ^ reg_ilc, 
  you know , bildberg , nwo , illuminati , and shit . 
  junker has obviously been sent by reptilians, 
   * we are willing to let * [ ... ] is n't assad only allowing russians to help with ground troops ? 
   hinkley point c has a feed in tariff of # 0.09250 / kwh which is $ 0.13 / kwh . 
  hinkley has a strike price . 
  do n't know how you calculate the rest . 
  ps : it 's pointless to compare unhedged power prices ( which would be 0.05 # / kwh ) with normal retail fit and all  i was actually wrong , that 's higher than all new photovoltaic installations in germany : http://www.jm-projektinvest.com/de/de/photovoltaik/einspeiseverguetung[ also , please , there are even us states with lower consumer prices than that subsidy itself . 
  it 's outrageous . 
   consumer electricity prices are so high in germany because of taxes and because the guaranteed feed in tariff needs to be financed man . . you realize that if the feed in tariff ( that still ca n't manage to keep prices low ) is financed with the same money that raise costs , then you have a double problem ? 
  it 's completely fucked up, 
  i linked the pages with the final elaborated charts . 
  then of course if you want to calculate this yourself , that 's where the fun really begins . 
  but the information * is * there , it 's not like iea is used to talk of flying ping . 
  there , notice , i linked you the exact page !, 
  * suprise * !, 
  well , they are incredibly [ strong ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/nuclear/comments/3r2s1a/russia_is_building_a_global_nuclear_power_empire/ ) in the nuclear sector : s, 
   the future guaranteed feed in tariff at hinkley point c is already higher than today 's guaranteed feed in tariff for larger photovoltaic installations in germany and way higher than the one for wind power stop this bullshit . 
  i ca n't even see this having physical sense , considering electricity in germany cost [ 50 % more ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/energy_price_statistics#electricity_prices_for_household_consumers ) than in uk . 
  and it 's pretty easy , you know , to have lower prices , when state already paid half or even more of your investment , like for [ wind ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3ntpph/wind_power_is_now_the_cheapest_electricity_to ), 
  ok , indeed you are right . 
  it 's like a religion . 
  they * feel something * , and they follow that , without questioning . 
  that 's why you have statisticians to assess said risk . 
  and it 's [ fucking low ] ( http://cordis.europa.eu/project/rcn/73947_en.html ) ^ ^ rs2b ^ ^ d7 .1 ^ ^ pp. 31 . 
  it 's called [ radiophobia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/radiophobia ) . 
  you can measure electric energy even in pj , you know . 
  after all w is j/s . 
  and wh is w * h, 
  http://www.iea.org/publications/freepublications/publication/projected_costs.pdf#67 then , if you are talking about hinkley , you should see that 's probably the first epr ever built ( which how may we say ... was n't exactly the best design they could think ) , but other geniii reactors are doing well , for example in china . 
  also , i should remember you that even its strike price , is still lower than every other low carbon alternative ( and i would n't know compared to fossil fuels , after you account for their externalities ), 
  honestly , i just stick to idea the op gave me . 
  center secular parties do n't burn flags or assault asian people and proprieties . 
  and especially *** not *** * because somebody denied ramadam rights * . 
  mhh i do n't think you are right , cause if votes just moved between mhp and akp , these two parties could still form an coalition alone . 
  and * this * would be way ** more ** of a fuck up . 
  so what 's your argument ? 
  better a hitler than an erdogan ? 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/grey_wolves_%28organization%29 indeed , you seem to speak wisely . 
   any loss of seats from akp would be a good thing except if those votes go to mhp i guess, 
  somewhat remember me the case of russia . 
  denying rights is a thing i suppose legally , being directly responsible for somebody 's death is another . 
  you do n't get death penalty only by being gay ( because punishing crimethoughts is a bit difficult i guess ) the actual offense is homosexual ^ ^ usually ^ ^ just ^ ^ between ^ ^ men intercourse . 
   this one was a convicted terrorist who could not be deported for fear that he might be harmed in his native county . 
  little correction : he could have received death sentence ^ [ 1 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rafik_y ) thanks to fantastic middle eastern laws . 
  [ here you are ] ( http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getdoc.do?pubref=-%2f%2fep%2f%2fnonsgml%2bpv%2b20151029%2bres-rcv%2bdoc%2bpdf%2bv0%2f%2fen&amp;language=en#page=10 ) [ , ] ( http://www.europarl.europa.eu/plenary/en/votes.html?tab=votes ) name by name . 
  hazard , right . 
  coal downsides on the other hand are a costant . 
  the second probably causes less problems, 
  on wiki https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/wendelstein_7-x edit : also , [ this nice askscience ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/3pwetp/in_nuclear_fusion_why_is_a_stellarator_so_warped/ ) regarding its shape . 
  italian translation . 
  also check the op , you seem to miss a link in that * the common people * il 27 ottobre voterai sul futuro di internet . 
   ~ ~ a big part of your population will be scared because ~ ~ ** the future ** ~ ~ out of the eu ~ ~ ** is unpredictable ** ~ ~ as a result they will choose to stay ~ ~ . 
  ftfy, 
  now , if only i could find the interview where putin said he was completely looking forward to dutch investigation . . 
  http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/appeal_to_consequences you do n't claim x has no sense because y does n't like it . 
  so y has nothing to do in the debate . 
   now multiply that quantity by 40 years or more of operation of each reactor during its working life . 
  that 's 120 m \u00b3 ( and also 320 twh ) which is absolutely a sand grain , compared to nowadays pollute standards . 
   the amount is n't small , as i said before spain pays areva 65,000 $ per day ( 24m $ per year ) and our nuclear capacity is rather low . 
  do n't tell me . 
  italy has not even nuclear capacity , but it 's still paying for * indefinite * storage ( just not areva though )  my only point is that it 's far from being the perfect and cheap energy source many people think it is , just due to the popular belief . 
  really ? 
  last time i checked [ popular belief ] ( http://www.behindenergy.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/report-costi-energia-rev3.pdf#10 ) here was that it 's even worse than coal :| coal !, 
   and it will only get worse since uranium is a limited resource ( with very few producers/exporters ) that 's why reprocessing makes even more sense . 
  and there 's thorium then . 
   and renewable technologies are more efficient ( cheaper ) every day . 
  https://xkcd.com/605/  perhaps , still it 's a long road till sun can shine at night . 
   there are plenty of renewables plants without subsidies . 
  let me check : kenya , djibouti , chile , rwanda for solar . . then mexico , uruguay and jordan for wind . 
  do you see what this bs is into ? 
  it 's not rocket science that the more and more you approach equator the more solar yield increase . 
  also , it 's not that difficult to beat competitors , when they are diesel generators that cost as `` low '' as $ 250 per mwh . 
  and not to mention that even hell is decentralized in african countries , infrastructure sucks and all . 
  i 'm absolutely sure these kind of plants can make sense there . 
  but let 's just think to developed countries , for a moment ( which was the op argument btw ) . 
  the only one `` touched '' by your source is spain , or even more specifically just [ this ] ( http://english.grupoenerpro.es/project/marchena/ ) . 
  of the `` five 2mw projects in 2014 '' there 's no mention whatsoever anywhere else . 
  after some research , i believe the author just looked at [ this ] ( http://grupoenerpro.es/unsubsidized-solar-power-gives-it-a-go-in-spain-2/ ) without additional checks ( for example for the usual gp bias ) . 
  the legislation is [ here ] ( http://www.ree.es/en/about-us/regulatory-framework ) if you are interested , but there 's a nice sum up [ here ] ( http://www.holtropblog.com/en/index.php/blog-uk/renewables/306-the-new-law-of-the-electricity-sector-once-again-affects-renewable-energy-investments ) ( in english ) . 
  basically , you are not awarded per unit of energy produced ( fit ) , nor `` subsidized '' ( paid before construction ) . 
  but you still receive a prize when you connect it to the grid . 
  oh , and while i was at it , i even looked for [ wind in spain ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/wind_power_in_spain ) . 
  definitively intriguing considering it had peak of 60 % ( [ 25/12/13 ] ( https://demanda.ree.es/eolicaeng.html ) ) . 
  for the records though , the * same * installed base is ( ~ ~ in this current moment ~ ~ three hours ago ) producing less than 1 % . 
  also , some economic consideration regarding [ build costs ] ( http://spectrum.ieee.org/energy/renewables/lessons-learned-along-europes-road-to-renewables ) could be made  from your report from my report , yes . . but did you look at the linked page ? 
  because it 's subsidies per wh that matters . . is n't it ? 
  like the good old famous [ deaths per wh ] ( http://www.forbes.com/sites/jamesconca/2012/06/10/energys-deathprint-a-price-always-paid/ ) . 
   i think it 's easier for you to give a counterexample of a private plant that is not subsidized . 
  they all have the guarantee that the us government deals with the damage they cause above a certain threshold . 
  well , i guess that by your definition of subside it 's impossible under current [ international treaties ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/economics_of_nuclear_power_plants#insurance ) .

  i think rupert murdoch is the biggest enemy europeans have . 
  maybe even worse than putin . 
  was there a couple months ago - one of the beast pieces of modern architecture i 've ever seen . 
  same here in italy - markings can be used to verify if somebody actually voted as promised ( in exchange for something ... ), 
  if this thing was n't so damn serious for a lot of people who will get screwed , i would really be laughing myself to death for the double disaster the tories were able to accomplish in such a short time . 
  good luck to all the good people in the uk . 
  hmmm ... trump gets impeached , then the new president proves even more of an embarrassment ?? 
  i never like to criticize hard work , but in italy there are many more `` superstrade '' ( ie , non-paid freeways ) than shown here , 
  doh , the one time i shitpost , you call me out like this ? 
  what are you , german or something ?? 
  :d and anyway , deuterium is chemically still hydrogen - just `` heavy '' hydrogen , is n't it ? 
  helium is the combination ( fusion ) of 2 atoms of hydrogen . 
  obviously , if the hydrogen bomb is the most powerful bomb , a bomb made with helium must be twice as powerful ? 
  i heard switzerland has lots of mountains ... 
  honestly , 2 % of gdp at eu level , used efficiently , it more than enough to make russia 's threat irrelevant . 
  just compare our gdp to theirs . 
  i understand your point of view , but i also think that burning down is easy , while building back is very , very difficult , and the end result could be much worse than what we have now . 
  who knows , perhaps brexit will force us to get our shit together and proceed with some kind of multi-speed europe in the right direction ... 
  honestly , i have very few hopes in the short term . 
  but i hope we 'll get there in the long term . 
  yes i guess so , must have been a big surprise !, 
  the water is used for a hydroelectric plant most of the time , and the fall is only `` left on '' as a tourist attraction at certain times . 
  i have some hopes that some kind of `` multi-speed eu '' will get things moving in the right direction . 
  well , for me being a federalist also means that the eu should have a government elected by citizens ( directly or with a parliamentary system ) , not by the national governments . 
  i do n't think there are many federalists around who want the council to continue having most of the power . 
   my opposition to this is more one that i do n't believe it 's right for a military to be under the command of something like the eu - militaries are for countries . 
  well , i 'm a federalist , so ... 
  but just to clarify , i would n't like to go on a spending spree and try to challenge us military power - to do what ? 
  i would just like to invest some money to build a more efficient and powerful eu force to use if needed ( hopefully , never , at least not at home ) . 
   it 's not the running costs , but the initial costs . 
  that 's what i would expect too ( as a project manager , even if not in the defense business ) . 
  but if you do n't try to integrate all units at the same time , i think those integration costs could be kept low enough ( as a % of all the money we spend on defense in the eu , that is ) . 
  and later , even considering all the inefficiencies of big bureaucracies , economies of scale should repay those initial costs multiple times . 
  why would you double your expenditures ? 
  you start creating some more `` euro-corps '' , moving national units to those - integrating those pre-existing units will of course have a cost , but i expect that to be much less than the cost of the units themselves . 
  then you move to other euro-corps , re-using the specialists who worked on the previous integration . 
  what would be the source of such big expenditures ? 
   unifying multiple militaries ( of any size ) is implausible . 
  army integration is not the same as unification , and it can happen in steps anyway . 
  so , what is going on with the official investigation ?? 
  should n't the netherlands still be pretty pissed off for what happened ? 
  but i did n't hear any news in a long time ... 
  it was meant to be a joke ... 
  i thought inflation took some time to catch up in the uk ? 
  anyway , thx , this makes sense . 
   `` it 's hard to quantify how serious , but we 've already seen that since the brexit referendum , uk consumers have been drawing down their savings to an all-time low savings rate , '' mateos y lago said . 
  is this just a coincidence ? 
  or are there really many brits who thought they could start spending more because with brexit they 'll have more money in the future ? 
  and it will last 1000 years !, 
  the eu ** does ** guarantee you do n't find yourselves in the similar situation . 
  you have a vote , you have veto powers on many matters , and , most important difference of all , you are free to leave if you do n't want to accept what the majority of the eu wants ( which is n't necessarily what france and germany want - they do n't have a majority by themselves ) . 
  to be fair , it 's oil that sponsors those regimes , not the west in general . 
  i did eat pizza in several different countries , and , while i agree that you can find lots of bad pizza in italy , i never ate anything better than what you can eat near naples - at least for my taste . 
  regarding my comment , i was just joking , i hoped that was clear enough ... 
  i 'm not able to hate something that i 'm not even able to imagine :d, 
  but they have increased the wealth gap , which is what the problem of the nurse is all about : rich get richer , normal people at best stay the same , often get poorer . 
  so , was this explosive meant to be used in northern ireland ? 
  yeah , threatening the eu has worked so well for turkey 's accession talks in the last decade ... 
  i 'd much rather boycott specific companies that support trump/benefit from this . 
  yes , but when the uk will be outside of the eu , ireland will be by far the biggest english speaking country left . 
  this is not to offend anybody ... 
  i did n't want to offend , but malta has 1/10 the population of ireland ... 
  a global agreement looks impossible to me . 
  but i agree that a eu agreement would be a good start . 
   italy ( and most of the world ) says that if xyz corp is based in another country then that 's where they should pay their tax on profits . 
  ireland agrees with you though and says that xyz corp should pay it where they make the profit . 
  well , then i 'm sure we 'll find an agreement . 
  lol just to be sure , so in your opinion it 's fair that a country steals taxes from sales made in a different country ( like with amazon , google etc. 
  i do n't care if you tax 0 % of what xyz corp makes in ireland . 
  but if you tax 5 % of what xyz corp makes * in italy * , then i 'll do whatever i can to stop that . 
   we do n't specify when stuff is male specific we should also in those cases . 
  because the rest of the eu is n't going to accept that for long ? 
  being the only real native english speaking country in the eu should be a much bigger competitive edge ... 
  should n't the title say `` europe 's women 's porn preferences '' ? 
  do we still have solar panels domestic production ? 
  actually , i think that being `` cannon fodder '' is the least common duty in a modern western army ... 
   i do n't mind having a federal europe , as long as the rights , obligations and democratic accountability are laid out crystal clear . 
  i strongly want a federal europe , and and i agree that the rights , obligations and democratic accountability should be laid out crystal clear . 
  but the reality of things is that national governments are n't going to give up their powers in the eu without a fight . 
  i see a gradual approach as much more feasible : i prefer to start sooner with a limited eu treasury which should manage only some important matters where eu coordination make lot of sense , than to start never with a perfect new system . 
   parties never make coalitions with each other i 'm by no mean an expert in uk politics , but was n't there a tory/libdem coalition government just a few years ago ? 
  no big deal , we were just bantering ... at least i hope so !, 
  well the first time the soviets actually surrendered to germany ... 
  divide et impera ? 
  i see a pattern here - like pro-erdogan outside of turkey ... 
  yes , that would be racism and i actually debated with fellow italians when a few years ago chinese restaurants were being all accused of not being safe because , you know , they were run by chinese . 
  at some joint , having been a great power a century ago is n't going to be enough to keep that kind of privilege . 
  india is going to become the most popolous country on earth , and at some point one of the three biggest economies ( unless the eu becomes a federation before that ) . 
  how do you think smaller countries like the uk or france will be able to keep more international power than them ? 
  lol, 
  i was n't thinking about personally offensive content . 
  i was thinking about `` offensive content '' based on prejudice against a category . 
  personally , i do n't work in restaurants or anything related , and i 've most often downvoted comments that were offensive for categories i do n't belong to ( and will continue to do so ) . 
  are n't we supposed to be dominated by germany ? 
  it 's france now ? 
  are n't downvotes also against offensive comments ? 
  you seem like a reasonable person , so maybe you can re-read your comment and realize that you generalized your anecdotal experience to basically say that whole peoples ( southern europeans ) do n't respect basic hygienic rules , as opposed to other peoples ( northern europeans ) ? 
  regarding the term `` racism '' , which alternative do you suggest ? 
  eg in italy discrimination against roma people is super common and most people against that call it racism , even if roma is n't a race . 
  i downvoted , because saying that `` southern european '' hotel personnel does n't respect basic hygienic rules is nothing but racism .

  other drugs still out-trade it . 
   also for cocaine more than half of the money is spent by users which are not typical addicts ( use less than `` near daily/daily '' ) . 
  who says that addicts are only people who use daily ? 
  do you seriously consider people in the `` use more than weekly '' category not addicts ? 
   also this study only looked at those 4 drugs - that 's far from being the complete market . 
  which other illegal drug beside cannabis , cocaine , heroin and methamphetamines represents such a large trade that only considering those four is `` far '' from being the complete market ? 
   why should convicted murderers or rapists be allowed near other human beings ? 
  murderers and rapists that have a psychological attraction to murder and rape are not , in fact , allowed near other human beings .

  if your problem is with the use of the word victim , then use `` smargafar '' to describe people who began a behaviour that later led to negative consequences on which they no longer had a choice . 
  either way , i would want someone who gave themselves smallpox treated in the same way that i 'd want someone who developed a drug addiction treated . 
   that 's correct , but only for some very addictive drugs , in particular heroin . 
  for most illegal drugs it is not . 
  [ most of the illegal drugs market is made up of cocaine , heroin and meth ] ( http://www.rand.org/pubs/research_briefs/rb9770.html ) , all of them very addictive drugs . 
   i think for most illegal drugs it is , in reference to this issue , comparable to a part of the pharmaceutical , to the alcohol or coffee industry . 
  and in fact both pharmaceuticals with an addictive potential and alcohol are regulated . 
  caffeine , as far as i can find , is not addictive and coffee ` addiction ' is certainly not an issue of comparable gravity to cocaine , heroin or meth addiction . 
   i was n't aware you had to be party to a democracy to expect that your government honor the views of the constituency . 
  this is the simplistc argument you made . 
  when it suits you , it seems that a simple view of democracy is fine ; when it turns out that the `` views of the constituency '' are not what you 'd want them to be , then it 's time to break out the debate on the complex nuances of democracy . 
  you are just reaching for some way not to admit you were plain wrong . 
   the other two thirds were naive . 
  i see . 
  the german government should follow the wishes of its constituents - except when you judge they are naive . 
  it 'd be more honest to argue against immigration without selectively choosing when democracy is ok . 
   sure , ` addiction ' can be a little weaker in some cases than others addiction to junk food is not ' a little weaker ' than addiction to heroin . 
  people will not beg , steal and kill to afford mcdonalds , but they will do that and more to fuel their drug addictions . 
  the magnitude of the issue is of a different order , and pretending that it 's just like any other industry would be dangerous and wrong . 
   if it 's no longer criminal , then there is no criminal element to be tackled . 
  no , that 's excessively simplistic and a little more than dangerous . 
  a policy deployed today , in 2015 , must take into account that these drug trafficking networks exist and will not just go away . 
  nobody gives up of billions in revenue , particularly not people who are used to going to any length to get what they want . 
  we ** will ** see attempts by criminal networks to take over parts of the legal drug industry , and we ** will ** see new drugs be developed and pushed to try and get a foothold outside of the legal , regulated and taxed market . 
  yes , and the german people until a short while ago were in favour of taking in refugees . 
  now they 've switched to mostly believing they are taking too many and the german government has switched to cutting down the flow and negotiating with turkey to stop it entirely . 
  there 's really no way to argue that the german government went against the desires of its people , unless that to you means `` what i think they should have wanted '' . 
   as a result violence between the groups and lack of integration will quite simply happen . 
  all evidence that we have points to the vast majority of attacks against refugees being perpetrated by far-right activists , not common citizens concerned with immigration . 
  the theory that some kind of overall societal threshold has been reached after which violence spontaneously emerges is simply wrong : it emerges because there are nuclei of racists and xenophobes who already systematically employ violence in their activism and who become more active the more immigrants there are . 
  i was a teenager when italy introduced the smoking ban in public establishments , and i can somewhat remember the smell and looks of bars that people had smoked in for hours . 
  now , even designated smoking rooms tend to very fairly clean , given the requirement for good ventilation . 
  exactly that , plus patios , gardens and such . 
  there are plenty of pubs , bars and clubs that have them , especially for the warm season ( but many even in winters , using space heaters ) . 
  interior smoking in public establishments is illegal ; smoking rooms , which need to be air-separated and especially ventilated , can be set up . 
  some of the larger bars and pubs have them . 
  smoking is also legal in exterior spaces .

   drugs are a health issue , not a crime issue . 
  they are both . 
  the drug trade is a multi-billion euro industry that fuels criminal networks worldwide . 
  the criminal side of it actively works to spread and promote its products and enable and cultivate addiction , so there is definitely a criminal issue that needs to be tackled with drugs . 
  now of course that is not the only facet of it , and the big mistake of the war on drugs policy was to assume that it was . 
  drug addicts are addicts , first-time drug users are nearly never criminals ( or if they are it 's unrelated to drugs ) ; drug traffickers , however , are definitely criminals and usually of a very nasty , violent kind given the sums involved and what people are ready to do for that kind of money . 
   i mean , heroin ... that 's a big one . 
  it is . 
  but when you have populations numbering in the millions to hundreds of millions ( if we are talking about europe-wide policies ) , you need to take into account that * some * people will * always * do stupid things , like go on heroin . 
  there is no policy that can stop that , even in the most prohibitionist places . 
  so what you have to do is a ) figure out how to minimize the number of people doing stupid things and b ) figure out how to minimize the damage that people doing stupid things do to themselves and society . 
  based on precedents , it seems that decriminalization combined with strong recovery programs can help combat * both * first-use and continued addiction .

   a witness told the irish times she saw the man , who she said was brazilian , get up to go to the toilet halfway through the flight . 
  the woman , who asked not to be named , said he looked `` really unwell '' and climbed over seats to pass cabin crew and reach the rear toilet . 
  a call went out from the captain for any doctors or nurses on board , and it became clear the man had collapsed outside the bathroom , she said . 
    `` at that stage they started to perform cpr , '' she said . 
  `` you could hear him start to ... well , screaming is n't quite the word . 
  it was a guttural noise , like a wounded animal . '', 
  a portuguese man went down to help , the woman said , and he was the one who was bitten . 
    `` the young brazilian man was having a seizure and they were all restraining him . 
  it was n't a random attack . 
  he bit him during the seizure , '' she said .

   i love how ` murican reddit is apeshit left ( dae bernie ??? ), 
  it 's more apeshit `` new guy that talks the talk '' . 
  ron paul was that guy last time around and he 's the polar opposite of bernie in most big policy respects : lower taxes vs higher taxes , much smaller government vs much bigger government , state freedoms vs federal standards . 
  they meet in regards of attacking the influence of money in politics , but that 's neither left or right . 
  oh you can definitely have south tyrol . 
  we pour a ton of money into it ( about as much as in certain poor southern regions ) only to get a ton of angry secessionist rhetoric back .

then i guess you are a multibillionaire since you can predict ten years of world economic, 
  we did n't switch : we lost and were occupied, 
  it 's really delicious . 
  they were of french origin, 
  spoken words are different than written treaty, 
   that 's not a good reason , that 's a nutjob 's conspiracy theory . 
  in fact that is a very good * casus belli *, 
  no , they are making fun of how the media report about it, 
  nice idea !, 
  none, 
  no , you can sue the company and enjoy an early retirement, 
   google will change their terms and conditions to say they can change what they want but if the law says otherwise their `` terms & conditions '' will go directly into the crapper . 
  plus , for example , here in italy that is forbidden by our constitution ( and i guess also germany , one of the benefit of antifascism ), 
  france , germany and italy are more pro-eu , britain is n't, 
  i actually do . 
  and it 's almost time to take britain out of that list, 
  there 's a difference between spying on a foreign government and spying every citizen of a country, 
  i think that a confederation is more likely, 
  http://imgur.com/blotjhh yep that 's the moon little town near treviso , italy ( not far from venice ), 
  you can see only italy there, 
  well the only positive things i can think of is that if they decide to marry between them so in a 2-3 generation we can have only one heir for all europe, 
  he got married without permission and against their family rules ; even the old king said that to him . 
  hitler and stalin by bullock ; martin gilbert 's first world war ; raymond cartier 's second world war ;, 
  i 'm still upset that when i went to london and visited the parliament they told to not to seat . 
  but now i realize that there is probably some cue regulation since neither yours mp can seat / s, 
  no , i stand correct , i was considering 20 years , why would you think of 2003 ? 
  never said 2003 . 
  said 20 years . 
  i hope you still get some basic math for free or you have to pay also for the simple 1 +1 ? 
  sorry if we do n't like to fuck things up like you did in the last 20 years, 
  we do n't like monotony, 
  their mess , their job, 
  we ruled europe and the mediterranean sea, 
  yes, 
  the downsides is that you have a foreign military base that - potentially - could be used to spy on your citizens . 
  but that is n't really gon na happen ... 
  and what about all the planes in their desert ? 
  well you wrote `` aereal bombardment '', 
  we - italians - did it in libya in 1911  on november 1 , the first ever aerial bomb was dropped by sottotenente giulio gavotti , on turkish troops in libya , from an early model of etrich taube aircraft . 
  you forgot the venice republic, 
  as in people from turku , fi ? 
  it 's kind of difficult to be worst then the last one, 
  they decided almost everything when they supported junker, 
  they are oligarchs because putin allow them in the first place . 
  so no . 
  they can not rebel against him : putin would just put to jail for corruption/whatever the rebels . 
  like the football worldcup it 's time to start doing rotation : last time were europe , the mediterranean sea and asia so why not in north america and africa this time ? 
  edit : i 'm saving south america because they have just buil stadiums , it would be a shame to destroy them right now, 
  not `` un - '' but `` less '' for sure . 
  well hollywood ... 
  also , they are used to the ** wrong ** side of the road . 
  american way, 
  one of the best thing that i ever did, 
  is n't is asylum kind of expiring any time soon ? 
  i think it will be next . 
  no , actually the american view of this thing is : you should spend more on defense , and you should buy our stuff , but not same same , almost-same stuff because we really do n't like if you can beat us on the strategic industrial sector such aerospace ( we had to ask for bilding our gps and still we had to put other `` safety '' measures ) , it ... 
  yes of course , because what us really wants is a ue heavly armed and at least at same level of them . 
  plus : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/la_leggenda_del_piave, 
  you should wait till hillary , then you will know, 
  eu has put some regulation , at least for the speculation part . 
  but yes , this is what us supremacy gives : a war and a economic crisis every 7-10 years, 
  no sanctions if you do n't vote . 
  and for the latter question ... 
  i really do n't know . 
  we ( italy ) do n't . 
  last time was saturday and sunday, 
  you forgot the mandolino thing, 
  social engineering . 
  new law : for having kids you should have a real house , a real address and a job ( or someone like parents have to garantee for you ) . 
  then the social service take their kids ( the youngster ) and put them up for adoption in all europe . 
  they will change or the will face extinction, 
  because the bigger nations in eu will never seek war since they clearly remember last time and the smallest are just to small to be alone . 
  so nato now means only us, 
   at this point i think there 's a better chance of nato falling apart than there is of it going to war nato is already dead . 
  nobody in eu is going to put money in military ( except for the normal defense porposes ) . 
  te best ways to avoid war right now is to tight with russia with trade so they will have more to loose tha to gain with a war . 
  what happend and what is going to happen is clear since day 1 . 
  ukraine will split : ukranian part and russian part . 
  now , they can became a federation but most likely the russian part will join russia ; then the real ukraine will join eu but not nato ( putin will not permit that ) , after they have clean themself from all the nazi-like leader ( recently one of them was killed ) . 
  this will clear the nationalist problem - for putin - and the presence in the eu parliament of russian rapresentative ( if ukraine join the eu now half of their mp would be russian ) and so eu will not be influenced by putin from the inside . 
  the future is that ukraine will became the link between eu and russia ( and by that asia ) for trade . 
  we are not going to war , eu will never permit that and neither putin wants . 
  war means destruction and death in the european union . 
  only us has something to obtain from a war : a new post war , and a new us world supremacy ( that now they do n't have any more ) . 
  just think about this : how many people from eu will vote for the next american president and congress ? 
  how many for the next eu parlament ? 
  in italy in some part the limit is 150 . http://www.sosviaggiatore.com/autostrade_150kmh.htm, 
  with dclauzel at least you can learn french . 
  the eu should male a new reformed islam and allow only this new islam to be practiced . 
  because he is not in a long time mission . 
  i went to finland - for my erasmus program - as an italian , came back less italian . 
  after a month there i found that except for the language there was n't so much difference between me and the german girl or the sicilian girl ( i 'm from north italy, 
  lets just conveniently forget about libya ... 
   military training for fitness so this time we sould do it in the us, 
   35c this is the reason i like r/europe, 
  if it 's a girl speaking french , for male german . 
  i like napoleon , he is my favourite italian . 
  who 's penis o'brien ? 
  you can survive , but no , not living, 
  oh yes ...

  if we think in terms of risks undertaken then ceos should be the top earners . 
  it 's not a simple problem . 
  that 's not completely correct . 
  fiscal policy is not monetary policy . 
  fiscal policy the management of taxes and expenditures , monetary policy is the management of the currency supply and value , etc. 
  you do make a good point though . 
  the main problem with the euro is this divide between monetary policies , determined by bruxelles , and fiscal policies , determined by the national governments . 
  we will solve the matter only when one of the two entities has the control of both . 
   cataclysmic m5s win seeing grillo lately i 'm starting to think even he now thinks a m5s presidency would be a disaster . 
  you raise an interesting point and the very one that made me jump from social democracy to socialism . 
  there 's no amount of regulations that can fix a system that thrives on inequality and exploitation . 
  you either do too little and fail to make any significant change or too much and cause more damage than what was healed . 
  the solution is to change the rules , not slightly tweak them . 
  that said i would say class and income divide should be kept in check , as the health of the market is directly infuenced by the health of the consumer base . 
  he was trump before it was cool . 
  there is actually an ancient debate still going on from the foundation of our country if it 's better the current anthem , mameli 's [ brothers of italy ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3rtobymtta ) or verdi 's [ va pensiero ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1jn--tqssc ), 
  you cheeky dick waffle . 
  he also was the one giving the republic of venice the coup de grace . 
  i have conflicting feelings about him , but mostly he was a cool guy . 
   what kind of sexual education did you get in school ? 
  the kinky kind . 
  jokes aside nothing at all . 
  not sure if we did it or not , i may have simply skipped it . 
  it 's been a while and with my score frequency i would n't have used what was said anyway ... ... yeah, 
  i would say centre left rather than socialist . 
  social democracy if you want . 
  unfortunately i do n't agree . 
  socially yes , the sub is quite liberal , but economically it tends to go more towards the right . 
   4000 $ for a year ? 
  4k a month . 
  [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/basicincome/wiki/index ) tou can see where i took the figure from . 
  just go to the `` how much would ubi be '' section . 
  the video did talk of the experiments the mit did , financed by the federal reserve . 
   in that video they assume money are not a useful motivator in some type of activities in any activity that requires a minimum level of cognitive abilities , so pretty much 100 % of modern day jobs . 
  even if you consider all manufacturing jobs purely mechanical they are still only 10 % of the employed workforce , so in 90 % of the jobs we have now money is not a sufficient motivator . 
  you refer to austerity ? 
  of course debt is bad , but the government is dependent on the health of its economy for its income , is it not ? 
  how can you pretend to pay off your debt if you are starving your cash flow more and more every day ? 
  just look at how the us got out of the great depression with the new deal !, 
  it did not apply absurd auterity measures , quite the contrary !, 
  it distributed money to the working population throught welfare programs and by creating jobs through government funded projects . 
  it got that money taxing the elite , not the consumers . 
   why is it going to be necessary ? 
  you just wrote two terms without explaining what ubi has to do with them . 
  those are the two big problems we will have to face in the next decade . 
  we have an aging population , while our birth rates are low ( italy and germany are the worst in europe in this ) , this means in the near future an increase in spending to cover the pensions of the extra elderly and less working people because of the shrinking young population so less taxes for the government to cover such spending ( not to mention healthcare costs as well ) . 
  the other big problem is that the automation revolution is coming in and fast , even now we can already automate 50 % of our workforce , with current technology . 
  and it 's not only low skill jobs that can be automated : doctors , lawyers , engineers , journalists , musicians , with technology we have now we can automate many of the jobs in these areas . 
  the problem with automation is pretty obvious : it takes away jobs from the job market and that again means less taxes for the government , as well as less people able to afford to spend so it 's a loss even for companies because of the shrinkage of the consumer base . 
  now what would ubi do to tackle these issues ? 
  well it wo n't solve them entirely , but it wll greatly increase social stability . 
  ubi would provide financial security for everyone , which will inevitably bring more people to form families and procreate . 
  also this financial stabilty would allow many more people to create their own businesses or get an education , after all if you know that you wo n't starve to death or get thrown out of your house if things go wrong , you are much more likely to take risks . 
  not to mention ubi would keep a healthy consumer base , allowing for more companies to operate . 
  now for automation , ubi would avoid cutting off from the job market people that had their job automated . 
  it would allow them to have the time to retrain and become again productive members of society . 
   what does that mean ? 
  on what arguments do you base this statement ? 
  well there are may arguments to be made on the likely collapse of the `` free market '' model we have operated on in the last 50 years , mainly because of the information revolution . 
  i like this small summary from the guardian : - first , it has reduced the need for work , blurred the edges between work and free time and loosened the relationship between work and wages . 
  the coming wave of automation , currently stalled because our social infrastructure can not bear the consequences , will hugely diminish the amount of work needed -- not just to subsist but to provide a decent life for all . 
  - second , information is corroding the market 's ability to form prices correctly . 
  that is because markets are based on scarcity while information is abundant . 
  the system 's defence mechanism is to form monopolies -- the giant tech companies -- on a scale not seen in the past 200 years , yet they can not last . 
  by building business models and share valuations based on the capture and privatisation of all socially produced information , such firms are constructing a fragile corporate edifice at odds with the most basic need of humanity , which is to use ideas freely . 
  - third , we 're seeing the spontaneous rise of collaborative production : goods , services and organisations are appearing that no longer respond to the dictates of the market and the managerial hierarchy . 
  the biggest information product in the world -- wikipedia -- is made by volunteers for free , abolishing the encyclopedia business and depriving the advertising industry of an estimated $ 3bn a year in revenue . 
  these are only a part of the bigger problem in my opinion , but they are already enough to menace the traditional model we use now . 
  it 's not like they are a mystery , you can google them . 
  ubi as i see it is a substitute for all welfare programs ( aside from government run institutions like healthcare and education ) . 
  considering the savings from merging all welfare programs ( so less bureaucracy and more efficiency ) into ubi it wo n't actually cost that much more than what you already pay . 
  also the best taxt to tackle the problem is an added value tax , so a tax not on income or vat that weights on the worker , but a tax on the surplus value produced by said worker . 
  the advantage of such tax is that it would also cover robotic labour . 
   there will be people who will quit their shitty jobs for the basic income and start their own businesses or finally have the stability to go and educate themselves . 
  ubi would decrease employment in the short term , but would greatly increase it in the mid-long term . 
  a ubi has the advantage to avoid that awkward spot of being employed is barely better if at all than being unemployed . 
  what you ear at work is all added value to the worker , so you would actually be more interested in a low paying job with a ubi rather than the unemployment benefits system we have now . 
   how much money could be this income ? 
  for the us it was estimated it can be as high as 4000 $ without increased spending if ubi substitutes current welfare programs . 
   could it be a wide spreading of low pay jobs ? 
  you mean if we would see more low paying jobs ? 
  absolutely , but we would see a great increase of self employment as well as cooperatives , which are arguably better than traditional companies . 
   how these low pay jobs could maintain a decent level of productivity given that workers are not stimulated by other incentives ? 
  money is one of the worst motivators , actually . 
  [ this video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgkkpqirrag ) explains what i mean . 
  you have n't been to eastern europe my friend . 
  visit us sometime , but do n't stay in the cities , go to the east . 
  read what i said . 
  are these people literally sitting on their asses all day ? 
  or are they doing the bare minimum to survive and then go do whatever they like ? 
  even the laziest person in existence has a hobby that likes to throw effort into . 
  the problem is not that people do n't want to work , the problem is that they do n't see themselves in their work , so they do n't care if it 's done or not . 
   how do you get people involved in scrubbing dirt off of things ? 
  how do you get people involved in working in mines ? 
  social cooperation and automation . 
  i guess someone cleans your house , it may be you or one of your relatives or your loved one , now expand it to your neighborhood . 
  you can meet and democratically divide the work to keep your area clean . 
  also for mines this is a non problem . 
  now barely 1 % of the population is involved in mining . 
  you can easily automate most of it and pay a decent salary for the remaining jobs .

  what the fuck does it mean ? 
  more and more authoritarian . 
  dragon age inquisiton irl, 
  nordic banter ? 
   it was awfully designed at doing anything more complex like finance or science . 
  basically it was obsolete and could no longer do what was necessary . 
  that 's not how it works . 
  first , languages are not designed . 
  second , there are not languages better than the other , simpler or more specific . 
  that will not happen until the irish state bans english and start tv and radio productions exclusively in irish , replacing road signs and other indications of public control . 
  you ca n't resurrect a language if that language is not felt useful . 
  are you confusing ww1 with ww2 ? 
  the only enemy you had around 1914 was mexico . 
  that kid has brain damage , he 's already dead . 
  there is no cure for his ill . uk did n't sentence him to death . 
  they are using the pc culture imported from america to create a system of laws that allows the goverment to spy on the internet history of its citizens and prosecute them for hate speech . 
  problem is ... hate speech is defined by the government and judicial system . 
  how long is the leap for `` criticism about the government '' to be considered hate speech ? 
  after all , most criticims is connoted by some form of hate . 
  this hurts , tho . 
   the pizza shops are about the filthiest in naples , and whoever knows naples will admit that is saying a good deal, 
  it actually was built by the military . 
  no , they did n't . 
  planned obsolescence is a thing , tho . 
  assassin 's creed 2 was in italy , not spain . 
  that was not made by the romans , it was made by vanvitelli . 
  was n't it the first ? 
  italy became fully roman after the social wars . 
  i do n't think so , trieste is our most important port . 
  if you give back istria to us all this fight between slavic brothers might end . 
  do it . 
  for peace . 
   free territory of trieste was determined . 
  no , that border was established when the ftt ceased de jure to exist , with the treaty of osimo . 
  that excluding the fact that the ftt ended de facto in 1954 and was never actually `` free '' . 
  they used workers , not slaves . 
   there were n't really any roman philosophers seneca , apuleius , pliny the elder ? 
   the knowledge they had was gained every knowledge is gained by someone else , with a process of accumulation of knowledge . 
  no one invents anything from the scratch . 
  the development of the roman culture is stricly related to the greek culture , of which the romans first encountered through the etruscans . 
  but it would be foolish to think of the romans as an empty container in which greek culture was poured . 
  they adapted greek cultures to their own customs and traditions , the mos maiorum , and evolved it from there .

  he was declared public enemy # 1 after the saint valentine 's day massacre and the castellammarese war . 
  police unions are the scum of the earth .

  i guess not . 
   what the fuck were those cops thinking ? 
  . . the objective should always be ` contain & de-escalate ' they were fascists . 
  their primary objective was to punish these `` no - global insurretionalists '' . 
  how is ww2 shameful ? 
  and rightly so .

  you can also put it on top later , but you need to mix pasta and sauce otherwise , as u/y _ u_du_dis _ says , the pasta dries out .

   you mix the pasta and sauce before serving . 
  this . 
  brown ? 
  this obsession with race must end . 
  democracy has nothing to do with international agreements and consequences in case that agreement is broken . 
  but when it 's about you getting our money then they should be all happy , right ? 
   repeated application of it in practice being a disaster it has never been applicated , if not in the first period of the russian revolution . 
  and this is a fact that only who has never read a page of marx or philosophy of that period can deny . 
   we live in the most prosperous period in history what is prosperous about this period of history ? 
  jobs are more and more scarce , wages are gettin lower and lower , and the wealth is in the hands of a tiny minority of the world population . 
  meanwhile employers are still feeding themself on the work of their employees , like parasites , getting richer and richer and paying their worker a misery of what they produce . 
  how is this prosperous ? 
   however my mission is now to melt them into one [ * hre intesifies * ], 
  did n't know marx wrote to send people in the gulag . 
  communism is not stalin . 
  stalin exploited the existant regime to gain power and then killed whoever opposed him . 
  and who opposed him were , guess what ... communists . 
  yep , working rights and fight of the capitalistic driven economy is so extremist and genocidal . 
   the truck hijacked of the berlin attack in 2016 started his trip from italy and intentionally drove straight to berlin . 
  why did n't he just attack in italy ? 
  because the truck was hijacked in germany ? 
  it would make sense if not that rome is a declared target in the isis propaganda . 
  the population does n't know what it wants . 
  democracy is overrated . 
  the jugoslavian partisans were communists , for the most part . 
  illuminami . 
  or montecassino . 
   who do they answer to they are not really different from the mafia . 
  they will be all wasted . 
  translation ? 
  democracy is not the apex of human civilization . 
  besides , liberalism = / democracy, 
  paradox games do not have real time combat tho . 
  their economic condition seems fairly similar to a post-war economy . 
   the majority of germans ( myself included ) gladly help . 
  why not help the greeks instead ? 
  why are they still there ? 
   even sa would go back to the dark ages without our existence . 
  it 's their country , not ours . 
  they have the right to fuck themself up .

  i agree . 
  it did not , that was the side of the story of the criminals who kidnapped 25 people inside and set fire everywhere . 
  in fact health authorities deny that . 
  many italians die each day for health realated problems , some of those avoidable possibly , but you never hear italians going to hospitals and kidnapping doctors and setting fires . 
  i agree with you as an italian , unfortunately our left wing ( unelected ) government does n't agree . 
   italian nationalists do not exist this is very true . 
  and a little bit unfortunate if you want my opinion , we are very critical of italy , we do n't take pride in the good things we have and that does n't help making out shitty situation better . 
  i saw the other examples and they were bad photoshopped like this one and the other example of `` how < country  sees europe '' , and they 've been allowed , this one has been removed because it was particularly critical of romania , despite being obviously satirical . 
   at the very least easier to integrate and much less violent statistically . 
  clearly you have no idea of the gypsy situation in italy . 
  it 's just a stereotype , we have it as well because of the * siesta * but we know it 's all bullshit . 
  i know , that 's also when they created the new expression `` post factual '' . 
  butthurt from all votes they were losing throughout europe and the usa they decided to censor the news they do n't like . 
   several `` anti-offence '' laws too were planned against anything published in internet ( from news sites , to personal blogs or even comments in forums ) yes , and those same laws are some of strictest in the west world . 
  not to mention a ban on public wifis ( pisanu law if i 'm not mistaken ) , only recently partially removed . 
  this ongoing trend of proposing news filters in west countries is exactly what our countries used to criticize about china , north korea , soviet union etc. 
  the effects are going to be much more pronounced than those of removing `` fake news '' , potentially every critic to the government or the establishment could be considered `` fake news '' and it could lead to the imprisonment of journalists the same way dictatorships do . 
  this possible new law could be abused in any way , and it will believe me , because that 's what have been done in any government with a censorship system . 
  do you remember the year of the * editto bulgaro * of berlusconi ? 
  he did that even without there being a specific law , and renzi with his rai 's management basically alienated all the people critical to him . 
  if something like that were to become a coded law it would be even worse , because for some matters it 's really difficult to define what 's truth and what is not , many independent blogs would cease to exist or would have a pretty rough time . 
  investigative journalism would also have a tough time . 
  anyway , there are also other independent ngos that talk about our bad freedom of the press , so it 's not just this one . 
  holy shit , you 're right !, 
  no i 'm citing what everyone in italy knows since berlusconi 's governments since periodically there is a harsh debate on the condition of our press freedom . 
  the left wing , rightly so , complained and publicly denounced that situation until , ironically , they came to power and we went even ** lower ** on the charts under their governments , in fact now we have a left wing executive . 
  so it 's a not a new situation , it 's becoming the ordinary over the years and it 's getting worse . 
  but you already knew that if you live in italy . 
  oh well , at least i 'm using science to prove my point , yours is completely irrational and delirious if you think romanians are the reason behind italy 's economic power . 
  you discard the mathematical data because you do n't understand it and call me close minded after i explained all my arguments while yours is just : * hurr italy is powerful thanks to romania durr * . 
  just to be clear , as i said above , i do n't think all romanians are criminals nor i think it 's the majority of them , in fact i know a few good people , but hey , just reply to my comments without reading them thoroughly and put words in my mouth . 
  i also sated a mathematical ** fact ** , that i invited you to check either on the newpaper i linked , or better off in [ italy 's offical statistics institute ] ( http://www.istat.it/it/ ) , and that is that we have a very big proportion of crimes committed by romianias citizens , despite them being only a small minority , but you can ignore the truth if you want , i really do n't care . 
  just so you know , italy is not new to this kind of censorship , they call it fake news but they do it periodically on any news inconvenient to politicians or the power in general . 
  in fact we are ** [ 77th in the world ] ( http://www.lastampa.it/2016/04/20/esteri/libert-di-stampa-litalia-crolla-ora-al-posto-jl0lw7t7ev7j31hrkipcwj/pagina.html ) ** for the freedom of the press , one of the lowest levels in europe and in the west , burkina faso and botswana score better than us . 
  so do n't be tempted to do the same , please . 
  the worst part is that they 're doing it in the name of `` democracy '' , just like in the soviet union did the same citing similar reasons . 
   this argument again ? 
  that was a response to explain to an ill informed redditor the `` miracle '' of some eastern europe countries ( coincidentally the ones who take more from the eu budget ) and why the big ones like italy france and yes , even germany have much lower growth rates . 
  i 'm not even arguing whether it 's right or wrong , just stating a fact of mathematical relevance . 
   italy contributes fuck all to romania compared to what hard working romanians generate for italy 's economy or how much you export to romania . 
  i 'm not even going to reply to that . 
   this argument again ?

  ahahah lol i did n't know this one !, 
  you forgot another german great movie : [ the lives of others ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0405094/ ), 
  lol funny how you did n't even consider portugal in your map , at least we are your bros ( in crime ) . 
  mathematically speaking leaving the euro ( not the eu ) is a necessary but not sufficient condition for growth . 
  high level corruption ( the only one present in italy ) , while being a huge problem , is not the direct cause of this economic mess ( just take a look at the growth figures during craxi government , one of the highest in more than 30 years , if you do n't know who craxi were look it up ) . 
   what do you think italian politicans would do better in that regard ? 
  this is a difficult question , but what i wrote above is the first thing that needs to be done. , there are some other ones , such as a profound reform of our disgraceful ( in ) justice system , which is very difficult thing to do given how justice members in italy are untouchable , have a huge power , significantly bigger than that of politicians and * de facto * immunity for most wrongdoings . 
   how is leaving the union and say having another decade of deficit spending with little growth not just kicking the can down the road ? 
  i do n't suggest leaving the union but only the euro as i wrote above . 
  of course the current eu is is a sick system , many people have no idea what the eu really is , the lack of democracy therein and how the constant ignoring of the eu problems ( immigration , criminality among eu migrants etc ) are going to destroy the union itself unless it acknowledges its shortcomings and take action to reform itself which is never going to happen seeing by whom we are represented ( jucker , schultz etc ) . 
   all you 'd need to do is look at statistics previous to 1999 , before italy adopted the euro . 
  economic growth was similarly sluggish , [ ... ] no it was not . 
  in 15 years of euro we grew a cumulative amount of ** less ** than 3 % , while in the 90s in only one year we had an average growth of more than 1 % , in just one year , and that was during the years of ems , a * soft euro * system that had its definite negative effects that eventually brought the uk to opt out of the euro and italy to temporarily withdraw from the ems . 
  in the 80s the difference was truly impressive , in the second half of the 80s in one year we had a growth of more than 4 % . 
  but it 's really too complicated to discuss it in detail , it 's quite clear if you are functionally competent in math and know a little macroeconomics , just go take a look at the main economics indicators from the 70s to nowadays , and read about the ems , what euro is , i mean how its value has been decided etc , you will see how a currency have a ** huge ** impact on a country 's economics system , you will understand how argentine came to ruin itself when it decided to use a huge overvalued currency when it pegged its peso to the dollar on a 1:1 ratio , that eventually led them to default etc. 
  you will understand how having the euro means that you are * de facto * emitting debt in a foreign , greatly overvalued currency that for economies such as italy are difficult to repay . 
  you will see how in the presence of a deficit , you only tools are only to : * emit debt * increase taxes as opposed to the other tool of simply emitting the quantity of currency you need . 
  you will see that what brought italy to be a g8 superpower was exactly that one economic system we had with the sovereign lira , exporting high quality goods and manufacturing , back then with the same ( even worse because we had craxi , other than berlusconi ) politicians . 
  if people took just a little time to read about some macroeconomics , and most of all to * understand * it , to which you must a good grasp on math , you will understand why economics nobel prize stigliz and the latest eocnomics nobel prize winner of 2016 criticize the euro as not being fit for all countries and actually being one of the main causes of economic stagnation of many european countries . 
  it is an extremely strong currency for our country and it makes difficult for us to export goods . 
  since the euro our economy is stagnating while prices have been going up all these years all coupled with very high unemployment rates . 
  of course i 'm not against euro * per se * , each country has its own economy , but euro is not suited to ours ( and some other european countries , greece comes to mind but it 's not the only one ) . 
  i think the sooner we leave the common currency area , the sooner we 'll have the chance to recover . 
  if i were to vote for it , i would undoubtedly vote out . 
  [ this ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5l9lbt/tomorrow_january_1st_2017_marks_10_years_since/dbvatf2/ ), 
  romanians , as far as 2007 , were responsible for the highest number of crimes out of all foreigners , take a look at [ espresso ] ( http://espresso.repubblica.it/palazzo/2007/07/23/news/l-invasione-dei-romeni-1.4418 ) , one of the most prestigious investigative report italian magazines , ** left wing ** usually very politically correct . 
  but of course you ca n't argue with the crude numbers , math is a bitch . 
  nowadays if i 'm being correct romanians have been surpassed by other foreigners , but not because they are committing less crimes , only because with the new migrant 's wave there is more competition to the crime game . 
  i strongly hope that it does n't . 
  i 'll take your word for it , mafia is ours undoubtedly , only a fool would deny that . 
  now it 's your turn to admit what everyone in italy knows , that is not to say all romanians are criminals of course , but we 're experiencing a huge problem with it , and the official stats confirm that . 
  it might be reason of the next exit from the eu , but yeah , just pretend that it 's not true what everyone in europe knows . 
   more than half of the crimes are done by gypsies , therefore romanians do n't deserve to be tarnished and dragged in that top probably you 're right . 
  i was n't tarnishing anyone , i was just stating a fact . 
  i 've had both good and bad experience with romanian people . 
  it just seems that our shitty justice system seems to to attract mainly romanian criminals , the brain drain from romania goes elsewhere apparently . 
  it does that with everybody , including italy . 
  if the state does n't come up with a good plan of expenditure , the money is denied , and it happens all the time here too . 
  but it does n't change the fact that even if we got all the money we were entitled to , we 'd still be significant net givers . 
   yeah dude , everything bad happens in your country because of romania and bulgaria just read what i wrote , i never said ** all ** of our problems are caused by romania and bulgaria , and i do n't think think it either . 
  i 'm stating what everyone knows , if everyone took the time instead of downvoting without reason to go to our official statistics institute website , istat , you would find that romanians , while only being a minority of about 2000000 people in italy , comprise a very high percentage of prisoners , and that 's a fact . 
  you can evaluate the rate of criminality on those data and you 'll find that romanians have a much higher rate , only lower than moroccan . 
   romania and bulgaria , if anything , helped your economy . 
  you are ignorant considering that you do n't know that italy is the third contributor to the european budget , that is italy is a net * giver * to the eu while romanian gdp is growing with that fast rate because is net * receiver * . 
  probably you know very little math , otherwise you would comprehend how gdp works , that is the sum of income produced in the country or that flows in the country , so a very big chuck of your gdp is due to the generosity of germany , france and italy , all net givers . 
  about bulgaria , they are * not * a significant part of our crime rate , the problems , statistically speaking , come mainly in this order from nigerians , moroccans , romanians . 
  that 's only murders , and anyhow the majority of crimes committed by those people go unreported so official statistics are underestimated . 
  that 's when our crime stats literally skyrocketed with crimes committed by gypsies and not only them . 
   if the interests of the kremlin i hope you 're joking and you 're not buying the whole russophobia propaganda you see on the guardian . 
  good for them !, 
  marine le pen is nothing like her father , and yet i hear always the scaremongering from the press , personally i hope for france that she wins as she 'll finally do the interests of the french and not other people . 
  sharia is law , at least in the uk where sharia arbitrates are perfectly legal and in germany where a judge recently sentenced in favour of muslim police . 
  why do n't you take a look at what those numbers were just * before * putin during the 90s ? 
  you know , just for comparison , and you might be pleasantly surprised with putin 's governments .

czechia is n't exactly athletic is that the good soldier svejk ?

  the china one is a stretch , but the rest are very impressive . 
  awesome landscapes . 
  well , i would n't dismiss all these claims out of hand . 
  it should be evident that there are a lot of problems with the `` centralized currency and localized economies '' scheme that europe has n't solved yet , nor does it seem willing to . 
  and the prices * did * go up in many countries , but the salaries did n't . 
  especially countries that imported a lot of goods . 
  it rarely comes up . 
  and the fee fo fi fum . 
  you are being too harsh . 
  the greeks certainly do n't trust their political parties , and have been trying to bring about change en masse . 
  there has been a political see-saw in power the last decades as the party not in power promises reform and shuffles its personnel around . 
  recently the governing parties have n't been able to generate necessary majorities to govern , resulting in alliances to maintain power . 
  therefore there has been a lot of discontent expressed by the people . 
  also have you not seen how the greeks have been rioting and protesting in the streets against the corruption ? 
  where have you been , really ? 
  your comment frankly shows a lot of ignorance about both the people of greece and the entrenchment of political parties . 
  look at every single country and tell me how easy it is to nudge the two big parties from power . 
  answer : not at all easy . 
   the greece journalism did n't do much to bring all the news about corruption before 2008 do you have any sources about this , or did you just pull it out of nowhere ? 
  i think your assessment is the naive one . 
  do you expect a person with a trade and a business to be able to make arbitrarily large amounts of money , and if he does worse than that then he should give up and do ... what exactly ? 
  you 're being absurd . 
  this is a small business owner . 
  he is trying to feed his family with his business , he did n't decide he hit a ceiling of 20k a year and then stop . 
  this is the whole problem with greece that this article outlines - that otherwise sustainable business are becoming unsustainable . 
  you are completely wrong about trade deficit being the result of borrowing . 
  a [ trade balance ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/balance_of_trade ) by definition depends on exports and imports . 
  greece has been buying german products for as long as there has been no industry in greece : since forever . 
  the difference being that with greece 's induction in the eurozone , german companies now make much more money off of those exports than they did before . 
  and of course because it 's so much more profitable , exports have more than doubled . 
  in retrospect , greece stood to gain very little from the eurozone , and people are now realizing this . 
  i do n't know to explain these basics to you other than this : this is a private limited company . 
  the business owner ca n't pay himself a salary - he is the owner , and he makes what his business makes , and he is in debt for whatever his business is in debt . 
  what the hell are you talking about ? 
  he has a business with a legitimate income of 20,000 euros . 
  how is that bankrupting himself ? 
  no , it 's the pre-tax income of the business , like it says in the title . 
  it 's one guy that has his own business , how is that hard to understand ? 
  that 's what jobs pay in greece . 
   firstly , ownership how the marbles were acquired is not the point . 
  the point is why you should give them back . 
  pretending a shady deal 200 years ago with the turks somehow legitimizes your possession of them wo n't help your case . 
   secondly , ownerership part 2 . 
  the culture that created the marbles has very little to do with contemporary greece . 
  and modern britain has ? 
  please . 
  continuity of culture is largely defined by geography . 
  and , who are you to judge which culture deserves its ancient monuments and which does n't ? 
  should we all ask the british about our monuments then ? 
  maybe wait your verdict as to whether * our * culture has enough to do with our ancestors ? 
   thirdly : as objects of world heritage , it 's a good idea to exhibit them , for free , in a city more people visit . 
  why do n't we move all ancient monuments away from where they were built , to new york ? 
  that 's where the most people visit , right ? 
  in sum : what utter , stunning nonsense . 
  for shame . 
  give back the marbles to where they rightly should be displayed . 
  clinging onto them ( and with such asinine arguments ) is clinging to a remnant of england 's imperialist past . 
  probably nonexistent , but i 'm in favor of that as well . 
  let 's give back everything to everyone who has a right to it . 
  what an unfortunate example you chose to bring up . 
  there is no reason whatsoever to not give back the parthenon marbles to greece . 
  well the perspective is that it is unfortunate at times that good people have to step down because their term ends , but on the other hand that 's how it should work . 
  cohesion within a single country does not mean a lot with regards to larger unions . 
  usually regional separatism has a lot to do with oppression suffered at the hands of the country the regions want to split from . 
  look at the catalans , the basques , the scots , sardinia . 
  but tell them they will be a part of eu , and they have no objection to that . 
  the formation of larger unified geographical entities tends to smooth out regional differences . 
  with what ? 
  secession ? 
  i agree with the caveats i outlined above . 
  if we agree as humans to be limited by the tribal construct of `` nation '' or `` country '' , then we must provide an equal opportunity to everyone to decide what that is . 
  anything else would be tyranny . 
  but my hope is that we can eventually , as human beings , transcend the impulse that drives us to separate ourselves into tribes and castes . 
  i hope that one day any kind of nation , whether whole or split off from another one , will become obsolete . 
  to clarify my position , it was one of thinking forward , not strictly one or the other of what i outlined above . 
  i am convinced that ultimately human progress and freedom lies toward the path of transcending nations , and therefore i regard secession as a temporary state . 
  while i applaud the impulse of freedom that drives it , and endorse it , i think that an attempt to create an even smaller nation , for all its potential benefits , does not lie on this path of progress unless it be temporary . 
  suppose , for the sake of argument , that we decided to call ourselves europeans - what would it matter where the border between basque country and the rest of spain was then ? 
  between sardinia and italy ? 
  it would n't . 
  and that , in my opinion , would be a great thing . 
  good for you for being consistent . 
  i am very much in agreement with the general argument for independence and self-governance , and my natural impulse is to say of course , any number of regions should hold referenda and if they so decide , secede or become autonomous or any other degree of independence they want . 
  however ( as a kind of political sciences exercise ) i also like to consider what the effects of this course of action are in the long run , not in the case of italy or spain or the uk , but in general . 
  vis-a-vis , if you provide every region with the chance to determine whether they would like to be self-governed , some will take that chance and some will not . 
  therefore in such a hypothetical scenario countries will naturally fracture into smaller constituent states with varying degrees of autonomy . 
  that state of affairs runs counter to my feeling that humanity must eventually transcend its tribal concept of nations and archaic us-versus-them ideologies and emerge united , not to mention anything about any adverse socio-economic effects of secession . 
  it 's an interesting question with no clear answer , but i find it hard to argue with those who advocate cohesion not because they are against the right to self-governance , but because they think it provides clear social and economic benefits to everyone involved . 
  do you have any thoughts about that ? 
  surely there are better reasons than that !, 
  may i ask you out of genuine curiosity how you feel about the basque separatists and other such movements within spain ? 
  that is a shame , then . 
  do you feel that the scottish economy can take steps to become less reliant or volatile in the future , and thus enable the scots to make a different decision on independence ? 
  and would that course of action be worth it ? 
  so the reasons are purely related to economy , i understand ? 
  completely agree .

  gee what 's with you balkanites and cleansing ? 
  it * is * a commieblock , complete with druggies and prostitutes . 
  same in italy - we all fear the * corrente * over here . 
  but yes , my grandmother too warned me to never sit on the floor at home because the cold may travel all the way up to my back and then i could get an ache , possibly catching pneumonia or death in the process . 
  oh oh oh , you wish !, 
  1919 best year of my life . 
  ( and even if you did you 'd be getting italy 's own retirement home , which is not that nice ) . 
  have n't you heard ? 
  wind is the number one cause behind all kinds of aches and ailments , especially those localised in the neck area ; you should never , ever leave home without having thoroughly dried your hair first otherwise you might catch a cold and die . 
  do n't say we did n't warn you . 
  then you 'd better start making decent beer , or they ai n't gon na let you join the club anytime soon !, 
  london , new years ' eve 2013 . 
  think of polar temperatures coupled with the kind of wind that would put trieste to shame . 
  what do we see ? 
  scantily-clad - actually almost naked - girls everywhere !, 
  to my italian brain , which is naturally hard-wired to fear even the most innocuous gusts of wind , this is unacceptable . 
  that , and the people puking their guts out on the pavement at 6 pm . 
  i wo n't actually be mentioning the separate faucets for hot and cold water because at this point it 's like beating the proverbial dead horse ( but i 'm definitely going to mention the exotic , and admittedly most curious , habit of carpeting your bathroom of all places ) . 
  toll booths . 
  ever heard of them ? 
  i mean , even croatia has those ... just let that sink in for a minute . 
  sure , as long as you have good dentists and cheap petrol . 
  but seriously , fuck dars !, 
  historically speaking , the alps have always been italy 's best ( and perhaps only ) friend . 
  legend has it that the architect who designed it died shortly after seeing the finished thing . 
  i do n't know much to dispute it , but it sounds plausible !, 
  i understand the political angle but did n't it become a rather iconic building ? 
  they very much do , and rome is no exception . 
  you know , proles generally do n't live in the quaint city centres tourists see ... 
  the entirety of rome 's outer suburbs should be nuked from outer space imho . 
  as well as all the shitty housing that sprang up between the 1950s and the 1980s ( not least because half of it was built illegally , almost overnight , with subpar materials and is an eyesore ) . 
  but wait , there 's more ... europe 's longest housing project : [ the snake !, 
  ] ( http://www.arvaliastoria.it/public/010286.jpg ), 
  of course , we need government approval even to take a shit . 
  this is kinda reasonable though . 
  if you have an undiagnosed heart defect , join a gym and suddenly die after perving at the hot girls during yoga class then it 's the owner 's ass on the line . 
  there 's legal trouble to be had . 
  absolutely haram !, 
  general practitioners are not `` public officials '' the same way police , judges or ... coroners are . 
  and while gps do visits for free , they still charge you for things like those certificates you need to join a gym or swimming pool ( prices are at their discretion : it is perfectly possible for one doctor to charge 60 $ , while another may ask for 80 ) . 
  exams coroners give you are considered beyond the so-called `` essential levels of assistance '' so you have to pay for them yourself as they 're not covered by the ssn ; prices are high despite being set by the government . 
  1 ) yes , 2 ) nope , even though they work with and for the ssn . 
  appointments are about 15-20 quid each ( prices vary ) but keep in mind that you 'll be going there relatively frequently and for relatively minor things as well . 
  then there are all the medical/drug/psychological tests they will tell you to do at your own expense ; in my case ( taxi driver ) the arsehole in question prescribed * every single one of those in the list * even though i had already done many of them while in the military , not even a year before . 
  i ended up paying about 600 $ , and good thing i pestered him or he 'd have forgotten my case even though the hospitals i had done the exams in had sent their results weeks before so all he had to do was to have a look at them , scribble a few lines on a piece of paper and put a stamp on it . 
  but `` no paper no registration '' - the local chamber of commerce was n't having any of that . 
  the kicker ? 
  i have to do this every three years . 
  that 'd be the forensic specialist - * medico legale * - tasked with investigating suspicious hospital deaths . 
  in italy , however , you also need to visit this ~ ~ villain 's lair ~ ~ person 's office whenever you need a certificate stating things like your degree of disability , professional competence ( for jobs like security guard or cab driver ) , eligibility to be a gun owner and whatnot . 
  this is also the person will be evaluating you should you ever happen to get your driving licence suspended or revoked , possibly because of a dui ... ... and every time you 'll set foot in that dingy , smelly little office , you 'll be safe with the knowledge that you 're about to be treated like the absolute worst criminal piece of scum on earth and have paid good money for such privilege . 
  what a time to be alive . 
  & nbsp ; edit : btw happy cakeday !, 
  same here !, 
  ok , i see where you 're coming from . 
  but let 's be honest : the whole thing about lower incomes is a joke , as the government has set the bar so low that one would almost have to be on the brink of starvation in order to qualify for any kind of discount . 
  this goes without mentioning the waiting lists , and good luck trying to claim your unemployment or doing anything useful with it . 
  prices in conventioned clinics , on the other hand , are still obscene and borderline unaffordable . 
  let 's not forget about what kind of butchers populate the asl , last time i checked they did n't even have anaesthetic !, 
  no biggie , right ? 
  after all who does n't want to have their cavities done without the thrilling prospect of at least some pain ... 
  the ssn does an admirable job overall but the italian dentistry sector is simply undefendable ; in fact , it 's utter shite and i 'd rather make the trek to croatia all over again than give a single penny to such profiteering fat-cats . 
  teeth are not a luxury !, 
  that shitty rip-off of `` titanic '' . 
  you know , the one with the rapping dog and all ... 
  i 'd say that the italian system works , and fairly well at that . 
  now if only it included dental care ... too bad the dentists here are a friggin ' cartel !, 
  they would give colombian narcos a run for their money . 
  it is cheaper to cross the border at trieste , stay in a hotel , enjoy the beaches of istria , have your teeth fixed in a local clinic and get back home via train than having a single capsule fitted here . 
  they even speak italian and accept euros , so what more could you possibly want ? 
  god forbid you ever need to speak with a coroner ... bunch of arseholes the lot of 'em . 
  they think they 're doctors but they 're not , they think they 're lawyers but they 're not and yet they want to be paid like one , they have an inflated ego the size of a drug lord 's fuck-off mansion ( complete with coke plantation ) and are incredibly rude to boot . 
  expect to shell big-time dosh whenever you see one . 
  i think they 're the most hated professional category in italy after traffic cops , notaries , taxi drivers , civil servants and politicians !, 
  ** spanish ** ... you know those ads in which the speaker has to warn the public of contraindications of a given drug in a ridiculously short time ? 
  or that sound videocassettes used to make when you rewound them ? 
  that 's spanish . 
  the ** french ** sound like they 're doing their best to talk while trying to hold their mouths as closed as possible . 
  ** english ** has no middle ground ; you 're either milord or a chav , sometimes a cowboy . 
  sometimes all of them . 
  ** portuguese ** is what you would sound like when you 're all bunged up and still attempt to speak italian . 
  ** welsh ** is what dead cthulhu would probably ` speak ' if it ever wanted to interact with us puny humans . 
  ** dutch ** sounds like a german trying to imitate a scotsman while coughing all the way through . 
  ** modern greek ** has a singy-songy feel to it and random , unexpected italian words abound . 
  ** polish ** is surprisingly smooth and sexy on the ears - a true slavic pantydropper of sorts !, 
  ** albanian ** is what an hypothetical bastard child of french and turkish would sound like . 
  sardinians sound like latin-speaking robots who talk in reverse , like master yoda . 
  venetian tends to have that slurred feel to it , you can almost smell the grappa . 
  tuscans have a most hilarious lisp and sometimes they talk real funny . 
  calabrians sound like they 're having an hiccough all the time . 
  the milanese , well ... they just sound effeminate !, 
  & nbsp ; finally : & nbsp ; roman , my dialect , is what harambe would sound like had it been given the faculty of speech . 
  still quite fond of it though !, 
  & nbsp ;  they do n't even speak the letters that are right there !, 
  & nbsp ; wait until you have to read fre - sorry . 
  heil no !, 
  not quite , i for one ca n't understand a word of spoken spanish !, 
  & nbsp ;  how does your country view ... the army ? 
  & nbsp ; the military has no particular prestige here ( everyone and their father has been drafted at some point ) so its members tend to be seen as little more than civil servants with an uniform on . 
  still , it 's a state job and once you 're in ... you 've made it for life .

  everything got back to normal thanks to the quirinal ( aka the president of italian republic ) that congratulated with the viminale ( aka the minister of interiors , we sometimes call them according to roman hill where their office is located ) . 
  glad i have n't fayed to deliver . 
  no worries , the ambulance is coming ... any moment from now . 
  you hit like a french concrete pylon . 
  i would pay to see junker completely drunk among kangoroos and koalas, 
  let 's simplify in a classy and traditional way : * cecco beppe *, 
  do not worry , they are in good company with a lot of dimwit assholes here : minister graziano del rio , just this morning , gave his best in the good tradition of catholic politicians . 
  my grandpa used to say `` in time of need every hole is a trench '' . 
  he is just commemorating ww1 ... since he was 16 apparently . 
  ten of thousands no , thousands maybe . 
  operation * mare nostrum * first and then * triton * helped to reduce the number of people dying , but the point is , they should not leave the coast in the first place . 
  the vast majority of them ( we are in the order of 90 % and more ) do not have the requirements to have political asylum granted ... 
  yeah , pretty much we accepted them into ports as they claimed they had rescued ships in danger . 
  so we were obliged to do so by international law ... but reality is , most of them were picking migrants up basically at few miles from libya and without any explicit danger for them ... 
  ignoring the closest safe port condition and ferrying them here . 
  mate we have always patrolled our waters ... 
  if you think it 's the problem is in our waters you are very mistaken . 
  the peoblem is in libyan waters ... 
  and that is exactly what is going on now . 
  our ships are already there ( 2 of the 7 right now ) , and results , hopefully , will come quickly . 
  not entirely true . 
  this year fiber cable arrive ( i 'm in a small town distant from the sea in central italy ) . 
  it has improved a lot in the recent years and the government is financing the total national coverage for cable . 
  it is getting better by the days . 
  in addition my comune has free wifi in the city center since 2014 . 
  while the code of conduct is marginal , the naval mission is not , and it is precisely what we needed . 
  part of the libyan coast guard was helping th human traffickers , now that we have ships there , they can not do that anymore and we will also give the libyan navy all the support they need to avoid the departures ... that 's the real thing . 
  let me give you the only reasonable response i can find . 
  done, 
  uhm ... 
  i 'll start to have a party then ... we did well even with a evaluation on * effective government * , ayy lmao, 
  try to behave as a proper human being or at least in the same way you are expected in you contry and everything will be fine . 
  i see a lot of people from northern europe here in italy who believe they are allowed to do anything ... from a bath in a roman fountain , to drive at crazy speed , to fuck amid a road as happened to a couple of britons in florence last year . 
  i see only one factual problem , the whole renaming of ikea stuff . 
  ... we got literaly bashed and accused of racism ( and even worse , fascism ) when we started blockading the mediterranean sea in accord gheddafi ... by the whole europe , nordic contries above all ... we were even fined for doing so ... 
  uhm , we beat frogs , albion and fritz , i would start having a party right now but , before that , what are the basis of this research ? 
  what kind of method did they use ? 
  can we have more informations ? 
  repubblica marinara di ragusa too strong mate . 
  yeah , my middlefinger for you is saving the planet . 
  we are already spending a lot of money , just have a look on the last year expenses for the illegal immigrants we host ... and almost nothing came back from europe despite the promises . 
  envy of what ? 
  80meters are for the secret labs and slavery department . 
  / s but not that much, 
  bravo poinc , bella galleria . 
  if you think the problem is for us to blockade the med you are deeply wrong . 
  we have been obliged by eu to rescue them as close as possible to libyan coast to avoid deaths of thousands . 
  i 'm tired of your bullshit , give me a break . 
   the erdogan deal was an attempt to find a solution for the whole of the eu and not just for individual nations which started putting up border fences . 
  ** no ** erdogan deal was a solution for the problem of a nation and the countries on the path to reach that nation . 
  not a problem for us , but still everyone paid . 
  and yet now when we are in the shit , mostly beacuse of europe and because france and uk and what they started in libya , no one is here to help . 
  we will start doing so when the germans will reduce their shameful surplus and the french will stop doing what the fuck they want with their deficit . 
  good day . 
  edit1 oh , and we will bailout all the banks we like since every one has done that before that rule . 
  yeah , totally not done beacuse merkel was also under fire for the arrival of thousands of people pissing off germans a year before elections , am i right ? 
  just for the outer borders . 
  please ... the whole thing to pay turkey was done by the germans and shoved in the throat of every other member state ... 
  you will not hear this from me , not now , nor in the future . 
  never . 
  but if you think i 'll stay silent while the entire `` union '' , a word that right now means nothing , shits on us , you are very mistaken . 
  it 's good to see europe solidarity for the problems of every member state , when it comes to bribe erdogan because germany needs it , all is perfectly fine . 
  when it comes to help us no one to be seen . 
  i wonder how i say * testa di cazzo * in other three languages . 
  there we go again and again and again . 
  do not worry , we will have our revenge . 
  be silent , goofy and smiley as always ... time will come ... 
  thanks !, 
  of course i was joking even if i would be glad to have he-man on a flag . 
  this picture gives me an unexpected sadness . 
  can we just work to make the deal as light and good for them as possible ? 
  if the idea behind europe is peace in the continent and respect for everyone , they need to be treated as such . 
  there is no point in punishing for a democratic choice and even more there is nothing more anti-european than punishing at all for something like that . 
  and also a referendum can not delete thousands of years of civilization , they are still europeans even if not part of the eu . 
  edit1 a word, 
  [ thank you so much sweden ] ( http://entertainment.inquirer.net/files/2016/07/13717225_1265259390150735_8093269019210020606_o.jpg ), 
  glad to hear that , really . 
  have a nice day !, 
  this is very true , that 's why france and italy have a new joint support ship class coming soon . 
  the new its * vulcano * ( [ here is the video of bow launching ceremony ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1uy0lvfqgdq ) ) , can offer a lot of the logistics needed for a conventional aircraft carrier like the * cavour * . 
  i ca n't tell you how much this comment makes me happy . 
  thanks for sharing your experience !, 
  i 'm really glad it 's working fine . 
  training there it 's a very good idea and will cut a lot the preparation time for our new planes , making * cavour * at full power in quite a short time . 
  harriers are old but not toys , the * garibaldi * alone with 8 of them dropped over 120 missiles/bombs on her mission to libya . 
  anyway i 'm glad we will soon have the f35b . 
  they will be very useful despite all the criticism, 
  you can remove * will * . 
  italy has officially built his first f35b and it is also the first produced outside us . 
  more to come , probably 20 even if only 15 have been confirmed for sure . 
  italian pilots are already training in the us , as soon as we get them in number , * cavour * will jump quite high in capability . 
  * cin cin *, 
  judging what i have spent last time , no . 
  they live out of that . 
  i will never take a ride on a gondola but honestly i do not feel i am in the position to judge them . 
  to be ( during the investigation ) with positive feelings and to have the desire to become a terrorist or clearly declaring support towards it . 
  they have kicked out even imams who attempted to recruit people . 
  since they are not citizens * arrivederci e grazie * . 
  btw the ban is at least 10 years . 
  no one expects the spanish shitpost .

  italy 's socialdemocratic party has a blairite social liberal as its leader . 
  same goes in france with valls ' faction getting stronger and stronger . 
  i think what 's happening in the uk is a good sign but i think that corbyn 's brand of left wing politics , although better than that centrist mess there used to be , is dated, 
  did n't most polls give sdp as the winner ? 
  anyway , will hdz able to form a government ? 
  they got a quite close win by the way , i find it surprising that dalmatian touristic areas are so right wing friendly, 
  i agree with you . 
  in fact , fascism and islamism are different faces of the same coin . 
  they are closer than you would think . 
  vague economical policies usually quite to the left of the political spectrum to get working class votes , social conservativeness and use of nationalism ( alt right ) / islamism to shift the discourse towards a common enemy ,, 
  giving money to marxist leninist party would be like giving money to a dead fish in the water, 
   agreed , the the biggest problem is making the islamists stay in line and respect the democratic process while also making sure hafter does n't have dictatorial ambitions . 
   anyway , while still fragile , this deal is a step forward , something i ca n't say about syria . . something i find interesting is that serraj is always depicted the man who can bring democracy to the country but what are his political ideas ? 
  does he plan to stand for elections in the future ? 
  the problem is that communist rule has weakened anything slightly to the left such as socialdemocracy . 
   revival of islam like a main social and political ideology . 
  atat\u00fcrk , mohammad reza pahlavi , nasir forced secularization , other dictators , including saddam , gaddafi , assad or boumediene , tried keep islam off politics , but it was possible only using force . 
  they strenghtened islamist parties by keeping them off of politics . 
  islamism is strong because it lends a hand to the working class and the underclass , it puts together social conservativism and leftist economics . 
  that makes it actually pretty similar to how italian fascism is born . 
  it 's a difference coin of the same medal  it is much more probable that democracy unfortunately extincts as political system also in west . 
  tunisia already is a democracy and morocco will probably slowly head the same way ( i think it 's likely it becomes a constitutional monarchy in the future ) . 
   who knows if turkey will have elections anymore under erdogan . 
  they were n't part of the spring . 
  anyway , yeah , they will have elections and we will most likely see hdp still hovering about 11-12 % , chp at 30 % , akp around 47-48 % and mhp under the 10 % threshold, 
  yep although as far as i know , far left parties are dead in the water in eastern europe at the moment . 
  i guess the time for their partial resurgence still has n't come, 
   same with china . 
  china has n't gotten to this point yet . 
  they are still effectively ruled by a dictatorship and the manifestations in hong kong show that sooner or later they will either have to make concessions ( which they already partly have ) or that shit will start hitting the far . 
  it can be compared to how europe needs a far right party scare ( as in them getting 15-20 % of the vote ) once in a while to remind us that we must never go down that route again like we did in the 30s . 
   if you remove semisecular dictators from power , there will be a violent islamist uprising . 
  that 's what happened in iraq , libya and syria . 
  a coup saved egypt from same fate . 
  not sure . 
  look at tunisia , the secularists won and ennadha had to rebrand from an islamist muslim brotherhood party to a conservative one to cope with the loss . 
  looking at egypt , morsi and mb won the presidential election quite narrowly and only because of his opponent 's close connection with the mubarak regime . 
  aside from that , from what i have been told , mb is supported in egypt ( especially by the working classes ) because of their leftist economical views and because they are set up like a charities that acts in rough neighbourhoods . 
   when the fuck will we learn that you do n't export democracy with missiles ? 
  the problem just like in iraq was that they did n't plan what was going to happen after the intervention had beaten the loyalist forces . 
  there was no plan for lybia post gaddafi . 
  if they had one , the civil war would have ended with his ousting, 
  libya was pretty much a feudal country . 
  it was n't a nation but a union of tribes kept together by the presence of a strongman at the helm . 
  libya was gaddafi during those forty years of ruling, 
   comparing to this or african average it was a paradise . 
  the problem is that it should n't be compared to subsaharian average but to countries such as morocco , tunisia , even algeria after which you would notice there were indeed problems . 
   he was on black list of western nations for so long / later he became almost our ally defending europe from migration from subsaharan africa , investing billions to italy and so on . 
  became almost bff with berlusconi ... so many things can change in international relations and geopolitics it is unbelievable . 
  so the question is who fuc.ked up . 
  nato did with another stupid intervention it 's italy who actually invested in libya and not the other way around . 
  we did infrastrcture work to repair for our colonial rule and in exchange of immigration deal . 
  in italy , the situation is usually reported more often due to how close libya is and i would say it 's reported quite well all in all . 
  libya has never been a hotbed of islamism , it appears to be quite similar to tunisia politically , maybe slightly more moderate whereas the split between secular and conservative parties seem to be larger in tunisia . 
   a united army also took over sirte from isis , now they barely hold some costal villages who are being besiege by the army . 
  the army , mostly made up of misurata brigades , is struggling though . 
  half of its men have been wounded or are now dead and that 's a large amount of losses for the government . 
   all in all libya today looks better then syria . 
  the people i spoke with , say this time everyone is determined to take it slowly . 
  write a constitution , under the un unity government , form a true army and only then hold elections . 
  i myself am more confident of libya 's future then that of syria , but we will all have to wait and see . 
  phew that was a long comment ... never wrote this much on reddit . 
  i hope now at the least , even if you disagree with me , you leave knowing more of libya then before !, 
  the problem will be to find an agreement between the tobruk government and the tripoli government . 
  that 's the main concern nowadays . 
   but that urbanisation leads to more secular-liberal culture i am pretty convinced . 
  it 's difficult to be in daily contact with a wide array of people and believe there is nothing more to life than what is prescribed by bronze or iron age texts . 
  that and a live and let live attitude is required to keep one 's sanity . 
  tehran behind the closed doors , far from the police 's eyes hosts a liberal society , yearning for western freedoms . 
  islamism has shown that it can thrive in a city as long as it is a homogeneous one ( in the same way tripoli or benghazi are ) . 
  looking at the syrian civil war , you will notice that generally the most different a place is , the least likely it is to be controlled by is or islamist rebels ( aleppo and northern aleppo countryside are an exception to the rule ) and more likely instead to be controlled by secular forces such as sdf and the government . 
   switzerland has referendums all the time . 
  if you accept the principle of referendums , it seems odd to only think they should happen every 10-12 years . 
  surely they should happen when people want them ( provided that they are about sufficiently distinct things ) . 
  i think that a referendum about a single matter ( i.e. 
  uk being or not in the eu ) should be done once about 10-12 years unless it 's formulated differently or it has a similar proposal to the one that was just rejected . 
  i did n't explain myself well . 
  i did n't know about 2011 referendums being different than the 2016 one mainly because i was n't aware of it . 
  i made my research now and i agree with you, 
  switzerland is my reference as well but i do think we should study what makes it work . 
  if there is n't a solid base , then the building will have structural problems . 
  for example , i think it tends to work more efficently on a smaller scale  however , for me this is fundamentally about trusting fellow humanity and believing that if you give people responsibility they will behave responsibly . 
  i think that one of the problem is that the medias tend to skew the perceptions of an issue often without properly reporting on it . 
  they give their twist leading people to believe in their political agenda . 
   maybe countries like uk and italy are not quite ready for that ( and indeed it seems like your upcoming referendum on changing your voting system is being delayed ... ) . 
  [ italy has a meaningful history with referendums ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/referendums_in_italy ) . 
  that 's how we made divorce and abortion legal in the 70s . 
  the radical party was a small party that had 5-6 % of the vote in the 70s yet they are the ones who started a series of referendum which revolutioned italy . 
  we had our last referendum in april about drilling in our seas and it did n't pass because it did n't reach the 50 % quorum because the side that did n't want things to change stayed at home . 
  i think quorum must be lowered to spur more people to vote . 
  the constitutional referendum is being delayed because it 's uncertain if the changes to our constitution are actually accepted by the constitutional court and because politicians ca n't agree to a date . 
  you are definitely the minority of brexiters and maybe one of the few to be coherent . 
  i am generally a supporter of direct democracy as well and i have seen that there are double standards amongst many of `` our kind '', 
  it is . 
  putting it down to a question of sovereignty is oversimplifying the matter when british people were renouncing the high number of funds they get from the eu in sectors such as agriculture or in depressed areas such as the mining towns of wales , northern ireland , ecc . 
  many brexiters support direct democracy only when it serves their purpose . 
  ask them about scotland getting another referendum or bremainers getting another referendum just like they did and see how they answer . 
  you got the referendum you wanted in 2011 already . 
  i mean , the same people who say scotland should get the independence referendum 15-20 years from now were calling for another referendum about the eu 5 years after last one . 
  that 's a mix of double standards and hypocrisy .

  we still have 1960 's style communists and de gaullian like right wingers , although they are the old guard and are starting to loose their hold on politics . 
  but we have new and young radical movements like the 5 star movement and the lega nord which have taken their place . 
  unfortunatly the table of discussion in italy is not between centre , centre-right , and centre-left ; it is between centre , centre-right , centre-left , jacobins , communists , fascists in all but name , the organised crime , the contrarians ( who much like reddit will oppose out of principle anything that is seen as majority approved of ) , the church , and whatever the flavour of the month is . 
  add to the fact that politicians will often switch sides based on whom the public is leaning in favour of , and parties are dissolved and reformed with the same regularity as the rain cycle ; and that in italy you can not vote for your representative , you can only vote for a party who will select a representative for you . 
  this is a rough picture and the strokes are broad and the colours are a bit off , but it is honest enough to show that in this landscape , political stability is simply not part of even the naivest idealist 's presumptions . 
   in italy , governments seem to be designed to be weak i would not say this . 
  i just think the italian character is naturally litigious and fickle , which will make any form of democratic government in italy unstable . 
   press conferences confirming that he intends to finish his term , then the question is in doubt . 
  whenever this happens in italy , 1-3 months latter , they resign leaving their mandate unfinished . 
  that makes sense . 
  i mean , clearly amongst a certain french elite the vichy regime was very popular . 
  we can find napoleon 's closest living descendant and go four a glorious round 3 . 
  canada acting as a hype man for america , who could have guessed . 
  but in all seriousness i admit / u/jaquestrap does seem far more informed on this topic than i. 
  and in true italian fashion , i surrender and switch sides . 
  well shit , this is a really detailed post ; i ca n't right now but will look it over and reply . 
  you seem very informed , so i do apologise for the harsh tone of before . 
   malta i think we have one or two of those around here . 
  i swear i have seen the flair before . 
  i did not see that one coming . 
  ^ is ^ this ^ how ^ to ^ start ^ a ^ pun ^ chain ? 
  the * ` pean empire * ; it is decided then !, 
  your entire post is composed of hindsight , speculation , and overestimation . 
  you make it all seem so simple and obvious , which shows a grave lack of historical context . 
  in 1939 the germans had the most powerful army in europe . 
  the french and british still remembered ww1 ; and they assumed that a strong push would be atrocious and could not be done unless there was a ready reserve of of men in the rear to support the vanguard and defend from a german counter attack . 
  i could also say that had poland spent more money and effort in creating a formidable fighting force they could have held out long enough for the british and french to prepare and launch an offensive . 
  so poland was stupid for not having done this . 
  but this would be speaking with hindsight and ignoring historical nuance and would make me seem very silly . 
  so how about we avoid armchair genius and think that maybe the generals of france and britain who had spent a lifetime practising the art of war and who had become men in the trenches of ww1 ; knew more about plausible successful strategies than some guy on the internet with a clear bias . 
   that entitled them to dispossess people of their land and curtail their political and social freedoms , outright annexing other countries ? 
  entitled , no . 
  it did give them enough justification that france , britain , and the usa would have to start a war with the soviets to take the east out of soviet hands . 
  no he would not ; the nuclear weapons america had at the time could not even come close to doing the damage the germans had done prior ; the soviets were willing to fight to the last man against the germans , dropping a nuke on them , would have started a war of genocide on both ends . 
  what where they meant to do ? 
  after five years of war against the germans , do you think they should have just carried on and declared war on the soviet union ? 
  the did not betray the east , the east just had the bad luck to be on the wrong end . 
  besides ( not poland ) but many baltic states and eastern states had supported the nazis ; this was the justification stalin used and it is hard to argue against , especially after 12 million soviet deaths . 
  and 12 million is not a pointless number . 
  true . 
  and the polish fought bravely . 
  but they could not seriously expect france and britain to come to their rescue immediately ; both nations needed time to finish rearmament and organise . 
  complaining that the french/british did not do enough is just presumptuous . 
  hear !, 
  hear !, 
  can we call it the the european empire ? 
  just to fuck with the rest of the world . 
  have we just figured out what to do with all the illegal immigrants ? 
  i think we have . 
  to be fair a nation which relies on other nations for its self defence ca n't complain much . 
  til, 
  not the louvre . 
  but spain is in the eu ; why would a spaniard have to worry about immigration rules with germany ? 
  then you have not been to italy . 
  i would say about 15-20 % of our university graduates are able to speak a somewhat tolerable english . 
  amongst those without higher education , i would say it is less than 5 % . 
   allegedly called poor people ` the toothless ' . 
  to be fair , if you compare to french history ; by contrast the modern poor are toothless and unwilling to fight . 
   i do n't doubt that they can make a lasagna sandwich work . 
  please do n't britain . 
  please , think of the children . 
  if they had the same level of advancement as scotland , then they too would have gotten short cuts . 
   all other new joiners have had to take on the entire acquis . 
  most other new joiners are poor eastern nations which require eu funding and have corrupt governments with little stability ; scotland is economically , politically , and structurally up to the standards of western europe . 
   what about an obligation to join schengen ? 
  or the euro ? 
  considering that they were part of britain i do n't think there would be any problem letting them in on the same conditions as before . 
  i honestly do n't think the main eu members would really put up much fuss or make scotland 's entry difficult . 
  the only one who might try to put up an obstacle would be the uk . 
  the french would do everything possible to help a smooth and quick transition back into the eu for the new independent scotland . 
  pretty sure the eu would give scotland automatic membership as soon as it sorted out it 's constitution . 
  weird , it 's almost like a nuanced and studied view of a topic , makes it difficult to turn into propaganda of evil vs good . 
   just sayin , ( maybe ) he was trying to make a point but the point was naive and uninformed . 
  and * l'assommoir * will shatter your soul . 
  wow i never realised how similar romanian is to latin before . 
  that is closer to latin than either french or italian . 
  he mean bonus as in extra not as in beneficial . 
  but it is important to consider how many lives were saved , the utter harshness of the russian reply ensured that no further terrorist attacks were carried out ; had they been softer , the terrorist might have tried more attacks . 
  it is entirely possible that in the long run the russians saved more lives . 
   the sufficient point to make here is a gradual evolutionary development of traits constitutive of morality , which does n't really allow for idiosyncratic cultural constructs to have a key role . 
  i may be misunderstanding what you are trying to say , so correct me , but this only makes sense if you ignore history . 
  from an evolutionary standpoint me and you are identical to an ancient roman or greek or indian . 
  yet in ancient greece slavery was not regarded as a moral fault . 
  in fact aristotle even made and argument that slavery is morally justified , and a slave society is making the just moral choice . 
   for a non-animal strain of argumentation here , you can take the intercultural results of the trolley , transplant and similar variants of ethical problems - you can get a significant level of consistency in the responses across cultures ( though apparently interesting differences have been uncovered over time ) -- when the fmri seem to suggest the differences in the switch vs fat man variants is in the emotional activation and regions related to response conflict getting highly activated in the fat man scenario , vs activity in the higher cognitive functions in the switch scenario . 
  again pointing to biologically fixed , emotive and patchwork nature of moral reasoning , rather than dependent on particular learned cultures . 
  here you lost me , mind offering this more precise way ? 
  the trolley problem is an example of an ethical paradox , so using it in a study to gouge ethical understanding seems pointless , as it is an idea with with to examine ethical systems . 
  for example if you take the kantian ethical system the answer is clear . 
  the fact that the majority of people do not devote themselves to the philosophical study of ethics , would mean that the participants would not approach the problem with their own refined ethical system but , would simply use the ethical hodge podge of ideas immersed into them passively by their society . 
  so i do n't understand the logic behind this experiment . 
   i think the more vocal name in making the argument that morality proper - just like in humans - is indeed observed in our closes primate cousins is frans de waal , so no surprise goodall would have a different take ( though idk if this is the case or not , i 'll take your word for it ) . 
  as you can see in the quotes provided ( here 's another one - http://www.ted.com/talks/frans_de_waal_do_animals_have_morals ) he sees no problem in calling these morality - so your claim that chimps have no sense of morality is - just as heavily debatable ( and counterexamples you give at first glance seem just as typical of human behavior as well -- having lived through a war and having been abandoned by my father , they even strike close to home ) this is a semantics debate . 
  morality is not fairness , it is a product of higher reason , and animals lack higher reason . 
  this is just about how one chooses to define morality . 
   your claim lions know of fairness seems highly dubious - check out the definition - this is about a distributive justice ; if you accept an unfair offer , both of you profit , if you reject it neither gets anything ; will you accept an unbalanced offer - humans and chimps seem not to beyond some minimal threshold , while the selfish thing , what you 'd do if you had no notion of fairness is to always accept the offer - this is the research pointing to the notion of fairness in chimps , can you link something similar re lions ? 
  once again i think this is a semantics debate as fairness is not morality . 
  fairness and cooperation are evolutionary and most mammals posses them as they increase the likelihood of survival . 
  fairness by definition is subject to circumstance , an ethical system by definition is not affected by circumstance . 
  you are talking about fairness ; i was talking about morality ; we are talking about different things .

  but we are , i just did . 
  i can well see that you chose to ignore my argument , but that does n't mean i should arbitrarily restrict my analysis to what you 'd prefer . 
  in fact , why do n't you go ahead and develop you argument in full ? 
  i 've done it , and i 'm not going to keep trying to guess what you 're trying to suggest by half-sentences . 
   the result has already caused upheaval in the markets as it has mired italy and the eurozone in a new era of uncertainty and is likely to worsen the position of its already troubled banking system anyone who does `` market reaction analysis '' a mere few hours after markets have opened is either ignorant or writing in bad faith . 
  there are always all kinds of panicked and stupid reactions immediately after a big event ; it 's the adjustment to trend that is indicative . 
  markets have returned across all indicators to exactly where they were before . 
   `` i do n't believe we can go on in a system where everybody criticises the system for decades and then does n't want to change it , '' said the italian pm . 
  what a pretentious little twit . 
  even now he fails to admit to his many mistakes , and instead pretends it 's a simple issue of stupid childish italians not wanting to go along with his enlightened leadership . 
  just because he proposed `` change '' does n't mean that it 's the change italy wants or needs . 
  and yet they did n't change the previous gdp trajectory , much like our `` lacrime e sangue '' labour market reforms did n't . 
  there might be a lesson to learn here ? 
   our parliament is not fast at all . 
  that only applies to the `` decretazione d'urgenza '' trivially false , i invite you to take a look at the actual numbers . 
  the referendum is done , so forgive me if i do n't go dig them up again . 
  forgive me for thinking that a brit might be consuming somewhat more british media than foreign then . 
  the point remains . 
  german gdp seems to have grown exactly on the same trend for as long as i can see : http://cdn.tradingeconomics.com/charts/germany-gdp-constant-prices.png?s=germanygdpconpri&amp;v=201611211731r&amp;d1=19160101&amp;d2=20161231 there were periods of stagnation and recession , but you can trace a very clear straight trend line from 1995 to today . 
  so i do n't know what they did in the 2000s , but it does n't seem to have put germany on a different growth path than it was before . 
  on the other hand , notice anything peculiar here ? 
  http://cdn.tradingeconomics.com/charts/germany-balance-of-trade.png?s=grtbale&amp;v=201611211040r&amp;d1=19160101&amp;d2=20161231 it seems that right around 2001 , german exports exploded . 
  coincidentally , that 's when germany adopted a currency significantly weaker than they had before . 
  germany is a reasonably well-run country , but any analysis of its 21st century economic performance that does n't account for the huge boon of the euro misses a fundamental component . 
   i thought the ` no ' vote was polling higher prior to the results , so the impact had largely been factored in ? 
  not just that , ` no ' had been polling higher for months . 
  everyone had positioned themselves accordingly , so it would have been rather surprising if there were any meaningful movement . 
   the italian banks have n't yet gone bust . 
  i imagine with british media predicting the death of europe ( any day now ) , this might seem like sound analysis to you , but `` the italian banks '' are n't going bust any time soon . 
  our npl problem is , to steal an expression , `` bad , but not serious '' . 
   well , 40 % all by himself , he 's looking good for the upcoming elections . 
  it 's 40 % for this specific reform . 
  renzi 's party is polling a net loss against the m5s . 
  yes , berlusconi 's party is still in the running . 
   here the funny thing : if this reform would have passed the new electoral law would have made possible to the 5 * to actually form a govern . 
  the referendum was not on the electoral law , the italicum majority-rule system remains in place . 
  come on man ... 
  the m5s does not want to leave the eu , they want a $ referendum . 
  by the way , the `` far right '' also does not want to leave the eu . 
  your press , to be kind , is a little bit sensationalistic and stereotyping when it comes to foreign country . 
   nevertheless something needs to be done and i 'm not sure i see anyone on the political scene whose up to the task . 
  there is n't . 
  which is why we need to face the music : strongmen and `` reformists for reform sake '' have failed , for two decades . 
  it 's time to turn to something else . 
   anyway , i just want to say it 's been a pleasant debate - which is a rarity on reddit these days . 
  thanks . 
  in brief : it would make it easier for the government to pass legislation without actual electoral support . 
  with the new setup , it would take a simple majority-rule electoral law ( like the one renzi passed ) to grant the government essentially the power to do whatever it wants despite not having 50 % + of the vote . 
   you 're obviously very happy but it makes no sense to me why you would be so against the referendum . 
  i explained it several times over between yesterday and tonight . 
   voting no now will just lead to inevitable instability in a time where italy needs a strong and stable government . 
  i fundamentally disagree with both assessments . 
   the italicum , jobs act and the bill for the constitutional amendment were like something out of a political drama . 
  the jobs act went swimmingly , the italicum and the const reform were an issue because he started writing them with berlusconi and then had to switch to different allies . 
  nothing to do with procedure . 
   but bigly is n't a word i know , it 's a trump meme . 
   is there anyone to take the country forward at all ? 
  we do n't need to take the country `` forward '' . 
  we 've been blindinly going `` forward '' for 20 years , without any question of where `` forward '' was leading . 
  we need to turn in the right direction before taking the next step , far more than we need to take a step for walking 's sake . 
   m5s wins the elections , they take us out of europe at some point , after the panick has settled , someone will actually check their policy positions and discover that the m5s is not for leaving the eu . 
  would you change the status quo for something that looks to be worse ? 
  neither would 60 % of us . 
  actually his hiring tax breaks had an immediate effect , as predicted . 
  they also had an immediate counter-effect as soon as they ended . 
  but sure , let 's wait a few years and see if making people easier to fire makes the economy better . 
  we 've only tried it for 20 years with no results , what 's a few more ? 
   because if not , it is the right thing for a left-leaning party to govern with a center-left policy approach . 
  but renzi was never left-leaning . 
  happily and openly so . 
   it 's about making it easier to pass big reforms . 
  yet renzi passed them with no issue . 
  so did the last 20 years of governments . 
   if the renzi could count on his own party for support then could get stuff done , but he ca n't because bersani hates him and will use every opportunity to destroy his own party 's government . 
  if you think bersani has any leadership role you really need to start paying attention . 
  bersani is politically dead , and ill of health as well . 
   they ( along with salvini ) are the standard bearers for the no . 
  yet the no won bigly even in areas where they are weak . 
  perhaps they 're only self-appointed in this role , without a real following ? 
  everyone can claim leadership in an opposition that does n't have an official structure . 
  those two parties hate each other , and yet ... 
   tell which economic reforms he managed to pass , during his government ? 
  the entirety of the jobs act ? 
  which was far more than abolishing the already-dead ( fornerno reform ) art . 
  his tax breaks ? 
  his huge overhaul of the unemployment subsidy and job placement scheme ? 
  his tax collection reform , only a few weeks old now ? 
  we 've reformed our economy for 30 years and it 's shit , maybe we need to stop thinking `` reform '' is the answer and start talking about the content of said reforms ? 
   but , in the end , the power resides on people and it will be them who will vote . 
  it does n't though . 
  power resides with those who have the money and influence to make a political party a relevant organizational force instead of nothing of note , with those who can give an idea media relevance or sink it , with those who can afford to not find a career but instead be in politics all their lives and build themselves up . 
  the people very rarely can do more than choose among the alternatives that the elite produces . 
  renzi himself made this about him , i do n't think it was particularly dishonest of them to take him at his word . 
   strengthens my original point that a new approach is needed to increase accountability this reform would have done the opposite though . 
  quite exactly the opposite . 
   you specifically said that the parliament in italy produces more laws than the european average yes , and yet we are mired in stagnation . 
  which means that making laws easier to pass is not what we need . 
   but i can never understand this tribalism that puts people behind grillo and berlusconi . 
  the tribalism is thinking that voting no means being with grillo or berlusconi . 
  i voted no and i loathe both those cunts .

  further negotiations are pretty much just wishful thinking . 
  so , just like this one , or are you really convinced on the occurrence of a christmas morning miracle in the event of a `` no '' ? 
  if push comes to shove , issueing temporary visas . 
  but i am pretty sure we wo n't really need to resort to that . 
  we * do * have a plan b , which would solve our problem , shifting the burden on the rest of the eu , but that does n't seem the kind of solution we are striving to achieve . 
  and rightly so . 
  you are right , because italy is actually in geographical proximity to siria and the italians are absolutely a driving force in the syrian conflict . 
  i know it might seem insane to you , but there are international treaties in place for stuff like that and you actually ca n't shred them at the first hint of any sort of trouble , well provided you are not north korea or some fancy country like that . 
  we are not looking for a way to weasel out of our obligations ( and rescuing someone who might drown is just that ) , we were looking for a way to shoulder the burden togheter and try to work a solution out togheter . 
  we were wrong , seems like someone is n't interested , never mind then . 
  you are right . 
  in the same way that joining the russian sanctions program is not any country 's duty , it 's just europe trying to show a unified position on foreign policy . 
  it 's really a pity that it seems to work only when some members of the eu stand to gain some advantages from it . 
   time for europe to become a fortress oh for fucks sake , / r/europe !, 
  is really this what we want to become ? 
  do we really want to subscribe to this deluded rhetoric , reeking of populism and xenophobia ? 
  today more than ever i feel perfectly in line with the reaction of the italian premier to today 's meeting . 
  if this is the idea of europe you plan to build , quite frankly you can keep it . 
  we do n't need it , we do n't want it and we 'd rather go ahead on our own . 
   a lot of people in sweden want more african immigrants . 
  is this really true ? 
  can i see a source on this ? 
  and , to be clear , being against dumping a bunch of migrants in the middle of the mediterranean sea , and if favour of providing housing is actually different from wishing there were more migrants to house . 
   libya ? 
  nope , more like the echr . 
  and that 's not something you can easily ignore or change . 
   nato members had to decide whether to let the libyan civil war simmer while ignoring all appeals for help , or help finish the civil war and stabilize libya by establishing a democratically elected government . 
  given the choice , the latter was clearly the best option . 
  given the current state of affairs in lybia , i could have sworn we had picked the former . 
   the only part of the plan that failed was how libyans failed to stabilize and establish a democratic government . 
  which , unfortunately , was pretty much the * whole * plan . 
   often efforts to deport them is met with fierce resistance from the eu and ngos for some reason . 
  i 'd say that the resistance is provided more by the migrants themselves and their home countries , which are generally more than happy to avoid the process of having them sent back , than by the various ngos , which still play a part though , or even the eu . 
  actually the lack of reference to organized crime ( in the area , that being camorra ) in italian media might partly excused by the fact that is something perceived as obvious . 
  anyone and their dog knows that behind the illegal waste disposal going on in campania there is the organized crime . 
  highlighting it as this point is pretty much just stating the obvious . 
  theoretically ? 
  yes . 
  practically ? 
  it really depends . 
  take the case of the syrian conflict as an example , there 's people who have been displaced for years now , and will probably be for many years to come . 
  would you expect someone who has lived the last decade in a foreign country , starting to make it his home , to just pack everything and go back because now his home country is supposed to be `` safe '' again ? 
  being in his shoes , would you ? 
  and we should delist them . 
  but amongst the link highlighted in the op there 's one from the website of the corriere della sera ( on of the most reputable italian newspapers ) reporting the words of the italian pm and on from the bbc . 
  are them propaganda too ? 
  it surely is . 
  yet does n't make it less than an issue . 
   that means over half should be sent back after they have exhausted all their appeals , and provided that their home country accepts them back . 
  a process which usually takes years and it 's incredibly burdensome on the legal systems of the countries that end up processing their claims . 
  in the mean time every plea to the eu pretty much falls on deaf ears . 
  so yes , it 's a problem and one that should be solved together by the whole union at that . 
   do n't try to sell the story as if italy did n't want to help the revolution actually nor italy nor eni had anything to gain from the revolution and were against a military intervention . 
  it 's no mistery that we were pretty cosy with gaddafi . 
  obviously , when presented with the the done deal , italy had to fall in line with the rest on the eu , being a democratic western country which despises dictators and human rights violations and all . 
  and , to be clear , i am not blaming france for the lybian clusterfuck more than i blame my own government . 
  obviously not from a moral point of view , but it really seemed a better solution from the logistical and practical prospective , at least from where the italian electorate stands.the lybian intervention was and still is widely considered a mistake . 
  actually no , but i see how this rhetoric would suit your goals . 
  fool !, 
  you are going to get us all banned !, 
  yes , pretty much . 
  and we took its backlash . 
  even though i 've never voted for the guy and i utterly despise him i still had to bear his government decisions and the neverending questions from foreigner friends on how was it possibile to pick him as premier . 
  are we talking about nowadays irish ? 
  because it seems to me they 're doing just fine . 
  it seems like there is more to the story , since the man was in italy the days of the attack to the bardo museum ( there is a consistent paper trail proving that he was , beyond any reasonable doubt , in italy on the 16th , attending an italian course , and it seems highly unlikely that he could reach tunisia in less than a day without using commercial flights ) . 
  for fucks sake , we took part in that fiasco . 
  almost each and every eu country was more that happy at the idea of the incoming after-war opportunities . 
   what are they going to do , put two frigates here ? 
  two warships ? 
  in libyan waters ? 
  that 's an invasion . '' i find this comment , from a presumed high-level smuggler with a grad degree in law , quite amusing , since depending on the content of the incoming un resolution , this might actually be what the eu is planning to do . 
   that 's already a lot of people . 
  compared to around 4 million people ( as of april ) it 's really not . 
  mind you , i am * not * saying that any country has to shoulder the blunt of the operation , but a mere 20000 people divided across europe is not * a lot of people * by any stretch . 
  ok , i 'm actually impressed , i 've never heard much about macerata but it seems a nice place and i see how the marche region is starting to cater to a foreign public , traditionally more associated with tuscany and to a lesser extent umbria . 
  we do , the area around florence is actually spotted with pharmaceutical plants , but the mission of the ifm is actually more extensive than simply producing stuff for the army . 
  as an example , there are many rare pathologies for which producing drugs would not be profitable in an open market , the burden is then picked up by the ifm and paid by public money . 
  or suppose you need a lot of a specific drug as soon as possible ( say iodine tablets after a nuclear event like chernobyl ) , you can not go around commandering private companies at every emergency , but the state can , and will , commander the ifm . 
  an article from 3 months ago . 
  it might arguably be considered an act of war under the current international doctrine and mantaining a close blockade would require a considerable logistic effort , for starters . 
   ap sunday 15 february 2015 01:55:05 pm a piece of news from two months ago ? 
  really ? 
  maurizio lupi is n't even the transport minister anymore . 
  edit : nice agenda btw op . 
  you really do not seem like an unhinged stormfronter . 
  really ? 
  something which was discussed at least a couple of times already in the last two days reaches 50 upvotes in less then 3 hours and 3 comments ? 
  are you kidding me ? 
  it turns out it was the regular libyan coast guard , with an embedded sky-italia news team on board , checking the papers of an italian fishing vessel that was fishing in libyan waters . 
  when the coast guard asked the boat to follow them to misrata port , since they did not have the required papers , the crew beat an unarmed libyan coastguard and took off . 
  you could actually argue that it was indeed an act of piracy from the italian fishing vessel . 
  [ source ] ( http://tg24.sky.it/tg24/cronaca/2015/04/18/peschereccio_italiano_libia_video_esclusivo.html ) ( in italian ), 
  i am not saying that a military intervention was wrong * per se * , hence why i am not particularly blaming the french government for the current situation , just that our actions on the matter were wrong , and that we clearly failed to reach the goal we set . 
  * the * intervention , as it was conducted , was a mistake , not just * any * intervention we could have mustered . 
  yet the intervention , among other international conditions , sparked the current libyan clusterfuck . 
  it turns out you ca n't simply depose a dictator and hope for the best , you either keep supporting the pacification process ( something we spectacularly failed to achieve ) or you might have to act later , even militarily , to fix the situation you contributed to create . 
  we actually should . 
  if not to pacify and reuinite the whole country ( a task which is totally out of the realm of possibilities ) , just to take the main ports and coastal areas , impose a naval blockade and set refugee camps . 
  and before someone highlights it , yes , it probably would be called neocolonialism , even under the un or eu banner .

  money was def the first reason , as employers in italy can be bloody difficult , but it was not the only factor . 
  i like living in cosmopolitan cities , meeting people from different walks of life and experience something italy ca n't offer at the moment . 
  speaking three languages , i wanted to be able to use them at work as well . 
  i am also gay , so i wanted to live somewhere i do n't have to worry about my personal safety or being discriminated at work/in public . 
  [ the italian wolf ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/italian_wolf ) , a subspecies of the grey wolf , which managed to survive even during the worst periods where wolves were on the brink of extinction . 
  it 's not official , but then again , our anthem is not official either . 
  i do like it , since it is a reminder that our wilderness somehow managed to get by better than in other european countries ( the wolves in france , austria , etc have had a less favourable treatment ) . 
  and it was one of rome 's most sacred animals as well . 
  meh , our relations are ok , when they do n't redirect the refugees ' boats to our coast , but generally i guess they are too small of a nation to be considered either commercial , military or economic allies . 
  and the fact that italian has been falling out of favour ever since they became a british colony does n't really help in that sense . 
  mmh , a toss between france ( if we give them another piece of our territory ) or spain . 
   one exception are coastal towns where villette are all the rage but even there you 'd be more likely to find condos . 
  and even in that case , i think a lot of people would question the swimming pool . 
  i mean , you have the sea at a stone 's throw . 
  and the sea is almost always better than any pool . 
  i think this falls into the '' americans lazy behaviours '' thing , like driving to get a sandwich and the likes . 
  no , he 's referring to the insulae , the ancient romans ' equivalent of the modern day condo . 
  there are not all wrong . 
  i just do n't like parties to base their policies on the polls and the fleeting nature of the public opinion . 
  i may be old fashioned , but parties win or lose elections on their party manifestos . 
  if you want to look at how fleeting public opinion is , look at england . 
  in april the tories seemed to be in for a landslide . 
  in june , they almost lost . 
   right now the \u00d6vp has a huge surge of popularity . 
  still believing in polls , i see . 
   when italy does the same they get fined abstrusely by the eu commission for human rights , but for the other nations is ok . naaah , it 's more like the game you see in the cartoons by bugs bunny & al. 
  you have the dynamite stick lit up and the thing gets passed over from one to the other . 
  it just happens that italy gets the stick the moment it explodes / s, 
  one word : elections . 
  the spoe and the oevp do n't want voters to switch to the far right fpoe and try to speak the same language . 
  little they know that the customer will choose the original over the poor imitation . 
   just like the italian border near slovenia tends to be quite empty as well compared to other similar regions . 
  but our border tends to follow the alpine watershed , so it makes sense that mountainous areas are sparsely populated . 
  just a word : dolomites . 
  [ case dismissed ] ( https://giphy.com/gifs/obama-mic-drop-out-3o7qdsovfaco9b3mlo ), 
   being dealt with without any say in the matter . 
  yeah , you 're right . 
  must be horrible not to have any mp at the eu parliament , no commissioner in the commission and no seat at the council of europe ... oh , wait !, 
  in the 60s . 
  the 50s were an age of conservatism all over europe , and italy was no exception ( the pope even personally telephoned the national broadcaster because two german soubrettes `` dared '' to wear carnation coloured stockings , so on black and white tv it looked like their tights were naked ) , but in the 1960s , especially after 1968 , we also had the wave of fight against the established morals , the echo of the paris 68 riots , etc , and this translated into referendums to introduce divorce ( 1974 ) , depenalise abortion and introduce state funded voluntary interruption of pregnancies ( 1981 ) and reform family laws so that both parents were legal guardians on equal standing . 
  celebrities also played a role in a way , as italy 's most famous singer of that era , mina , was ostracized for having a baby with a married man in 1963 ( he was actually separated , but there was no legal divorce back then ) and banned for one year from tv , only to be called back because fans did not care ( note : the public opinion was not as scandalised when ingrid bergman had twins with director roberto rossellini and was baned from hollywood ), 
  yep , as a bolognese , can confirm . 
  one of our thoroughfares leading out of the city is called stalingrad avenue , and we also have a lenin street and a togliatti avenue :p, 
  emilia romagna , liguria , tuscany , umbria , marche and umbria have been for the most part of the xx century the so called `` red regions '' because of their socialist and later communist allegiance ( read italian communists . 
  they were communists but they did not advocate for the seizure of private property and they 'd rather stay inside the nato than warsaw pact ) and because emilia and tuscany experienced the brutality of the gothic line warfare ) . 
  right now everything is melting down rapidly , so i would not be surprised if the democratic party , the party that took the baton from the communists and progressive catholics , collapsed , should an italian politician a la macron appear . 
  and riccardo illy and lucio malan are both waldesians . 
   ah a tip do n't google italian jewish politicians you do n't want to see the end of that tunnel . 
  do n't worry , i am masochist , but not to that point . 
  in any case , i am half through a jar of nutella , so i could handle it , if i wanted , 
   even the fascist party had 9 jews deputies ( up until mussolini decided to follow hitler in his genocidal idiocy ) . 
  his minister for finances and tresury in 1932-1935 was of jewish origin as well . 
  one of our first prime ministers was half jewish , but that was in xix century . 
  one of rome 's first majors after porta pia was jewish as well . 
  we do n't even have an official anthem to begin with . 
  our de facto anthem is the inno di mameli , but we never officialised it , although we use it in all official occasions . 
  our unofficial national anthem would be the [ va pensiero ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfsljt1362s ) chorus from verdi 's nabucco . 
  many people even tried to make it the anthem of the kingdom , but the sad , painful lyrics of the chorus did not bode well with the triumphalist , pompous nationalism that permeated europe in the last decades of the xix century , so it was shelved . 
  paris , rome and florence, 
   germans , austrians : crucchi ( i do n't know the meaning ) , mangiacrauti ( sauerkraut eaters ) , kartoffeln crucchi is actually a word we italians use for germanic speakers , but is slavic in origin . 
  it stems from the fact that during the a-h occupation , the lower ranks of the k.u.k. 
  army was filled by slovenes and croats . 
  when italy fought against a-h and captured pows , these guys called insistently for kruh ( i.e. 
  bread in slovene ) . 
  so we associated kruh with austrians and conflated it to refer to the other german speakers, 
   from roast beef , which we consider a lesser food ) ca va sans dire lol, 
  apart from italian one , which i am clearly biased for , i like the austrian set a lot . 
  like our set , they have come up with a lot of ideas and designs . 
  so much better than the boring monarchical ones  rather than changing the design of the coins , i rather hope the ecb will print banknotes with key european figures and cities in place of the anonymous , bland ones we have now . 
  a beethoven/schiller one with the music sheet of the ode to joy would be cool . 
  the founding figures of the eu , like schuman , adenauer , de gasperi , etc should also be a must . 
  naah , majorca is the 17th , after the 16th bundesl\u00e4nder on mainland germany . 
  amen !, 
  well , since lake garda is the 18th bundesland , we do n't wan na lose too much territory to the bavarian hordes :p, 
  ahah , funnily enough , my parents went to palermo last week and my grandma sold her east sicilian country house to a norwegian man . 
  no , you wo n't notice mafia . 
  but you will find that in palermo there are ruins of houses bombed in wwii and not rebuilt ever since . 
  the reason is that the mafia bosses could not decide who had the right to call dibs on that slice of the city , so they left the rubble untouched ( or so i was told ) . 
  apart from that , i think you might get shocked by the poverty of some neighbourhoods ( compared to the stinky rich norwegians , they are run down like a french banlieu , more or less ) and the lack of public services . 
  however , as an art history fanatic and foodie , i have to admit that palermo is well worth the visit nonetheless . 
  pm if you need extra tips , 
  actually we have also italo trains , but i 've been living outside italy for a while , so i never took them . 
  i am a frugal traveller , so i do n't care if you 've got hostesses wearing a design uniform , etc. 
  the point is that for some foreigners italy is like sub par west , ridden with corruption or something like that , so the idea that our infrastructures are above standards is beyond their expectations . 
  the brits are among them , since you sometimes have a superiority complex ( other times you are like us , taking a sadistic pleasure in bashing your own country ) . 
  probably the dugento ( i.e. 
  1200s ) , as it was the era when modern italian was being elevated to language status and codified , the italian communes were competing against each other and we had great personalities like st francis , marco polo or dante, 
  italian in the uk : i normally have to explain to the brits that `` under the tuscan sun '' and `` la dolce vita '' are movies , not real life . 
  we actually put longer hours that the eu average and have one of the lowest wages in we , so we ca n't really afford to spend the day drinking wine in a piazza , or whatever they think . 
  and we do n't all look dark and olive skinned , nor is italy an uninterrupted series of sunny coastal villages . 
  our territory actually stretches across the whole alpine arch and europe 's southernmost glacier is just some 50 km east of rome . 
  mafia exists but you only notice it in the south , and only in three regions out of 7 . 
  and contrary to stereotypes , some of our infrastructure is actually good . 
  i 'd say that our motorways and fast speed trains are much better than in the uk . 
   the monarch ca n't be a catholic etc is there something similar for the pm ? 
  i vaguely remember that blair came out as catholic shortly after stepping down as pm , so i wondered if it was more of a convention or if there was some rule prohibiting pms from being catholic or non protestant, 
   time to burn some monasteries again you will have to do it over my dead body , if that means no more kloster andechs beer !, 
  would that be the lutheran church in estonia ? 
  yeah , i might be wrong , but i count eritrea and ethiopia in the mena region . 
  no , the only ethnic restaurants you will find in italy are the chinese , some middle eastern and japanese ( run by chinese anyway ) .

   romania comes from latin and if a hand me down from the romans .

   i think that some words here has been misunderstood/misplaced . 
   i think your definition of mountaineering is mistaken . 
  that 's why i tried to explain with my own words the differencies ; gon na tell you in italian , montanaro = / = alpinista . 
  edit : found out that you can call montanaro `` mountaineer '' ... 
  yes and no ... 
  since is sicily , iirc , they had a huge period under islam/moors ( too lazy to check atm ... ) and if i look at the women 's hats , i see a lot of `` arabesque '' ( 2nd and last pic , the base of the headgear ) and same goes for the n. 9 , the helmets of the guards . 
  edit : with arabesque i mean a lot of decorations , not the pattern . 
  i think that some words here has been misunderstood/misplaced . 
  on one hand we are talking about `` alpinism '' like expeditions , highest peaks reached , exploration , in this case english , as you said , did a lot . 
  on the other hand , i guess is what u/standy85 meant , is about `` mountaineering '' as living the mountains and on the mountains , know how to live on them , how to work on them , and so on . 
  is like saying `` italy best sailors in the world cuz colombo & vespucci !, 
  '' , that is not true , great explorers does n't equals to great sailors .

  [ this is italy equivalent , sung by a french band ] ( https://youtu.be/o-8wlzcmd0a ), 
  well , i dunno where and from whom you learned latin , i had 5 yrs of latin in high school ( talking about 20 yrs ago , in a liceo scientifico , if i 'd chose ginnasio and after liceo classico , i had also ancient greek for 5 yrs + ancient latin ) . 
  in italy they only tell you that is a difference in pronunciation between `` classical '' and `` ecclesiastical '' ( like `` veni vidi vinci , in classical should be pronounced `` weeni , weedi weeci '' , if you are non romance speaker or , using classical , and `` veeni veedi veeci '' if you use ecclesiastical ... as an italian that studied latin , switching from classical to ecclesiastical pronunciation for me there is no difference , i can go both , one sounds `` fancy '' another one sounds like mass at sunday , easy peasy basically . ), 
  since we do n't have recording of live voices from classical latin , we ca n't say if even those pronunciations are right , only ecclesiastical survived for obviously reasons ( example , vatican city and the pope ) but is based on oral traditions , what you refer as `` regional variant '' are basically `` writing styles '' of historians of the time ; this means that back when i was in hs , if in a test you had a `` version '' from cesare talking about gallia , it was easier to translate cuz `` you already know his style of writing '' , that means cesare gon na refer with that word in that context to that meaning or nuance of the word/term ... and the dictionary book already list the different meaning/use of that term related to the author and to the time he wrote .

  this chart/site is kinda tricky , they seems to list grapes , but also they list wines ( prosecco ) and not the grapes ... for lugana and and garda 's area , maybe they omitted them due to the fact that those wines are just one step above `` vino da tavola '' , so not so `` prestigious '' ... 
  ... you right , but nothing can compare the sea in greece ... 
   first , not sure why they chose the colloseum ... maybe because 60 yrs ago in rome they signed a treaty that evolved in today 's eu ?

  those are basically grapes varieties , not wines . 
  barolo is made from nebbiolo grapes , barolo si the name of the town ...

  on the palate it typically shows classic apple and pear flavors , depending on where it is grown , with spicy or mineral notes .

  the destructive effect is amplified when shrapnel is produced ( either deliberately or as a side effect ) : the energy of the explosion is then delivered by a compact and massive object , which can transfer a much high percentage of the total explosive energy to a much smaller portion of the target , ensuring penetration . 
  this is also the principle behind firearms .

  in an explosion , unless there is a fireball or the passport is in the right spot ( say , where the pressure wave is likely to just tear through it ) , the passport is likely to be just blown away , harmlessly turning the energy of the pressure wave into kinetic energy and dispersing it wherever it falls . 
   the moment they failed ( the goths ) their entire world fell historical nitpick : that 's a very outdated , and today discredited , view of the fall of the roman empire . 
  rome suffered a long period of decline caused by multiple factors : the inherent instability of the imperial system ( whereby only an emperor who commanded the personal loyalty of a strong portion of the military could rule in peace ) , several waves of plague , the self-reinforcing mechanism whereby control of the peripheral regions would be maintained by further decentralization , which slowly turned them into effectively independent empires and made them weaker and more vulnerable . 
  the long process of migration into europe was more the coup de grace on an already terminally ill roman empire than the prime cause of its fall . 
  for example : the wealthier , more populated and more centralized eastern roman empire endured for centuries still , even in the face of more powerful military threats than any barbarian invasion . 
  no , there is n't a current live thread ( not in / r/europe at least ) . 
  we closed last night 's after french media stopped giving updates . 
  if media activity starts to pick up again to the point of having fast updates we 'll put up another ; otherwise , regular submissions + this thread for discussion are going to be enough . 
  please add `` nsfl - death '' before the link . 
  i know it is to be expected , but people can be distracted or not know very much and might not want to see what unfortunately is in that video . 
  the video description says : uploaded by monawaat on 2/18/2015 the hollande speech featured is date to january . 
  it 's safe to say that this video is not connected to these attacks .

   it 's amazing how british women do n't seem to notice the cold during a night out . 
  amazing in the sense that there 's no season of the year when you wo n't find short skirts about london , yes . 
  that is indeed amazing . 
   christianity was born in asia , which was well defined as a separate continent and cultural civilziation since the early ancient times . 
  historical nitpick : not really though , certainly not with the same boundaries as we today understand . 
  for the simplest counter-example , the greek cities of the ( modern-day ) turkish coast were definitely greek and not part of a separate cultural civilization . 
  but in a more profound sense , the east mediterranean by the time of the emergence of christianity had had centuries of very very strong cultural admixture with greek culture , with hellenistic kingdoms having ruled the vast majority of it for centuries and koine greek having become both lingua franca and the language of the educated classes ; not by chance , the gospels were originally composed in koine greek . 
  and again , not by chance , the great centers of early christianity were not bounded in terms of geography as we understand it today , but of cultural and commercial ties as they were relevant at the time : antioch ( by that time a hellenized city ) , alexandria ( a hellenistic center par excellence ) , corinth ( a greek city ) , ephesus ( same ) , thessalonica ( same ) . 
  by the time of the islamic conquest , christianity had very strong centers in the east ( which was and had been , after all , the wealthies and most populous part of the roman empire ) , but most of post-roman europe had been christianized ( at least in terms of institutional religion ) , and many important centers of christianity had emerged there . 
  it 's not really fair to call it a ` backwater ' , because history is n't really chiefly concerned with whichever region is more prosperous at a time ; europe went onto its own historical trajectory , which saw it become poorer and much more fragmented than the east for a time , but the theological developments elaborated in europe were not lost to history , and in fact became centerpieces of worldwide christianity with the later resurgence of western europe . 
   and then every african nation pays their citizens 250 $ each if they request asylum in the eu . 
  trip and expenses are paid by the government . 
  and then we fingerprint everyone we deport , and if they are found again we deport them again with no payment to the country in question . 
  writing anti-abuse clauses is n't impossible , nor is it getting them accepted if your carrot or stick are big enough . 
   with some luck , the tories will be out next election . 
  that would take an impressive amount of luck , things being what they are . 
  while it 's true that the tories are somewhat losing steam , as any government in power for long is wont to do , it 's also very true that their opposition is scattered and confused , incapable as of now of mustering the kind of unity it would require to win a majority in fptp . 
  labour , which should be the chief contender , has elected a radical new leader which gave some hope of buffing off the patina of passivity the party seemed to have been covered in for the past 8 years . 
  but corbyn 's first few months have n't seen him aggressively campaign to expand the reach and support of the party , which is what he desperately needs to do if he plans on seriously contesting swing constituencies . 
  this might be because he 's first taking the time to reorganize internally , but i fear he might be engaging in confused and self-referential grandstanding rather than the necessary concerted political action , especially at the local level . 
  as for the others , none seem to have the potential to make the necessary gains under fptp ( which requires the ability to win a plurality in specific seats rather than get a good nationwide results ) . 
  the snp is likely capable of holding onto scotland , but ca n't alone tip the scales . 
  ukip seems to maintain its very thinly spread support , resulting in it getting a lot of votes and very few seats . 
  the lib dems are yet to recover from their electoral disaster , and despite the rage they might feel at having been abandoned by their voters over what seemed like a trivial issue ( compared to the rest of their activity in the former government ) , they must absolutely find a strategy to regain the trust which they 've lost , fairly or unfairly . 
   overwhelmingly large telescope [ 3 ] was cancelled , because it 's cost - $ 1.5 billion - was deemed too high let 's not kid ourselves though , it was cancelled because any alien visitor would [ take a look at the thing ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d5/overwhelmingly_large_telescope.jpg ) and conclude it was obviously a planet-based superweapon . 
  if they did , they 'd see fast and large withdrawls , as people take out their money as cash to preserve its value . 
  it would be an extreme choice based on the calculation that they stand to lose more by keeping interest rates above zero than by having a mini-run on the bank . 
  `` the swedish democrats in lund distribute maps and lists of refugee accomodation within the municipality of lund '' is this incorrect ? 
  people are not attacking ireland because of its low corporate tax rate , but because it has legal arrangements that allow companies to do business in other countries but pay taxes in ireland . 
  [ the irish government even openly recognized that its tax regime was unfair ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/14/ireland-abolish-double-irish-tax-scheme-apple ) , and changed it so that starting from 2020 these tax arrangement will ( if nothing changes in the meantime ) not be possible anymore . 
  i agree that people blaming ireland or the netherlands for all fiscal problems in europe often exaggerate though . 
  it 's an issue , but it 's not as if solving it would miraculously filling italy 's coffers with all the money we need . 
  early 20th century italian irredentism was as messed up as any other , and ended up annexing and forcibly italianizing a lot of people that had little desire to undergo that process . 
  i do n't think there are too many people in italy that defend the annexation of south tyrol in particular ; in fact , i think you 'd find more support for letting south tyrol rejoin austria if that 's what it prefers . 
  i 'm not sure that they 'd like to lose out on the money though . 
  ** automated translation : ** according to ted ekeroth it 's about civic information and nothing else . 
  - there is a big one here on business in lund without a decision and clandestine planning permission . 
  there are previous examples of when the neighbors were not informed , for example , in the case of the sankt hans hill . 
  officials give evasive answers and it is kept secret , says ted ekeroth ( sd ) . 
  on facebook , the sweden democrats put out a list of ten buildings with temporary planning permission for various forms of temporary accommodation , but not everyone is a refugee accommodations . 
  neighbors are encouraged to appeal . 
  - this is our way to get the information out so that people know what happens , because there is no public debate on this . 
  we try to reach out to lund 's population . 
  if citizens do not like what is going on so they must make their voice heard . 
  the municipality has bypassed the rules on advertising in newspapers and notify neighbors . 
  it does none of this , but just drive on . 
  read also : building sheds were identified as residents of the sd 's list building committee chairman bj\u00f6rn abelson ( s ) says that all rules are followed . 
  - the municipality has not committed any rules in the planning and building act . 
  we had another more restrictive interpretation than the provincial government about the neighbors who would be interested in the matter of accommodation for eu migrants in the sankt hans hill . 
  we followed the county administrative board 's proposals , so it is sd totally got wrong . 
  a couple of building permits on the list published in sydsvenskan . 
  the maps and charts have attracted many comments on facebook and prompts to remove the material are numerous . 
  several comments about it inappropriate to lay out the information , given that it has already occurred fires in refugee accommodations . 
  the connection seems obvious to most who left angry comments . 
  according to bj\u00f6rn abelson ( s ) plays sd extremists in his hands . 
  - they go of nazis and fr\u00e4mlingsfientligas matters when it comes to trying to make it extremely public where it is proposed refugee accommodations . 
  it is extremely poor judgment and it just shows that their openings against extreme movements are clear , he says . 
  ted ekeroth ( sd ) dismisses criticism of laying out maps and addresses for possible accommodation . 
  - it is typically left fuzzy . 
  it is about public information . 
  the left wants to make it impossible for us to inform citizens about what they should already have been informed . 
  are you not worried that it may trigger crime ? 
  - we oppose any form of violent action . 
  would anyone like to do violence to people or buildings so they can find out where they are on their own . 
  it does not need us for that . 
  our purpose is to inform citizens so that those who wish can complain and react , said ted ekeroth . 
  the chief of police in lund , patrik isacsson , no comment other than to the police to avoid a heated situation . 
  - this kind of accommodations will be available in all municipalities so it becomes a natural element . 
  it is unnecessary if it becomes upptrissat but it 's no secret with the accommodation at the people 's park , for example . 
  we do not want it to burn more places and we will have some form of oversight of all places , says patrik isacsson . 
  start with a poor region with a long history of clientelism . 
  introduce fiscal transfers but let local politicians manage them . 
  the result is that those who have no qualms using those transfers to buy votes ( `` i 'll build you this useless giant factory ! '', 
  or even literally `` i 'll get you a job if you and your family vote for my candidate '' ) get the most votes , and keep mismanaging money to keep themselves and their friends in power . 
  add the ability of organized crime to manage this system ( by acting as the transmission mechanism between the bigtime politician and the actual low income voters , and getting protection and lucrative public contracts in return ) and you end up with southern italy . 
  it 's a bit of a myth that the mafia ` returned ' to southern italy with the allied invasion . 
  for all its pomp about law & order , fascism had never really crushed the mafia , only forced it to be less visible ( as with many problems with italy , the fascist approach was to make a big show of intervening manfully and then not really following through ) .

  anywhere in abruzzo and especially the little towns along the ss80 . 
  pietracamela , crognaleto , fano adriano , etc. , etc. 
  judging by the sheer number of sketchy chinese establishments that have popped up recently in which one can apparently get a `` massage with happiness '' , i 'd say very . 
  in case you were referring to ordinary spas , not much . 
  it 's wealthy people 's stuff . 
  definitely not uncommon - no one will bat an eyelid if you do n't drink . 
  and the mere act of getting pissed in public is still quite frowned upon , too , but then again we do n't even drink that much ( unless you are in the north-east ... ) . 
  anything . 
  apparently italy is too italian for most of them so they end up bitching about everyone and everything , as if they represented some ridiculous outpost of civilisation !, 
  i 'll agree about the horrid bureaucracy and that steamy pile of shite and that is our postal system ... even taxi drivers , though i was one not too long ago ... but still , most expats are a bunch of arseholes imho . 
  they come here expecting to live * la dolce vita * ( whatever that means ) surrounded by colourful caricatures of gesticulating , olive-skinned , wine-drinking italians eagerly awaiting to meet them and to act as a backdrop for their wanky journey of self-discovery then they get shocked to find out that the people here are pretty normal , do n't especially care for strangers ( let alone their kids ! ), 
  and have to work impossibly long hours for shit pay in a work environment that 's more reminiscent of colonial ethiopia . 
  seriously ? 
  i think ours is the wolf ? 
  anyhow , it 's a good reminder of just how happy we are to jump at each other 's throat . 
  wait a second ... how did they know american soldiers were circumcised ? 
  yes , an ordinary house the likes of which you can see in hollywood films . 
  not going to find one unless you move to the ( fairly depopulated ) countryside and even then , they tend to be old or the climate 's too shit for a swimming pool . 
  one exception are coastal towns where * villette * are all the rage but even there you 'd be more likely to find condos . 
  & nbsp ;  [ ... ] from the context i 'm guessing apartment is the standard living situation in your country & nbsp ; yeah , you 're right . 
  but what did you expect ? 
  we 've literally invented ~ ~ insulae ~ ~ condos ... 
  what colonies ? 
  / s we have a rocky relationship with libya : blaming italy and italians for any occurrence used to be a favourite pastime of theirs during the last regime plus my paternal family had all their properties , bank assets and social security contributions requisitioned before being expelled following gheddafi 's coup in 1970 . 
  therefore , they are n't too keen on `` that shithole '' and its people not least because we 've been waiting for compensation for almost 47 years now . 
  i mean - we were almost going to get some in 2009 but then 2011 happened ... thanks france ... eritrea ( they sure do love us down there !, 
  ) , ethiopia and somalia do n't exist and our government not only does a terrible job of teaching our colonial past but as a rule of thumb , likes to pretend we 've never had any colonies at all . 
  well , no . 
  not least because it 's unusual to have a detached house ( let alone a backyard ! ), 
  in the first place . 
  italy is not a `` pretty religious '' country , though , and has n't been since the 1970s . 
  true - it 's more on the culturally conservative side of things ( mostly ) but religion does n't actually have much to do with it and views/values can vary wildly between different generations . 
  are we ... ? 
  no , like , seriously ? 
  * something something mandatory school subject *, 
  sorry , mate , but i 'm definitely not the one with a chip on my shoulder here . 
  my god . 
  you northerners are masters at it , there 's no way a lowly provincial from rome could possibly beat you guys at your own game ... 
  i 'll also have you know that i 'd rather pass for a peasant than be forced to speak with the kind of effeminate , nasal accent you 're so fond of up there ; at least i do n't sound like a granola-munching fashionista who 's yet to hit puberty and unlike the lot of you , i do n't do my damnedest best to butcher italian grammar with gratuitous anglicisms or hideous constructs ( `` settimana prossima '' ? 
  who 's illiterate , again ? ) . 
  now please do the rest of the country a favour and go back to whatever glitzy turd of a city you crawled out from . 
  u/quirite over and out . 
  yes , your answer is not only very exhaustive but also quite the generalisation indeed . 
  thank you for having provided proof of your low character - whatever we might have done to you must 've been bad enough to leave such a mark on your delicate psyche and warrant such a bitter response , which is by no doubt indicative of some deep-seeded trauma . 
  so ... sorry for having stolen your girlfriend or whatever , mate !, 
  have a nice evening . 
  btw remember what they say about wankers ? 
  try not to touch yourself too much on your way out will you . 
  thank you very much for the gratuitous epithet . 
  it 's much appreciated . 
  may i enquire as to what actually caused you to have such a low opinion of 2.8 million of us ... ? 
  til i 'm attractive, 
  i live in a council flat located in a condo from the 1920s . 
  which means external plumbing , high ceilings , steep and slippery stairs with no lift ( those 90-year-old marble steps make for a very polished death trap ) . 
  it 's not far from my workplace ... 
  i 'm unemployed !, 
  [ here 's a view ] ( https://www.google.it/maps/@41.9459061,12.5340704,3a,75y,109.78h,98.18t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1snb024yq7pfsipfcfjkbgqg!2e0!7i13312!8i6656 ) of my district and yes , those are all social housing blocks . 
  my old boss had all the file folders in my office renumbered so that they went from 16 to 16/bis . 
  rather often ; cars still cost a few millions , at least according to my family . 
  in rome , however , we also have quite a few eritrean and ethiopian restaurants . 
  ( mesob is particularly good !, 
  i would have loved to have been born and grown up in a swiss city like zuerich , basel or bern . 
  you know - the kind of place that 's reasonably clean , wealthy , efficient , quiet and where most importantly the people actually mind their own damn business . 
  cannelloni , pasta al forno and anything involving green beans . 
  i have traumatic memories of when my grandma forced me to eat those !, 
  they 're squishy and oily and taste like shit ... they 're only slightly worse than broccoli ... 
  most seafood is also pretty disgusting ( deep-fried calamari being the only exception ) . 
  back to back champs of peggiore ferrovia d'italia !, 
  i thought libero was just an e-mail provider ? 
  til . 
  `` our '' beach would be ostia , which is located some 30 km from rome proper . 
  *** il giornale *** ~ ~ would be ~ ~ no , actually very much is italy 's equivalent to the daily heil . 
  no further description needed . 
  *** il fatto quotidiano *** is a publication reserved to all those who believe that the movimento 5 stelle can do no wrong , and the kind of place where five star supporters can congregate to worship beppe grillo , our new prometheus , or denounce the evils of the illuminati/bilderberg/reptilians / democratic party/big pharma/silvio berlusconi by means of a collective struggle session . 
  *** il messaggero *** is a safe space for all those readers who enjoy spending their time lamenting the fate of rome . 
  as such , they would like `` that bitch of a mayor '' to do something about it for example by repairing potholes , increasing rubbish collection , flogging fare-dodgers , beheading pick-pockets or re-opening extermination camps for gypsies , immigrants and other `` undesirables '' . 
  *** l'unit\u00e0 *** is a newspaper that has been put out of its own misery multiple times , basically the kind of rag that nobody ever reads but which is kept on life support by public subsidies alone . 
  as such , it is to matteo renzi what the * pravda * used to be to the soviet politburo and its readers - assuming there are any - are very careful to toe the party line . 
  whatever that is . 
  *** repubblica *** is fake news with plenty of typos and we all know it . 
  & nbsp ; r/italy is a loose federation of stem-lords plus a bunch of assorted shills who get paid by the democratic party in order to fellate matteo renzi and organise cyber-attacks on web platforms owned by the m5s . 
  their main hobbies are downvoting things and getting triggered by food pics . 
  saying something nice about [ current government ] , now this is guaranteed land you in a whole world of trouble !, 
  jokes apart , in italy people tend to be quite ... * politically incorrect * so if the gubmint were to arrest anyone for some post on fb there 'd be a public uproar . 
  it 's only illegal-ish to deny the holocaust but as far as the rest is concerned you could go around rambling like a friggin ' klansman and not be bothered by the authorities ( you might get a broken nose , a black eye or something like that though ) . 
  defamation , on the other hand , is a whole other issue . 
  yeah , we also do that . 
  too bad we despised each other and have n't kept in touch . 
  to be fair , that 's not how it works in italy . 
  1 ) you make most of your real friendos during high school ; 2 ) universities have limited resources and are generally poorly connected with the private sector , so no internships unless you 're into a decent field like medicine or some other shit or you go to one of the fancy ( private ) universities and business schools ; 3 ) professors are the kind of arseholes who have to teach to huge numbers of students , they ca n't be bothered to remember your name or even care about whatever it is that you do . 
  italian unis are very much `` swim or sink '' - meaning that you 're all by yourself ; 4 ) no you do n't . 
  at least not here . 
  public universities have no special reputation therefore such kind of name-dropping would sound ridiculous , try doing that with your gymnasium ... `` oh , but i went to mcsomething high school !, 
  toughest school in the country i 'm telling you ! '' . 
  besides , it would be a bit complicated to hire fellow alumni , first because we do n't care about whichever uni you graduated from and secondly , but the sapienza is so huge ( 120.000 students/year ) that half of southern italy goes there . 
  hell no !, 
  in italy we pay high enough taxes and tuition , why would they want even more money to blow ? 
  they can frig off . 
  plus all those who happen to be wealthy enough to make a donation mostly flock * en masse * to the more prestigious , private universities anyway . 
  nope , no , not at all .

  the definition of a bully . 
  italy had 56 bilion of trade surplus last year . 
  we were . 
  i know that here in / europe the 60 milion italian are considerare less than the 1 milion of people from estonia but we exist . 
  because it ' a the economist . 
  a biased and full of prejudice and stereotype english newspaper . 
  last 2 covers about italy was renzi eating a gelato and the tower of pisa , and the one before a pizza . 
  and what kind of cars comes to your mind when thinking about italy ? 
  ferrari , lamborghini , maserati are all expensive cars with a low number of vehicles produced per year . 
  the realt problem is that only fiat is here and it 's not a surprise . 
  i do n't know for how long italy will remain the second manufacturing ( overall ) in europe . 
  we more , we more !, 
  you require the knowledge of german language . 
  not so easy for an italian . 
  like what ? 
  the opposition leaded by berlusconi ? 
  i talked about the italian government so the italian parliament . 
  not the united nation . 
  http://www.lastampa.it/2015/02/27/esteri/palestina-gentiloni-governo-favorevole-al-riconoscimento-zztozpi3udyfmdafnoz7io/pagina.html in february . 
  with israel really happy . 
  so pro-palestine that just last year she was part of the italian government , a government that refused to recognize palestine . 
  what will she be tomorrow ? 
  the arci-friend of north korea ? 
  ah right she was supposed to be the super-arci-ultra friend of russia . 
  ok it 's just my imagination . 
  our trade with russia collapsed at -60 % and all our parties talk about remove sanctions but it seems there are no sanctions at all !, 
  italians must live in a parallel world !, 
  and slovenia too . 
  this virtual world technology must be really good if entire countries believe in invisible sanctions . 
  just google it ? 
  anyway a lot of food for example . 
  you have no idea what the general opinion is here , the one of the government is way more in line of the german one compared to what the oppositions and the general population think . 
  you make it sound like it 's nothing . 
  they rapresent more than 40 % of the eurozone . 
  also i would n't consider spain and portugal on schauble 's side . 
  true and i think also the distribution network favors those brands . 
  you know right that every year some italian companies are bought by american one ? 
  it ca n't be only one way . 
  i really do n't think he is better . 
  i would prefer being governed by a corrupted thief than by a crazy one . 
  nah not everywhere , just latin countries ( and greece ) . 
  and that hate was deserved . 
  if you want to become the prime minister of a country you ca n't say that the majority of a big friendly country elected for 2 clows ( even if it is true ) . 
  it 's called diplomacy . 
  i do n't see merkel or renzi say something so stupid . 
  i read that considering the votes from italian living outside italy the m5s would be the 2nd party . 
  do n't considering them they would be the first . 
  but why do n't consider them if they are worth as much as you for italian law ? 
  so you think is a good thing ( economically speaking ) that north italy send every year more than 100 bilion $ to south italy ? 
  do you think the good and services south italy buy can compensate such numbers ? 
  no they do n't . 
  in the same way if germany decide to give 100 $ to italy , less than 20 $ would go on german products . 
  and so on . 
  that 's ridicolous and a so simplist way to see the thing . 
   whenever i post on reddit i get shit for the actions of `` germany '' even though i do all that is within my capabilities to change this . 
  what can i do besides , voting for parties that might change things , protest against government actions and try to educate my surroundings and friends about the shit my government does ? 
  you are right but it 's the same in other countries . 
  you have no idea how many times people on the internet answered me with things such `` you elected berlusconi 4 times !!! '', 
  even if i never voted for him in my whole life . 
  elected to what ? 
  everything you say is true but you are only listing the negative effects of this scenario . 
  even before the $ italy was having worse conditions on loans , still the situation was way better than the actual one . 
  and anyway only 30 % of our debt is owned by foreigners . 
  yeah 'cause i was talking about that little greece and not about italy/spain . 
  but it seems italy and spain are geographically located in the south so they must be greece 2.0 . 
  i would like to remind you that with a fiscal union the transfer would probably be more from west to east than from north to south , like it is now . 
  and usually german people do n't take them so well . 
   let 's imagine the south declares an end to austerity , so who gives them the money to spend more again ? 
  the same people that did it in the decades before the euro ? 
  the same people that did it in the decades before the euro ? 
  well someone that from nothing has become one of the richest man in the world ( at least 10 years ago ) and the most powerful man of a g7 country for more than a decade sure as hell is not a stupid man . 
  he was super buddy not only with north african dictator ( and god bless that kind of friendship , i would pay for have a dictator there instead of the total mess we have now ) . 
  the reality is that b. is a corrupted criminal , but not stupid at all . 
  renzi tried every single week in the last 6 months . 
  you must have missed it . 
  no more drug plz, 
  yes 'cause this is the first time !, 
  do you really believe that south europe do n't follow rules and the other countries do ? 
  or is just some sort of prejudice ? 
  do you believe that italy exports paintings , pizza and opera ? 
  from a country that receive money every single year from the eu and that ask for support against russia every single year this is embarassing . 
  agains the us , japan , china , south america . 
  in fact france is not doing so bad . 
  because the role of our ecb is not to combat the unemployment . 
  because our dear germans wanted a central bank ( the only in the world ) that care only about inflation . 
  we contributed for around 850 $ per person too . 
  and all we get is hate . 
  not only we paid but we are considered lazy southern that spend north taxpayers precious money . 
  do you think is better ? 
  so tell me what spain proposed to the european commision/parliament/council to solve this problem . 
  i never heard anything proposed by your government . 
  i would be happy to be wrong . 
  we do ? 
  when the hell did i say that other nations 's media are perfect ? 
  they are biased too 'cause they all try to sell to a specific audience . 
  i see you also have no idea how media works in italy , not a surprise . 
  berlusconi just owns tv channels . 
  he does n't own any of the top 10 newspapers ranked by total readership . 
  you can still continue to believe we are crazy acolytes of mister b ( here on reddit lol ) . 
  spain 's stance is to oppose quota and propose nothing to solve it .

  italy wants to see the creation of an eu prosecutor general and perhaps even a european version of the fbi nice idea . 
   de maiziere said that germany 's constitution would not allow the formation of a european fbi and said that better monitoring and surveillance and data sharing represented the only practical way forward . 
  end of the dream . 
  last time i saw the king of spain in video ( 2015 , maybe ) he looked much younger . 
  that 's the whole point, 
  but steinmeier is the head of state , so the map is right . 
  it 's steinmeier, 
  no , merkel is your head of government . 
  and your president is more than cerimonial , he has reserved powers ( dissolving the parliament , veto laws , naming the chancellor , ) . 
  the chancellor , on the other hand , is the `` de facto '' leader of the country because he/she has a majority in the parliament . 
  [ example ] ( https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/pomo_della_discordia ), 
  in italian you can also say `` pomo '' . 
  it 's more poetic but it 's correct . 
  jupiter optimus maximum smoking a joint . 
  the french constitutional system is very effective in that regard . 
  voting for the parliament a bit after electing the president and after the president has named his government leads the voters to give the majority to the president 's party . 
  spending does n't mean more effective either . 
  what matters today is power projection and deterrence . 
  ok but corbyn may need to form a government with the lib dems and with the snp . 
  in that case he will have to deliver a soft brexit and give scotland a referendum in 2020 or before the 2 years of negotiations end . 
  romans had their first month named to mars , the god of war . 
  then they added january and february . 
  this is also why you have october , november , december as the 10th , 11th and 12th month . 
  originally they were the 8th , 9th and 10th month , just like the names suggest . 
  why ? 
  that hdi meas that they are basically at the same level , in fact both are in the same group when it comes to standard of living ( very-high ) . 
  unemployement is lower in slovenia , which obviously means it 's easier to find a job but it 's also more likely that if you find a job in spain you 'll have a better life , cause per capita figures are still better for spain when it comes to gdp per capita , or even better when it comes to wealth per adult . 
  my point is that we ca n't look at a single number to give a picture of an economy . 
  but anyway i agree that slovenia has a pretty advanced economy now . 
  and i knew slovenia had good statistics . 
  i 'd argue that you do n't even measure an economy 's sophistication by only looking at the gdp per capita . 
  there is the human development index , there is the wealth per adult , there is the unemployement rate . 
  we ca n't just look at one statistic .

  and here is [ another angle ] ( http://www.secoloditalia.it/files/2013/11/studio-letta.jpg ), 
  russia has the permission of syria ... as much as i dislike putin their presence is absolutely legitimate . 
  you ca n't use force in another country unless : a ) the un or the sovereign government of that country approves it b ) you or your allies have been attacked without these conditions you commit a violation of international law . 
  looks german, 
  sounds like the enigma of amigara fault, 
  my sister had to sleep with sergej lavrov :(, 
  11.78 popes if you consider that there 's also benedict xvi, 
  yes . 
  gentiloni ( and shinzo abe ) wanted to have russia back in the group but this plan was probably stopped by may . 
  italy has always had good relations with russia even during the cold war . 
  i 'd say it 's for diplomatic reasons ( realpolitik ) , so italy acts as a bridge between the us and russia when it comes to european affaires . 
  you can see this in italy 's positions regarding the sanctions or syria . 
  i agree with you on that , they probably took into account the fact that he bombed that base in syria and therefore thought he is n't that `` warm '' to russia . 
  maybe , i mean she is so strong and so stable ... she can do it . 
  she is the only leader pushing for more sanctions at the moment . 
  you are right , but shinzo abe is trying to improve the relationship with russia : he is probably the first japanese leader to put a lot of effort in it . 
  so this is why he is considered warm to russia just like trump is in the middle even though there are us sanctions in place against putin . 
  this is more about the leaders , i guess . 
   is it real ? 
  < ---------------------  save the planet i laughed so hard, 
  that could have a bad impact on the economy . 
  i mean , if you eliminate tax allowances in order to put money in the pockets of people that do not pay taxes at all , you are : 1 ) creating a hole in the budget in the long-term 2 ) basically promoting unemployement . 
  i mean , if you really want to change the situation for people without a job , it 's better to spend money in public investments rather than create a new small subsidy for the umpteenth time ... 
   but the church is just so autonomous ... people down the ladder say `` oh , i do n't agree '' or `` oh , nice pope '' and that 's it . 
  diplomatically , the holy see speaks for the whole church . 
  and the holy see is basically the pope plus the roman curia . 
  only one case in germany , if i 'm not mistaken . 
  hollande is the son of soros , the man in black is his secret twin ( just in case to replace him ) . 
  every leader has a jewish clone somewhere . 
  the man is basically a clone of hollande ( with the beard ), 
  pianoforte ( piano = soft ; forte = loud ) vaffanculo ( five words actually , you can also say `` vai a fare in culo '' ) affresco , chiaroscuro , terracotta and a lot more , i guess . 
  you need a permanent naval blockade in front of libya to do that . 
  i remember this plan was agreed in april 2015 , so i think the correct term is `` failed '' not `` failing '' . 
  really ? 
  do you mean the tornados ? 
  i think the gop is waiting for a big scandal to replace him with pence , a more traditional conservative ( he may be worst than trump btw , sounds like a religious a fundamentalist basically ) . 
  that said , pence would absolutely lose the 2020 elections ( and the gop knows it ) , trump can win . 
  maybe not on that level ( breitbart is more like `` la verit\u00e0 '' , a right-wing ) . 
  `` il fatto '' is serious at times but often makes huge mistakes by looking for scandals even where obviously there are n't . 
  so this is why i say it 's better to wait . 
  this is what `` il fatto quotidiano '' jut said , i 'll wait informations from more serious journals . 
  in fact , berlusconi 's girl is like 50 years younger than him ... 
  fascists gon na fasci, 
   leonardo sacco is a friend of the italian foreign affairs minister i do n't really like alfano , but this particular guy simply has a photo with him during some sort of public meeting . 
  he also has a photo with the pope . 
  anyway let 's wait for more informations . 
  well , if we want further integration we need eurobonds .

  no it 's not just the banking system . 
  it also includes non-financial wealth and homes etc. 
  the point is that they lack these data for some countries ( russia , belarus , ukraine . . ), 
  yeah , so that 's what it is, 
  i know , but it 's the most used indicator to represent the income ( not median of course ) . 
  probably a mix of poor data for these countries , low value of properties in eastern europe and private debt taken into account ( while obviously pensions and incomes are not taken into account ) . 
  tbh the median wealth of ukraine ( or russia or belarus etc. ), 
  must be a combination of poor data , low value of properties in eastern europe and large private debt . 
  it would make no sense that the average ukranian owns 133 $ of stuff . 
  the first you said . 
  gdp per capita is the one closer to represent the income .

  seems like a reasonable thing to protect from fickle politics . 
   the vast majority of voters are uninformed on many topics .

  glancing at the data also shows that the pool is fairly distributed for various socio-economic situations . 
   race to the bottom . 
  that would only work if the uk annexed ireland , who 's already doing that . 
  probably the netherlands , cyprus , liechtenstein , and luxembourg too .

  there 's more to that story : migrant arrivals are roughly on par with 2015 but since the paris attacks the people in `` temporary '' processing locations or just here illegally saw some 50 % increase , before this year a lot of them slipped unchecked . 
  this does n't get in the news simply because both anti and pro migration parties are happy to have less illegals , and admitting to not controlling those people is a political no-no .

  your description reminded me of * the tartar steppe * , great book . 
   the plot of the novel is drogo 's lifelong wait for a great war in which his life and the existence of the fort can prove its usefulness . 
  the human need for giving life meaning and the soldier 's desire for glory are themes in the novel . 
   drogo is posted to the remote outpost overlooking a desolate tartar desert ; he spends his career waiting for the barbarian horde rumored to live beyond the desert . 
   without noticing , drogo finds that in his watch over the fort he has let years and decades pass and that , while his old friends in the city have had children , married , and lived full lives , he has come away with nothing except solidarity with his fellow soldiers in their long , patient vigil . 
  ** spoiler spoiler spoiler ** .

  i do n't necessarily agree with the author . 
  of course historians will draw lines between different events , but they can only do it in retrospective . 
  and as they say , hindsight is 20/20 . 
  but you ca n't draw the lines while you 're in the middle of the situation . 
  there 's prognoses for many different outcomes and possible futures , so one of them will always end up right and * no one listened to them at the time * .

  not needed , there 's two counter examples in the 20th century alone .

  what is the world coming to if we do n't respect the democratically elected president of a country anymore ?

  but if we take as a given that he is a crazy person , does it even matter if we have the nuclear deterrent or not ? 
  would a crazy person care about that ?

   germany [ ... ] liberal beacon of reason always has been , always will be . 
   in december i already see the optimism coming through !,

  it 's just a feeling i have . 
  the last election came as quite a surprise to many people , so i would n't bet on anything though . 
  i just have a feeling that the vdb campaign has not much to gain among non-voters , so they wo n't improve their result . 
  i would be surprised if hofer did n't win , to be honest . 
  well this does n't have much to do with trump . 
  they probably wrote that thing one month in advance and just needed to know whom to address it to . 
  but we know two things : china just wants the money . 
  on the other hand , wars are burning the money . 
  therefore , china does not want the wars . 
  ^ ( right ? ), 
  as chairman mao said : without destruction , there can be no construction . 
  i do n't see a war coming , but i do see some political destruction ahead . 
  and overpopulation . 
  my parents tell me they heard a lot about that problem in school . 
   heck , the closer the eu and russia would get , the closer we would be to rivaling the us in soft and maybe eventually even hard power after a while . 
  but the continent would be overpowered by russia ( as the biggest single country in this scenario ) and germany ( as the strongest economy ) . 
  now russia and germany leading europe , that 's not how i envision my eu . 
   i would love for america and russia to be friends again were they ever friends ? 
  i do n't see them being friends working out well for the world . 
  it is astonishing how deeply in denial the whole european media ** and ** european politics were to trump 's chances of winning . 
  it seems like everyone was out of touch with reality . 
  no wonder most western countries start being internally divided if everyone just reads and acknowledges what they want to . 
  it serves the european politicians right that they get a bad start with trump . 
  as for me personally , i hope it will work out well for europe in the sense that we finally get an independent foreign policy and more unity and cohesion . 
  i hope this is the starting point for a multipolar world where europe is not in need of a legal guardian usa anymore . 
  usa , eu , china as the three major powers in this multipolar system should be where it 's at , with russia unsure of whom to follow . 
  alas , this will probably not come true , but one can dream , right ? 
  you know , when your parents start becoming crazy oompa loompas , you need to move the fuck out of your home and start a life on your own .

  they are [ dialects ] ( http://bostoniano.info/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/mappa-dialetti.png ) , though . 
  if anything this map lacks of occitan and sardinian language , that are not dialects . 
  northern italian dialects ( gallo-italics ) are part of the western romance languages , while the southern ones are part of the southern romance languages ... 
  they are in the same romance language group but they are from different families, 
  do flemish language and dutch one come from different language families ? 
  the sad thing is that calabria is even above the southern italian average by a long shot when it comes to tax fraud , workforce with undeclared jobs and so on ... 
  the difference between , say , a venetian and a sicilian is much larger than the one between a dutch and a flemish, 
  if you have an undeclared job ( and not looking for a job then ) you 're an * inactive * to the stats , not an * unemployed * sicily and calabria for example have an 43 % employment rate , but many `` inactive '' people actually work , informally, 
  i 'm not claiming that they 're different people - italian ethnicity includes a lot of people and cultures ( venetians , tuscans , neapolitans , sicilians ... , so does the german one as well ) so it would be fairer ( imho ) to identify them with a single group of people they share culture and a common dialect with,

  smes are holding up the economy in italy as a whole automotive industry has declined a lot in italy . 
  it went well until there was n't globalization and pratically every italian had a fiat . 
  in the last two decade it has lived an huge crisis . 
  marchionne actually did some improvements , increasing quality of the cars , by buying chrysler and founding fca ( he put this new society 's hq in amsterdam though , he ca n't stand italian taxation , eheh ) . 
  but pratically a lot of workers in italy have been fired , and despite [ production ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_motor_vehicle_production ) ( we just overtook you last year lol , anyway i found out that slovakia is the first country by per capita production ) is now rising , it 's still a lot down from , say , the 90s, 
  you 're welcome . 
  the industrialization ( it started in the lat xix century , boomed in the early xx century ) happened in the places which had the infrastructures to do it : i.e. 
  piedmont and liguria , and parts of lombardy . 
  such regions were the core of our economic boom in the 60s , and indeed got in a few years millions over millions of workers from southern italy , some neighborhoods in turin were built just to house them : turin , from the 0,7 m inhabitants in 1951 , peaked almost 1,2 m in 1971 . 
  fiat mirafiori , the oldest still active factory in europe , their main employer , counted nearly 60000 workers in 1970 ( now it 's just 5400 ... everything got outsourced to poland , serbia and turkey ) . 
  since the 80s and mostly in 90s , the deindustrialization phase in the north-west started : the big industries ( producing steel , cars , clothes ... ) , core of the nw industrial production closed or outsourced ( somewhat similar to what happened to the uk or the us ) to romania or china , to name a few ( i once read that in romania there are almost 900k jobs brought by italian industries which outsourced ) , and the main industries pretty disappeared , but meanwhile the centre and above all the north-east was living an industrial boom , not thanks to the big industries or the conglomerates ( except fiat , ferrero and few others , italy has n't any ) but the small , family-led factories , nearly all of them with less than 15 workers , which have been able to increase their exports and mantain an high productivity and competitiveness ; such factories opened in the nw as well to avoid a complete deindustrialization . 
  if today we 're still the country with 2nd largest manufacturing output in europe , that 's not due to some large conglomerates , but to 400k small ( and medium ) manufacturing factories - thing somewhat similar to the german * mittelstands * , with the difference that germany has a lot of conglomerates too ) . 
  edit : spelling, 
  rome was a cultural center during the middle age but it was ' t that rich , for sure the states in northern italy were far richer ( milan , turin , venice , genoa , florence ... ) . 
  the first part of the country getting industrialized were turin , genoa and some communes near milan ( desio , sesto san giovanni ... ) together with naples ; contrary to what one could think , naples was actually fairly industrialized in the xix century ( [ industrialization index ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4c/italy_industry_1871.svg/2000px-italy_industry_1871.svg.png ) in the italian provinces in 1871 , where you can notice the former * industrial triangle * turin-milan-genoa , while nowadays the industries and manufacturing pretty shifted in the north-east : veneto and emilia romagna , while lombardy remains the first industrial region ), 
  before ... 80 years ago ? 
  spot on , there would n't be the fog otherwise ^ / s, 
  unlike rome , naples has actually improved in the recent years, 
  the real ones are much bigger . 
  rome is at 4,5 m , milan at roughly 7m . 
  for example , your list puts naples metro area at 3,1 m , that 's less than naples ' province when you should add part of caserta and salerno 's provinces ... 
  well milan is smaller than rome ( even tho its metropolitan area is bigger ), 
  lol thank you , that 's what i 've seen once and was looking for just a couple of days ago . 
  ca n't speak for the other countries but in italy the trouble is the opposite . 
  exports are going well helped by the weak euro . 
  economy is stagnating because of the domestic market . 
  look at the [ difference ] ( http://www.termometropolitico.it/media/2014/12/fatturato-interno-esterno.png ) between 2008 and 2013 of the facturate of the manufacturing , the first one is the internal market and the second one are the exports exports in some provinces with active industrial districts grew by two digit in 2015 , but the internal market is , often , still in negative .

  it 's not about working harder , they are being exploited , period . 
  two totally different things . 
  italians have to pay taxes and do n't have tens of people available for working all the day just for food . 
  have you idea about how the chinese work ? 
  they barely sleep and work 12-15 hours a day without respecting any sanitary standards and work rules . 
  when not working they live in garages with 5-6 coworkers . 
  for almost every chinese you see in the roads with a bmw there are tens of chinese being exploited by him . 
  not if they do n't pay taxes and exploit their compatriots by making them work 12 hours a day . 
  no , they do n't pay taxes . 
  they work by night when the job inspectors ca n't go into their factories to control them . 
  sanitary standards are not respected . 
  if they get fined , they change region and noone will know anything about them . 
  lately they 've been making part-time contracts for their workers to make them look like they are working legally , then the workers have to work 12 hours a day . 
  prato ( one of the capitals of the textile industry in italy , in xix century it was called * the manchester of tuscany * ) , near florence , has `` just '' 200k people but the biggest chinese community in europe after london and paris .

   because the eu has no efficient border control in the countries where they first enter ( greece and italy ) it is not possible to even count them .

  the one clutching at straws is the person comparing a house to the right to put your trademark on cigarette packages .

  a valid real estate analogy would be with a developer that is no longer allowed to put asbestos in his buildings because of new regulation : too bad , but he has n't and should n't have any right to compensation . 
  your first sentence is saying that the lawsuit was not about stopping plain packaging laws .

   saying companies can sue government `` for protecting their youth '' is extremely misleading what 's misleading is cutting out the rest of that sentence , which was `` protect youth from cigarette marketing images '' . 
  which is literally ** exactly ** what was being done : protect youth from cigarette marketing which would induce them to start smoking . 
   firstly , the basis of that suit is not health regulation per se but expropriation of a trademark . 
  we do n't have to dance to the tune of lawyerspeak . 
  the lawsuit was to stop plain packaging laws . 
  the legal basis for it was that plain packaging laws removed the company 's trademark - ** which is the entire point of the law ** , since the plainness of the package is exactly what you want to achieve . 
   secondly , the suit has little chance of success , it is mostly a tactical move from philip morris . 
  philip morris has spent tens of millions of dollars on a tactical move with little chance of success . 
  why ?

  people know nothing about most things that their own parliaments legislate about , but draft laws are public for everyone to see . 
  that 's because we do n't live in a technocracy , we live in a democracy : democratic review of the actions of our governments is fundamental . 
  transparency , education and a functioning press are all necessary to make this review possible and meaningful ; if people do n't know enough about a topic to meaningfully talk about it , the solution is n't to take it away from them , it 's to educate them . 
   suing governments through a tribunal for such offenses as trying to protect youth from cigarette marketing images fear mongering bullshit my ass , this literally already happened .

  not really , we have a representative democracy because for the vast majority of the history of modern democracy it has been technically impossible to even attempt letting every elector vote on every law , and it remains difficult to this day . 
  but even in a representative democracy , it remains absolutely fundamental that the electorate is informed of the activities of the government and understand them as much as possible . 
  transparency , education and a functioning press are fundamentals of a functioning democracy . 
  how would twitter get overloaded in turkey but not elsewhere ? 
   the vast majority of people do n't even understand ttip the vast majority of people do n't understand most laws that are passed by their own parliaments , but the solution to that is n't to suspend democracy , it 's to make it more transparent , educated people better and promote a vibrant political discourse where journalists and experts can help bridge the knowledge gap .

  thank you for this very valuable contribution . 
  well , first of all , it 's a giant trade deal that will impact a lot of way in which our economies are run . 
  that establishes it 's importance . 
  proponents of the ttip argue that the deal will boost the economies of the us and europe , raising trade , removing bureaucratic red tape and enabling the full potential of transatlantic trade to boom . 
  opponents of the ttip argue that a deal of this magnitude should n't be negotiated in secret ( it is being negotiated in secret ) , that its positive effects have been vastly overplayed and may well not exist and that provisions inserted into the deal ( which have been gleaned at through multiple leaks ) threaten national sovereignity and in effect would allow corporate interests to impose their will in the name of protecting investment .

  * there were 3.279 deaths by shipwreck in 2014 , 2400 deaths in 2015 but expected to grow to 4.000 by the end of the year . 
  * the leader of movimento 5 stelle , the main opposition party , is talking about closer surveillance and harder approval rules for refugees , joining the voice of right wing parties on the matter . 
  oh , the irony of this sentence . 
  i 'd want to be french if it was n't for those pesky frenchmen . 
  the catholic church has a preferential treatment above other religions by law : the constitution references to the lateran treay , a set of agreements made during the fascist regime ( 1929 , to be precise ) . 
  if a children is born from at least a baptized parent he/she ' s considered automatically catholic by the church and the state even in official statistics . 
  a lot of young people now are just indifferent albeit still have a religious marriage / have religious funerals . 
  looking at our republican history , after wwii , no government has aver been elected without the vatican 's support . 
  even the communist party , which was much more relevant when the ussr still existed , has always had friendly ties with them . 
  a lot of social issues about lgbt and woman rights are still poorly discussed because of resilience from cei ( italian episcopal conference ) , which is the organism that interfaces the vatican with italian politics , albeit this is slowly changing in recent years , with cei 's voice being relatively less loud in recent years . 
  -- a little bit of tax math follows :  there is an income tax called `` 8x1000 '' , where each year a citizien has to choose to give 0,8 % of its income to a pool for one of 10 religious entities or the state ( you are not obliged to specify to whom , in fact explicit specification is around 43 % ) . 
  to distribute the money of this pool :   * generate total 8x1000 income  * count signings for each entities  * contributors choice have the same weight , indipendently from contriubutor 's income  * if a person did n't specify , it 's percentage is distributed according to the resulting proportions an interesting fact : public schools have non mandatory irc ( acronym for catholic religion teaching ) if a student adeheres to it the irc teacher has a vote for promotion/failure , plus if he/she 's in high school and chose to follow irc some credits for the final hc grade are given , the alternatives give no credits . 
  irc teachers get chosen by the state but if they are deemed not worthy by the catholic church they can be fired . 
  edit : added 8x1000 , and corrected grammar . 
  * if you cry when you 're in love , it sure ai n't no disgrace . 
  no , thank you for delicious sp\u00e4tzle . 
  yes , that 's san marino . 
  if i sound repetitive it 's b/c either you edited your post in less then 3 minutes or i misread what you wrote . 
  san marino is on the bottom of the part of italy that is in continental europe . 
  vatican city 's official language is latin , `` cerevisia/cervisia '' is latin for beer and the arrow points at rome , so it aims at vatican city , but good luck finding someone in that enclave that sells beer , if anything . 
  some 2000 italian dance mv with la linea artstyle , really cool : * [ blablabla ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kz2lwyti0oy ) * [ the riddle ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dcfxvl0mh0 ), 
  honest question : is may already full season ?

i walked el camino de santiago this summer , and seeing all these pictures made me a bit sad ... : ' - ), 
  how actually strong is the independence movement ? 
  what percentage of the catalan people supports it ? 
  is it just spain to keep them from leaving ? 
   it would hurt them as much as it would hurt the rest of eu if not more . 
  our public transport is not particularly , ahem , efficient . 
  we do n't have much choice . 
  indeed . 
  also , they were allowed to come back in 2002 , and since then you can sometimes see the current `` prince '' in various low quality but highly popular reality/talent tv shows . 
  the concept of a monarchy does n't make any sense in 2014 , but i believe it 's an important symbol for a country and its citizens . 
  it helps increasing the feeling of national identity . 
  that being said , we exiled our royal family with a referendum in 1946 and they 're now involved in some sort of prostitution/gambling and other dodgy things in switzerland . 
  so , yeah . 
  well , you ca n't say he does n't listen to the people . 
  really ? 
  i 've always bought alcohol in sainsbury 's with my italian driving licence . 
  then you ca n't provide valid evidence . 
  well , i 'm studying in the uk and god bless sainsbury 's 3kg spaghetti for # 3.80 . 
  or pasta !, 
  loads of it !, 
  i do n't think inexperience is something we can afford right now . 
  one of my favourite ones is [ kitchen stories ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kitchen_stories ) , from norway , although i do n't know if that counts because i have actually lived in norway . 
  i also quite like [ l'auberge espagnole ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/l'auberge_espagnole ) , which is french-spanish . 
  wow , i did n't know this site . 
  it 's actually quite useful !, 
  it 's higher up , like this : 5 \u2022 10 = 50 when you write quickly it can easily slip down a bit . 
  i still prefer it though , because there 's no mistake with the variable x. 
  i 'm not sure why we use commas , to be honest . 
  however , i ca n't help but seeing a relationship with the fact that you do n't use the dot as a symbol of multiplication as we do ( and i think also other continental countries ? 
  ) , as it would probably get confused with the decimal dot . 
  i was n't surprised . 
  i do n't trust those sneaky bastards either . 
  i would really like to comment that this makes it seem so much worse than it actually is but , in fact , it 's just about right . 
  pff , they wish . 
  you could travel from rome to venice by train , then from there you can get a thello train that departs at 8 pm from venice and arrives in paris at 9am . 
  i picked italy . 
  i mean , we just ca n't speak . 
  yeah , as i said , i had a doubt myself . 
  i had this doubt and i checked . 
  apparently effugio in the sense of `` avoid '' demands accusative . 
  only certain schools teach latin . 
  i used to be a lot better , but apparently a year is enough to forget quite a lot of things ... 
  i just answered the call !, 
  my latin is a bit rusty though . 
  i used to hate it when i moved to the uk but then they apparently turned me british little by little because now i ca n't have tea without milk . 
  defenceless ? 
  what exactly is threatening us ? 
  these guys are just ridiculous . 
  the ask for changes , but then they ca n't agree on what kind of changes . 
  half of them support berlusconi , half of them grillo . 
  yes . 
  at least i do . 
  but then why would n't you reduce it by 99.9 % by using a condom instead ? 
  it just makes no sense . 
  in no way circumcision prevents aids . 
  that 's what condoms are for . 
  it 's mutilation , it 's irreversible , they do it without your consent , it causes dryness and it drastically reduces the sensibility of the glans . 
  i can see only downsides . 
  it was about time . 
  ^ this, 
  they will certainly add some subs . 
  for me , i just had to stop watching it . 
  completely disgusting . 
  because right-wing politicians have already said that they wo n't tolerate their leader being unjustly condemned and they intend to resign . 
  he is releasing a declaration at the moment , pure rubbish . 
  he 's saying that magistrates are irresponsible and politicised , that he has been persecuted for the last 20 years , that he is a brilliant politician and the only one who can fight the communist party ( as if we still had one ) . 
  and he talks about himself in third person !, 
  i ca n't even stand watching it . 
  i 'd love the idea of the eu becoming an economic and political union . 
  since my country does n't give me many reasons to be proud of it , i must say that i 've always felt more european than italian . 
  however , i do think the eu expanded a bit too fast before it was completely ready to do so , and that this may be one of the causes of the present crisis . 
  so while i love the fact that we are 28 now , we should have done it a bit more thoughtfully . 
  i sometimes eat it as a snack in the afternoon . 
  risotto , as you would probably expect . 
  oh , i missed this !, 
  yeah , that would be great , but they 're never gon na manage to do that ... 
  italy  how is it taught ? 
  what does it cover ? 
  ( in broad lines ) it is basically just games and some fitness . 
  in my class , for instance , we usually warm up , we do some stretching , we exercise on a particular game and then we have a match of that game ( it can be basket , volleyball , handball ... ) . 
  it highly depends on the teacher , though . 
  for instance my brother 's teacher really likes volleyball , so they always play volleyball . 
   does it count towards the score/average/whatever for college ? 
  no , not really . 
  it does count for the final exams ( 25 % of the total score is given by the average final grade of the last 3 years of school , including pe ) , however italian universities never use the final grade as a criterion , so ...  how much time of it do you have ? 
  2 hours a week , compulsory , usually one right after the other so we have more time to do stuff . 
   about physical education in your country ... nope , i do n't know if it should , but we just do n't have it . 
  no , we just do sports . 
  it 's very easy for a people to blame others for their own fault . 
  i mean , we do have some examples in history , do n't we ? 
  the idea italian parties ( mainly right-wing parties actually ) are trying to spread now is that our economy is bad because the germans imposed austerity , and could grillo disagree , with his `` let 's fuck the system '' attitude ? 
  of course rational italians know perfectly that it was n't the germans and that we definitely needed austerity , however we are not very influent at the moment ... 
  it depends : if i go for the taste , i use a moka . 
  however , if i need someting that will keep me awake for some hours i go for drip-brewed coffee . 
  i was exchange student in norway last year , and i really thought non-italians did n't know what a moka was at all . 
  but then i saw my hostmother use one and i thought `` hey , what a pleasing suprise !, 
  '' , but then she ( ** blasphemy ** ) diluted that marvellous black dense liquid with hot water . 
  that said , norwegians , your coffee is n't bad at all . 
  yeah , berlusconi made that law in a hurry just before he lost to prodi in 2006 elections . 
  it was meant to be an advantage for him , since it gave more seats to the most populated regions ( lombardy , veneto and sicily ) which are traditionally held by the right wing .

  so ... they like the money , but do n't like how they make the money when they have little else to offer . 
  call me crazy but that 's stupid, 
  do n't worry they are in an open air sauna , this rule does n't apply to sauna, 
  the one on the right could be considered chubby the others are kinda normal, 
  the one they borrowed, 
  who said they have one in first place ? 
  you missed the brexit joke, 
  what culture ? 
  so why does he have the uk ? 
  sorry i ca n't compute , they do n't come from a boot shaped country , must be shit, 
  but even so , how can you deal with all these baguette and omelette du fromage ? 
  no they are not , i can understand the big picture of what a spanish person say , but not a french one . 
  for me they speak baguette . 
  it 's easy : it 's considered the cheaper version of spain where people speak brazilian . 
  i have the solution . 
  lower wages so that people do n't have disposable income for drugs . 
  it 's working in the south apparently, 
  drug death is too expensive for southern europe apparently, 
  that 's not the reason . 
  back when woman could start to enroll they did the same training , the problem was that most of them would end up with an injury compared to the male counterpart . 
  oh what a surprise . 
  do you have some link to some these studies ? 
  so that i can point them out to feminazis, 
  nope it 's because in the name of gender equality man and woman undergo a different training regime . 
  this lead to the results that male soldier prefer to fight next to another male as if something happen the female soldier might not be able to carry the body, 
  how many ages have those that gain more than you stayed there . 
  how many achivement those who earn more have gained compared to those that earn less ? 
  i 'm kinda sure i know the answers ... 
  not really . 
  and you can see it in many places . 
  just to make an example the soldiers on the field are usually only male , while the woman fill the backlines, 
  then they should study comunication technology and not philosophy, 
  then they should study comunication technology and not philosophy, 
  so ... we are surprised that the one that study production heavy studies gain more ? 
  why not making these stats by compare 1 million female graduate in engineering vs 1 million male graduate in engineering ? 
  if i study `` social study '' i ca n't compare my wage to someone that studied comunication technologies, 
  so ... we are surprised that the one that study production heavy studies gain more ? 
  why not making these stats by compare 1 million female graduate in engineering vs 1 million male graduate in engineering ? 
  if i study `` social study '' i ca n't compare my wage to someone that studied comunication technologies, 
  yeah , it 's not like if we where the us, 
  is he flexing in the picture ? 
  wait canada in included in world ? 
  italy is kinda stuck in place . 
  but the thing is that france did n't surpass the uk because they raised their gdp but because the uk fell of one spot . 
  that is outdated . 
  france got over the uk in the last year, 
  britons are the only one in europe who ca n't claim political and economical superiority over us atm but good luck for the future :3, 
  of course we will face some lost in economic power , but not that much when compared to the uk, 
  yep economy in italy is shit . 
  and so is the uk . 
  is this a comparison between my contry and yours ? 
  nope , i 'm simply pointing out to the stupidity of those that say `` we did a great move '' plus the `` increasing illegal immigration '' has been a thing since the 90s . 
  since it 's a peninsula close to africa we suffer from immigration from that places . 
  and wars in the middle east does n't help . 
  nice comment on your flair . 
  plus as i said . 
  let 's talk back in 10 years . 
  i was thinking that this was a serious comment . 
  than i 've seen your comment history . 
  briton confirmed . 
  lol yeah keep the brexit . 
  see you in 10 years . 
  oh and remember the 350m to the nhs, 
  so much is to be expected . 
  but this will be nothing compared to the blow the uk economic will suffer . 
  that 's released before half life 3 either way, 
  yep it was a typo . 
  and no he can damage the uk and their affair with foreign forces , but outside of damaging the uk itself he ca n't do that much, 
  well it 's like he can do any damage outside of the uk . 
  and inside the uk , you voted for him , you can keep him, 
  well ... since you do n't have positive stuff on your candidate attack the other, 
  the fact that you said tekken remembered me that in germany the nintendo game `` pokken tournament '' is called `` pok\u00e9mon tekken '' because pokken sound like the word pocken that is german for smallpox, 
  it 's his now . 
  that plate own him his life, 
  yeah super bock sucks . 
  fries are french right ? 
  it 's french fries after all, 
  nope . 
  it 's a joke about being the million and one . 
  just out of the million allowed, 
  the number of decimals is equals to the decimal of the pi, 
  not if you are # 1.000.001, 
  but obama was n't in terminator 3 . are you talking about a possible remake ? 
  1 like 1 respect, 
  let 's convert that catapult, 
  yeah , but did they find the guild master ? 
  roll a d20 to know more, 
  that 's the plan, 
  we can send them all to the uk and wait for the brexit . 
  and at this point we can always play the military card . 
  `` it would be a shame if we let our soldier in your borders . '', 
  `` fiorentino '' mean from florence , florence is the english name for firenze, 
   i can only imagine that eu membership is n't important to catalan separatists ? 
  british flag ... ... ... am i the only one who see irony in this ? 
  that 's actually a cultural think for us . 
  we do n't really talk against alcholic beverage . 
  but when we drink ( usually socially ) we do n't do it to get wasted . 
  sad, 
  we are visited by the pope everytime he leave his house . 
  why are n't we the one winning everything ?

  the us have started all the wars in the peaceful era in world history , not calling them warmonger is being detached from reality , like you are, 
  not going to happen anytime soon . 
  they 've seen the initial impact of the idea of invoking the a50 . 
  when the a50 will strike the uk will lose even more power , and all the negotiation table . 
  but you can keep dreaming , see you in a few years when people will look at uk as a fallen empire, 
  nice try briton . 
  you inpact on the eu economy is quite low actually you are putting yourself against 20 + countries ... 
  if the eu would be go at the olympics as a single nation like the us does then we 'll have most of the medals all the time, 
  well the euro will lose some power due to uncertanty of the market but it 's only a fluctuation . 
  not something that will last long . 
  of course before all the wars where in europe . 
  usa was n't even considered in the global scale of things . 
  but even going post ww2 you can clearly see that while the member of actual eu where mostly at peace , the us thrown out war after war after gaining influence from said ww2, 
  considering that us was n't even a serious thing back in the days ? 
  not in recent years . 
  i got that reference in the first post . 
  i do n't recall how it goes on after the first sentence, 
  contentious , maybe , less than the us for sure . 
  how many wars was started from the us in the last couple of decade ( using the onu to keep them going ) and how many from eu ? 
  so it 's a place like cornwall that was sure to still get money from the eu even if they left ? 
  italy does n't really have a lot of car factory remaining . 
  i 'm still gloating and having fun , thank you for your concern, 
  nissan will probably move most of the production leaving in the uk only the factories needed for the internal production . 
  damn europeans . 
  at least we do n't have the problem that america have , americans . 
  germany still wants to make an example out of uk leave . 
  france have the most extreme position , ireland want to help the uk to prevent more immigration , and other countries will probably work with singolar deals to make things work for the uk . 
  they need to convince 27 countries after all, 
  it 's political karma right here, 
  because while the eu want to punish the uk it 's still a strategic asset . 
  this mean that they do n't want to sink that ship yet, 
  it will be fun , if you 're not in the uk, 
  eu does n't comply with all treaties and standarrds , they had a lot of leverage and bended the rules in their favor while in the eu . 
  but since once invoked a50 they will lose those leverage power, 
  lol , no . 
  major european markets are already exinting from their need of the uk . 
  the uk need the eu , the eu does n't need the uk, 
  it 's not at least , it 's at most 2 years . 
  unless the other memeber will all accept to prolong the term , wich is unlikely, 
  eu memeber wants to make an example out of britain leaving the union . 
  especially france . 
  it 's more than half . 
  and as an european it will be a fun show in the next few years, 
  the result simply prove that people should n't be allowed to vote on international agreement matters, 
  i do n't see the ukranian force having the force to attack russia and not fall easily in retaliation, 
  yeah right keep on beliving it . 
  it will be fun when your bubble burst, 
  considering that uk economy is mostly based on the import/export with the eu it would mean their failure as a nation and the end of an empire . 
  fom will be accepted by the britons . 
  except that while it 's probable that the uk will end in the single market they will have to accept a number of condition that they do n't want to accept . 
  eu is much bigger and powerful than the uk . 
  then the service comapny you know are like less than 10 % of the total . 
  plus many company that trade with the us trade with the rest of eu too, 
  then mark my words and see back in 2 years . 
  services will not leave today , they will leave before brexit happen , they have a lot of time actually, 
  i think it 's time to declare war to poland for crime against umanity, 
  lol , nice joke , briton . 
  i 'll let you keep dreaming, 
  oh you mean the services that are moving back into the eu , because a lot of service companies are making exit strategies to get out of the uk, 
  if you excluse almost all the goods the uk import like foods ... 
  not really . 
  ireland is seeing the banks that where in london move into his border . 
  these banks kept uk alive in the past decade . 
  you will see uk getting poorer in the near future and ireland getting richer, 
  in poland they try to imitate us ? 
  so ... someone from the colonies ? 
   all germans are shinny white that 's racist, 
   mine is huge why have i read it in trump 's voice ? 
   i can take a few hits before unleashing my full attack on you . 
  you sound like brok 's onyx , when he use bide . 
  oh well i 'll use tail whip or sand attack, 
  ah , jokes on you i attack you armor with a battle mage using him/her as a mace . 
  magic ignore ac right ? 
  welll we do n't live in a post apocalictic world, 
  dungeons & dragonite, 
  calm down there . 
  i have +4 as a modifier in dex and a light armor ... you are in full plate !, 
  i rolled a 12, 
  i finished bg2 back in the days . 
  as far as i know , iceland is quite small . 
  i would n't be surprised if most people have meet their candidate to the election at least once in an informal context . 
  i 've gone from memory . 
  you are right it was dex but you know ... it 's been 12 years since my last character i can miss a stat name ... stil ... you got the reference, 
  we have different stats . 
  let 's go with strenght agility constitution windsdom intelligence charisma, 
  you mean that a german with the sense of humor is a shiny german ? 
  ok , we might have to check the iv of that dude, 
  like a shiny pokemon, 
  this , plus all we know about ttip are leaks . 
  the deal so far is being keept a secret apparently, 
  lol , nope . 
  northern italy is doing quite good actually . 
  the south have some problems . 
  now the real question , are the girls in romnia all hot ? 
  there where deals made as a group and deal made as a single country . 
  as a group most deal where simply on the like `` the imported goods should be able to abide the standards we have in our countries '' . 
  the thing is that the common market some mininum standards where the same so goods could travel freely . 
  the uk after brexit still wants to be part of common market , while being outside the eu , like norway . 
  now , it 's almost midnight so i 'll go quite fast with my reasoning . 
  the eu did n't prevent uk from trading outside the eu .

  the one for personal defense is almost impossible to get . 
  you have to prove you 're mentally stable ( which is the case for the other two as well ) . 
  then to walk around with it you have to prove you have a reason you 're walking with it around . 
  like someone threats you but you ca n't just lie because they 'll wan na know who . 
  for an average person it 's almost impossible . 
  they usually give it to people who carry around a lot of money or valuable things and that is their profession such as a gold store owner . 
  the other ones who can get it are judges , prosecutors because they might be attacked by the subjects they sue by default . 
  my personal opinion ( which differed a lot from the common one in / r/italy ) is that gun control is way too strict . 
  i think a mental test for stability is enough and that we should have the right to bare an arm and defend ourselves . 
  recently near milan a crazy immigrant shot some people . 
  i think i should have the right to have with me something that can help me survive such a psycho . 
  and as we see the ban does n't stop the psychos . 
  also please can anyone tell me wtf is a 3d `` printable '' gun ? 
  russian . 
  trust me . 
  strongest of those countries . 
  nobody fucks with russia . 
  lots of russians anywhere in the world as tourists . 
  the biggest eastern european trade market . 
  i do n't even see why you 're considering it . 
  have n't noticed them . 
  what do they do and who are they ? 
  well i should start off with this . 
  the north is much much wealthier than the south . 
  the gdp per capita in the north is more than twice as big as the one in the south and is higher than in germany . 
  in some places in the south unemployment reaches up to 50 % while in some places in the north it goes 0.5-1 % . 
  all the big factories are in the north-the cars like fiat , ferrari , alfa romeo , lancia are from the north ( turin ) . 
  our fashion centers are also in the north ( milan ) . 
  almost every piece of earth is made into fields which is not like that in the south . 
  you can also sense a difference wherever you go . 
  like the north is cleaner . 
  naples often has trash problems . 
  add to that that the infamous italian mafia comes from the south so it 's the base of corruption . 
  when you read this it seems like separation would only be a smart thing to do . 
  but no . 
  because in the short term the wealthy north will be much better ( you know paying less taxes because we wo n't have to pay for unemployed southerners ) . 
  i 'm a little ashamed to admit that there was a period in which i believed in the separation of italy . 
  the problem with the south is that it 's poorly developed . 
  the south has really rich lands . 
  if we start to exploit them correctly that will make a huge change in economy . 
  if we invest in the south we could create working places and drive the economy forward . 
  the south is really warm ( unlike the much colder north ) which enables us to take care of cultures like olives and use electricity from the sun . 
  in the long term the south may become very useful to the rest of italy because of it 's nature . 
  a very important thing-italy is self-sufficient ( except natural fluids ) . 
  only the north is not self-sufficient enough . 
  also , the south provides inside-immigrants for the north . 
  thus many of the people who work in factories come from there . 
  having all that said i think you understand why we would regret it . 
  also something else . 
  leaving the south because it 's in a hard period would mean we 're traitors . 
  you ca n't just leave them because they are in the rough right now . 
  maybe in a few ( hundred ) years we will be worst than them . 
  we are , after all , one nation ( although some people try to dispute that and they have their arguments ) . 
  and a nation must never be separated . 
  separated means weak . 
  the bigger we are , the better . 
  not a bag question . 
  the north ** would ** surely benefit from a separation but that would be a short-term financial benefit . 
  then , in time we would regret it . 
  no they do n't . 
  they are my favorite english team as well but i just think this is not the proper subreddit . 
  i see you 're from the north . 
  a southerner would never say this . 
  yes but i have to ask . 
  does n't the rest of spain provide some products for you guys as well ? 
  i mean are they not good for anything ? 
  you speak one language right ? 
  i 'm asking this because in italy all the industry is in the north ( cars , guns , factories ) . 
  also income in the north is 2x the one in the south , yet the south has valuable things that contribute . 
  such as grain , olives and stuff . 
  why is the rest of spain useless to you ? 
  so why does catalonia want separation ? 
  i mean in italy there is a party that wanted the north to be separated from the south . 
  but they are often perceived as idiots . 
  i see it 's different in spain . 
  i am a huge football fan but i do n't think this belongs here . 
  many people do n't care . 
  this is not a major change to football anyway . 
  it 's not like man united have any significance anywhere outside of england . 
  same goes for the rest of europe . 
  nobody , even the chinese , dare to fuck with russia 's name .

  do you like `` friends '' ? 
  and they said muslims are aggressive ... 
  well i do n't know hungarian nor turkish so i wo n't argue . 
  maybe this was n't a the best point since i was judging of the sound of the language . 
  other points still stand strong though . 
  ok so the special ones are : valle d'aosta , trentino alto adige , friuli-venezi giulia , sardegna , sicilia . 
  is it not true ? 
  would you say that turkish is closer to any european language than to arabic ? 
  dude in italy every region has a strong regional identity . 
  italy was a divided country not so long ago . 
  macchiavelli called it `` patriottismo spicciolo '' . 
  every region has their dialect etc. 
  if i were you i 'd only add the special ones like valle d'aosta , friuli-venezia giluia . 
  if you made veneto and piemonte it is only fair to add emilia-romagna , lazio etc. 
  as i said everyone has a strong regional identity . 
  now that you have made different flags for the regions you guys will probably start getting your average north-south conflict and whatnot , although i think that italians on reddit are a bit smarter than that .

  sure !, 
  you are in italy , in rome , near oranges ' garden , you can look through that door that hides a palace with garden from malta 's knights order , then you see the san peter basilica dome , the vatican . 
  and in between there 's still italy .

  you can look at three different states from [ this lock in rome ] ( https://www.instagram.com/p/9ojy1yrjvb/?taken-at=402382692\\ ) ), 
  for who ? 
  conflict of interests live personification . 
  wow , you just have to start an activity in italy then, 
  [ s\u00ec ] ( https://youtu.be/jf-wiwpkdxi ), 
  it 's a thermostatic valve . 
  it closes the hot water coming in the unit when a temperature of the air is reached . 
  like : 1 = 10c 3 = 17c 4 = 20c 5 = 22c you have to find the general thermostat to activate the system though , or to do it manually at the boiler , otherwise those valves do nothing . 
  you are a cunt, 
  you can have it if you really want to - disney, 
  why would you want canned food if you have a year wide supply of everything ? 
  hope they are scarse , because india is going to use them soon . 
  which is cheaper ? 
   international spotlight do you think italy or rome need the olympics for this ? 
  because i imagine you could make a touristic propaganda for decades in the whole world with 10 billion euro , creating work , you know , what our republic is not ensuring . 
  or just a 10 billion mess, 
  successful in everything but economically . 
  in the same way it would have been in rome . 
  you have to admit and accept something before you can learn and grow better, 
  great leaders have the habit of hosting olympic games, 
  the malfunctioning system is peculiar to the whole peninsula , though in rome it has reached unbelievable levels , but everyday life keeps going . 
   what makes the city so difficult to manage ? 
  [ even with a debt of 12 billion ] ( http://www.ilsole24ore.com/art/notizie/2016-04-06/roma-debito-pregresso-quota-12-miliardi-064018.shtml?uuid=acldy01c ) , city services are scarce at best . 
  lack of money is the cause of all . 
  but why are money missing ? 
  money have always been mismanaged , obviously . 
  how ? 
  some think of lack of competence , some think of mafiaish procurements . 
  occam razor . 
  trasparency has always lacked , it 's not even been a appliable concept on the matter for people untill today . 
  balances have always been hidden . 
  last mayor , who was getting improvements on the corruption layers , was kicked off by his own party , the pd , the national government 's one . 
  he openly said the reasons behind . 
  m5s has been elected by a enormous majority pointing to trasparency and operatization of the system ; in 3 months it has been attacked by all the parties and there has not been a day rome 's question was n't on [ national news on the media ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/mapporn/comments/4fmewv/2016_world_press_freedom_index_1581x969/ ) . 
  ** tl ; dr : ** money and corruption, 
  let 's start , you get us watches , deal ? 
   but the problem has grown so bad that early this summer , videos circulated of children playing by counting the dozens of rats surrounding roman garbage bins . 
  although it 's unacceptable , that the problem has grown is an invention of the politicized media . 
  i 'm roman and rome had way worse garbage problems before last differentiation program in the last fove years . 
  also , i remember of rats around my school , years ago and that was no problem at all for administration apparently . 
  rome 's announced disaster , in many imaginary ways is a media construct . 
  he 's obviously worried by the illegal immigrants situation, 
  it is eu 's choice because we all think that uk would prefer to get other privileges and remain in at this point . 
  the majority of the emissions is caused by old cars and trucks . 
  the solution would be to ban those . 
  you do n't know shit about italian university system . 
  are you even italian ? 
  taxes for public universities , which is the norm for everyone except some privileged , are between 2500 and 3000 euro a year . 
  if your family income is certified low enough , your taxes are lowered too . 
  extremely low incomes receive free money bag too for books and accomodation . 
  usually a room in a flat is between 200 and 400 euro a month , depending on the city and location . 
  even though teachers competence is highly respected , the system is harsh , really disincetive people from completing . 
  we have a ~ 50 % abandon rate as a result . 
  if you read the study , then you 'll find they did n't make the worst engines as euro5 standard . 
  ( though in the article that image is taken ... ) . 
  though , i believe for a cost-benefit reason , they have not implemented a fine-of-the-art apf system . 
  so , in real life conditions , even if their cars are able to pass the euro6 tests , to garantee longevity to their systems , at some circumstances the fluids circumvent the system , therefore being more dirty , relatively . 
  because we all know that a bigger engine makes bigger exaust volume , right ? 
  or have we forgotten that ? 
  just remember that there is no union . 
  then you will see it is not the union that bends , but yourself . 
  yeah , blue in florence , milan and north east would have crushed with the agenda, 
  of course those are righteous points . 
  given that policy , though , eu then should deny access to the common market to multinationals based in a country that has a lower than average corporate taxation . 
  problem solved . 
  media are objectively against her in the way as `` macchina del fango '' is cited in encyclopedias , not since the investigation was released , days ago , but since the start , about themes that were not her governance 's fault , but obviously about pre-existing mafia governed structures . 
  political knots that are unknown to us took place for the resignation en mass . 
  is this index of incompetency ? 
  yes . 
  though , are media insisting this new party to be dirty ? 
  yes . 
  is that a political agenda ? 
  media have a lot of betrayed responsability , though : you can not deny as raggi was elected `` scandalo qua , spazzatura di la ' , stipendio su , raggi gi\u00fa '' was an anthem chored by the media 24h/24 . 
  i also said mafiaish , which is different . 
  i noted the economically incongruent situation that is rome , which is explained by the mafiaish corruption in * appalti * , which is not * en par * anywhere else . 
  you , denying it , make your position hilarious . 
  because of democracy , she does, 
  i 'm from rome and even though i 'm not happy with her management , i 'm happy my money are not going to mafiaish services ' businesses or disappearing now , as it has happened for decades with usual parties ' administrations . 
  rome , the capital , with the highest budget though the worst services in the country . 
  rome has billions in debts too , ( who has created those ? 
  ) , has shitty services for missing funds and pd candidate supported the 2024 olympic candidation , which would have ended with even more debts . 
  now it furtunately will be withdrawed . 
  now , traditional parties have a strong power on media , and since she was elected with a extreme margin , they have pushed for scandals and public sensationalism , because they want to make her fail because of all the mafiaish businesses that would not operate otherwise . 
  edit : lol at the downvotes , people who do n't live here do n't understand why romans voted ** 67 % ** in favour of raggi,

  the fact that two of those might have died does n't implicate a major ground deployment . 
  jebus is right , you do n't want to see the kind of pictures slyratchet sends to us drunk at 4 in the morning . 
   during the financial crisis , the eurozone 's northern members rescued their southern counterparts by offering huge bailouts and backing the european central bank 's promise to save the euro at all costs . 
  when germany recently requested a quota system to cope with the massive influx of refugees , however , its partners showed no such solidarity . 
  german-style `` solidarity '' tanked the economies of southern europe , which are still in the toilet and not recovering because of the pure genius of expansionary austerity . 
  meanwhile , for years germany refused to even talk about refugee redistribution from the border countries ; back then it was all about following the dublin regulation and how the border countries needed to do a better job protecting the border . 
   and now that france , reeling from the paris attacks , has declared war on the islamic state , other european countries are shrugging their shoulders , mumbling condolences , and silently hoping that the conflict will spare them .

  the new nominees are street priests , while their seats were held to be feuds of comunione e liberazione , a powerful catholic group with a strong influence over politics and business in northern italy ( and several scandals involving bribes and embezzelment to its name ) . 
  negri , the bishop of ferrara , openly expressed his hope that the virgin mary might `` perform a miracle like she did for the other one '' , in reference to john paul i , the pope who died 33 days after his election and was widely considered to be a reformer . 
  please do n't editorialize and sensationalize titles . 
  the original was :  report : evidence paris attack weapons shipped from germany | a german newspaper has reported possible links between the illegal arms trade in germany and the november 13 terrorist attacks . 
  officials have declined to comment on the report . 
  there is a gulf of difference between a newpaper reporting a possible link and the generic `` assumed '' you used , which leads people to think that it 's `` assumed '' by investigators . 
  i think it 's less a positive idealistic belief in the eu and more a negative idealistic mistrust in the italian state . 
  regarding the euro , for example , most italians ( especially of voting age ) remember the times when our economic woes were handled through frequent currency devaluations , even as structural issues were left untouched out of political expediency . 
  most of my compatriots would n't trust their own government with control of the currency and , in general , still think that for all its faults brussels is less likely to screw up , be corrupt or be liable to special interests than rome . 
  brussels , for its part , has done a lot towards dispelling that notion . 
  that 's a fearsome air wing , i did n't know belgium could field that level of firepower . 
   so you want to leave the council of europe because you do n't like the human rights regulations ? 
  sure , if that 's the spin you want to put on it feel free . 
  i 'm too tired of people being unable to argue on this topic without resorting to misrepresentations to actually try and get you to stop , so go ahead and i 'll just ignore your attempts . 
  what i want is the ability to stop people abusing the asylum system as a gateway for illegal immigration . 
  [ 53 % of asylum applications made to italy are rejected ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/images/4/44/first_instance_decisions_by_outcome%2c_selected_member_states%2c_2nd_quarter_2015.png ) . 
  if you look at the [ countries of origin ] ( http://data.unhcr.org/mediterranean/country.php?id=105 ) , it 's even clearer that most people arriving here come from places wherefrom they are unlikely to need asylum , and are in search of better economic prospects . 
  their misuse of the asylum system doubles the strain on an already highly burdened asylum system , and their particular mode of travel adds to that by requiring an extensive s&r effort to prevent them from dying on the way here , beside financing human trafficking networks . 
  i want the instruments to start tackling this problem . 
  expelling illegal economic immigrants is not a violation of their human rights , there is no human right to migrate to another country except when you are at risk of persecution and in that case you would qualify for asylum , which most of our migrants do not . 
   proposes mini-schengen with belgium , sweden , austria and germany . 
  interesting proposal : boot out of schengen the mediterranean countries and let them deal with their external borders , not your problem after all . 
  what a beautiful example of european solidarity . 
  at this point i 'm wondering what exactly italy is doing in the eu : the euro is too strong a currency for our needs , european fiscal pacts restrict our ability to use fiscal policy for growth , and now foreign ministers are talking of scrapping open borders as well . 
  we might as well just get out entirely , return to a national currency , leave those european treaties that restrict our ability to enforce our borders and start caring for our interests and screw the rest , it 's what everyone else is doing . 
   what about polite men in purple with no insignia ? 
  the north atlantic treaty provides a mutual defense clause against attacks on their territory by anyone , not just attacks by a state entity :  article 5  the parties agree that an armed attack against one or more of them in europe or north america shall be considered an attack against them all and consequently they agree that , if such an armed attack occurs , each of them , in exercise of the right of individual or collective self-defence recognised by article 51 of the charter of the united nations , will assist the party or parties so attacked by taking forthwith , individually and in concert with the other parties , such action as it deems necessary , including the use of armed force , to restore and maintain the security of the north atlantic area . 
  that 's why the usa could invoke article 5 after 9/11 , despite al quaeda not being a state of any kinda . 
  if polite men in purple invaded a polish region , poland could very well invoke article 5 . 
  this sentence :  the reality in the vast majority of cases is between those two extremes means the opposite of this sentence :  you think women can ** only ** want to wear headscarf because they have been directly or indirectly forced to it thanks for showing that you 've been choosing to misrepresent my position this entire exchange ; good bye . 
   you think women can only want to wear headscarf because they have been directly or indirectly forced to it i 'll wait for this quote too , take your time and good bye . 
   you argued women only can wear headscarf because they have been indoctrinated to , because you consider it inconceivable otherwise , as it limits their personal freedoms i 'll wait for you to produce the quotes where i 'm supposed to have said this . 
  good luck . 
   that 's not what i said . 
  you threw out an unclear sentence about ` hedonism ' in a debate that had nothing to do with it , be clearer and you wo n't be misunderstood . 
   abrahamic religions , by rule , are about self-constraint and about 700 other things , plus they share that trait with plenty of others , but let 's move on . 
   so arguing that they can not possibly want to believe because it limits their freedoms is absurd lucky that i did n't argue anything like that then . 
  but at this point the debate is about moving the goalposts and misrepresenting what i said with every other post , so let 's just agree that we are n't managing to communicate and cut it . 
   as if spirituality was ever about individual freedom or hedonism not covering your head with a piece of cloth is a form of hedonism now ? 
   so they can never form their own opinions on spirituality or religion , can only be forced to it by outside forces that 's you projecting and nothing like what i said . 
  but i 'll note that you believe impositions founded on a male-dominated religion are more likey to be genuinely shared by women than internalized as a result of social pressures and expectations , and move on . 
   how is it oppressive to want to dress modestly or according to one 's religious code or even personal creed ? 
  when did we establish that every french woman who wears a headscarf does so of her own volition ? 
   the fact most women wear headscarf because they want to according to their religious beliefs again , when did we establish this ` fact ' ? 
   if they are being forced to wearing a headscarf by their relatives , that 's a problem of domestic abuse nope . 
  you are setting up a fake black-and-white rhetorical space in which women either choose to wear a headscarf out of their 100 % free will , or else suffer domestic abuse that forces them to do so . 
  the reality in the vast majority of cases is between those two extremes , that is a series expectations and pressures which do not make the legal threshold for abuse but still restrict the freedom to choose of the woman in question . 
   equality is banning petty clothing now ? 
  symbols of oppression are often petty things , like being forced to wear a certain piece of clothing , cover a certain part of your body , or prevented from wearing a certain style . 
  the fact that it 's petty does n't make it any less oppressive , in fact it can make it more so : it signals that the power of the oppressive institution is so great it can force you to do a meaningless thing or face widely disproportionate retribution . 
   the first votation is done nope , the chamber still needs to do a final pass before the first votation is done . 
  that 's scheduled for january . 
  then another two votes will be needed for the second votation . 
   and it needs 2/3 of the votes to passes without a referendum , and it will , renzi has the numbers no , he does n't . 
  he has 178 , a far cry from the 211 he 'd need for a 2/3 majority . 
  neither of these things are in dispute , they are simple facts . 
  i do n't understand what you are trying to argue here . 
   these democristiani ( or should i say ex-democristiani ) have quite a lot of support in italy they are fairly marginal in terms of votes ; what they have is a willingness to work with everyone so long as their special interests are protected , so they always end up being members of the government coalition and having enough votes to kill a law if need be , especially since cross-coalition deals are extreme rare in italy . 
   i know that technically is the case but come on , you just have to live there for a while to understand that italy is n't really a lay state we have `` teachin of the catholic religion '' ( not even `` religious studies '' , straight up catholicism ) as a default part of the public school curriculum , you have to actively opt out not to do it . 
   you 've also got to consider that while not homophobic , the average italian is pretty politically incorrect when it comes to gay people , so the task that renzi is undertaking is n't exactly a stroll in the park . 
  that 's not his main issue though . 
  he could muster the votes in parliament but he 's locked in by politics : part of his majority , including part of his party , belongs to the christian democrat faction that would revolt over a gay marriage bill , and reaching across the aisle to those parts of the opposition that would support it is made impossible but the extremely polarized rhetoric . 
  40 % sell-off actually . 
  they are presenting it as privatization but it 's mostly a way to make bank ; same thing they did with the mail , selling a minority of the stock while retaining complete control over the company . 
  nope , absolutely not . 
  we are not even at the end of the first reading ; there 's one more vote in the lower chamber and then it goes back the senate and back again to the chamber , and to a referendum after . 
   no more senate  done that 's simply false . 
  the constitutional amendment process requires two readings in both chambers and only the first reading is proceeding ; additionally , unless the amendment is passed with 2/3 of the votes , it does n't take effect until a referendum confirms it . 
  this is n't even remotely done , it 's not even at the midpoint of the process ( which would be the conclusion of the first reading ) . 
   on ruote to be done this is even falser . 
  there was never even a law presented for same sex marriage , the attempt was for civil partnerships and even on those the government has backtracked and it 's now at the point of allowing a secret ballot + no party line , essentially giving permission to its representatives to vote down the law . 
   well , showing a bit of our patriotism , history , christianity and culture would not be bad at all . 
  we are trying so hard to be ` modern ' that we are forgetting our past and what makes us a nations . 
  we have giant cathedrals on every one of our main city squares and a large portion of our cherished cultural heritage is churches and sacred art . 
  i do n't think we are at risk of forgetting anything any time soon , 
  it depends on the 18 year old , and even more so on the kind of visit you give them . 
  i was involved in outreach projects back when i was in italy and kids actually * are * interested in history , so long as you do n't make it about a boring recitation of facts . 
  people of all ages are curious to understand how other people lived and what they did and why and how ; i remember a display in a very small local museum where we taught kids the various way to don a roman toga while explaining to them the significance and cultural signalling underlying dress during various periods of roman history .

  cheaper chinese products would also be almost unstoppable without a strong regulatory voice that italy could never have by itself . 
  external custom tax and internal free trade are the most important economic asset for italy , without it italy would n't be able to compete .

  i hope there is already something in the works for this . 
  let 's flip the balkans like a pancake , i want our latin buddies near us : *, 
  that 's unusually easy to read for a financial article , kudos to you mr ritcher . 
  if they are this angry now i do n't want to imagine what will happen when china is given market status . 
  that will be far worse to eu economy then food or migration problems . 
   grazi ** e **  and done . 
  this link is a newsflash , i 've found [ an article ] ( http://bologna.repubblica.it/cronaca/2016/02/16/news/bologna_il_figlio_di_erdogan_indagato_per_riciclaggio-133566205/ ) that goes a little more in-depth , but it 's in italian . 
  february 16 , 2016 *** bologna *** - bilal erdogan , son of the recep tayyip , is subjected to investigation by the prosecutors of bologna for the offense of money laundering . 
  prosecutor manuela cavallo is investigating as result of a complaint by murat hakan uzan , businessman and political opponent of erdogan , a refugee in france . 
  the * esposto * asked to investigate any funds brought into italy from bilal , with the suspect of money laundering . 
  the son of erdogan , who 's lawyer is john throop , moved to emilia in fall for a doctorate at johns hopkins university . 
  in december , the university wall and other nearby buildings were vandalized with graffiti accusing erdogan of terrorism . 
  according to reports , erdogan has filed a lawsuit . 
  '' *** a large sum of money . 
  *** '' the son of erdogan , in emilia since last fall , is studying for a doctorate at johns hopkins university . 
  the presence of bill and his wife and children had created domestic political controversy : the official reason for the transfer is the resumption of studies , a doctorate started in 2007 . 
  but , according to some anti-government sources , he would have flown in italy in late september `` with a large sum of money '' as part of an alleged `` escape plan '' . 
  these allegations were filed by lawyer massimiliano annetta of the florence forum in lieu of his client murat hakan huzan . 
  *** a large armed contingent . 
  *** huzan considers himself a victim of political and judicial harassment by the prime minister of turkey . 
  the * esposto * , written in both italian and english , states that bilal erdogan appeared in bologna with a large armed contingent of bodyguards , whose entry into italy was not allowed . 
  the bodyguards were therefore conferred on them turkish diplomatic passports after a few hours . 
  ( sorry for the lousy translation , but i 'm weak on judicial terms and auto translators are no use . ), 
  that too . 
  it 's fun how most people are using gross contributions , the uk is a wealthy state . 
  for these critics to be useful to a discussion on `` fairness '' they should go by expenditures/gdp . 
  i 've asked for proof of the 2 million estimates , and it 's still not given by anyone . 
  simple question for simple answers .

  so you 're saying that because those countries are now gone their achievements should n't be acknowledged ? 
  and yes , we are their descendants . 
  my country is frekin ' amazing . 
  the only countries that have done as much as us for the world are probably russia and germany . 
  maybe the usa-but not even . 
  most of the inventions made in america are made by europeans , born and raised in europe . 
  the sad truth is that when hitler started repressions against the jews many of them ran to america . 
  jews were rich so their brought huge capitals and you were rich enough to sponsor projects . 
  american achievements are not only done by europeans , but also with european money . 
  plus italy is not `` much younger '' than the us . 
  even italy as we know it today is almost as old as the usa as we know it today . 
  first of all i 'm not looking down on the rest of the world , i looking up to us . 
   down at you since i 'm american wow really ? 
  italians have done so much for the world . 
  we 're probably one of the most significant nations that ever set foot on this planet . 
  yes , we have economical issues now but americans are n't better than us . 
  it amazes me why your opinion of italians is so low . 
  first of all , the civilized culture was firstly limited to greece . 
  if it were n't for the romans nobody would spread this culture to the rest of europe . 
  the romans changed the world to the core . 
  then , again , italy drew the world our of the dark ages and started the renaissance . 
  italy made great discoveries , we have great art and literature . 
  these and many many others changed thew world . 
  how dare you tell me that you as an american can look down on me ? 
  how can such arrogance go to your brain . 
  the continent you inhabit is named after an italian for god 's sake . 
  another italian showed people it existed . 
  you are using the alphabet my ancestors ( the romans ) made . 
  i bet you enjoy our food quite often . 
  what is more , you do realize that america is made by europe 's unwanted and unnecessary peasants or criminals right ? 
  no , because i want to provide a good lifestyle for my kids . 
  i want them to have education and go to bed with a full stomach every night . 
  i want them to have toys and books . 
  i will only have a child when i can provide this for it . 
  if i 'm wealthy enough i will have as many kids as i can support . 
   they do n't know who 's going to look after them when they 're old well that 's selfish . 
  bringing a child to the world , knowing it may die and starve just to know someone will look after your ass . 
   want increased fertility ? 
  make europe goddamn poor . 
  you know what ? 
  i 'm sick of this bullshit . 
  we deserved not being poor . 
  we fought for it and we made life better for ourselves . 
  well no , you are right . 
  you know what-for every person of a non-western outcome that changed the world i will tell you 10 of western outcome . 
  i can assume it . 
  a world changing genius is born pretty rarely and in 95 % of the cases he is born in western civilization . 
   wow ... just wow !, 
  you make it sound as if without us , the earths core would stop spinning no but humanity would be pretty backwards . 
   humans as a species will surely survive for a long time , will western culture ? 
  hard to say , is western culture the best when you factor in human happiness etc ? 
  well yes , western culture is by far the best . 
  there is no other civilization that has increased it 's population 's longevity so much . 
  nobody else has made such medicine and science . 
  no other culture has comparable music , literature , no one else has ever built such space stations or done so much with it technology . 
  we have almost defeated problems such as famine and plagues killing millions . 
  not only have we done it for ourselves but we have also done it for others . 
  thanks to us many asian countries have become technological and advanced . 
  we 're also helping africa . 
  how is western civilization not the best ? 
  we are having problems with reproducing only because of our greatness . 
  other cultures do n't care for their children as much . 
  a middle eastern woman can have 10 children and not care about their education . 
  an african woman breeds to the world 10 children-she does n't care they will starve . 
  or maybe she does , but that does n't stop her . 
  our women and men are responsible parents . 
  they only have a child when they 're sure that they can provide a suiting lifestyle for them . 
  because european families will want to make sure that their child will go to sleep after it 's washed , fed and happy . 
  they want to know their child will get a proper education and will live a nice life . 
  they want to know that their child will have their attention and not feel lonely . 
  for that reason , of loving our kids , we have less of them-to provide a nice life for them . 
  because you see , by our logic quality is better than quantity . 
  we want to have 1 child that has a nice life instead of 10 that will live in suffering . 
  the japanese for example have adopted our methods . 
  they are similar to us and for that reason their population is also declining . 
  their culture is respectable . 
  but africans and middle easterners do n't care . 
   also , suggesting that europeans are the only ones that can help humankind `` survive '' is preposterous it has been like this so far . 
  it 's like this now . 
  what reason do we have to think anything will change ? 
   why do you care so much about mankind ? 
  because i am human . 
  i know we are a small planet and a pretty irrelevant species . 
  so what if we 're irrelevant ? 
  we have the right to survive as a species . 
  who knows-maybe one day we will be able to conquer the universe . 
  get to know other species . 
  our brains can not even begin to comprehend what lies beyond our knowledge . 
  we , as a species , have the right to survive . 
  and without europeans that 's not going to happen . 
  also how is it naive ? 
  i see a tendency so far and nothing suggest it 's going to change . 
  i disagree . 
  without western civilization the world would suck . 
  do you realize how little achievements there would be without europeans ? 
  without us planet earth would be at least 2000 years back from where we are now . 
  we are the ones responsible for the success of mankind . 
  this said , i refuse to believe we deserve being extinct . 
  might sound arrogant but we are awesome . 
  we are the ones who reached space and we are the ones who made the world the way it is today .

  so far , all that has happened is that the pound lost some value one year ago , and the economy has had plenty of time to absorb that . 
  but the uk is still in the single market , still has the five freedoms , and so on so forth . 
  if anything the only significant thing that has happened is that the elections have paved the way to a softer brexit , where nothing will change except the uk loses the ability to discuss the rules it is subject to . 
  so in the end it boils down to good old devaluation . 
   tell lybia to get fucked news at 11 , `` lybia '' already is fucked ( and it 's also spelled libya ) . 
  italy makes treaty with libya about immigrants . 
  france bombs libya but does n't want immigrants that come to italy through libya . 
   pressuring north african countries you mean that country where france wanted to export democracy , the one that now it 's about as messed up as somalia ? 
  who do you even have to pressure there ? 
   stop forcing eastern european countries to accept migrants   do whatever is necessary to protect the external schengen borders what are the eastern european countries doing to protect the external schengen borders ? 
  the eu is not the tooth fairy , it can only do whatever the member states do together . 
  so far , all the eastern european countries have done is whining about the 50 immigrants quota allocated to some of them . 
   a taxi to the airport apart from the obvious difficulty of flying back 100.000 people ( so far in 2017 ) , good luck figuring out even _ where _ to send the plane back , and assuming that country will accept them . 
  good luck , really . 
  other messages you wrote are very reasonable . 
  but it 's hard , and the way austria is approaching the issue is ludicrous . 
  you could call it the final solution ( sorry german friends ) . 
  in my family only my mother-in-law and i love it . 
  and ievan polkka , of course . 
  if the issue that made it undemocratic was the unmodifiable articles , obviously erdogan ca n't have fixed that . 
  you 're just spitting out propaganda . 
  even the turkish constitution has a few unmodifiable articles . 
  can you translate the three sentences just to give an idea ? 
   but i do n't how to explain the difference is that ergative ? 
  for example say you have : * the dog walks * the ball bounces * the dog catches the ball in the last sentence , most other languages use the same case for the dog that was used in the first two sentences ( nominative ) , and another case for the ball in the last sentence ( accusative ) . 
  in basque instead the case you used in the first two sentences is used for the ball in the last sentence ( that 's ~ ~ ergative , i think ~ ~ absolutive ) and the dog in the last sentence uses a different case , ergative . 
  at least that 's what wikipedia says , or how i understood it . 
  as accommodating as usual . 
  if / u/greetings _ friend had a high-resolution version , that would make a nice submission to / r/photoshopbattles ... 
  hans zimmer is awesome . 
  cool , thanks for the informative answer !, 
  could he change the constitution _ that _ much ? 
  or are there some parts that are substantially immutable , even by the parliament or through a referendum ? 
  no , but it was the norm in western europe and perhaps in the world until 1945 . 
  the threshold is not at the national level , it is computed separately for each region . 
  the 20 % is for coalitions ; usually there are just 2 or 3 of them , and all other parties go alone . 
  the italian system sucks , but this is not the reason why it sucks . 
  funny how in italy abortion and divorce are allowed ( doctors can refuse to do abortions as conscience objection ; it is not a problem in practice ) , but we have no civil partnerships even for heterosexual couples . 
  it 's very different ( and i 'm not a supporter at all ) . 
  they propose wide access to broadband network , selection of candidates via cv , short mandate limits and stuff like that . 
  in principle there 's a lot to agree upon , a lot of it is demagogy but it 's interesting to follow its evolution . 
  zs is a tell-tale for hungarian . 
  definitely . 
  renting a 60 m2 apartment near technologicky park costs around 400 euros , and food is quite cheap ( for a single person , 100 euros per month will be enough ) . 
  taxes , welfare etc. 
  eat roughly 35 % of your wage . 
  i confirm it 's a very nice city , though it is also quite large so it has some ugly neighborhoods . 
  north of the station & & close to tramway lines is already a safe bet . 
  where i lived was 15-20 minutes walk from the office and 10-15 minutes by tram to the center . 
  public transport was always punctual and night buses are phenomenal . 
  in other words , my experience matches iambulgariaama 's quite closely . 
  also , finding an _ interesting _ job in brno is much easier than finding it in italy , even though in italy you 'd make more money . 
  ( source : i lived in brno for 18 months , left because my wife still had a job in italy and had finished her maternity leave ) . 
  not hindsight in my case . 
   ( well , somewhat . 
  i bought some italian bonds last december , not last june . 
  i wish i had sold them in march and bought them back in june , but that _ is _ hindsight bias : as i wrote , i did n't need the money , so the right thing for me was and is to keep the bonds until expiration , since they give pretty good coupons ) . 
  the good thing with short term bonds is that they give an easy plan b ( just keep them ) . 
  but right now only very long-term bonds are worthwhile . 
  actually it is a good deal to lend to italy , or at least it was back in june when everybody knew that the italian rates were awfully inflated , or even in december right before monti took power . 
  you could have made some pretty good capital gains ( 4-5 % ) on italian 3-year bonds . 
  to some extent you can still do the same with spanish bonds . 
  of course that 's mostly true if do n't need the money , so you can wait for 3 years for italy to pay back the bonds in case your bet is wrong . 
  there 's still the risk of defaulting , but a default would be much more problematic for me ( as an italian ) than the investment i would lose ... 
  besides what ericthehalibut said , age matters less than bonus class for computing your insurance premium . 
  young people start with a shitty ( and expensive ) class , and have to climb down the ladder for the first 10 or so years of insurance . 
  this is doubly discriminating , because an older person will pay his first accident for just 2-3 years after which he 'll be back in the best class ; for a younger person , it will take 2-3 years _ longer _ to reach the best class , and if that means 12 years instead of 10 , they 'll be paying a higher premium for all those 12 years !, 
  that can also be regulated though . 
  in italy a new car gets the best bonus of the family , independent of the age of the insured person ( this does n't require that you are living with your parents , as long as your legal residence is at the same address ) , so it 's possible for a newly insured person to get a good bonus class and pay little as long as they cause no accidents . 
  the cynical side of me wonders if bankruptcy would be the better option . 
  problem is rome can not be taken out of the loop . 
  income tax would have to be above 100 % to sustain the expenditures . 
  sicily would go bankrupt in a matter of months . 
  the problem is that `` what 's given '' amounts to useless jobs with extremely good salary for what you are doing ( nothing ) and with advantageous conditions for retiring so that they can hire more people . 
  who cares if they still have to pay you . 
  services in sicily ( healthcare for example ) are among the worst in the nation , but the president of the region has over 1000 people on _ his personal _ staff . 
  there are some rules anyway . 
  for example they can not deny you coverage . 
  i think problems happen when an arranged marriage may involve moving back to the original country . 
  it may not be the common case , but i imagine that 's the kind that would rapidly escalate to forced and make the news . 
  for that matter , a marriage may be forced and at the same time not arranged by the parents ( like `` you 're pregnant , you marry the father '' ) . 
  it 's called margherita , because it was dedicated to queen margherita . 
  if that applies to isps i could buy it . 
  but `` social media companies must allow only real pictures of users . '', 
  does not give any excuse ... 
  ahem , italy has never asked for bailout money , never . 
  ( btw , i 've lived in cr for one year and a half , so my source is my former colleagues ) . 
  countries such as lithuania and estonia are pro-eu because , having to choose between ( the possibility of ) being fucked by eu or by russia , they think the eu is a better bet . 
  czech republic benefits a lot from scepticism . 
  for example it is possibly the richest of the former soviet block countries , but still gets access to eu money for eastern countries . 
  czech republic is one of the most skeptic countries in the european union , possibly second only to great britain . 
  klaus 's hidden motives are simply to please his potential electors . 
  right , the dirty jobs are left to illegal mexicans . 
  come on ... 
  in europe , the bible is in many cases ( not all ) just a pretext . 
  that should be illegal . 
  they might be allowed not to renew your contract ( you do n't need an explanation for that ) , but not to fire you . 
   up here , we think that using 200g of parmesan for a risotto is using a lot of parmesan in one go . 
  do n't worry , here too .

  people literally ca n't ask for asylum there . 
   if not lybia send them to tunisia there are a few issues with that : 1 ) they are n't passing through tunisia , so tunisia has no business with them . 
  we ca n't just send them to the nearest safe country we do n't like . 
  2 ) tunisia is a very small country and could n't possibly take on all the migrants . 
  even if we just stonewalled them the tunisian government would let migrants go and try to reach europe again , something that is probably already happening . 
  while this kind of a dick move from their part we ca n't really expect a country smaller than sicily to take in the whole refugee wave . 
  what are you saying ? 
   coming directly from a territory where their life or freedom was threatened in the sense of article 1 refugees can obviously pass through dangerous countries in order to reach a safe one . 
  libya is a country where their freedom is being threatened , they ca n't even ask for asylum since the country did n't agree to the 1951 refugee convention . 
  you could even say that libya as a country barely exists now ... 
  anyway the vast majority of people coming through libya are n't granted refugee status , but subsidiary or humanitarian protection . 
   the fact that they went there with the purpose of saving vessels should be enough to prosecute them . 
  this is idiotic , staying in a place to help people in need is a crime now ? 
  ngos were accused of helping smugglers , but they were all acquitted and are actually working together with italian authorities . 
  if it was n't for them smuggler would still send migrants into our country ( like they did for the last 5 years ) , they would just use slightly better boats that would sink near the italian coast . 
  most of the migrants going to italy are n't coming from turkey , that 's a different route . 
  in italian media they are called `` migrants '' and roughly 40 % of them are granted subsidiary or humanitarian protection that allows them to stay in the country . 
  the vast majority of them are not granted refugee status . 
  can you blame those people for not wanting to migrate in countries ruled by merciless dictatorships that sometimes are even involved in slave trading ? 
  anyway most of the countries you listed did n't even agree to the refugee rights convention . 
  then that thousand year old teaching is violated every day that two people that do n't want kids get married , but we do n't see many people protesting those kind of marriages . 
  civil marriages are not the church bussiness and they should stay out of them . 
  then do n't mind us and try to change the status quo . 
  as i 've already said :  easy for you to say when your country is not the one risking economic sanctions . 
  `` go on italy , break international law by sending both refugees and illegals back , who cares , you 're the one that is going to pay for it while we wo n't lift a single finger to help you out . '', 
  and before you said anything , no european right wing party has ever had any decent proposal about changing the refugee convention . 
  we are not gaddafi 's libya , we are n't going to violate international laws to do your dirty job . 
  easy for you to say when your country is not the one risking economic sanctions . 
  `` go on italy , break international law by sending both refugees and illegals back , who cares , you 're the one that is going to pay for it while we wo n't lift a single finger to help you out . '', 
  and before you said anything , no european right wing party has ever had any decent proposal about changing the refugee convention . 
  we are not gaddafi 's libya , we are n't going to violate international laws to do your dirty job . 
  then you change those laws , you do not break them . 
  and not a single right wing party wants or knows how to change them . 
  [ warm ligurian hospitality ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1t_eyl6jxsk ), 
   it 's foolproof , which is why politicians and ngos hate it . 
  ngos have beek asking for humanitarian corridors for half a decade now ... 
  this is idiotic , politicians would kill for an easy way out of the migration crisis which has been causing massive loss of votes for moderates all around europe . 
  the hard , ugly truth is that there is no simple solution to a mass migration . 
  tunisia is a minuscule country that would never accept to host hundreds of thousands of people - because they will keep coming , just because they might think they could succeed in reaching europe . 
  italy alone reviewed almost 100.000 asylum requests in 2016 , and 40 % of those were accepted . 
  while many of these people are economic migrants , many are not . 
  there is no amount of money that could convince tunisia to flood themselves with migrants from all over africa , we can barely convince marocco to take back its illegal migrants in the eu . 
  that would apply to most european countries . 
  freedom of speech is a human right , but like every human right it is subject to certain restrictions . 
  for example fighting words are n't protected speech , not even in the us . 
  libel , slander and pornography are also limited . 
  many eu countries have more restriction on this right than the us but this does n't mean they do n't respect human rights , especially when compared to the country that built guantanamo bay and funds the nsa . 
  pretty much the entirety of western europe colonized something . 
  it is still someone hoping for terror attacks ... not on muslims , but its political opponents . 
  and i do n't think they would feel sorry for any muslim terror victims . 
  anyway a guy a couple comments above linked a user profile of someone that complimented the attacker . 
  also the web is full of right wing personalities calling for the `` glassing '' of the middle east . 
  it 's not like you can just go and visit it , aside from st. peter . 
  getting an entry permit is n't easy , and living there is pretty much impossible for anyone that is n't working for the church . 
   i do n't defend pedophiles . 
  i do n't see the children being victims of him without any further details given . 
  apparently you do n't think that the children aged 3 and 5 years old were victims of abuse , yet you come here saying that `` we all know children abuse is wrong '' ? 
  you are an hypocritical and disgusting human being . 
  a m\u00e0mmeta is the standard reply when you do n't think you were insulted but you ca n't be completely sure . 
  it just means `` your mother '' . 
  i do n't know a single word of your god forsaken language so i 'm just going to answer you with : a m\u00e0mmeta . 
  well , of course he 's running . 
  he had almost disappeared a couple of years ago but made a slight comeback . 
  there is also decent chance that he will be involved in a government coalition in the near future . 
  i do n't wish to insult anyone , so i will only say that many italians have a pretty degrading view of eastern eu women . 
  popular opinion is that they are hot , submissive and gold diggers . 
  he 's firmly stuck at 10 % or something , though i would like to see him and trump together for a handshake and a photo shooting . 
  those guys have a lot in common . 
  just like many people from western europe were n't happy when whole neighborhoods became full of eastern european . 
  they may be europeans , but they are n't western european , it 's still a change in a country 's ethnic identity if we want to play the nationalism game . 
  i can tell you that 10 years ago in italy no one would have thought that romanians , albanians or polish were in some way close to us because they were europeans , and many people actually did n't want romania in the eu . 
  nationalists are n't gon na to like you just because you are part of a union they do n't recognize . 
  the biggest noble gasses can react under certain , usually pretty extreme , circumstances , yes . 
  the correct rule is not really `` noble gasses do n't react '' but more like `` most noble gasses are very stable and do n't usually react '' . 
  all chemistry 's rules are full of exception , and pretty much all the heavier elements behave differently from the lighter ones in the same period . 
   a person aged 18 or above may apply for french citizenship by naturalization after five years ' habitual and continuous residence in france they do not get their citizenship instantly , according to wikipedia ... 
  same for germany :  children born on or after 1 january 2000 to non-german parents acquire german citizenship at birth if at least one parent :  has a permanent residence permit and has been residing in germany for at least eight years . 
   it 's just too easy these days you litterally described the requirements for italian citizenship in your post ... and i do n't think the french ones are that different . 
  what european country is giving instant citizenship to migrants ? 
  not really , mussolini held much less power than hitler and the king could , at any time during his first years , have taken him down ... in 1922 he could have just signed the state of siege order all his fascist movement would have been trampled . 
  instead the king allowed the coup , collaborated with the regime and did n't act against its aggressions against political opponents . 
  remember that the king was still the leader of the army . 
  you fear the masses , but forget how much wars were started by kings and dictatorships , forget that monarchs are still people and that they can still be incompetent , stupid and bloody . 
  i also like my civil liberties , like freedom of association or press . 
  i ca n't really think of a single good point for which monarchy should be superior to democracy ... 
   i think a king would be better than a powerless figurehead of a president who suddenly pretends to be non-partisan as soon as he gets elected pretty much every monarch in any european country is a powerless non partisan figurehead . 
   fascism was 80 years ago . 
  mistakes were made , they paid for them `` mistakes '' . 
  allowing a fascist coup to happen is a mistake now ? 
  dragging us into ww2 is a mistake ? 
  no thanks . 
  if we need a `` powerless figurehead '' then i would like an elected president instead of a monarch . 
   fascism was not a parenthesis and it did n't come out of nowhere . 
  of course , but the coup would have never happened without the king 's help . 
  and `` most '' italians were n't really that ok with fascism . 
  they went on with their lives , sure , because that 's what people do . 
  but if they could they would n't have voted for it . 
   the recent presidential pandering to the `` veterans '' ( ! ), 
  of the rsi is the final nail on the coffin . 
  citation fucking needed .

  i 'm curious to see what they 'll do when reality kicks in : they 'll still have free movement , they 'll pay pretty much the same amount to europe but without access to european funds , and they wo n't have any say about anything . 
  sorry for the people who wanted to remain , this is a disaster , and most people are too stupid to realise that . 
  oh come on i do n't believe that . 
  i mean , obviously no one was going to say `` in do n't want the fucking foreigners on the bus '' . 
  but `` taking control of our borders '' , `` taking our country back '' and stuff like that are kind of code words for it . 
  and i 've heard plenty of people making those points , a lot more than those who were convinced they would be better off economically . 
  i might add that england has always preferred doing the interests of the states rather than europe 's , not a nice ally under that point of view . 
  i too think we might end up being better off , if we manage to contain the euro sceptics that will pop up in the next future . 
  yep , i was talking about it with my wife , i agree . 
  i think xenophobia has always been widespread here , the referendum just made them feel entitled to act as twats about it , they do n't have to hide it anymore . 
  i do n't know man , i have n't even seen it in europe , outside of italy . 
  i have even looked it up on amazon.com but it looks like it 's only available on [ amazon.it ] ( https://www.amazon.it/crema-novi-spalmare-nocciole-cacao/dp/b01eg4s9iu ) edit : maybe if you [ send them an email ] ( http://elah-dufour.it/it/contatti ) begging they 'll send you a coupel of tubs , 
  good !, 
  that would boast sales of crema alle nocciole novi , which is less known and kicks nutella 's ass hands down . 
  crema novi is the shit . 
  unskilled immigrants driving wages down has been proved wrong multiple times though . 
  that 's a very dodgy and , sorry to say it , quite stupid characterization . 
  the uk gets tons of highly specialised workers from the eu . 
  the entertainment industry , the video games industry , the financial industry , the tech industry , the it industry , even your nhs , depend strongly from eu workers . 
  i was reading just yesterday that the movie industry is terrified by the potential scarcity of competent people were immigration made more difficult , and the same goes for the nhs . 
  there are indeed immigrants happy to work for minimum wage ( as if it were their choice ) and send money home , but taking that as a paradigm of what the uk gains from freedom of movement is completely dishonest . 
  finland most tourists ? 
  yeh it does n't really work like that but whatever . 
  the payment of the dues is completely unrelated to anything the uk can demand though . 
  the argument is `` we 're divorcing , let 's settle the bills we had together , and then we talk about the rest '' . 
  it 's not a quid pro quo situation , where if you pay you get something , it 's just money owed . 
  you ca n't say `` well what do i get if i pay my debt '' . 
  under this point of view i completely agree with the eu wanting to put this ahead of everything else . 
  this should be sorted before any talks about trade commence , because the uk might as well say `` you know what ? 
  i 'll give you nothing '' and just walk away . 
  as well as you , i think this will halt every negotiation process . 
  i do n't envy may ( not just because i hate her guts ) , as any penny she will agree to pay will have people moan and complain to no end . 
  it must feel like christmas for the daily mail . 
  i did n't even know this was still on the table :0, 
  you do n't want people who do n't know shit about enormously complicated matters to vote directly on them . 
  that 's precisely why you appoint specialists instead of consulting with a panel of 4chan users . 
  the uk , as much as all members of the eu , did have a say on every major treaty : by directly voting their representatives in the european parliament . 
  if they were shit at communicating with their voters it 's just their fault . 
  ahah fucking hell i 'm not a fan of merkel but i 've always respected her . 
  her face here had perfect comic timing . 
  yes !, 
  that 's him !, 
  i listened to the same program , 
  also john cantremember on radio 4 in the morning . 
  i listen to him while driving to work and he makes a sport of tearing politicians a new one . 
  i wonder if that cunt david cameron realized the mighty shitstorm he triggered , of if it 's dawning on him a bit at a time . 
  weird , i thought ireland was in schengen . 
  honestly i never heard her doing fear mongering . 
  her point has always been `` scotland voted to remain in the uk on the assumption that the uk was to remain in the eu . 
  england and wales have now voted to leave , removing the conditions the scottish referendum was based on . '', 
  it makes sense that voters are asked if they 're ok with the new developments , as most of the scots who voted to remain in the uk , did so thinking that that was a way to remain in the eu . 
  her main point never was `` omg we 'll all be fucked let 's jump boat asap '' . 
  what happened in poland that makes it keeping poipping up ? 
  i 've been out of the loop for a bit . 
  i 'm sure the money invested in long term projects from both sides will be part of the negotiations . 
  i really do n't think that the gist of it is `` ah sorry mate your money is gone '' . 
  how 's that a `` petty threat '' ? 
  it 's a project of the eu for eu members , if you are not in the eu you do n't get to use it , as much as the entirety of the other things that are exclusive of the member countries . 
  like , when you stop paying for the gym , do you tell them they 're petty if they wo n't let you use their sauna ? 
  this sentence does not make sense and has no bearing on actual facts but whatever man . 
  i came to the point where every comparison to nazi sounds to me like `` i 'm an idiot , i do n't have arguments and i do n't know what else to say '' . 
  if someone is n't literally killing millions of people just shut the fuck up . 
  you clearly do n't know what you 're talking about . 
  yes if the rest of the world made it as demeaning for americans to get a visa as it is for non americans to enter the us , maybe it will send a message . 
  oh no that 's not that uncommon , if i understand what youy mean . 
  in italian ( and i believe french and spanish as well ) you do have indeterminate and determinate articles . 
  un gatto ( a cat ) , il gatto ( the cat ) . 
  jesus that sounds impossible to learn :0, 
  oh you forgot this , there you go  \\, 
  no i 'm not sure !, 
  i thought about it just because my friend learned the rule while studying italian . 
  for us i guess it 's just for granted , i do n't remember ever hearing of that rule , then i ran a mental list of islands and it makes sense . 
  elba is definitely an ecception , as you always refer to it as `` isola d'elba '' , so for short it becomes `` l'elba '' . 
  could cyprus be another ecception ? 
  i ca n't think of others , really . 
  that 's interesting , in italian seven is `` sette '' , which is masculine , while thirst is `` sete '' , which is feminine . 
  so yes , i guess some evolution of latin led to your `` seven '' and `` thirst '' to be the same word , but the different meanings retaining their gender . 
  fascinating , 
  in what language ? 
  aha that 's so cool . 
  good , finally we get to my point : no , i think you 're wrong , colonialism is nowhere near as criticized as other atrocities . 
  quite the opposite . 
  and i 'm not saying this to `` further my agenda '' or implying that you 're an idiot . 
  i just think your claim is just fucking wrong . 
  just think about it for a second . 
  there are loads of movies where british colonialists are depicted in a positive way . 
  all gentlemen in kaki and round glasses , cutting though the forest followed by black porters and giving enemies `` a jolly good spank '' . 
  name me a positive movie about nazis happily spreading german industriousness . 
  how acceptable would that be ? 
  there are literally zero movies about good nazis . 
  in fact , there are plenty of documentaries about german atrocities . 
  germans themself teach them at school , they embrace it and condemn it and talk about it on reddit . 
  knowledge about british war crimes is nowhere near as wide spread as the one about the nazis . 
  ask anyone if they know about the boer concentration camps , the aden 's torture centers , the amritsar massacre , just off the top of my head . 
  there is a semi romantic myth about british colonialists who spread civilization while drinking tea , and the british have been happy to spread that myth and [ literally silence the opposite ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/apr/18/britain-destroyed-records-colonial-crimes?newsfeed=true ) . 
  i have been in at least 5 museums of germans atrocities here in europe . 
  i have never seen a single museum about british atrocities . 
  i 've been in a couple about british colonial armies though . 
  uniforms , weapons , captains , documents , pictures of soldiers celebrating , soldiers on elephant back looking at the camera , soldiers on camel back looking tough and so on . 
  not a single picture of [ kids starved to death ] ( http://i0.wp.com/listverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/01.jpg?w=632 ) ( this is fro ma boer concentration camp ) .

  cutting taxes cost money . 
  that 's what italy did in last years so we are not saying that countries should increase debt . 
  we are saying that a susteinable growth is the way to reduce the debt . 
  but if you have to stop cutting taxes , if you ca n't finance your reforms and if eu-investments are not effective because we have to obey to technocratic rules ... then we are not going to have growth and no debt reduction in the long term . 
  btw italy 's deficit is not big ... so it 's wrong to say that we want debt or public spending etc. . . 
  you are so optimistic ... 
  except we are a net contributor to the eu, 
  i totally disagree . 
  the referendum is about reducing the powers of the senate to normal powers of a normal upper house . 
  no senate in parliamentary republics ( or parliamentary monarchy ) has the same powers of the lower house ; and no senate in the world can vote a motion of no confidence to the government . 
  what 's abhorrent about the electoral law for the chamber ? 
  the constitutional court may change it in october if it has some problems ; but it 's not part of the referendum anyway . 
  the current electoral law at the current senate is abhorrent . 
  in fact if the referendum fails we 'll have no government ( or super-grand coalitions ) for a loooot of time . 
  and then we 'll complain about political instability , too much mps , the unuseful political enties and all the stuff we have in the reform . 
  and the reform actually makes some good and reasonable steps when it comes to direct democracy . 
  well the uk is doing something legal and the idea to kick greece out was illegal . 
  the point is , they have been threatened and/or put under pressure . 
  imagine if you are the one to do something illegal ... 
  1 ) i agree , but that 's my point 2 ) offer ? 
  yeah an offer greece ca n't refuse . 
  ( * relevant flair * ) . 
  greece was not punished because of the social-democratic bloc in the council and because they accepted the juncker package . 
  3 ) britain is pretty powerful and influential . 
  and still , it 's under pressure and during the negotiations it will be 27 vs 1 or something like that . 
  some economic and political reforms proposed by italy http://www.governo.it/sites/governo.it/files/asharedpolicystrategy_20160222.pdf http://www.ansa.it/english/news/world/2016/04/15/italy-proposes-migration-compact-to-eu_f7efdc81-7df8-4999-b90d-c0c96ca9acc6.html http://europeanpost.co/renzi-primary-election-to-select-the-president-of-the-european-commission/, 
  the eu institutions were about to smash greece into pieces because of the result of tsipras ' referendum . 
  germany wanted to kick greece out of the eurozone . 
  i absolutely disapproved that and i did n't like this kind of behavior . 
  but that 's what happens . 
  you ca n't let each county decide its own form of union for itself . 
  the other countries ( the ones respecting eu treaties ) will react to that in a way or another . 
  i 'm not saying that eu law hampers growth ... but the eu it 's structured in way we do not have some tools other economies have ( look at the powers of the fed and compare with that of the ecb for example . 
  look at how weak is the juncker plan : it could be muc more effective ) . 
  italy has proposed some reforms and i 'm pretty sure france has proposed a similar kind of reforms too . 
  i think sanctions are likely to take place cause if a country decides unilaterally to leave the eurozone , then a country can decide to leave the schengen area etc. 
  well of course you can do illegal stuff , but it 's illegal . 
  yes https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/grec\u00eca_salentina, 
  well , to say that the five star movement supports the eu is wrong . 
  they want a referendum on our membership in the eurozone ( you ca n't exit the euro on your own but anyway they say whatever they want ) . 
  they have euroskpetic positions and euroskeptic allies . 
  so no , farage 's biggest ally in the european parliament does not `` fully support the eu '' . 
  i `` m schoked by the fact that this author is italian . 
  you do n't get what italy is saying . . it 's not just about austerity ... the eu needs structural reforms too . 
  we are not happy with our slow recovery but is germany really happy with a 0.4 % growth in the second quarter ? 
  is france happy with a 0 % growth in the second quarter?really ? 
  polls are like 50 % to 50 % : i still have faith in the italian people . 
  renzi had 70 % approval in the first months he was in power ... and he was super-popular ... than he did the structural reforms and his approval rating fell to like 35-30 % . 
  so i do n't understand your point . 
  yeah what could possibly go wrong ? 
  you are a self-hating italian . 
  your opinion is not relevant . 
  keep voting for berlusconi , grillo , salvini or any other anti-euro and tax evasor clown . 
  no problem whatsoever . 
  a ) this is the flag of europe and she is european . 
  b ) she wanted to show solidarity with france , belgium , germany for recent terror attacks ... instead of bringing three or four flags , she used just the european one . 
  3 ) i guess she believes in the european project ... so you can also bring a european flag if you feel `` european '' ... just like you can bring the peace flag if you believe in peace 4 ) this gesture was appreciated in italy . 
  really ? 
  i mean we have a lof of problems ... but i think italy is actually one of the brightest examples of separation of political/judiciary system . 
  our prosecutors are judicial officers just like judges and our minister of justice has no power whatsoever over investigations and stuff like that . 
  politicians of all levels and parties are arrested and convicted since 20 years . 
  man , you do n't send your money to italy . 
  we are a net contributor to the eu . 
  instead of the `` shish '' thing ... that 's my fav video : https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=kq0csdlua9a, 
  renzi 's tweet ( translation ) : `` in this country , judges respond to the italian constitution , not to the turkish president . 
  it 's called rule of law '', 
  i understand sanchez ' point of view . 
  i guess psoe will lose a huge amount of votes if it joins a grand coalition led by the pp . 
  cause they are mix of both far-left populists and far-right populists so they look like a centrist party . 
  this does not change the fact that grillo is fucking dangerous . 
  italy never bailed out in its history as a united nation , nigel . 
  but they are farges 's ally in the european parliament and they want a referendum in order to exit from the eurozone . 
  and they are n't certainly a left-wing party . 
  in fact they have no clear position on immigration , citizenship , civil rights , etc. ... which is kinda frustrating cause when journalists * ask them about this kind of issue ... they do not give answers . 
  it 's a sort of mix between far-right populists and far-left populists . 
  a dangerous mix if you ask me . 
  what drives me crazy is that they have the worst supporters . 
  they tend to insult you on the internet , they are very aggressive in doing that cause they kinda colonized the italian web ( you think you know what i mean by that , but no ... you have no idea ) . they consider grillo a god and they imitate what he says and what he does . 
  he is a master of insults basically ... so most of his supportes and some of his mps basically call whores women of other parties , and they say everybody else except them are thieves , corrrupt etc. 
  what 's ironic is that grillo has ome serious problems with justice . 
  * members of the five star movement are usually interviewed alone cause they refuse to take part in debates . 
  that 's so frustrating imo cause they have a sort of special place in talk shows . 
  and despite this , they say all journalists are pro-establishment or whatever . 
  at least god was smart enough to place the uk in the middle of the sea at the top of the map :d, 
  the other track it 's a eu project btw . 
  if we count only the army , the navy , and the air force we are at 180,000 ( still more than germany and britain though ) . 
  but carabinieri are also used in peacekeeping missions and they are the fourth branch of the `` armed forcez '' , this is why they are included . 
  so 280,00 350,000 is probably an exagerration , it 's beacuse we have another group called `` guardia di finanza '' . 
  all members of guardia di finanza are organised under military lines and the guardia has a very large naval component for a police force . 
  but still it 's just a police force . 
  guardia di finanza fought in world war ii but in peacetime they have no role in a warfare scenario ( they have a role in border and sea security though ) . they are like 60,000 . 
  what 's good about the italian military is that we have two light aircraft carriers and a lot of troops able to take part in international missions . 
  so we have some kind of power projection other nations do n't have . 
  the difference is that cameron said he was not going to resign.if something goes wrong i hope mattarella saves the day . 
  if no wins , we 'll have a boschi government till 2018 trying to change the electoral law and to make a decent law for the senate.but i hope the yes wins obviously . 
  yeah ... tha 's good thing though but i do n't trust grillo and instability is a bad thing ... and to complete the picture , i think that the temporary government after renzi ( if he falls ) will be probably led by this woman . 
  the `` renzi go home '' campaign has coined the word `` renxit '' . 
  if renzi goes , no one knows what happens next . 
  probably a temporary government and then we go to elections without renzi . 
  in that case i 'm pretty sure the five star movement wins in the chamber of deputies but they will not have a majority in the senate .

   many openly advocate for the dissolution of germany . 
  even if this is only youthful , nihilistic posturing , its pervasiveness is telling . 
  uh , congratulations on discovering anarchists . 
  they 've been around in germany for something like 150 years . 
   `` move against state and capital . 
  no peace with germany ! '' literally anarchist slogans . 
  is this guy for real ? 
   taken to its natural conclusion , a billion chinese can move into germany tomorrow if they so choose . 
  yep . 
  they are anarchists , you do n't need to extrapolate , they 'll tell you exactly that themselves if you but ask . 
   granted , the above death wish for nation and people , i spotted in connewitz , leipzig 's hotbed for young radicals ... so he 's actually aware that he 's talking about the fringe of the fringe ? 
  why the feigned shock ? 
   these neo-punks an-arch-ists . 
   many germans many ? 
  anarchists are a numerically insignificant portion of the german people . 
   the two countries with the fiercest martial spirit from the last century have been pacified , and perhaps wussified , and that 's why one hears of young japanese men who spend all day , literally , in their childhood room playing video games and looking at porn it 's a bizarre new form of orientalism to reduce japanese society to one metric , militarism , and construct a social theory of hikikomori on the basis of too little militarism . 
   wandering around leipzig and dresden , i see plenty of slogans denouncing fascism , nazism , sexism , anti-semitism and homophobia , but no mention of germany 's complicity in the syrian war . 
  [ look harder ? 
  ] ( http://i.imgur.com/juryaz9.jpg ) especially radical left groups of the kind he describes are very active in denouncing german arms sales . 
   next year , who knows how many millions will be welcomed by nsa-bugged merkel . 
  what 's in her closet , i wonder ? 
  to protect her own career , merkel must obey her master . 
  i see . 
  the nsa spies on merkel , which means she 's on washington 's leash ( because she clearly has skeletons in the closet ) , and that 's what her refugee policy is based on . 
  one would wonder why washington did n't yank that leash a few years ago when the german govenment 's position instead that refugees landing in italy and greece should stay there . 
  but that would be giving credit to this sort of simplistic conspiracy theory . 
   should xenophobic outbursts explode down the line , they can be traced back to this initial suppression of dialogue . 
  i see . 
  does the author similarly justify islamic terrorism because islamic extremists have been suppressed by the west ? 
   without patriotism you can not accomplish anything . 
  strange : germany is the leading economy of europe and even considered its most influential country . 
  how did they manage that with their deplorable lack of patriotism ?

   only for the usa we have to see the people as somehow innocent . 
  everyone engages in this sort of hypocrisy , everyone . 
  everyone thinks that the in-group is made up of different people and the faults of each are not the faults of the group , while the out-groups are amorphous and homogenous every individual speaks for their entirety .

  * ** libya ** is imho the least favourite of the lot because of what happened in 1970 and during the gaddafi era ( y' know , back when its government showed a slight tendency to actively promote international terrorism ) . 
  but , hey , there 's oil and lots of immigrants ready to land on our shores down there ... this is why our politicians decided that dealing with gaddafi was a-ok , at least until shit began hitting the fan in 2011 . 
  * edit * : the damn android spellcheker wo n't let me write something that makes actual sense . 
  again . 
  most italians , including our myopic government , probably do n't even know we had colonies . 
  enough said . 
  we just wanted to forget and be done with it . 
  the comments below the article are even worse than the piece itself . 
   [ ... ] is that just a small but vocal minority whining about it , or do most italians feel that way ? 
  luckily , the naysayers belong to a small , vocal and ... rather * annoying * minority . 
  yes , i do see them . 
  but most happen to be tourists or otherwise foreigners ... do n't know about weed , had some friends who smoked a few joints and that was pretty much it . 
  is it that weird ? 
  in my experience it is certainly frowned upon - we did it once and got all sorts of dirty looks and comments from passersby . 
  i would n't do that again !, 
  afaik few people are willing to get shit-faced with colleagues ... not to mention the fact that generally you do n't see many drunk folks on the streets . 
  at least not here ( i am from rome btw ) . 
  no drinking songs over here . . in fact , there 's ( almost ) no drinking at all going on with the notable exception of the country 's north-east . 
  and getting drunk is considered rather shameful in italy !, 
  ... which is not to be confused with * ti voglio bene * . 
  the latter sentence translates as `` i love you '' ( as in : `` i love you , daddy ! '' ), 
  but is only used with family and friends ; * ti amo * , on the other hand , is only ever said to a lover . 
  yeah , but i still think that such an expense is out of reach for most , with or without state subsidies . 
  and i honestly ca n't think of any decent alternative ... 
  i 'm afraid that happened almost 1000 years ago - muslim rule only lasted some 150 years in sicily ( even less in the southernmost tips of the peninsula , which was all they ever got hold of after having tried to conquer the mainland ) and the invaders themselves were totally outnumbered by the locals , before being expelled by the normans . 
  i believe that such a thing has absolutely no impact whatsoever on the italian `` volunteers '' ( but i suspect the term `` traitors '' would be more fitting ) , who are by and large northerners coming from relatively well-off families . 
  by your logic , a good chunk of spain should be a perilous nest of jihadists ready to take over the west ... 
  as pointed out above , l'aquila is mainly an historical city - meaning that a lot of its buildings were built long before modern seismic regulations ; moreover , retrofitting them is too expensive for most families i reckon . 
  some more contemporary edifices , however ( such as the one hosting the casa dello studente ) , were likely made with low-quality material ... but during the postwar building craze little to no attention was paid to such concerns and decent regulations were only passed in a second time - people wanted houses , and builders were eager to satisfy the enormous demand by spending as little as they could . 
  the mafia is n't * necessarily * involved with all this . 
  the results of such unscrupulous work are under the eyes of everybody . 
  the costs of retrofitting this kind of buildings can be prohibitive , too , and i think few families can afford the expense . 
  i know i am four months late ( sorry !, 
  ) , but i just wanted to point out the fact that central italy * definitely * is n't a fucked-up mess ; it 's far , far more like the country 's north ... not quite like it , granted , but close . 
  my country 's national holiday is ** june 2 ** - republic day , that is . 
  we keep celebrating a change in government ( the day in which the monarchy was abolished by a ~ ~ clearly rigged ~ ~ somewhat controversial referendum in 1946 ) when imho we should be celebrating ** march 17 ** instead . 
  and no , i 'm not referring to st. patrick 's but rather , to the proclamation of the kingdom of italy in 1861 . 
  there 's a military parade taking place at via dei fori imperiali , schools are closed and i suspect that 's pretty much it ... 
  i 've taken a look at the article you linked and i do agree with the author ( and with you , of course ) . 
  i must point out , however , that there 's no such thing as `` la dolce vita lifestyle '' as claimed by the woman in the video - there 's no such thing and there 's never been one !, 
  workers here do n't take midday naps or have 3-hours-long lunch breaks . 
  * la dolce vita * is just the title of a film - which is n't even among fellini 's best imho - and nothing more . 
  ** edit ** : the damn android spell-checker wo n't let me write something that makes actual sense . 
  i think the prize would go to ** palmiro togliatti ** , head of the italian communist party during and shortly after ww2 ; a close friend of stalin 's , he purposefully ignored the pleas for the safe return of thousands of pows from the eastern front , hated his own countrymen with a passion and would have gladly turned over large swaths of italy 's north-east to yugoslavia - not to mention the simple fact that he wanted italy to become a satellite of the ussr . 
  a grade-a prick , if you will . 
  bear with me , we 've got another winner : marshall ** pietro badoglio ** . 
  a mediocre commander during ww1 who suddenly found himself appointed viceroy of ethiopia just because he happened to be best buddies with someone powerful at court , and then became the guy in charge of what was left of the country after 1943 . 
  perhaps the king had in mind a close italian equivalent to petain but he was mistaken - badoglio turned out to be ( unsurprisingly ) an incompetent , boisterous babbling baboon . 
  his glorious legacy ? 
  leaving the royal italian army without instructions , to fend off for themselves while the nazis invaded the country 's north and turned against them ... thus becoming a ( now obsolete ) byword for `` traitor '' . 
  then there 's ** silvio berlusconi ** . 
  even his supporters are ashamed of him . 
  i 'm afraid , however , that uncle ben is more divisive than hated so he would n't quite qualify ... 
  * football ; * football ; * football .

  the part about 44 % of the youth not attending school is pure fiction , though - that statistic actually refers to the rate of unemployment among young people . 
  he 's a bit too much , even for us . 
  i 'm pretty sure we 'd hang him the very moment we learn he 's gon na be king ... 
  that 's an urban legend , i 'm afraid - not only there 's no such law , but there are actually buildings ( located in the eur district , if memory serves me well ) which are a bit taller than st. peter 's dome . 
   italy , rome that 's actually a view of vatican city which , incredibly , is not rome ( or even italy , for that matter ) .

  the pretender to the throne of italy is not vittorio emanuele , but his cousin , amedeo di savoia-aosta ; not only was v.e. 
  disinherited by his father ( umberto ii , the last king of italy ) but the * unione monarchica * officially recognises his cousin as the pretender . 
  oh , and apart from being an arsehole , he 's also a murderer and a tax-evader . 
  i dare say we 've got a bit more than just `` two submarines '' ...

  sorry , guys !, 
  typical inner city rome house . 
    italy 2 : that 's just uninspired . 
  looks like a normal house . 
  actually , both seats of the italian parliament were originally built as patrician mansions in the 16th/17th centuries and were requisitioned by the government in 1871 . 
  also , i 've got to say that our chamber of deputies ( palazzo di montecitorio ) looks great - [ even the building 's rear fa\u00e7ade . 
  ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/07/106palazzomontecitorio.jpg ) but yeah , the senate building can be best described as `` disappointing '' . 
  they actually use the same kind of train ... [ and an italian one , at that .

   only brits and germans looking for fun/a quiet retirement/sex/tapas . 
  i thought i had read `` fun , quiet retirement and * sex tapes * '' . 
  now that should make for an interesting vacation ... 
  for once i can be proud of something my government has done !, 
  seriously , i did n't think i 'd have lived long enough to see this day ... 
  besides , our department of national heritage and cultural activities ( that 'd be the * sovrintendenza * ) would n't allow something like that anywhere near my city 's ( rome ) historical centre . 
  `` no no no , that 's a total eyesore !, 
  '' , that 's what they say - and this is * also * why we are stuck with a ridiculous public transit network . 
  actually , the * sovrintendenza * would n't approve of pretty much anything be it tram , trolleybus or metro . 
  if our mayor was to act on every single complain of theirs then we 'd all be commuting via flying carpet ... 
  i 'll tell you what , i do n't even think it 's about god anymore . 
  i suspect most people get their children baptised just because it 's customary to do so and , well , because it is something a lot of people in their families are more or less looking for - especially if they 're older . 
  my grandma threw a fit when she learned that my half-brother was n't going to get baptised anytime soon ( i was , but at my mother 's insistence ) . 
  of course , this is just my personal opinion and should thus be taken with the proverbial grain of salt ... 
  a very large religious community ? 
  in italy ? 
  a good 90 % of us may be ( nominally ) catholic but very few here , apart from our rather servile media and political establishment , actually give a hoot about the church . 
  if anything , your average italian is rather pissed at the vatican because of its nosy attitude towards our internal affairs , because of the ridiculous privileges it to bestows upon its employees ( vat-free petrol , supermarkets , medications and * electronics * for pete 's sake ! ), 
  and because of it owning lots of properties throughout italy without ever having to pay a penny for them . 
  oh , and also because it used to cover up paedophiles and terrorists alike ... 
  my two pence : i think the low rate of internet users can have something to do with the fact that many people in their 40s and 50s - which are still the predominant demographic in our workforce - simply `` do n't trust the internet '' , whatever that means . 
  it is not uncommon for them to shy away from services such as e-banking , e-commerce and the like ... also , i would be inclined to believe that a good chunk of them has never learnt to fully use a computer , simply because they never had to . 
  i 've worked with a lot of these people at the office and i swear that most of them required continuous assistance to do everything that was n't simply punching data into a spreadsheet or surfing the internet for shit and giggles . 
  my theory is that many of that generation have never been truly exposed to the internet and therefore do n't / ca n't see its advantages ( note that is is n't necessarily true of everybody who 's above 45 , though ) .

   owning a car . 
  in most eu countries it is unusual to have your own car until you 're with kids ; before then if you need your car your work will either lease you one or pay you extra for your car expenses . 
  you wo n't use your car too much for personal stuff . 
  i think it depends on the country . 
  i 've been owning a car since i was 18 , and i could n't go to work or bring my children at school without it . 
  children in italy often do celebrate halloween , influenced by american tv series and cartoons . 
  for many of them it 's become the most loved holiday of the year ( source : my children ) , so i think it 'll become mainstream when they grow up and will have children of their own . 
  we get something similar in trieste , italy , when the `` bora '' wind blows : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xm2lkey_voa, 
  must be because of those delicious kobarid \u0161truklji . 
  sorry i 'm not a sport fan and english is n't my first language . 
  indeed , who would expect that soccer is the most popular sport in calcio-obsessed italy !, 
  soccer , basketball , cycling . 
  i 'd just add that private security guards in uniform in italy usually carry their guns openly . 
  if you 're in civilian clothing instead the gun should be concealed . 
  1 ) never had any negative feelings . 
  i 've travelled to the us several times , and i still do n't have negative feelings  2 ) over the years i 've travelled to large cities ( nyc , la , san francisco , philadelphia , washington dc , boston , denver , new orleans , las vegas ) , to small towns ( in pennsylvania and colorado ) , and to natural parks in utah , colorado , and arizona . 
  3 ) i 'm not annoyed at all and , being italian , that something i get a lot when i 'm in the us . 
  i like the fact that people are curious and even proud about their ancestry . 
  4 ) first time in europe ? 
  paris , prague , and venice . 
  and in new mexico . 
  by what some italians who were born and raised in south tyrol told me , they are in a similar situation : they had to learn german at school of course , but they were n't confident enough to hold a conversation in german . 
  the separation between the two ethnicities is real and i think it has served politicians on both sides well , but not the population . 
  i also met some german speaking south tyroleans who went to the university in other italian regions , instead of going to innsbruck or elsewhere in austria , to better learn italian and to get out of a social environment they considered small and asphyxiating . 
  weird , romania is an important destination for italian hunters , do n't romanians hunt ? 
  maybe since there is such a social stigma attached to gun ownership people are n't likely to disclose they have guns . 
  i have exactly the same windows at home . 
  i think they are not pushing as hard as they could : they do n't sell many semiauto rifles , so they have a limited interest in the ban ( the directive never really covered handguns ) . 
  instead , they sell a lot in the usa , to the military , and to law enforcement agencies ( this is especially true for beretta ) . 
  if they want to keep those profitable orders coming , they often need to back restrictions imposed by the government to civilian gun owners . 
  we won a battle , but not the war . 
  we must keep lobbying the meps and sending letters . 
  what saddens me , but does not surprise me , is that the italian government strongly supports these restrictions , but only behind closed doors in bruxelles . 
  they want a restrictive legislation from the eu in order to to tighten the rules here , but they do not want to spend their political capital by proposing anti-gun laws themselves , at the national level . 
  i really hope they go down in flames , along with the eu gun ban . 
  15 - ** venice has no sewer system . 
  ** household waste flows into the canals and is washed out into the adriatic sea twice a day with the tides .

  in others by san nicol\u00f2 ( st. nicholas ) on december 6th . 
  thanks . 
  such as ... ? 
  how would an eu ban affect norway ? 
  at least in italy , governments do n't have enough political capital to introduce a gun ban . 
  the only way to do it would be by saying `` the eu made us do it !, 
  this is exactly why the commission 's plans must be stopped . 
  they are desperate to sell this to the general public as a result of their anti-terrorism efforts . 
  the good thing is that with this proposed directive they managed to breathe life into an [ eu gun lobby ] ( http://www.gunsweek.com/en/events/articles/against-eu-gun-ban-firearms-united-conference-european-parliament ) . 
  proud to be called a lobbyist and proud to donate to our gun rights organization , it 's money well spent . 
  not going to happen . 
  i 'm the 1 % ( italian r1a ) . 
  more than their sample size , i was more impressed by the implication that cretans are not human . 
   the researchers then compared and contrasted the new dna samples with previously reported data from 332 other ancient individuals , 2,614 present-day humans , ** and two present-day cretans . 
  ** i know cretans are a proud lot , but i did n't realize they are considered a completely different species ...

  it looks like i 'm paying that french goat cheese i love twice . 
  also , poland . 
  i do n't know how the author can make such generalizations , some germans apparently like to eat frugally , others do n't . 
  my personal experience in berlin was very different , but i do n't claim it represents the norm . 
  my german friends invited me to a barbecue so rich that i still remember it after many years , and then , the morning after , they offered me a lavish breakfast at the reichstag rooftop restaurant . 
  italy has issues with building mosques too , every proposal is met with protests and controversies . 
  i have no idea of what the age of consent is in my country , so i guess it 'd be just right . 
  vat on sales is cashed in by companies and then transferred to the state , net of vat paid on purchases of goods and services . 
  if i understand correctly , you 're implying that if suddenly there was no vat , a company could still sell its products at the same price , reaping an extra profit of 20 % , instead of turning 20 % of its sales to the state . 
  it 's a good point , i 've never thought about it in these terms . 
  however , many expenses would also be higher , because the vat paid on them would not be deductible anymore . 
  so the net effect on profits would be in any case lower than 20 % . 
  having said that , i still do n't see how an increase in vat could affect company profits , unless you consider the depressive effects on sale volumes , due to the price increase . 
  in this case the firm would end up paying less income tax , which could be detrimental to the state . 
  you do n't get it , vat is n't a cost for companies and it does n't affect their bottom line . 
  it 's not reported in their income statements at all . 
  vat only affects end users , i.e. 
  i see your point , but i think you 're reading too much in my comment . 
  first of all , i 've never mentioned croatian nazis ( my family blames yugoslav communists instead ) , nor did i imply that all croatians were criminals . 
  i do n't see how mentioning an historical event that affected my family directly can perpetuate any `` old-fashioned behavior '' . 
  secondly , i 'm sincerely happy that croatia joins the eu : i live very close , i visit frequently , i 've been vacationing there for 35 years now , i have professional ties in croatia , i believe that eu enlargement will bring stability and other benefits to the area , and possibly economic growth to the part of italy where i live . 
  my point was that this benevolent attitude towards the eu enlargement to croatia is not commonly found among those italians whose families were forced to flee from there after wwii , a considerable portion of today 's population in north-eastern italy . 
  the article never says that mafiosi are macho aristocrats . 
  however , tomasi di lampedusa was definetely an aristocrat , but i would n't call him `` macho '' . 
  poorly researched article indeed . 
  a 3-hour long lunch break , to be precise . 
  the milanese flee the city in droves on weekends . 
  i think that the market for physical travel agencies still exists in italy because of the lower propensity to online purchases , when compared to other eu countries . 
  people who own credit cards and use them for online purchases are still a minority here . 
  i 'm enthusiastic , even if in theory i should n't be , because my family was forced to flee , leaving its houses and fields behind after wwii . 
  but it 's an old story and newer generations need to move forward . 
  we ca n't possibly leave croatia out of the eu , given the fact that we accepted other members that were in a poorer shape than croatia is now . 
  its economy is also almost fully `` euroized '' ( at least bank deposits are ) . 
  i 'd also welcome all the other balkan countries , when they 're ready . 
  i 'm a bit skeptical about albania , but it 's a small country and i think we can afford to take it in , if they want to join . 
  what we can not afford are large , poor countries , such as ukraine , belarus , and turkey . 
  i 've been asking myself this question for years and people just though i was nuts . 
  my realization is that there are a lot of people who do n't follow `` regular '' office hours ( teachers , stay at home wives , police officers , retired persons , etc. ), 
  and the the system suits them well . 
  this is one of the reasons i started using online services extensively in the last decade . 
  what irritates me the most are travel agencies , which where i live ( italy ) are closed on saturdays : what kind of logic makes them think it is a good idea to close a business that deals with spending one 's leisure time on the very day of the week when most office workers are free from work ? 
  i 'm a foot soldier of fiscal conservatism .

  he looks like a baby who put on a wig to look older . 
  it calculates the estimates by subtracting the retirement ages from the life expectancy . 
  so if a country has a life expectancy of 80 years with retirement age at 60 , the estimate would be 20 . 
  edit : forgot to say that it considers the life expectancy at 30 years . 
  oh , works fine to me .

  the president represents all the people , not just those who voted for him , that only happens in a proportional system , and even there it 's not a perfect representation . 
  it 's not like the eu is economically irrelevant , it 's actually a bigger trade partner to the us than china . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/serbian_cross and i 'm not sure how much the us would gain by starting a trade war with the us . 
  well , the region of serbia was once part of the byzantine empire , it 's not like they had nothing to do with each other . 
  i found this [ page ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/serbian_cross ) on wikipedia which goes quite in depth into the history of the serbian cross , but i was n't able to find a decisive answer as to why they adopted it . 
  i will say the same thing . 
  if someone is lawfully elected in a democracy as the head of state , they represents the nation , no matter how crazy or stupid that person may be . 
  let me be clear , i 'm not saying that americans are our enemies because of his actions , but as their president , he represents both those who voted for him and those who did n't , that 's how democracy works for the better or worse . 
  trump is the democratically elected president of the us , and as such he represents the whole nation whether you like it or not . 
   the us and europe are allies not if your government wants to dismantle the eu, 
  brexit was n't caused by trump supporters . 
   not replacing europe 's ethnic population ever again i doubt that 2 million people are going to replace 500 .

  i would n't be surprised if johnson actually believed that . 
  why the hell is the end of the ottoman empire at 1570 ? 
  it lasted until wwi . 
  alright , i see what you mean and i totally agree with that . 
  what i do n't agree with is the idea that kazakhstan is a european country , but you probably did n't mean that , so never mind . 
  but according to that logic france is a south american country . 
  it 's not that our gdp has gone down , but rather that it stayed the same , while the eu average has kept going up . 
   having to cooperate because everybody is scared that germany goes off for yet another killing spree is n't really our fault . 
  i have no idea where you 're getting that fear from . 
  our problems have nothing to do with the euro , they started way before it was even a thing . 
  if we were to abandon the euro our economy would go to shit , even worse than it already is , and the lira would be absolutely worthless . 
  i do n't know , but it 's irrelevant to this discussion . 
  because we are talking about the legally recognised human rights which did not change since their international recognition in 1948 with the [ universal declaration of human rights ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/universal_declaration_of_human_rights#adoption ) . 
  ctrl + f `` change '' = no results regarding changes of the human rights . 
  also , i 'm pretty sure that the office of the high commissioner of the human rights is a better source than wikipedia , but what do i know ? 
   it is utter insanity to do such checks after they 've crossed the border . 
  and where would you do them ? 
  yes because i 'm not very smart and i need you to explain that to me , in detail please .

  by the way , refugees detention centers kinda exist already . 
  lampedusa is one of them for example but most of those who stay there refuse to give their identities and in the end are moved to similar centers in the mainland . 
  but does france care about a handful of refugees enough to leave the eu ? 
  i hope not, 
   letting refugees enter italy , spain you either let them drown or do what italian and spanish government do already . 
  the only way to reach these countries from northern africa is the mediterranean and there 's nothing we can do . 
  the australian solution is impracticable . 
  first of all , there 's barely an unpopulated island in the midst of the mediterranean and chances are that the citizens of lampedusa , linosa , menorca or whatever island is chosen would stage a protest and disagree with this solution . 
  the situation in lampedusa where there 's a detention center ( we can call it europe 's ellis island because most immigrants coming from the shores of northern africa pass from there ) is desperate enough already . 
  as for eu refugee centers in northern africa , you would have these countries to agree and i 'm not sure they will . 
  i think libya is the only country that could , at least gaddafi kinda did . 
  anyway , i think there 's a solution but it 's more difficult than the one presented by right wing parties who do n't care about the issues other than getting votes with promises which can not be kept, 
   part of me wants to just bring back death penalty for these kinds of human scum . 
  but that would mean abandoning our values and descending to their level and it would make him a martyr . 
  life imprisonment in isolation or semi-isolation . 
  that said , [ in somalia they are trying to see how a deradicalization program works ] ( http://library.fundforpeace.org/blog-20160127-terrorism ) on former shabab fighters and it seems there 's a pretty similar rate than the average prisoner has of committing crimes again . 
  [ pakistan and saudi arabia has done it as well ] ( http://www.wsj.com/articles/a-test-case-for-deradicalization-1430944585 ) . 
  do n't know how it would work for someone as high ranked or well thought as choudary though . 
   the saudis have touted their program as having a recidivism rate of just 10 % to 20 % , according to a report on deradicalization written by dr. stern . 
  but one graduate of the saudi program later became a leader of al qaeda in yemen . 
  standards have grown and people want their children to live a life as good as they did , something which they ca n't guarantee . 
  the main problem though seems lack of time to look after these children ( since both parents work ) . 
  i think the gamechanger would actually be policies addressed at offering places where these children can spend their day in the time window before they start going to kindergarten . 
  the situation is starting to improve though , schools offer way more in the afternoon than they did in the past for example and that 's already a step ahead . 
  one last problem is that females fear losing their work after maternity or fear that their children would at least hold back their career, 
   and have ~ ~ mexico ~ ~ african countries pay for them ftfy !, 
  in fact , i think life imprisonment is probably the best solution for this kind of crime , especially if talking of a higher up who shows no remorse regarding his wrongdoings . 
  i think life solitary imprisonment is the best method . 
  maybe , at most , give him an access to similar prisoners once upon a time . 
  it 's similar to what turkey does with ocalan . 
  difference is that there is n't a political party as supportive of him as hdp is so his ideas would remain confined there, 
  what if the wall commits itself to jihad and crumbles on purpose to free a martyr like him ? 
  who do we blame for that ? 
  because it does n't exist anymore in britain and for a good reason . 
  good but that 's not enough time for him . 
  i wonder if a person like that can change so radically to become a valuable member of society again . 
  i think he will most likely keep posing a threat once he 'll be free again, 
  ** italy ** * [ five star movement is first in the polls for the first time since its birth ] ( http://cdn2.scenaripolitici.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/emg1.jpg ) * the usual tv programmes are back . 
  in fact , in italy the main presenters and shows of the tv channels ( whether private like mediaset or state owned like rain ) take a summer break that lasts from the last week of may to the first of september . 
  in summer , all we have are reruns or filler shows . 
  * colder weather has settled in with temps dropping below 10c \u00b0 in the areas affected by the recent earthquake , most of which are sleeping in tents . 
  thunderstorms are expected throughout the southern half of the country * five star movement are facing a crisis in rome due to one of the new mayor 's choices as manager for the city 's environmental problems being investigated . 
  the problem is that whether it would be normal for any party to carry on , it 's against their rules ( anyone investigated of wrongdoing should step down and be kicked out of the party ) but since she was n't elected through the party but chosen by the new mayor and she does n't want to step down , there 's nothing to do about her . 
  also , the new mayor supports her and has lied about her warranty warning but they risk losing face ( and votes ) if they do n't give her support * a famous constitutionalist said he will step down from his job uni professor if the no to the new constitutional reform does n't win, 
  we call them radical chic in italy . 
  it 's basically a socialist bourgeoisie that cares more for identity politics than about what socialist scholars said, 
   swedish politicians they are n't that bad . 
  the only thing that makes me laugh in despair is that there 's actually a party called feminist initiative that has 3 % of the votes . 
  it seems weird to read about getting to an airport through boat . 
  it has quite a james bond-esque feeling to it, 
  exactly . 
  i can understand it in the usa where there are still problems to put equality in practice but not the uk where even if there are problems , they do n't run nearly as deep and are n't about to it seems that the whole protest was n't exclusively for this issue but about things like climate change , immigration policy , ecc . 
  that said , were i an uk citizen , i would see it disturbing to see any kind of divisive politics whether they come for the right ( ukip ) or left ( blm ) . 
  right wing parties do identitary politics as well . 
  their voters just do n't seem to realize it . 
  for example , campaigning for the white working class as several populist parties do is identitary politics, 
  i can understand why there 's a black lives matter in the usa but i do n't understand the need for it in the uk, 
  i knew we could rely on japan or else we would n't have been allies through hard times , 
  yeah i think that for this reason i heard it called a sleeping fault or something akin to it, 
  yep  funny we have to thank a neapolitan queen for them though, 
  they did n't do the math at the time . 
  there was a fault near mirandola scientists had yet to discover and which forced them to upgrade the area to 2/3 after the earthquakes happened, 
  we have to cross our fingers that it 's handled as well as friuli 1976 or even emilia 2012 and not like irpinia 1980 and l'aquila 2009, 
  i 'm curious to know what happened afterwards . 
  did they get a new home built for them ? 
  did they have to move ? 
  earthquake of this strenght are a concern elsewhere too . 
  [ a 5,1 earthquake in lorca ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_lorca_earthquake ) , spain did quite a bit of damage for its strenght having caused the death of 9 people, 
  it was n't as much the earthquake as the tsunami after that that did so much more damage, 
  if we ever get a unified europe , bidets should be made compulsory . 
  i swear they are the best thing the french have ever invented, 
  no names released yet, 
  ok , i get it . 
  fixed, 
  in the meanwhile , prime minister renzi has just came up with an official declaration :  pulling people out of the rubble is difficult , but you can see how good civil protection workers have been . 
  the work is carrying on and our priority is get people out of the rubble . 
    in the afternoon i will visit the area and i will be involved with meetings with the authorities concerned : the head of the department for civil protection , and the minister for infrastructures and a great number of others . 
    at moments of difficulty italy knows how to cope . 
  and when things do n't go well , the whole of italy demonstrates its most beautiful aspects . 
  from now on we will make sure that we wo n't leave any families or communes on their own . 
  and he will really work , because in the next few hours we can save human lives from the rubble and give hope to those territories that have been so badly affected . 
  i guess so . 
  it is n't as popular here ( aside from honeymoons and winter holidays ) but it seems to be big in central/northern europe . 
  if the whole arab spring did n't affect egypt it probably would n't benearly as popular though, 
  example : lioni [ before ] ( http://www.storiadilioni.it/gallerie%20fotografiche%20vecchio%20sito/foto%20terremoto/chiesamadre.jpg ) and [ after ] ( http://www.comune.lioni.av.it/c064044/images/slide/oggi/parrocchia-santa-maria-assunta.jpg ) , 
  it seemed strange that a serbian would know so much about italian newspapers ahahah anyway , english tend to take daily mail and the sun much more seriously than we do dagospia , chi or novella 2000 . 
  that 's the problem . 
  gossip papers tend to talk about politics there . 
   england has more freedom of speech and every `` journal '' can write what they want without the clusterfuck drama as it happens in italy after every il fatto quotidiano headline .

  the next supreme leader is guaranteed to be more moderate because the reformists have gained a foothold in the council of imams as well . 
   wrong , iran is quite more ideologic than saudi who has acepted free market , international order and the existance of israel [ yeah , sure ... ... ... ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/26/world/middleeast/saudi-arabia-islam.html?_r=0 )  keep opposing the iranian islamic republic and try to encourage a transition to a democracy which could be a reliable partner , using both the carrot ( cooperation if they behave well and elect `` moderates '' ) and the stick ( isolating it from it 's allies , defend iraqi sovereignity , fund and help the opposition ) as for gulf countries i would cut cooperation with qatar who in fact does support aq , just keep things steady with saudi and try to make the uae a success story of `` freedom '' in the middle east . 
  i agree with your view of uae and , i would add , oman and jordan , but i would cut cooperation with both qatar and kuwait ( which is one of extremist group 's main funding sources as well ) , support the government in bahrain against the shi'a in exchange of democratic concessions and try to play the iran-saudi rivalry by switching between one and the other ( or at least threatening to do so ) keeping them both in check and pushing them towards modernization ( for example the nuclear deal has given a great boost to reformists in iran ) . 
  i do n't think we should halt relationships with saudi but i think we should give them a scare and loosen up the ties with them . 
  the difference between the groups that are financed by the house of saud and the ones financed by the iranian government is that the former has tried to spread a single ideology as a means to gain a foothold amongst the muslim population and that that ideology tends to be one of the west 's main threat at the moment while iran just funds whoever is willing to support them politically . 
  at the moment , the house of saud and the ideology it is so hell bent on spreading are more of a threat to the west than iran is at the moment . 
   there 's 15k of those , you 're just basically saying `` rich people with saudi citizenship '' it is quite large . 
  that does n't mean that every wealthy saudi citizen is part of the house of saud . 
  given that you are opposing me ( you should read my response above to understand what the west should do in the middle east ) so heavily , what would you do in the middle east ? 
  keep supporting gulf countries and saudi arabia ? 
  syriza have disappointed . 
  i 'll give you that but they are still far and away an improvement over new democracy in terms of actual corruption ( still more than was expected but not nearly as much as any other party from pasok to golden dawn ) and foreign policy . 
  tsipras is at least being vocal about changing the eu as a whole while new democracy would just follow the diktat of the rest of the center right parties . 
  they would n't . 
  they called for and tried to implement austerity in the first place . 
  either way , the greeks have to choose between different shades of austerity : tsipras will press and will always choose for the lower amount , that might make recovery slower but it will also ensure not as many people are damaged by the economical reforms slowly being put into place . 
  that does n't mean we should drop the house of saud completely . 
  we should just leverage them to start reforms . 
  if i had my way , i would n't choose a horse but just flip flop between iran and saudi arabia playing them and trying to get both countries to modernize . 
  for example , if the sanctions against iran have worked to replace the principlists with the reformists , why would n't similar threats push the house of saud to scrap wahhabism and reform much like the hashemite and the alaouite dynasties in jordan and morocco ? 
  that was a standalone attack . 
  aside from that , hezbollah has moved more and more towards being an arab nationalist party rather than an islamist one , especially ever since the moderate wing of the party is in charge . 
  aside from that , iran funds hezbollah and pmu ( which are shia , christian and sunni and not sectarian ) which are no threat to the west while saudi arabia funds hamas , al qaeda , is ( they did fund them at the beginning and members of the house of saud had close ties to them until pretty late into 2014 ) and other terrorist groups all over the middle east, 
  we just do it fine . 
  it 's in usa 's interest to keep a good relationship with our countries especially now that european countries are starting to bring up the idea of a eu military and now that russia is becoming a threat again . 
  sanctions worked when ahmadihnejad was in charge , they are slowly becoming useless now ... ... . . 
   so instead of having to send in american troops into syria to resolve that shitshow and get men killed in the process , we just get the natives to do it for us . 
  resulting in the strenghtening of terrorist forces who commit genocide on minorities and try to export their brand of terrorism to nearby countries and europe destabilizing the whole area . 
  iran is logically the best option . 
  saudi arabia is good only for shady deals , handouts and natural resources . 
  cabbies should just be phased out altogether . 
  $ 8 for 2 kms of drive is ridiculous . 
  we should just generally improve public transport instead and make it possible for uber to operate while placing taxes on them as a company and on their drivers . 
  as it is now , for a broke student , a taxi is a last resort solution when it 's the middle of the night , i 'm drunk and there 's no active public transport but the prices that are charged by them mean that i 'm more often than not tempted to walk home rather than call one, 
  it 's not like new democracy is going to do any better . 
  they will push even more austerity down the throats of greek people , they are the austerity party . 
  five years of them means that kke and the more left wing factions within syriza will become only stronger, 
  that 's sad ... ... tsipras has been one of the few leaders that 's worked actively with italy in the last few months to lift austerity or find a solution to the immigration problem . 
  new democracy will probably bring another right wing isolationism pro-germany government ( kinda like rajoy in spain ) instead of one that fights to find a solution, 
  it really is n't and it is n't like this 10-15 % is all made up of suiciders , just extremely conservative persons whose views are incompatible with western ones, 
  it 's the opposite , the right uses terrorist attacks and is happy about them because it helps them scare people , divide them further and push its agenda more and more . 
  that 's the far right for you . 
  they convince working class people they are on their side attacking whatever scapegoat is popular while actually doing nothing of note to improve the working class ' position, 
  it was an example ... ... ... 
  i am the first to be against nationalism and these parties . 
  i 'm scared by them having the chance to govern western european countries in some ways but i think the current approach of calling them names is pushing even more people towards them . 
  we must expose the far right in its hypocrisy and not just shout `` alt right !, 
  covert fascist ! '', 
   lol , funny how the far right desperately tries to rebrand themselves . 
  seriously , fuck that . 
  let 's just call them fascists , nor neo-fascists . 
  that 's what they really are , no matter how often their followers deny it and want to shout down everyone that calls them outl a few of these parties have distanced themselves enough from what they used to be, 
  we also get the `` if we legalize marijuana , hard drugs will slowly be legitimized and their use will increase '' excuse, 
  yep . 
  where i live , tomatoes are the worst but grapes and wine are soon behind . 
  grain and olive oil harvest do n't tend to be as heavy though when it comes to working conditions ( still pretty horrible ) , especially the former because it generally does n't require as much workforce because it is done more and more with specific machines eliminating the need for extremely cheap imported workers, 
  none of my post supported the far right . 
  i 'm just saying they should be addressed differently than they currently are, 
   yet unable to take any any serious effort to protect ourselves because of political correctness is one other reaction they 'd love for us to have . 
  what political correctness ? 
  we do n't take full action because saudi arabia and gulf countries are the ones funding radicalism and are at the same time one of our main allies in the middle east . 
  i guess they regret not being part of ukraine now, 
  something like 10-15 % can be considered radical here in italy so that would explain your viewpoint but then again who 's to say those polls are reliable or representative of dutch muslims . 
  if 40 % were radicals they would have funded an islamist or at the very least conservative party who would poll at 2-3 % already , yet there is n't one . 
  in belgium , there 's an [ islamist party ] ( https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/islam_\\ ( parti_politique_belge \\ ) ) ever since 2010 , yet the highest vote they got is 4 % in molenbeek ( it had to be there , of course ) in 2012 communal elections and they recently only got 0,2 % in brussels elections . 
   people can be patriotic and have love for their home country without being nationalistic . 
  that 's pretty much what i said so no need to argue with me . 
  this is how any left wing party should tackle the `` far right '' . 
  the far right support is with the working-middle class but this same far right is often just nationalistic and does n't care for welfare state . 
  that 's their weak point . 
  they seem more moderate in their claims than pretty much any other party of that kind but then again it might be because sweden 's politics do n't lend themselves to extreme claims, 
  when did she say that ? 
  it seems to me that she tries to portray herself as a defender of secularism but then again , doing one thing and saying another is a classic of populists, 
  why should terrorist attacks matter ? 
  we have had them for decades . 
  their goal is to make us changeand be hostile towards immigrants so that they can have an easier time to radicalize them . 
  then we 'll move to sweden and start being in public with you, 
  here , it 's the entirety of the italian left and parts of five star movement and democratic party which are the two largest parties in parliament . 
  it should pass but it does n't because these two parties ca n't agree on the whole matter ( especially the democratic party ), 
  i would argue it 's much more subtle now than it was back then but the same process is happening, 
   so ceta and ttp are fine but chinese access to `` free markets '' is n't ? 
  because chinese does n't allow us to access their `` free '' market . 
  foreign companies or individuals ca n't own more than 49,9 % of chinese companies and therefore it means that it 's all a one way street to china . 
  it has n't for the most part . 
  we must hijack the ones who make the things integration harder ( funding of radical mosques , intervention of governments in their diaspora 's matters , ghettoization , ecc . ), 
  and fix bugs but for the most part it 's going pretty well . 
  despite all the flak brussels has taken with its 25 % muslim population , an islamist party ( although i would argue it should n't exist at all but this is the same city where there are places like molenbeek ) tried running in the municipal elections and has gotten 0,2 % of votes . 
  that means that they represent 0,8 % of brussels ' muslims . 
  well , that pot wo n't go wasted if someone is there , right ? 
  we love marijuana here . 
  31 % of italians above 15 have smoked marijuana in the last year and yet they still ca n't legalize because of the freaking catholic church . 
  there 's a proposal in parliament which makes it possible for over 18 to carry up to 5 grams outside of home and up to 15 grams at home as well as making it possible to cultivate up to 5 plants but the upper chamber keeps blocking it . 
  the good thing is that the lower chamber has approved it, 
   it 's also interesting that you 'd consider it 's conservative to not promote minority languages `` enough '' . 
  would n't regionalism be very conservative ? 
  regionalism is n't conservative . 
  it can be anything but it kinda depends which shape it takes . 
  sardinian regionalism is almost exclusively left wing , vallee d'aoste centrist , sudtirol mostly centrist , veneto right wing , ecc . 
  221 out of 630 in the lower chamber in italy and 73 out of 315 in the uppen chamber . 
  with the new constitutional law , it would be much easier for soft drugs to be decriminalized as the upper chamber would cease existing .

  it 's not our fault that we 're doing better than you . 
  it 's your fault for not doing as good as us . 
  and really , people like you put a bad name for all the hard working good people in the south . 
  but let 's face it . 
  the south and north are different . 
  neither is better-they 're just different . 
  like germany and spain or austria and greece . 
   the unification was basically an annexation of the reign of the two sicilies by the savoia are you kidding me ? 
  the unification of italy was basically an annexation of everything by the savoia . 
  every part of italy was united with invasion force or rebellions . 
  italy was united by invasion troops . 
  garibaldi and his 1000 man took down the reign of two sicilies and won at volturno ? 
  please . 
  the people supported and joined them . 
  as i said since the fall of rome the south has been weaker than the north . 
  maybe it 's the germanic influence , who knows ? 
  the stronger city states , the stronger economy , the * everything * was in the north . 
  a railway means nothing . 
  by 1861 the north had 1900 km of railway compared to the 100 km of the south . 
  saying the south was anywhere near the north in development is outright stupid . 
  i 'm not being prejudiced . 
  i 'm checking the facts . 
  is the north more developed ? 
  yeah . 
  is there more corruption and mafia in the south ? 
  yeah . 
  and you know what all i 'm saying is ? 
  i 'm not saying southerners are stupid or lazy . 
  i 'm not generalizing at all . 
  i 'm saying : stop blaming other people for your own fails . 
  you ca n't simply talk about how the north forgot the south and all that bullshit . 
  but i guess this * is * the actual biggest difference between northern and southern italy . 
  some of us are willing to take responsibility for their actions and move forward instead of blaming someone else for it . 
  i 'll go further and say it is complaining people like you that are ruining the south . 
  of all the hard working good people there , it 's people like yourself that will give a bad name for the entire part of the country . 
  italy has forgotten it 's lower half ? 
  please , since the roman empire fell , the lower part has always been `` forgotten '' . 
  it 's always someone else 's fault and one has to wonder why emilia-romagna never has the problems campania does . 
  the south has been invested into since the unification , and yet it 's always falling behind . 
  when i hear these news are from naples all i can think about is how about 50 % of the money for `` salaries '' is in someone 's pocket . 
  otherwise it would mean that people in charge are complete morons . 
  if a business is so unprofitable it 's obviously time to lay people off . 
  too much staff for a too small of a job . 
  either that or someone is slacking at the workplace and not being productive which i would n't be surprised of either . 
  fail . 
  i actually do n't understand why the stadiums are so small . 
  most seem to have a 40-50 000 capacity . 
  one at 70 000 and one at 80 000 . 
  seems too small . 
  yeah , it is also proven that learning a new language or playing chess increase your iq . 
  the eastern bloc is getting better at everything recently . 
  you know why ? 
  because they had very little progress compared to the west for 50 years . 
  so they 're catching up . 
  it is n't a fair place , i agree with you . 
  but i do n't see not teaching math as a huge deal . 
  what is the point of making someone who hates math study math ? 
  the only possible benefit to doing that is that your country will score high on iq tests . 
  i do n't think creepy is the exact word i 'd use . 
  scary would be more like it . 
  besides with the spinlessness the west has shown i wo n't be surprised if they proceed to take all of ukraine . 
  this pisa thing together with iq tests is pretty much ... bullshit . 
  1 ) both would appear to be based on maths . 
  therefore a country that makes it students study more math is gon na score higher . 
  in europe ( well , italy because i do n't know about the rest ) most students have a choice of what to study . 
  we have linguistic schools , culture schools , schools for arts and math schools . 
  so the students in most schools do n't give a shit about maths . 
  meanwhile in china for example they study maths like crazy . 
  from what i know the rules are such that even if you go to law school you still study maths ( which i find stupid but that 's another discussion ) . 
  meanwhile , african countries do n't even have * any * fair education so their students can be on par with the others . 
  this is a completely unfair criteria-of course countries and places that concentrate more on math will score higher . 
  2 ) who does those tests ? 
  the sample , just like in most studies and surveys is incredibly small . 
  too small to make a statistic for a whole country . 
  how is it creepy that a guy from an army has the same gear as another guy from the same army ? 
  why is it even creepy that the same army may deploy the same soldier to different places ( pretty sure it 's a different guy though ) ? 
  he does n't control the russians living outside of russia . 
  other than that i personally see nothing wrong with this quote . 
  there is no such things as ethics . 
  ethics is a man-made concept that changes very rapidly and very often . 
  economy is in the basis of species existing , humans have just taken it to the next level . 
  animals have a type of cooperation to survive . 
  wolves eat the week deer . 
  the deer population keeps he fit genes , and there are as many deer as the nature can feed . 
  and wolves have full bellies . 
  even in a preadator-pray condition it 's still economy . 
  and you see this is the kind of thing that bothers me with taxes . 
  for example , italy gives money to the vatican . 
  and religious people are probably happy about it . 
  just like italy gives money to immigrants and people like yourself are happy about it . 
  i , on the other hand , would not like to pay for neither of these things . 
  the state is not a leech that sucks your earning and that is why i spoke of rousseau . 
  the basic of his work has started before ancient egypt and has stayed unchanged until today . 
  the idea of a state is that . 
  ** the citizen gives part his personal freedom and part of his wealth in exchange for the protection of his life and favors the state produces for the money ** . 
  basically . 
  if we ignore the freedom/protection part ( which is important but irrelevant to our discussion ) you get money for services . 
  now as i pay taxes , i expect that the government to create and keep infrastructure , health care , sustain an army and so on and so forward . 
  therefore i pay for services . 
  that is why it is a social contract-just like the contract you have with a person who sells you something-you give the money and he the favor .

   addendum : in fact , someone who is from alto adige is called * altoatesino * in italian . 
  i know . 
  i always found the word incredibly ugly sounding beside i usually use sud tirolesi per rispetto to local sensibilities and my ear ones . 
  and i never found a person that did n't understand that i was talking about altoatesini . 
    i just said that italians are not used to say them separately   because they refer to the * region * . 
  trentino is * not * the region . 
  oh really ? 
  i belive you have missed my point i never said that torbole is not in trentino , i just said that describing were a city or in this case a town people here would more likely place them by region hence why op wrote trentino-s.t. 
  and not just trentino .

  i am perfectly aware that a.a. / s t. is the province and that trentino a.a. / s.t. 
  is the region thank you very much . 
  i just said that italians are not used to say them separately unless talking about something specific . 
  we see our country divided first and foremost in regions from our point of wiew the fact that the two are autonomous provinces is secondary to the fact that they belong to a region with special status . 
  so frankly i fail to see where the misconception lies frankly . 
  i love read from which country the cars are while walking in front of them while they are parked .

  i dunno , all jars i see here in italy are produced in piedmont and taste the same , but maybe ferrero has a plant outside italy and they use different ingredients or something ? 
  i have no idea .

  poland being mentioned in the italian anthem ( written in 1847 , in the middle of the unification of italy ) :  * gi\u00e0 l'aquila d'austria le penne ha perdute . 
  *  the austrian eagle has already lost its plumes . 
  the blood of italy and the polish blood it drank , along with the cossack , but it burned its heart . 
  it 's referencing the fact that both countries were struggling for independence from the austrian empire - and , in poland 's case , from russia ( `` the cossack '' ) . 
  *  march , march , d\u0105browski , from the italian land to poland . 
  under your command we shall rejoin the nation . 
  the polish anthem was written in 1797 by a polish soldier ( the d\u0105browski mentioned in the stanza above ) of the polish legion led by napoleon during the italian campaign of the french revolutionary wars . 
  the guy wrote the anthem while in italy , and he mentions it when talking about going back to poland to fight and unite the country , at the time divided between russia and austria . 
  i know . 
  what i was wondering is , is there some kind of relation between the words `` night '' and `` eight '' that explains their similar sounds in most indo-european languages ? 
  is there a reason for this ? 
  or is it just a cool coincidence ? 
  and italy is mentioned in the polish anthem !, 
  as far as i know there are at least two sammarinese redditors lurking on / r/polandball ; it would be cool if they could provide some inside .

  1.620 , in downtown padova . 
  heh , almost . 
  :p but honestly , the prices have somewhat winded down in the past few months : now a liter of petrol is 1.6-1 .7 $ , but it used to be 1.8-1 .9 $ this spring , and last year in some places it went over 2 $ . 
  it can be quite crazy ( and annoying ) , but it does have some positive aspects , if it leads people to use their cars a bit less . 
  yeah , and the same goes for automated gas stations . 
  a pain in the ass when you have to fill your moped , when it does n't hold 10 $ worth of petrol . 
  actually , the sex-with-minor part of the trial is the least important , despite being the most talked about . 
  the real scandal of the `` rubygate '' is berlusconi 's malfeasance , having used his position of authority ( he was prime minister at the time ) and a whole deal of blatant lies ( `` the girl is mubarak 's niece , we 're risking an international scandal '' ) to make the police agents do what he wanted ( namely , securing ruby - who was in police custody - to one of his `` girls '' , who of course was in no position to do such a thing ) . 
  either way you 're right , it 's * paying * for sex with a minor that got him into trouble . 
  piazza dei miracoli - which is basically what 99 % of tourists limit themselves to in pisa - seriously feels like something artificial like a park attraction ; the monuments are beautiful , but the setting around them is eery in its ` tourist-trappiness ' . 
  the only things i would dry up by hand right after washing are glasses from the `` good set '' ~ ~ you ~ ~ your grandmother would put in display in her glass cupboard in the dining room . 
  in order to avoid spots . 
  or if you need a glass/dish right away . 
  for anything else , the dish-drying cupboard someone else mentioned is a gift from heaven . 
  dude , it 's zucchini flowers we 're talking about here !, 
  their flavour has nothing to do with that of zucchini ( trust me , i 'm no zucchini fan either ) , and deep fried zucchini flowers are nothing short of awesome ... give them a try !, 
  french is a romance language as well , though . 
  he 's a troll , do n't bother . 
  do you have good articles on the matter i can document on ? 
  i was too young at the time and ca n't remember . 
  that could be argued about all of them ; hell , just saying , monti was his direct opponent only 6 months ago . 
  that said , i trust ( and napolitano does as well , or else he would n't have appointed them ) their neutrality : they 're perfectly aware of the position they 're in and they know it mostly has a symbolical role . 
  edit : tl ; dr - if i were berlusconi i would be worried about more pressing matters , but we all know he 's putting up his usual ` teatrino ' . 
  yes , they can . 
  but for obvious reasons they usually choose not to , especially on touchy matters . 
  also they ca n't be more than five ( out of 317 senators , and not counting ex presidents of the republic who , after their mandate , are senators for life * de jure * ) , so it 's not like they can have such a huge impact - assuming they would vote the same , that is . 
  by the way , that 's exactly what berlusconi is assuming and worrying about , because he believes the 4 new senators are all left-leaning , when the truth is none of them has existing political links . 
  not quite . 
  assuming the knighthood you 're talking of is akin to the order of the british empire , its direct italian equivalent is the [ order of merit of the italian republic ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/order_of_merit_of_the_italian_republic ) - both knighthoods grant no political role , and there 's no limit to the number of knights appointed . 
  on the other hand senators for life are full-on members of the senate and have the same rights of a ` regular ' , elected senator ; * de facto * , though , they only take part to the vote in special occasions . 
  also , there can be a maximum of 5 senators for life at a time , but you 'll find more on that [ here ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/senator_for_life#italy ) . 
  they were appointed `` senators for life '' for their merits in the fields of art and science by the president of the republic ( just like the late levi montalcini ) ; it 's a honorary position , on paper they can vote in the senate but they usually choose to keep a low profile and only take part in special votations and such . 
  exactly . 
  someone above was talking about the alleged `` southern lifestyle '' as being a pr move : it is , but here 's the catch - we 're not the ones ` promoting ' it , it 's the rest of the world who , for some reason , likes to believe it 's the norm . 
  case in point : you ca n't find a guardian article about italy where ` la dolce vita ' is n't randomly mentioned , basically every american movie set in italy is a pasta/pizza/mandolino stereotype-fest , and many tourists are actually disappointed when they discover that no , we do n't spend our days in the countryside making olive oil and enjoying life , but live in sometimes gloomy cities trying to make ends meet . 
  tourists simply get sold what they want to see ( 100 $ for a short gondola ride in venice , lolwut ) - if they wanted to see real 2013 italy , they would only have to get rid of their romanticized view of the country . 
   this is not applicable to paper , trees being a renewable resource . 
  yes and no . 
  it depends on the quantity that gets cut down and then replaced in regards to a certain tree growth rate . 
  let 's say you have a forest of 1000 trees and you cut down 10 of them every day , while replacing them with young ones . 
  this means that after 100 days your supply has ( momentarily ) ended - unless the 10 trees that were replanted first are now big enough to be cut down again ( they 're not ) . 
  think in years instead of days and yes , your forest can be considered a renewable resource . 
  so in the end it all depends on the sustainability of this process - as far as i know , not many countries respect it . 
  ~ ~ man , i love ` the line ' - it 's incredible how you can make a funny sketch that also makes sense by using only a line . ~ ~ ~ ~ it 's also impressive how he never fossilized on a particular drawing style and keeps changing it . ~ ~ edit : nope , apparently the line was created by the late osvaldo cavandoli .

   citt\u00e1 del vaticano it 's * citt\u00e0 del vaticano * with a grave accent and not an acute one , but i 'm nitpicking . 
  yeah , it 's portogallo in italian - i did n't know we were the only ones to change it , though . 
  til . 
  no , but they never miss the chance to randomly mention berlusconi , which is just as annoying . 
  and honestly , it 's been a while since i last saw hitler being mentioned when talking about germany in * serious * news articles - comments of trolls notwithstanding . 
   further evidence the number is bullshit : central pisa has only 88k residents , with 200k in the metro area . 
  the thing is , you 're assuming only people from the province of pisa are applying ; florence , siena and lucca are all a hour away by car , and commuting to these extents is certainly not uncommon around here . 
  moreover , it 's not unlikely people outside tuscany are willing to move there for working reasons - some time ago there 'd been a similar situation for a certain number of nursing positions in a big city like rome or milan , and applicants had come from everywhere in italy . 
  if i find a source in english i 'll post it . 
  i reciprocate by having 9 german coins out of the 15 in my wallet ; the others are italian ( 3 ) , french ( 1 ) , spanish ( 1 ) and finnish ( 1 ) . 
  oh , and a random polish zloty . 
  do you still have the banknote with the pink/purple see-through patches ? 
  i completely agree , but i think liaisons_dangereuses 's point was that other nations are n't in the position to be patronizing towards us like they 've been in the past few days . 
  to put things in perspective , [ here ] ( http://geocurrents.info/cultural-geography/the-rapid-rise-of-the-xenophobic-right-in-contemporary-europe ) 's a recent article where the rise and size of the xenophobic right in europe is discussed . 
  and seeing the numbers mentioned , i really do n't see how italy is more racist than most european countries . 
  of course , xenophobia is not exclusive to the right and simply looking at the votes the right receives ( without taking into consideration the differences among these parties , for starters ) can only lead to a limited vision of the current situation , but i believe it can still be a starting point . 
  edit : dear downvoters , i 'm more than happy to discuss this . 
  do n't be shy and bring up your reasons . 
  again , the perpetrator is allegedly a member of a far-right xenophobic and fascist party , forza nuova , which never got more than 0,5 % of votes and never managed to get any seats in the parliament . 
  representatives of all other parties , including the anti-immigration lega nord , condemned the gesture . 
  so no , i would n't really judge 60 million people from the dumb gesture of a single idiot . 
  this does n't mean there are no racist italians whatsoever , of course - but i believe it 's a phenomenon whose size is comparable to that of other european countries .

  italian politics is like a trash bin that has never been emptied . 
  shit stays there for centuries ( and i mean it ), 
  jesus christ berlusconi will damage us even after his death, 
  i do n't understand the part about goverment interference . 
  that thing stood there for 3k years and it lost all its significance at least 2k years ago . 
  at one point it simply was n't considered important anymore . 
  preservation of cultural heritage is something pretty new . 
  up until the beginning of the 20th century , or maybe the 50/60s , the idea that that stuff had a value was not widespread . 
  a lot of [ these ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nuraghe ) were torn down during the centuries , to reuse their stones to make drystone walls . 
  now they are derelict , eaten by the bushes , and i literally mean eaten , me and my dad found those two tombe dei giganti because we were searching for my dog that was running around , a lot of people do n't know they are there , and of those who know some do n't care and most of those who care know it 's unlikely money will ever be spent to do something about it , because hey , we find it hard to get the money to mantain the best and more important artwork in the country ( think of pompei ) , it 's hard we 'll ever be able to do something about smaller stuff . 
  so stuff stood there for millennia and will ( hopefully ) stood there for some other time . 
  damn shame . 
  italy is full of non-mapped prehistoric sites . 
  in sardegna me and my dad stumbled upon at least 2 `` tombe dei giganti '' that are n't in any book ( and half my family being sardinian we own a lot of them about the subject ) , half torn down and full of bushes , hard to reach , but they are there . 
  the locals know about them , ( at least , my very old granpa knew about it ) but it 's some 3k-4k y old shit that is n't studied , mapped or protected . 
  in puglia there 's a lot of rock sites where ancient christians hid themselves from persecution . 
  they made churches in caves , painted the walls and it 's something exceptional , but a whole lot of them are inside private property and for centuries they have being used as storage room to keep hay or rabbits or stuff . 
  unmapped , unlisted , unprotected . 
  there 's a lot of stuff and we lack both the money and the will to protect and valorize it all . 
  shame on us . 
  automation without redistribution of wealth not so much, 
  friggitrioria carega in genova has the best fried stuff in the universe,

  without the rule of law we would be the philippines . 
  thanks but no thanks . 
  of course we are n't ruled , but if you know where and what to look at you see it . 
  it 's what makes us a civil place . 
  of course milano has mafia problems , where there 's money there 's mafia and milano is full of money . 
  bayern , switzerland and netherlands all have mafia problems , they simply are n't aware of it or willing of dealing with them, 
  with the train via france to torino to milano and then sesto san giovanni ( big town of 100k + inhabitants bordering milano ) . 
  probably, 
  pffff,

  wiki :  terrorism is , in its broadest sense , the use of intentionally indiscriminate violence ( terror or fear ) in order to achieve a political , religious , or ideological aim . 
  a man resisting an arrest , even if he is a terrorist , is not terrorism . 
  it 's blurrier in the second case , but italian newspapers claim he did it as a `` revenge '' on the state for money questions . 
  personal , not ideological . 
  learn definitions , dumbass . 
  yep . 
  ca n't wait for full automatization, 
  how is resisting an arrest a terrorirst attack ? 
  how is an italian enterpreneur trying to get a revenge on the state ( not killing people to get a political reaction ) terrorism ? 
  how are those terrorist attack ? 
  sources ?

  if you are worried about your gun industry and a possible war enlarge your army and have them use czech weapons .

  then vote someone else and change those laws . 
  owning guns should not be a right , it sould be a privilege granted to few and as heavily regulated as possibile . 
  the only purpose of a gun is to kill . 
  i do n't like it , i do n't want it anywhere near me , if the guy i voted for tries to ban it he has my blessing and likely secured my vote next time . 
  yeah maybe you do n't have the 3 biggest crime organisations in the west making buisness on your country and smuggling guns an ' shit from the other side of the adriatic where 20 years ago they had the last european war , have you not ? 
  i do n't want people to own weapons outside hunting stuff . 
  i 'll vote against whoever might have the dumb idea to change our laws on the matter, 
  that is an uninformed opinion . 
  we never had a terrorist attack in the last 15 years . 
  we have more police than any other eu country i think , it would be their job to sedate any riots ( and i do n't remember anything big enough not to be shrug off easily ) not of the avg dumbass with a beretta . 
  there is no proof more weapons would bring down crime ( quite the opposite ) and there is no need to . 
  the usa have 5-6 times our rate of homicides , and we are on basically on par or better off on that matter with almost any other european country . 
  i hope this bullshit stays as far away as possible from us .

  7 villas there , and spent his vacations there .

  st is 500k people , the mother tongue of at least 100k of them is italian . 
  the rest of the country is 60m people . 
  he had to state his intentions about the new government and to report about what he and the president of the italian republic mattarella spoke about . 
  this concerns 60m people . 
  by far most of this people do not speak german . 
  st/aa is italian since 1919 . 
  they speak italian . 
  there was no point in speaking german in that occasion . 
  he did it , it 's a free country so of course he is free to do so , and i 'm free to say it was a moronic choice . 
  and about speaking french , once again , it 's a hundred years st/aa is italian , and 20 % of its population mothertongue is italian . 
  i seriously doubt we could do more to have them keep their culture . 
  i mean , they wanted separated schools for italians and germans , they have them , they wanted ethnic/language quotas for every public stuff , they have them , they are flooded by public money , what more ? 
  the dumb fuck with that sweater belongs to casa pound . 
  they are fascists . 
  they are not representative of the entire country . 
  he spoke german to an italian public after being asked about italian affairs while in rome . 
  he is dumb as shit . 
  by the way cruciani would insult even his grandmother , you really picked the wrong guy, 
  the truth that your country smuggled explosives and weapons used by terrorists to kill italian soldiers/policeman , took in said terrorists and refused extradiction ? 
  that st/aa is enjoying a number of economic privileges and political autonomies no other region in europe has , and that it 's the last place left in europe where ethnic discrimination is legal ? 
  that they mastered the italian art of `` chiagni e fotti '' to a level that shames the rest of the country ? 
  i 'm not referring to the referendum at all . 
  and i voted yes , by the way, 
  you know we are net contribuents to the eu budget , right ? 
  anyhow we have a totally different mindset and view on this matter . 
  dude you have no fucking clue what you are talking about , and it 's not about wether i believe in keynes or in santa claus , it 's about the fact that italian politics is complex ( way more than american politics , if you believe kissinger ) and not easily ascrivable to that of other western countries , let aside eastern european ones , and it 's about your assertions on pd . 
  it 's not a socialist party simply because it is n't , period . 
  it 's a huge party son of a lot of partyes , whose members come from very diffetent backgrounds .

  hey france , if you want to be a free country too , you should get rid of your stupid labour protection laws and stop wasting money into schools , healthcare , and pensions .

  there will be great architecture , installations and performances , but being a world exhibition centered on nutrition , the real selling point for me is food , and the chance to try and discover proper regional food from around the world ( even strange stuff : fugu , crocodiles , insects ) thinking about that , i 'm very sorry that scandinavian countries wo n't be there , because there 's a thriving modern cuisine movement up there and money should n't be a big issue ( the us even managed to pull off a great project and program without any government fund ) . 
  and the 1992 olympics in barcelona are a case study on how big events can positively change a city . 
  that sounds reasonable , a corrupted country would have offered a rich deal to the highest bribing contractors . 
  but yes , with croatia being so close and so nice , setting up a small space to promote its tourism to all the visitors coming from asia , america and the oil countries , could have probably been worth the money . 
  it 's not so bad , many pavilions will probably complete their office spaces in the few weeks after the opening , but the exhibition spaces should all be ready from the start . 
  beside russia and a couple other countries , they all have completed the structures and are finishing the interiors . 
  [ some recent photos ] ( http://milano.corriere.it/foto-gallery/cronaca/15_aprile_26/expo-padiglioni-ultima-settimana-giorni-countdown-via-a4e603ae-ec2c-11e4-b9d3-aa4aa3ffc489.shtml ) speaking of europe , the [ french ] ( http://inhabitat.com/frances-2015-world-expo-pavilion-challenges-world-hunger-with-a-farm-to-table-design/ ) and [ british ] ( http://www.dezeen.com/2015/04/15/wolfgang-buttress-bdp-uk-pavilion-milan-expo-2015/ ) pavilions are probably the best looking ones , but i 'm sure the spanish tapas bar and the czech pool with dj and models will draw a lot of attention . 
  the only way to stop this would be a common immigration policy , with countries sharing the responsibility and the costs of dealing with migrants . 
  right now it 's everyone on its own , which makes no sense since , under schengen , italy 's borders are europe 's borders . 
  blaming italy for not doing enough , or for not imprisoning people until our immigration system is able to process them , is a stupid way to look at the problem . 
   island in the middle of nowhere  sicily [ you are an island in the middle of nowhere ] ( http://31.media.tumblr.com/7b95cb7ffd8f9434e8fc65cdf352f5c8/tumblr_n1ykxfha6v1tt3yyso1_400.gif ), 
  you redditors should understand that if a solution sounds stupid enough , there 's a good chance we already tried it : some years ago berlusconi 's government stopped a boat in international waters , picked up the migrants and then drove back to a lybian port , and of course we were fined by the european court of human rights for that . 
  italy , spain and greece are not australia . 
  if europe wants to try a similar solution , we 'll need a common immigration policy and shared investments . 
  europe ca n't ask mediterranean countries to take the sole responsibility of dealing with migration fluxes stronger than their capabilities , or to increase their capabilities by a factor of 10 while austerity and debt reduction are still on the table . 
  either we are all equally responsible , and we all do our part , or it 's everyone on it 's own doing what it can : northern countries will still have to deal with the problem , because the migrants that escape our systems will reach them ( with all the security risks connected to clandestinity ) , but on the other side they can blame southern countries , and their politicians wo n't have to tell their base that they 've agreed on accepting a quota of asylum seekers . 
  right now , it appears that everyone feels more comfortable doing things the wrong way . 
  the number of arrivals jumped from 12 thousands in 2012 to 130 thousands in 2014 ( 2015 will be even more ) . 
  you ca n't rebuild your immigration platform to work on 10 times it 's capacity in a single year , and you also ca n't detain people for months without a trial , waiting for them to be processed by the system , without breaking their human rights . 
  almost every one of them . 
  the only reason behind the decision to replace the expensive seek and rescue mission that italy had in place over the past year with a cheap , pan-european , border patrol operation , is that no one wants to deal with the migrants and letting them die in the sea is the easiest way to solve the problem , hoping that it will also stop them from coming ( which of course does n't work ) . 
  it 's disgusting that 29 countries , together , only managed to finance an operation that costs 1/3 of what italy was paying on his own ( plus all the costs of dealing with 130.000 arrivals ) , in a recession , while we were also dealing with the austerity measures imposed by bruxelles . 
  but yeah , we are the one that get to see the bodies every week . 
  he literally said today that the [ relationship between him and renzi ] ( http://i.huffpost.com/gen/1638784/images/o-matteo-renzi-enrico-letta-facebook.jpg ) is `` serene '' . 
  he 's still biting the towel ( sta a rosic\u00e0 ) . 
  and by the way , [ deep fried artichokes ] ( http://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/04/09/dining/09passover1_395/09passover1-superjumbo.jpg ) , only served in the jewish ghetto in rome , are one of the best things in the world . 
   project based contracts are staying , contrary to initial promise ? 
  [ this is my last piece of news ] ( http://www.linkiesta.it/copertura-economica-jobs-act ) ( and poletti said yesterday that all the measures will be ready by august ) also , i do n't get why an employer would pay to fire people who worked 3 years for them and replace them with untrained fresh hires . 
  subsidies will only last for the next 3 years , and should work as a stimulus for employment and to reduce temporary contracts , from 2018 things go back to normal . 
  the most important thing , right now , is to see how and to what degree the active labour policies will work , without them the reform will indeed be flawed and unbalanced . 
   work of entertainment = italian politics, 
   what actually happened was that all the old contracts were left in place , and the old standard work contract saw its job security protections eliminated and replaced with a severance of 1 month of pay for every year of seniority . 
  unemployment benefits were reshuffled but left essentially unchanged , and no work placement or re-training program has even been mentioned . 
  that 's not true , the law gave to the government the guidelines for writing the new regulations , and many of them are still being written in their final form . 
  some were already revealed in details and are waiting to be issued ( the scrapping of project based contracts , new regulations on maternity leaves and against fake freelance contracts ) while others are still being worked on ( concerning the training and work placement ) . 
  the new unemployment benefits are a big improvement over the old ones : much easier to get , with higher maximum cap and with a fairer computation of the due benefit . 
  the lower protections of the new permanent contract came side by side with huge economic incentives for employers that choose it over short term contracts . 
  overall , the law is not perfect or dreamlike , but it 's probably more balanced , cohesive and relevant to the modern labour market , than what we had before ( which was ok for some and terrible for many ), 
  the supreme court declared the appeal process invalid , so they had to move the case to another court and redo that . 
  the third guy ( and now only culprit ) took the short route and his trial ended in 2010 . 
  once you get used to , `` hi !, 
  - hey !, 
  * kiss * * kiss * '' is way less awkward than `` hi !,

  i 'm not an expat , but during my erasmus year in munich i gradually became aware of the greyness of the urban environment , something i did n't expect to affect me . 
  for comparison : [ the city i was born in ] ( http://www.blog-ville.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/bologna.jpg ) vs [ munich ] ( http://www.julia-mathewson.com/photos/europe_2008_photos1/2munich03.jpg ), 
  decent families do n't fight over money and take care of their problematic members . 
  why should i treat the many great people in the south as enemies , when their only difference from me is that i was gifted with a pampered youth while they had to grow up in a more hostile environment ? 
  for most of the local population they are like big bullies , who scare you into doing what they want . 
  the potential solutions are : - police work : catch the leaders , track the money-flow , offer protection to people under threat . 
  we are fairly good at it , but sometimes it feels like emptying a river with a bucket . 
  - cultural : schools and many associations are working every day to support the civic reaction against the mafias . 
  they have done huge progresses in the past 30 years . 
  - economic : fight the degrade in many southern neighborhoods . 
  this is the hardest task because the quest to build a clean and functioning economy and political class in mafia controlled territories has proven very hard , and a huge part of the money we have been throwing south for the past century ended up wasted . 
  this is also quite annoying for taxpayers in the northern regions , hence the lega nord party : as you can see [ here ] ( https://s1.yimg.com/bt/api/res/1.2/nw5bhegvakfh0qyesvolng--/yxbwawq9ew5ld3m7ct04ntt3ptyxma--/http://l.yimg.com/os/653/2012/06/21/regioni-tasse-jpg_131046.jpg ) , lombardia only gets to use 2/3 of it 's taxes , while calabria spends twice the amount it collects , more than lombardia , and yet they often ca n't manage to not look like a open air dumpster . 
  the claim came from `` il fatto quotidiano '' ( an obnoxious newspaper founded in 2009 to cash in on the political scandals surrounding berlusconi ) who opened with `` berlusconi says fat-ass to merkel '' . 
  they are now saying that they never wrote that such recording existed , but that there were gossips about it coming from berlusconi 's entourage . 
  anyway , absolutely no proofs to support the claim , but since everybody liked the story ( b. 
  's fanbase included ) , they happily shared it without asking further questions . 
  only in italian , i 'm afraid . 
  [ here 's a full recap ] ( http://www.ilpost.it/filippofacci/2015/03/13/culone-che-non-lo-erano/ ) , but the basic story is simple : berlusconi is on trial for the prostitution scandal , many of his wiretapped phone calls are published on newspapers , one of them writing a bunch of articles based on the claim that in one of the recordings berlusconi 's heard calling merkel `` unfuckable lardass '' . 
  the news spreads quickly around the world , then four years later the trial ends , all the trial documents are made public , and it 's discovered that the remark on the chancellor never existed to begin with . 
  they 're in the un security council, 
  by the way , did you know that the famous `` unfuckable lardass '' comment by berlusconi on merkel never happened , an italian newspaper made up the whole story and the truth surfaced years later , when the full wiretaps became public . 
  you really do n't need doctored proofs to sell a fake story to the world , people will believe a story they like . 
  even here , it was easier to side with the fake or the double-fake arguments rather than saying that we were n't able to know the truth until all the parts involved revealed the real story . 
   italy has strong business links with russia more than that , the reason renzi visited russia and egypt in the past weeks ( and will meet with obama in april ) is libia, 
  there are multiple production lines ( nh90 are built by a consortium of european companies ) , and i 'm quite sure germany made theirs ( [ firsts source i 've found ] ( http://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/germany-calls-a-halt-to-nh90-flights-over-safety-fears-408844/ ) ), 
  they were built by airbus in germany, 
  well , he 's not really immune nor laughing . 
  in the past year he was forced to leave the parliament and to partake social work duties , his only way to remain politically relevant was to bend before renzi , who proceeded to fuck him harshly . 
  he used him to become prime minister , got a huge win in the european elections , pushed his reforms forward , made the 5 star movement irrelevant , and then elected the president of the republic of his choice , making berlusconi look like a fool and leaving his party in ruins . 
  no more sex parties too , i 'm afraid . 
  the trial was a joke , they never had solid charges to begin with . 
  having said that , an acquittal does n't change the moral and political judgments on the events : a ) he 's an old , deluded narcissist , a male chauvinist , a gigantic douchebag , but i do n't think his sex escapades can be considered unethical or immoral . 
  speaking of ethics , i 'm more concerned by the actions of the press and the magistrates , on this case . 
  b ) on the political side , this story is very compromising : the guy is constantly blackmailed and is constantly paying a large network of people for their silence . 
  he 's also completely delusional and unable to deal with reality , not a good thing when you are ruling a country . 
  `` storm '' = the troglodytes who are trying to build an italian lepenist right wing did their usual hate mongering routine , and the press as usual helps them by giving to their stupid boutades more credit than they will ever deserve . 
   [ now explain that `` out '' for italy . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwepl4aujy8&amp;spfreload=10 ), 
  great , now french people know that we call our election laws with stupid names ( porcellum , mattarellum ) . 
  it all started in the 90s , when a journalist sarcastically gave a pseudo-latin name to the election law drafted by sergio mattarella ( our current president ) , calling it mattarellum . 
  everyone adopted the new name . 
  years passed , berlusconi 's government changed the law , but it turned out to be so bad that even the man who wrote it described it as a `` porcata '' ( bullshit , or , more literally , something made by/for pigs ) . 
  so the new law became the porcellum , and for years politicians , journalists and common men seriously debated the topic by referring to it as bullshitellum . 
  renzi promptly nicknamed his law italicum , in order to prevent journalists to attach a more degrading name to it . 
  aside of the shallow opposition to the current government , the major concern for some commentators is that the reform will strongly alter the current checks and balances of our system , turning it in some sort of presidentialism by putting too much powers in the hand of the government . 
  but our old political system has always resulted in low governability and ultra-slow lawmaking , and now that we moved from a bipolarized parliament ( left-right ) to a mexican standoff featuring three major parties , a reform is needed . 
  with the rise of populist parties alongside the classical left and right wings , it 's a problem for most of europe . 
  some systems , like french presidentialism , can easily handle the new wave of politics , but spain for example is fucked like us , and unable to form a government . 
  it 's not a good or bad thing , it 's a thing . 
  and it 's not limited to italians but also every other immigrant , from northern africa to eastern europe . 
  chinese shop owners undercut normal prices by basically working impossible shifts , i know chinese people that spent their youth without ever seeing their fathers .

  in this case i firmly hold the position that whoever decided for this ruling showed a considerable amount of pro-muslim/palestine bias and anti-jewish/israeli bias . 
  i do n't know whatever the hell an `` a priori '' hierarchy should be or what `` hate crimes '' above `` impartial '' should mean , apologies . 
  i did n't really understand that part of your post at all . 
  i 'll repeat , it 's very simple - torching synagogues , mosques and churches is/should be automatically ( a priori ) a hate crime as it is very simply and transparently an expression of * hate * against certain religious/ethnic communities . 
  that 's it . 
  to deny it is laughable , illogical and an attempt at covering the ass of racist and bigoted criminals . 
   what if the debate is inconclusive the fact that * you * deem a debate inconclusive is no reason to not have it  what if i as the obvious minority think that the ruling is ok . can my opinion be ignored ? 
  no * in the sense that you have every right to express it and do whatever , but so does everybody else who thinks this was a shit ruling . 
  and if a considerable amount or a majority of people does think that this is a shit ruling ( even outside the reddit circlejerk ) , it probably means that a debate is worth having and attempts at silencing it with the old appeal to authority ( `` judges are always right , who are we to criticise the law ?! '' ), 
  are shitty  i can answer that one : nazis tend to really , reaaaallllly be proud of their `` views '' , therefore are too dumb to actually hide their intentions in a way , which would make the lives of their defense lawyers easier in front of a court . 
  well then , if the muslim perpetrators of hate crimes against jewish symbols are smart enough to hide their intentions and the judges fall for it , that just means that the judges are getting played or are conniving , nothing else . 
  lmao , stop acting like the law is impervious to current political & social issues or like law rulings happen in a perfect objective vacuum . 
  the law and judges can , should and must be critiqued - which i remind you is a healthy mechanism in the democratic context . 
  intentionally burning down synagogues , mosques or churches should be recognised as a hate crime a priori , as it 's always been as far as i know . 
  this ruling reeks of both pro-muslim/palestine and , even more , anti-jewish/israeli bias ; `` every aspect was taken into account '' my ass . 
  although i understand that the arsonists were convicted for their actions , the stubborn refusal to see the clear , logical and transparent anti-semitic motives behind burning ( or attempting to burn ) down a synagogue and the covert attempt at painting it in a quasi-favorable light as an `` anti-zionist '' action is laughable and deserves a debate . 
  i also for one do n't expect to see any young mosque-torching neo-nazi youngsters getting convicted without a hate crime charge on their backs . 
  i wonder why . 
  i guess a lot of it comes down to having enough money to compete with global standards & symbols of wealth . 
  i mean , consider two cases : 1 ) you earn 1000 in romania while spending 500 in living expenses and 2 ) you earn 3000 in the uk while spending 2000 ( made-up figures ) . 
  in the first case you 've got 500 for saving/travelling abroad/buying iphones/buying a car or whatever . 
  in the second case you 've got 1000 . 
  it 's all about having a bigger slice of the pie . 
  wait , so people get to go to syria to do some rapin ' and beheadin ' and * then * they get to come back to sweden to a nice home and state-provided stipend ? 
  what ? 
  y' all , they were just a bunch of kids having a laugh !, 
  their molotov cocktails would have never burned down that synagogue , anyway !, 
  it was just a prank , really . 
   it would be if the court would have been able to prove beyond reasonable doubt that it actually was motivated by hate against jews , or judaism . 
  wait , so are you really saying that setting fire to a synagogue of all places is n't * always * a hate crime against jews and/or judaism ? 
  what ? 
  i guess when nazis burn down a mosque it ai n't a hate crime against muslims either . 
   when it comes to the english language there are so many different accents that even getting started may be ridiculously difficult . 
  i disagree . 
  english is one and one only - apart from some minor differences in diction and spelling . 
  accents of course vary , but most beginners are either going to have british or american teachers and are gon na be taught `` standard '' english . 
  most of the anglophone media an european consumes is also either british or american , so there 's that too . 
  i dunno , i found english ridiculously easy to learn . 
  on the contrary i just ca n't achieve fluency in french and i 'm a native italian & spanish speaker , go figure . 
  haha god this is me . 
  i remember being a passenger in a car driving through bumfuck , midwesttown . 
  it was like - shit i * know * this . 
  i 've seen this countless times . 
  i know what kind of pleasantries people are exchanging inside that diner . 
  it was very funny and a bit unsettling , got ta be honest . 
  lovely, 
  what , did a spaniard steal your partner ? 
  reeeeeeeee, 
   taking all the capital investments and markets for products but closing the labour market is uk level of entitlement . 
  basically, 
  because we 're surrounded by poor countries . 
  if the eu says `` come all ye poors , free movement for all '' we 'd get a cool billion of thirdworlders knocking at our door tomorrow . 
   for the collective better yeah , europe was doing so well before uniting is n't it ? 
  those lovely days of competing against each other , declaring war to each other , bombing the shit out of each other . 
  ahh . 
  those were the days < 3, 
  like , if they want , they should be able to . 
  just outside the eu . 
  but that would be terribly inconvenient , would n't it . 
  is this likely to be accepted by brussels ? 
  i 'd wager no, 
  `` times change so let 's invade alsace , we could use some more room do n't we boys '', 
  you must be facetious . 
  immigrants by and large retain links and cultural ties to their own cultures ( as is understandable ) . 
  do you think religious muslims are ever going to cherish and care about france 's history as a native white frenchman would ? 
  a christian-rooted , deeply western , culture , with a past of crusades , enlightenment , revolution , bourgeoisie , wine-drinking and pork-eating - concepts completely foreign to most muslim countries . 
  muslims , from whatever country , have their own historical landmarks , their own stories , their own mythical landscape they 're gon na give to their own children and grandchildren . 
  the same goes for africans , asians , etcetera . 
  i for one expect that not many italian muslims or chinese-italians are ever gon na care and feel a deep , emotional link to some italian works like the divine comedy or the aeneid ( not italian per se but you get the gist ) or whatever . 
  ai n't gon na happen . 
  what 's gon na happen is that cultures will get mixed into a big ol' blob , just like the states , where multiple subcultures coexist under a big umbrella of nothing much ; where the culture itself is multiculturalism . 
  which would be a great thing . 
  the eu should stop sending any and all aid to countries that refuse to take back their own citizens . 
  the only worrying thing is that national identity/traditions/lifestyle are gon na be lost in a vague sea of multiculturalism . 
  people do deeply grieve losing their culture or seeing it diluted to the point of indistinguishability from the others . 
  nobody bats an eye if arab or african immigrants keep their culture when they immigrate , but suddenly it 's a no no if a frenchman or a dane is kinda attached to his/her own . 
  something will be done surely . 
  i can see severe bans on immigration from africa and the middle east getting imposed in the next 20-30 years . 
  africa 's gon na quadruple this century , shit 's crazy . 
  europe 's gon na start shooting their boats/militarize border control . 
  edit : imma throw in another prediction . 
  the right will win the battle against the left , generally . 
  it could be 20 years , it could be 50 . 
  we 're already seeing the first symptoms of it . 
  automation is gon na steal jobs everywhere -  less jobs -  more unhappy unemployed people who wo n't be happy to see more third-worlders come into our automated , job-scarce countries . 
  not just because they 'd be competition : they would n't even be able to compete , because there wo n't be any low-skill jobs when the robots have eaten them all up , so they 'd just lie around collecting welfare . 
  the left will necessarily keep being an advocate for immigration and migrants , and this will make them lose all credibility among the hungry and angry masses . 
  the right winning election after election ensues . 
  edit : even if ubi got implemented , people would still be against mass immigration . 
  actually , i think the implementation of ubi is going to be the final nail in the coffin of unlimited immigration from the 3rd world - if you let in too many people , the whole system implodes . 
  kids are expensive and an hassle , end of . 
  they suck all money out of your pockets , they scream , vomit , shit themselves and they need c.o.n.s.t.a.n.t. 
  attention . 
  if you 're a woman , more than one kid ( and even just one tbh ) is gon na set you back when you 're competing on the workplace against childless women and men . 
  gaining new skills is basically out of the question when you have a 3 year old vying for your attention 24/7 . 
  it 's just a big lose lose , rationally . 
  irrationally , it 's also a big source of joy and satisfaction , or so they say . 
  i think i 'd like one . 
  also because the more women get educated , the more they want/need to compete in the job market and you ai n't competing if you 're birthing 3 kids in quick succession, 
   as a maltese , i say we should call their bluff and shoot a rocket at the plane .

  article deleted for the meanwhile . 
  unfortunately , this is true to any country but recently the idea that anything muslim is not good has made inroads in many people . 
  the far right is being legitimized after the recent terrorist attacks ( and erdogan 's crack on opposition newspapers is n't helping either as is the fact that most in the west still think the coup was made by some kind of secular force ) and xenophobes are more and more vocal . 
  i did bring a few articles to the table at least even though your claim had nothing to do with the subject of the article . 
  if you do n't ( or ca n't ) disprove what i am saying , it means that i am right to the neutral reader and that to him pis will be validated as a far right party and that poland 's political sphere will be considered the most right wing of europe by him . 
  i was reading english cumhuriyet 's front page ( was just curious if they were still running ) when i saw it and did n't check it was old . 
  that makes it much more believable . 
  at the same time , it kinda confirms that campania is the region with the lowest actual employment rate . 
  is there article coupled by the stat by the way ? 
  i would be interested in reading it, 
   even we secular turks are tired of europeans hating on us by now . 
  we just ca n't stand the way turkey is going . 
  turkey matters to us because we see it as an example that democracy can work in the muslim world . 
  we are n't attacking turkey or turkish people ( the right does that sometimes ) as much as we are attacking erdogan and akp, 
  you 'll have to wait for that . 
  he 's still fairly young and in good shape, 
  third world country we are not . 
  according to the [ human development index ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/34/2014_un_human_development_report_quartiles.svg ) , we are a very developed country . 
  [ they even list us \\ ( 0.873 \\ ) over poland \\ ( 0.843 \\ ) ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/human_development_index ) . 
  i wo n't deny that there is corruption but [ more people reported paying a bribe in poland ] ( http://www.transparency.org/country#pol_publicopinion ) than in [ italy ] ( http://www.transparency.org/country#ita_publicopinion ) . 
  there are datas when your country does better and datas where mine does better but that does n't mean either italy or poland are third world countries either way , you are avoiding to prove my point wrong changing the discours entirely . 
  i proved you wrong , now it 's your time to prove my point wrong . 
  made me really laugh . 
  the song is really spot on and german satire show seem more high quality than ours ( at least from this song ; [ the best we have is crozza ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kte16cmqrve ) ), 
  we already tried but you did n't want it to happen , 
  prove me wrong then . 
  poland is europe 's most right wing country . 
  that ca n't be denied . 
  there is n't a single leftist party in parliament . 
  the most left you have is basically a liberal europeist centrist party . 
  making the steps that are needed to enter the eu would mean a series of reforms that would lead to a further improvement of the political situation in your country . 
  all of non akp voters ( except kurdish nationalists ) should support entering the eu . 
  leaving the muslim world for eu should be a positive development to all kemalists at the very least, 
   also the syrian arab army has decayed considerably to the point it no longer exists in practice , it has even lost control of the warlords who acted on behalf of assad : the saa certainly exists . 
  it may be weaker but if we count the ndf which is basically counter insurgency/reserve force , they have a much larger number of soldiers than rebels do . 
   the current battles in aleppo at the moment are almost entirely between rebels and foreign shi'ite militia working on behalf of the regime - there 's no functional saa on the front lines anymore . 
  that 's not right . 
  liwa al quds ( palestinian syrian group ) , tiger forces and desert hawks ( multi-confessional elite troops ) and parts of saa 's 1st , 4th and republican guard elite unit are all fighting . 
  by the way , rebels also make a large use of foreign fighters . 
  the suicide bombers in the current aleppo offensive are all foreigners as are most of their shock troops . 
  how can you say things as your last sentence with a straight face ? 
  and how can you support the rebels without being an islamist ? 
  indeed , the eu has prepared some kind of road map for turkey to follow and erdogan is going in the opposition way on many of the policies needed to enter into the eu, 
  even a broken clock is right two times a day, 
  he 's turkey 's putin . 
  as simple as that . 
  whether a place 's well controlled or not , in the midst of a war , has little to do with the number of deaths but with local economy and how its government controls its citizens . 
  most of the rebel groups have proven to be warlordish . 
  the regime does n't make things easier of course ( by the way , i think unhrc numbers are exaggerated , especially given that un council is controlled by saudi arabia at the moment and that they are a huge backer of the opposition ) and i would argue their war conduct has n't been good at all but in this war , all of the sides ( with maybe the notable exception of sdf ) have committed their fair share of atrocities edit : [ the most realistic number of losses is probably the one included in wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/casualties_of_the_syrian_civil_war ), 
  i wonder how these figures would look if cash-in-hand jobs were accounted . 
   quite a few muslim women left france because they could n't live without the burka . 
  seems like we solved that problem . 
  i think this phenomenon is called hijra and is encouraged by salafists and ultraconservative sunnis . 
   the extremists , `` ready for action '' , work in cells anyway . 
  what 's more problematic is what i see in germany here . 
  wahhabi and salafi fundamentalists are already shun by many almost every `` mainstream '' mosque here . 
  they are pretty much outcast - but they 've found other ways , lecturing via video and internet streams , private gatherings and on the street these days . 
  unfortunately , the internet has gave a voice to pretty much any extremist , whether salafi , marxist or neo-nazi , ecc . 
  but it still limits their action, 
  look at the bright side . 
  the sultan will be replaced with a new ataturk 8 years after we will win our war . 
  that 's why he should have kept his mouth shut in the first place . 
  if he cared so much , he could have done something . 
  instead , he transformed southern turkey into the waiting room for entry into is, 
  it literally was syrian al qaeda . 
   jabhat fateh al-sham ( arabic : \u062c\u0628\u0647\u0629 \u0641\u062a\u062d \u0627\u0644\u0634\u0627\u0645 , transliteration : jabhat fat\u1e25 ash-sh\u0101m , `` front for the conquest of the levant '' ) , formerly known as the al-nusra front ( arabic : \u062c\u0628\u0647\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0646\u0635\u0631\u0629 \u0644\u0623\u0647\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u0634\u0627\u0645 , transliteration : jabhat an-nu\u1e63rah li-ahli ash-sh\u0101m , `` the victory front for the people of the levant '' , often abbreviated to jn ) , al-qaeda in syria , or al-qaeda in the levant , [ 39 ] is a salafist jihadist terrorist organization fighting against the forces of the syrian government in the syrian civil war , with the aim of establishing an islamic state in the country . 
  [ 40 ] it was the syrian branch of al-qaeda until 2016, 
  nah , it 's more of a case of poland having its political scene unnaturally tilted towards right than pis not being far right poland is europe 's most right wing country . 
  do n't you realize that ? 
  only hungary comes close and maybe slovakia . 
  as an italian , sounds a good enough reason to invade you . 
  it 'll be 1912 all over again ... ... 
  many have returned blending in with legitimate refugees or with economic migrants but if turkey had a stricter control on their border with syria , foreign fighters both could n't have gotten to or returned from syria in the first place, 
  depends . 
  some regime held areas probably are but the main cities of damascus , hama , homs , ecc . 
  have strict state control ( even though at the start of the war , syrian government had to rely on militias and secret services ) the difference with rebel held areas is that there 's no main authority and that there 's a frequent infighting between the various groups . 
  a rebel win would basically mean another civil war between the winners . 
  a regime win would mean the end of the war . 
  the lack of resources has also made warlordism pretty common in places like aleppo . 
   pis is neither right or nationalist . 
  of course they are . 
  using both hardline conservative and nationalist rhetoric as well as having authoritarian tendencies . 
  the only established parties who are more right wing within the eu are hungary 's jobbik , greece 's golden dawn and slovakia 's lsns, 
  italy has slightly gone up to 56,5 % . 
  still above only croatia and greece . 
   in calabria for example inactive people are even twice the unemployed ones , what 's the point in fully trusting unemployment rate if it interests just 1/3 of the people without a ( declared ) job ? 
  that can easily be explained by the prevalence of undeclared ( under the table ) jobs in southern regions . 
  i think they fair well in the game making industry too but of course their biggest contribution is porn , 
  even areas with few romas such as trencin , kosice , zilina have all unemployment rates around 10 % . 
  to add to that , i think romas would n't be counted in an unemployment rate because the ones who have n't integrated usually do n't search a job, 
  i think age of consent should be raised to 16 or 18 in case one of the two persons involved has an authoritative role as in this case but the court just applied the law in this case , as flawed as it is . 
  i think for 14 and above , it 's called ephebophilia by the way , i do n't see why incest should n't be legal if two persons , whether they are male or female , want it . 
  it should be made illegal only if it 's under the age of 18 where the parent can exercise control on its children . 
  of course , mine is probably an unpopular view . 
   somalia is a failed state libya and rebel ( the so called `` moderate '' groups ) held areas of syria as well, 
  [ all the while they remove the syrian branch of al qaeda ( al nusra ) from their terror list ] ( http://www.cumhuriyet.com.tr/haber/english/84325/turkey_removes_al-nusra_from__terror__list.html ) and while their special forces fight side to side [ with groups like zinki who have beheaded a child as recently as three months ago ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-36843990 ), 
  it 's kinda the opposite though . 
  going overtly against him is only going to worsen the view of many turks towards the west . 
  we should just fund the opposition ( hdp , chp and try to rid mhp of bahceli if possible before funding them too ) and take a stand against the closing of newspapers, 
  exactly , they want to keep a good relationship with the west because they have realized it 's a good tool to spread sympathy towards kurdistan 's fight for autonomy .

even down town in the capital ? 
  down town istanbul would lose so much business . 
  it 's a ridiculous law . 
   in addition , the sale of alcoholic beverages will be banned between 10 p.m. and 6 a.m. those who violate this law will incur a fine of between tl 20,000 and tl 100,000 . 
  the scale is misleading . 
  at this rate they are still in a debt spiral albeit a slower one . 
  thanks , i wrote an email to them in fact asking them to consider including continental europe in their service . 
  they only have the major english speaking countries which is just silly . 
  [ country codes ] ( http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/statistics_explained/index.php/glossary:country_codes ) to be able to read the charts, 
  yeah , you 're right , i looked up a graph on google and i read the units as billions instead of percentages . 
  ~ ~ looks like latvia 's public debt is over 130 % of its gdp . 
  interestingly it decreased slightly after the financial crisis , and now its rising up again with a rapidly rising gdp . 
  maybe the the massive debt is leveraging sound investments and latvia can manage its debt under financial stress ? ~ ~ edit : latvia 's debt is 40 % of its gdp, 
  if i remember correctly , this was the same guy posting that the eu is undemocratic because it is too complicated , and he even suggested that the uk was n't part of europe , and that the benefits of being the eu such as work and travel rights were not such a big deal . 
  he said he wanted to buy land in spain , and he could just apply there for a residency without the eu . 
  i think this guy is presumptuous . 
  [ a map showing the approximate distribution of indigenous languages in europe ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_day_of_languages ),

   seams to somehow corelate to income per capita . 
  edit : i just mean you ca n't prove it looking at the graph . 
  maybe attribute was n't the right word . 
  edit : i do n't really like that stereotype about italians . 
  you ca n't attribute cultural patterns . 
  look at eastern europe .

  flavors do n't make cigarettes taste any better , and young people do n't start smoking for the taste . 
  it 's like berlusconi ca n't make up his mind . 
  does he want italy to default or not ? 
  if he does n't , why is he trying to create this kind of compromise where monti runs for pdl ? 
  he is basically holding italy hostage for political power - either he wins in one way or another , or italy risks default . 
  personally i do n't want italy to default because it will create a huge depressive stagflation that italy will never recover from , not to mention what will happen to the eu . 
  a debate is a debate . 
  what i do n't appreciate is the anti-debate sentiment . 
  people discuss anything they want . 
  and i would argue that yes , people should surrender certain opinions or at least refrain from expressing them violently , or in this case , under the implicit threat of violence . 
  we ca n't have universities censoring debates because it pisses off a bunch of backwards mother fuckers . 
  i do n't understand how the uk has bowed so far to immigrant pressure . 
  these muslims are bullying an entire culture into submission . 
  europeans talk a lot of shit about american 's in this sub reddit , but if a bunch of muslims started a violent protest in ` merica , they would get their asses justly handed to them .

  more like poverty killed people . 
  `` italy has few natural resources . 
  there are no substantial deposits of iron , coal , or oil . 
  proven natural gas reserves , mainly in the po valley and offshore adriatic , have grown in recent years and constitute the country 's most important mineral resource . 
  most raw materials needed for manufacturing and more than 80 % of the country 's energy sources are imported . 
  the energy sector is highly dependent on imports from abroad : in 2006 the country imported more than 86 % of its total energy consumption ( 99.7 % of the solid fuels demand , 92.5 % of oil , 91.2 % of natural gas and 15 % of electricity ) . '', 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/economy_of_italy#energy_and_natural_resources half of italy 's oil is imported from libya . 
  ok but they still have to meet the economic criteria to be accepted into the euro currency union . 
  i suppose that will change when they become independent . 
  i think that if italy defaults , it would be wisest to default on the lira , so italy can print money and avoid bank runs as well as to cushion the fall with stronger exports . 
  it would n't be such a bad idea to start printing lira right now and start stocking banks if it did n't disturb the market . 
  i also have doubt 's how good an argument a low lira is . 
  imagine how high the cost of importing oil would become . 
  it would cause massive inflation and people could no longer afford anything . 
  i think a lot of italian exports are also based on raw materials which need to be imported . 
  a depreciation could possibly cancel out any positive effects on the current account . 
  i 'm not so sure that the depression italy would go into would readily escapable . 
  i think the best thing would be for the `` core '' countries to leave the euro currency and form a secondary currency , bail out italy with their new currency , and re-enter the currency with a proper banking system and a euro bond , and for mario monti to remain and crush corruption and waste . 
  i think italy maybe was stupid to enter the currency . 
  did n't they understand the effect it would have on their account surplus ? 
  they could have joined the eu without adopting the euro .

  maybe krugman was right . 
  austerity has done worse . 
  italy can continue in debt slavery and depression to the benefit of the other states and the world 's general economy , or it can default and try to work it 's way out of whatever apocalyptic depression ensues . 
   fiscal tightening itself has pushed italy 's public debt from a stable  equilibrium into the danger zone . 
  the imf says the debt ratio is rising  much faster than before , jumping from 120pc last year to 126pc this  year and to 128pc in 2013 . 
  really ??? 
  wtf i mean this fucking guy is trying to capsize italy . 
  i just ca n't believe how rotten he is . 
  why is he resigning ? 
  american has waged war and toppled government for years , and it 's a christian nation . 
  just because it 's educated and democratic and is n't torn by internal conflict and poverty does n't make it peaceful . 
  and looking back at history , christianity has been as bloody as islam . 
  christianity is n't exactly the religion of peace either . 
  he might possibly be the straw that breaks the camels back and sends italy into default . 
  europeans think they are the center of the world . 
  they do n't realize americans basically live on a cultural island in comparison and that we do n't have much reason to care since we are an economic hegemon and the entire world copy cats almost everything we do . 
  many europeans prefer to live inside their own tiny little country . 
  do n't take it personally if they give you crap for being `` ignorant '' in terms of their own culture or languages or geography . 
  take it in stride . 
  europeans can be just as ethnocentric as americans . 
  there 's also a huge amount of diversity in europe , so do n't expect everyone to have the same expectations . 
  i think though that most young people 's views tend to converge now days , and you 'll find people who like you for being different and adventurous and coming to europe . 
  i see lot of posts here are really petty in terms of how to act . 
  i think most of these people are overly self-conscious and pretentious judgmental and ignorant and probably just young . 
  and if people wa n't to over-generalize about americans well fuck em . 
  you 're enlightened just by virtue of being humble and open minded . 
  if you have n't learned a second language fluently , you 'll be amazing how much progress you can make if you study it a couple hours a day .

   there is no special reason to tax co2 emissions in cars other than the hysteria about it , there are other gasses an particles that do more damage to the atmosphere and the surrounding in smaller quantities . 
  there 's no such reason to think co2 is the most deadly thing since rat poison , but . . why in the hell not tax this , and the remainder then ?

  there is no single most prestigious university , but rather universities that are considered prestigious in certain fields . 
  sns pisa , a grande \u00e9cole on the french model , is considered the most prestigious institution for the more academic subjects such as the sciences or literary studies . 
  politecnico di torino and milano are the top schools for engineering , materials sciences and related fields . 
  bocconi is by far regarded as the best university for finance , economics and business . 
  iirc , bologna 's law school is the most prestigious in the country . 
  i actually do n't know which places are prestigious for medicine , so if anyone wants to chime in i 'd be curious . 
  i know that sant ` anna , again in pisa , has a highly regarded program , but i do n't know if it 's considered the best . 
  beside academic prestige , oftentimes universities are also regarded for being the places where the elites of the future are educated ( oxbridge comes to mind , but also the us ivy league ) . 
  this is n't really the case in italy , where the norm was for people to attend whichever major university was closest . 
  for example , if you look at our most recent pms , all of them went to their city 's university or if insignificant or absent the next closest one . 
   ` we are importing religious conflict , ' well , we are . 
  there 's no doubt about it . 
  the reports about religious conflicts among refugees , or refugees and previously-established migrants , ca n't be dismissed . 
  at the same time , it 's high time that the debate about this issue graduates into adulthood . 
  as it is now , it is largely a series of back and forths between right-wing fear-mongers taking single incidents of conflict and applying them to the entire migrant population , and left-wing people rightfully contesting that this is cherry-picking and oftentimes thinly-veiled bigotry without however giving an alternate model of how these things happen or how extensive they are . 
  i 'm not especially hopeful that this graduation will happen any time soon . 
  there is n't too much to be gained on the anti-immigration side by toning down the rhetoric , and on the left there 's more to be gained by rallying people against the ( very real ) racists and bigots than by calmly admitting that there are issues that come with immigration . 
  it 's the middle of the night in most of europe . 
  only foreigners , expats and insomniacs are active now . 
  well it does , unfortunately , as horrific as that is . 
  i mean , the reason why france still counts for something on the world stage is essentially that it has nukes and sits on the un security council , that alone tells you how much morality and decency matter in these things ( not that it 's immoral to defend yourself in a dangerous world ) . 
   2 ) why have n't malta , italy and greece called for one before ? 
  because it 's pointless to call a meeting when the big guys do n't want to play ball . 
  even little malta could get the eu leaders to sit in a room out of formal respect for a fellow eu member , but it would be little more than a fancier way of asking for help . 
  it would also be an embarassment for the government who called it , a way to formalize that their foreign policy clout is essentially nil ( which would be true regardless but of course is n't as ttrue if it 's never put to the test ) . 
  shut up italy great-a power rinascimento colombo garibaldi ' 15 - '18 never forget ( but pls forget ww2 k ), 
  to be honest that 's unfair . 
  britain was forcibly kept out of the european project for decades , and when it was finally included a lot was done to ensure that its input would n't really influence the direction along which the project proceeded . 
  france was especially bad at this , being the country that worked most to keep britain out and then sideline it after that . 
  i do n't blame britain for being euroskeptic . 
  a lot of the criticism it gave of eu initiatives through the decades were very legitimate ( those of the euro sound especially prophetic now ) , and with the way it was sidestepped at every turn i ca n't blame it for tapping out and leaving the rest of to handle our own messes . 
  i 'll try to be as brief as possible : - both italy and germany , as defeated axis powers , spent 50 years without a real chance to put forth their own foreign policy - as a consequence , for 50 years both their electorates and political classes gave little importance and developed little experience with real foreign policy - when the cold war ended and the overbearing role of the western block waned , that chokehold on their foreign policies lifted , but its effects could n't simply vanish - as a consequence , both countries ( i.e. 
  their electorates and politicians ) are very reluctant and very inept at taking strong , leading stances in foreign policy - but because germany is the largest european economy and european politics have been driven by economic issues for three decades , germany is thrust into that leading role - italy has only half as big an economy , which is still very large by european standards but not large enough that italy does n't need to assert itself to be listened to - however , because italy has n't been asserting itself on the european or world stage for most of its post-war history , it lacks both the internal political mechanisms and the attitude to do so contrast with france , who was both a major world power going into wwii and emerged as a victor . 
  it had a very active and independent foreign policy from day one , which coupled with its significant economic importance meant that france has 70 years of european leadership under its belt and continues in that role to this day . 
  no , regiment is a military unit . 
  you might be thinking of regimen , which modernly refers to a prescribed course of medical treatments but also used to refer to a system of government . 
  i find these comments very informative . 
  only on reddit can you find multiple people who are privy to the details of a eu plan yet to be published , and can already tell me what incentive structure will be used . 
  thankfully these cunning commentators have realized that a `` pay-per-return '' plan would incentivize more illegal immigration , something that clearly could n't have occurred to the plan 's authors . 
  let 's all hope this information can reach them before it 's too late . 
  i 'd rather read a complete report on the living situation of in-transit migrants than watch a video which has a very obivious agenda ( `` migrants \u00b4 invasion - we \u00b4 re taken for a fool '' ) and will only show the parts of the story that will appear to support that narrative . 
  i do n't see anything in this article beyond a personal comment . 
  no details of what the plan would have entailed , no reasoning as for why it would have worked , nothing . 
  it 's basically just an attention-grabbing headline shouting `` cameron 's got no balls says former important person '' . 
  interesting to see that problems become eu problems when they start to affect germany , france or the uk , but are otherwise national issues instead . 
  france and germany in particular have been telling our government for the last two years that securing our border was our responsibility and that any migrants coming in were ours to deal with . 
  glad they finally changed their mind , but this does n't make me particularly hopeful for a eu solution that is fair to all countries rather than the most powerful ones . 
  `` regime '' also means a system or a way of doing things . 
  in this case , the hungarian fingerprint regime is how they fingerprint people coming into the refugee camps ( as opposed to fingerprinting only asylum seeker or whatever other way one could go about it ) . 
  as you can see from the map in my screenshot , this thread in particular was posted to / r/europe , not / r/askeurope ( although op did also post that request there and elsewhere ) . 
  as far as i know , there is no dmz that is unclaimed , so to transfer anyone you would need the consent of the relevant sovereign state . 
   europe is facing the biggest flood of immigrants and refugees ever . 
  [ not ever ] ( http://grafik-jetzt.de/beispiele/hands/romans_vs_barbarians_battle.jpg ) . 
  there are four [ terrae nullius ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/terra_nullius ) , lands that are unclaimed by any state . 
  however , three are microterritories resulting from incongruent border claims , much too small for any meaningful population and * de facto * controlled by one of the bordering states ; the fourth is a slice of antartica , which can not sustain even a small population without massive per-capita investment . 
   so turkey , italy and hungary are just areas they 're passing through . 
  `` just '' is n't very descriptive of the situation . 
  in 2014 , italy rescued an estimated 170.000 migrants and received 66.000 asylum requests . 
  that alone points to the fact that we are no longer `` just '' a transit country , but rather a destination by ourselves ( as we used to be during previous migration waves ) . 
  on top of that , maritime rescue efforts impose a special strain on italy ( and greece ) . 
  our navy is out in the med ( now with eu assistance ) plucking thousands of people out of the water every day . 
  they are then taken to land , triaged , treated , fed , clothed and put up in temporary housing . 
  afterwards , they are transported over the country to try and lessen the load on the overburdened sicilian centers . 
  all of that constitutes a massive logistical undertaking which weights almost entirely on our shoulders . 
  even if a majority of these migrants will attempt to move on to northern europe , they are likely to remain in italy for several months . 
  finally : i 've concentrated on italy , but it 's incorrect to say that turkey is a just a transit country . 
  turkey hosts nearly two million refugees itself and it is in fact the premier destination for syrians fleeing the civil war . 
   people tend to over react over swastika these days . 
  might that be because there have been ~ ~ dozens ~ ~ ( turns out it 's 200 ) of neonazi attacks against refugees and this flag in particular was raised in front of a refugee center ? 
  i 'm not an expert on finnish affairs but i 'll hazard that context here might explain a few things . 
   i do n't think they need a defence our constitution thankfully does, 
  with what resources ? 
  a criminal trial is a criminal trial , it 's going to take up x man-hours from judges and clerks in any case . 
  how do they know ? 
   it is worth remembering that mass decolonization was proposed after the horrors of the second world war , after which europeans discovered that it was morally indefensible to subjugate their fellow human beings to imperial rule . 
  [ mfw this is what reactionaries actually believe ] ( http://i.imgur.com/o3znqdd.gifv )  the humanitarian solution to the third world is neocolonialism [ neocolonialism ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/neocolonialism ) is already a thing and , [ . 
  ] ( http://cdn.meme.am/instances/57339841.jpg ) , it sucks . 
   and stems from islamist groups that even paredate 9/11 . 
  which were n't at work in iraq before we invaded it , because saddam accepted no challenges to his power and kept them out . 
  it was the western invasion that let al quaeda ( from which isis originated ) into iraq . 
  pretty well , we stopped getting our judicial system gunked up in useless work . 
  it 's a nice soundbite but it does n't really say much . 
  i 'd rather know which percentage of new businesses belongs to immigrants . 
  according to various reports immigrants own about 7 % to 10 % of businesses registered in italy , which is in line with a foreign resident population of about 7.5 % . 
  i 've yet to understand why [ arbitration panels ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/muslim_arbitration_tribunal ) in matters other than contract law are supposed to be a good thing . 
  by all means get two companies before an arbitrator to resolve their dispute , but why the heck should we have people who have n't gone through the full education and vetting process of a judge decide on matters of marriage or inheritance ?

oh believe me , this is just the beginning . 
  meh , going to amsterdam to smoke pot is so '90s . 
   the point is that right now greece and italy are austere enough to manage their expenses but the interest rate payments are what is bringing them down . 
  nobody yet has made ** the ** obvious comment , omg, 
  they 'll be percieved as natives , or tourists at worst since they 'll have money , papers etc. 
  they might even have the bonus of speaking native english . 
  i think you 're staying out of italy if you know what 's good for you economically-wise , but for academic curiosity yeah , racism is pretty high in some places , although all it takes sometimes is nice dressing and behaving like a `` good person '' , since immigrants here are more often than not illegals who are smuggled through the coasts etc. 
  no , i think it 's incredibly tasteless to joke about nazism , of course they do n't have a plan . 
  congratulations to you too , `` lol italians '', 
  dem white socks . 
  aryan socks , actually . 
  ... , he said , from his nice comfy chair . 
  wow , 14 upvotes on `` everything is going according to plan '' . 
  i saw this like 4 years ago on facebook , it 's crap , it 's stereotypes , and our breakfasts are legendary ( just like all our food of course ) . 
  nice video shared by a eu flag flair . 
  well i 'm happy knowing that scots are level headed and wo n't do any crazy things to get independence . 
  impressive !, 
  we should make a reddit propaganda poster in the style of the american 50s , `` when you downvote , commies win '', 
  yes , i second both of your comments , and i add that if you dare think about this for a second i 'll use my english skills to help godfathers from south italy and usa spread their culture and customs all over the washed out and tasteless european union so you 'll finally learn some proper manners . 
  reddit is fucking horrible as usual , say something out of the hivemind and they downvote you for no goddamn reason . 
  anyway yes , all those things above i 've seen them and know them , and i live in the north . 
  it 's obvious they 're gon na hide that , and as far as the staff being `` friendly '' that has nothing to do with anything . 
  you 're forgetting - a pretty chance of getting illnesses due to the wonderful nhs , including `` cancer '' ( yes , that 's right , cancer ) - enabling state money to go to some thief - being judged like the scum of the earth if you do something `` horrible '' like getting a tattoo or an std ( even if you 're a perfectly healthy person etc ) and a couple of others i forgot because it 's been a while since i left that horrible world behind . 
  giving blood ** is ** indeed wonderful , do n't get me wrong ( do it kids !, 
  ) , it 's italy that ruins everything it touches . 
  do n't remind me of that too :(, 
  uhm ... yes . 
  i fail to see the connection here , but i 'm always against human extincion , 
  and sadly the smartest comment is found sitting here . 
  yes , if we go down this line people should ask italy payments for enslaving the known world back in the days of the roman empire , lol . 
  people ** always ** have killed one another , the 20th century `` only '' intensified this because of the technology . 
  what 's wrong with education today , i still wonder . 
  on one hand , yes . 
  on the other , do n't we have a burden as white men ? 
  it has n't , it 's called `` chatting '' ? 
  jeez, 
  jesus , is europe that much property of a. merkel ? 
  thanks , i know that , 
   it all started when mr. berluscone , king of the italy lol no but seriously , as long as `` italy '' means `` berlusconi '' we might as well talk about pizza . 
  i 'm not here to be an idiotic nationalist , italy is a banana republic , but berlusconi and his `` ministers '' are a joke , period . 
  ah , i see that now . 
  look whatever makes you feel righteous is good for you , what do you want me to say . 
  there 's clearly no team play , no global view on these matters , plus too much nationalism . 
  we must look silly to americans . 
  and this is hurting the economy as a whole , thank you for pointing this out . 
  but yeah team play is impossible in europe , americans know this very well, 
  italians are and will be italians , yet if you replace 20 years with a berlusconi with 20 years with a monti you ca n't deny things would 've been radically different . 
  how nice that you 're quoting word for word , it totally does n't mean you 're being brainwashed . 
  oh well , `` south is lazy '' and all that , whatever makes you feel happy i guess, 
  and here i am arguing with an italian again , apparently i ca n't learn my lessons . 
  anyway  your berlusconi-source-of-all-evils theory lol . 
  let 's just say that if italy had somebody competent for a change in the last 20 years things would n't be so ruined . 
  it 's not what he did , it 's also what he did not . 
   that 's how it came off in the local finnish media there 's your problem ? 
  the media sucks here too , and when it comes to eu politics nothings sells better than nationalism usually . 
   on top of that we now have monti throwing thinly veiled threats . 
  lol what is this the godfather ? 
  look , this may be a geniune case of divide et impera , and things are not this simple anyway . 
  i find it really hard to think monti really went and `` threatened '' the northern countries , not only because it 's stupid but because it makes no sense - what can italy possibly be doing , send waves of pizzas ? 
   two-faced charlatans blaming others for their own mistakes lol , you 're not serious are you . 
  i hope somebody else abroad understands the intricate situation monti has to deal with . 
  and for the record ** no ** , monti 's not blaming anyone for italy 's situation , read the goddamn article . 
  is this advanced trolling ? 
  oh come on . 
  economic recession aside , berlusconi hit italy in almost every way . 
  it 's stupid to deny it . 
  that 's a [ major national issue ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u86salencos ) , yes , but we 're talking about how national monuments are compared to penises here : why the *** leaning *** tower of pisa ? 
  ah yes , the salerno-reggio calabria is legendary . 
  people have been talking and will be talking about this for decades . 
  blue1 _ 's comment explains the technical details pretty well . 
  of course everyone knows of that highway , but what can private citizens do , especially in the south with their mentality . 
  finally we have a technical government in office that is trying to straighten things up and this is of course going to cost right now but is gon na be good on the long run . 
  about the payment per se , mafias are stronger than ever and a public payment will only be seen as a victory medal , if anything . 
  no real solutions have been found to this plague , multinational companies stay away from the relatively cheap italian labour force because of this and they go on their own pretty well abroad . 
  perhaps the long term answer to this lies in the delegation of power at an european level where it might be more difficult for them to be `` connected '' but things do n't look good on that side . 
  omg ** this ** . 
  leave brazil out of it and we ( by which i mean mostly italy , of course ) are the world 's champions !, 
  as an italian i 'd like to ask about the pisa tower . 
  not the size , but ... you know ... 
  shut up flanders . 
  * i know , i 'm sorry , i could n't help it . 
  no seriously , stop drinking propaganda it 's unpleasant to read . 
  i 'm sorry , what ? 
  is trolling invented / best done in the us by any chance ? 
   i 'm sure america has some history . 
  they just killed everybody and brought in slaves ftfy, 
  5 out 5 of ours are on the centre-right , what a surprise . 
  there we go !, 
  i was worried i got off without a warning this time . 
  you rock man !, 
  link to this please ? 
  ok i see your point , got anything to tell to an italian ? 
  now why would you go and insult cyprus like that . 
  how is the dear leader these days ? 
  pff , you do n't get to play this game . 
  get back to your first world country and first world politicians . 
  no no it 's called `` italy '' , get your facts straight !, 
  [ here you go ] ( http://nanobotswillenslaveusall.files.wordpress.com/2010/08/north-korea-best-korea.jpg?w=400&amp;h=294 ), 
  you certainly deserve an upvote , but a question like that i could only answer like [ this ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ns_roi0iizw ), 
  perhaps , yes .

  it is not hatred , it 's animosity . 
  but it 's well-founded animosity . 
  to be fair most europeans can appear snob to the american eye . 
  especially considering that if you can locate a foreign country on a map or count without using your fingers you 're a nerd to them . 
  i 'm not talking about the current level , i 'm talking about the post-brexit vote one . 
   monte paschi mean anything to you ? 
  which has nothing to do with '' banking debt '' or whatever that is , and it 's all about non-performing loans . 
  http://www.xe.com/currencycharts/?from=gbp&amp;to=eur&amp;view=10y nope , not at all it 's the lowest since the 2008 crisis even though we 've been depreciating the euro so much it 's almost at par with the us$ . 
  dafaq is banking debt ? 
  did count von count from sesame street teach you international finance ? 
  my father owns several rifles and pistols , i 've been going out hunting with him since i was 6 . 
  this however does n't mean i want people to be able to acquire guns without a licence nor i 'd like people around me owning military-grade weapons . 
  i 'm not blaming anybody , just calling a spade a spade . 
  huh k. r/anarchy and r/lackofanyknowledgeofhowsocietyworks are that way . 
  it seems rich from your perspective because of how depreciated the pound is . 
  look up in the dictionary the words '' public good '' and '' negative externality '' . 
  sure because an historian can not know more about a certain historical period than the people who actually lived during that time . 
  also one can not have an opinion about something without having experienced that directly . 
  great logic . 
  it 's not really that bad , it 's just that basically nobody lives in fucking calabria , so a couple of extra murders bring the average up . 
  regarding other southern regions , the mafia is so well organised there people do n't kill each other in the streets anymore , it works more like a corporation than a gang . 
  they 're actually so big that ` ndrangheta alone has a higher revenue than the deutsche bank and mcdonald 's put together . 
  your banking sector comprises 11.6 % of your economy , which is more than twice other major european countries ' percentage . 
  it 's not hard being the most innovative country when you have so much money to fund investment . 
  italy has a hundred times the number of copyrighted inventions of switzerland , but we also have six times your population . 
  i mean , making money off foreign deposits without creating any new wealth is n't really working , is it ? 
  yeah life is good when you live on others people ' money huh ? 
  '' no pal , it 's not at all about muh ghuns durr durr !!, 
  ! 1 '' what 's the reason then mate ? 
  is it because you 're all fucking retarded ? 
  is n't that russia ? 
  nah i actually live in the nl , it 's just such a peculiar case of human stupidity that it makes for a great one-upper when talking about politics . 
  funny , my european friends and i mention it at least weekly . 
  thanks to u/i124nk8 for the link . 
  `` the sun never sets on the british empire '' there are three country on the italian peninsula . 
  german humor , or lack thereof , strikes again . 
  and to culture really . 
  the sun always sets three times on the italian kingdom . 
  italy never fought with the central powers because the alliance was solely defensive and austria-hungary and germany attacked first . 
  they also did not communicate their intentions to italy before and during the war you fucking knobhead, 
  no we did not, 
  fuck it , this time we 'll take back the iberic peninsula and make a latin union of insolvent countries . 
  at least we won one out of two wws . 
  the euro and the coal and steel pact are about 40 years apart . 
  you have to pay more for imports and to go on vacation , but you also have much more money to spend due to the euro . 
  hard to believe when one says `` gers economy is monocausal '', 
  i agree structural reforms are needed , but fiscal management has little power without a monetary one . 
  you have no clue what the referendum was about . 
  and yet you speak . 
  we do n't really want to borrow because we do n't want to increase our debt to the level where it becomes unmanageable . 
  and we did n't that 's why we did n't have to be bailed out during the crisis . 
  you 're dumb . 
  i 'm not saying it was a bad move strategically , just calling a spade a spade . 
  one of the basic notions of economics is that money is neutral in the long run . 
  yeah we see how going for the risky choice has worked out for you throughout history . 
  allies that did n't communicate their intentions of starting a war beforehand and that began building forts on the border with italy at the very beginning of the war . 
  what ? 
  germany attacked both france and russia with no other reason than that the russians began mobilizing their army . 
  what ? 
  hahahaha, 
  i do n't , i was merely explaining past economic events . 
  germany was not doing at all well before the introduction of the euro . 
  european integration is so that germany does n't try to take over the continent again . 
  we took a risk . 
  switzerland is rich , and this has nothing to do with what currency they have . 
  you did n't ask any question . 
  also the graph is meaningless , two variables can grow at once and this does n't imply causation . 
  as was every other empire doing at the time . 
  also , austria was controlling italian regions . 
  i do n't see how the balkans and greece freeing themselves from ottomans is bad . 
  we did n't want to destroy every other country in the world , only enlarge our empire . 
  oh yeah great 6 years old argument . 
  the italian referendum was n't a black and white situation like the brexit . 
  both the no and yes front had solid arguments , and there is no blame for whoever voted for either . 
  i 'm not . 
  europe has been since wwii . 
  no it 's not , i can give you so many example , a change in the interest rate or even inflation rate target will have an immediate effect on the financial ( and exchange rate ) market . 
  where did you get your economic notions from ? 
  a huge growth that was still not enough to beat italy , which has a smaller population . 
  not it has n't it always had high growth until the middle 90s . 
  the first two were written after . 
  empirically means we could not see this phenomenon , which we did n't because there was no other large monetary union of different countries . 
  without empirical basis we could not test theories and those formulated were no more than philosophy . 
  it 's not always delayed . 
  they did n't have an impact also in the long-run . 
  the difference between western germany and france relatively to their economic masses was n't great . 
  it 's gdp in ppp terms was lower than italy 's for most of the time between 1950 and the 90s . 
  i 'm referring to the 90s and early 2000 ( obviously i thought since we were talking about the introduction of the euro ) . 
  germany had several structural problems one of which was having to pay $ 1.5 trillion due to the reunification with eastern germany . 
  furthermore it slipped into recession in 2003 . 
  how, 
  bahahahaha i did n't know he actually said that . 
  i 'm sure they did n't know , a monetary union this large did n't exist at the time , we had no theoretical nor empirical basis . 
  because those reforms had little impact to the real economy , while the euro had . 
  well a pocker player prefers leaving the table when his pockets are full . 
  having to cooperate because everybody is scared that germany goes off for yet another killing spree is n't really our fault . 
  this calvinistic mentality of `` he is a bad monetary situation , it must be his fault ! '', 
  has really no place in the academic society . 
  italy 's economy is not as strong as it * was because our system of depreciation to increase exports during times of crisis can not be implemented anymore ( while it 's automatically implemented in germany since the euro wo n't appreciate as much due to other eurozone countries ' lower productivity ) . 
  this system is macroeconomically feasible and has worked fantastically well for us for the past 54 years .

  if it is so then the initial skimming during basic training is too lax . 
   anaerobic power : [ ... ] the female top 25th female percentile overlaps the bottom 25th percentile for males this shows that they were too lax in the initial selection . 
  they have full access since 2000 . 
  there have been no decrease in effectiveness caused by having them in combat roles . 
  as of today they make around 8 % of our armed forces . 
  do n't be so sour , kraut . 
  welcome to the 21st century . 
  maybe if we press balkan + central + soviet we can reboot moldova . 
  the cull needs to continue , but because of environmentalist pressures key figures involved in the extermination are being investigated . 
  accusations are about the excessive use of pesticides and the health risks for the population of the area . 
  first time i heard of it . 
  i 'm in my early 20s if this matters . 
  yup . 
  * whoa *, 
  in estonia ? 
  this could work , but strict external border control must be implemented , hopefully with financial help from non bordering countries . 
  a marvelous song i found on / r/italy that i could n't resist to post here when something about russia popped up . 
  [ trading places ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/trading_places ) and [ home alone ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/home_alone ) have been on the air every single year around christmas . 
  we also have the opposite , every christmas has a low effort comedy movie with big names of the trash movie scene that is forgotten weeks after it hits the theaters . 
  edit : [ balto ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/balto_ ( film \\ ) ) is also frequently aired on christmas afternoon , i loved the cartoon as a child . 
  his introduction is a perfect description of italy 's relationship with the vatican . 
  our social progress has oil tanker anchors thanks to it . 
  lube is on me if someone wants to shove it in his holy backside . 
  enjoy the tourism while this fad lasts ... then it will become yet another area that looks like old soviet block houses . 
  it 's hard to deny that there is a lot of resistance to eu influence from eastern europe , just as much as the `` old '' eu is resilient to compromise . 
  interesting , but this statement  this is not to say that the west never uses double speak itself . 
  it does , but of a different kind . 
  in the west , double speak may be used to cut some corners and solve some thorny real-life problems , but it has never become a norm nor led to a sustained double reality . 
  rules can be breached , but they still remain rules , even in the eyes of those who breach them . 
  in the soviet system , it was vice versa : rules were known to be fictional even in the eyes of those who followed them . 
  is hypocritical in and of itself . 
   15 % reports there are disturbances . 
  most of those are made by them \u00af \\ \\ \\ _ ( \u30c4 ) _ / \u00af cue answers with episodical events proving a trend . 
  heh , italy 's worse but does n't get as much of a bad reputation . 
  our government is not so secretly anti-sanctions . 
  they get things wrong with a moderate frequency tho . 
  / r/badhistory is the sub that collects and corrects most of their bigger errors . 
  * another one bites the dust *, 
  our funeral car park is dominated by stretched sedans from mercedes and a few chryslers . 
  well , iceland is in the middle of nowhere . 
  she did good , but not nearly enough to grant her the nobel prize and the fame . 
  when she started yes , but once she got enough recognition and donations increased her guests received less then 10 % of them . 
  she had the means , but wasted them . 
  `` give them comfort as they die '' , she did n't run hospices , but shelters , poorly managed ones . 
  almost like a. . . sealand . 
  germany is still the strongest economy in the eu and it 's not going to change in the foreseeable future . 
  true , they are receiving a lot of migrants , but economic outlook and day to day life has n't changed significantly . 
  sheltering poor people and curing them with nothing but prayers , truly the most catholic way of life . 
  and let 's not forget that becoming a saint requires that at least a miracle must have happened in one 's life ... 
  wow , he 's polish stalin . 
  edit : worded poorly , i meant to compare him to a dictator , not a communist . 
  what does it do ? 
  no , stopping cooperation with the west and allowing even more boats to pass . 
  europe has to , and is actually doing , take the diplomatic route . 
  goes well with a swedish fika . 
  to be fair russia is n't the only one treating its presidents like a cult . 
  trust me , a lot are n't . 
  but we ca n't just throw them into the sea . 
  any uninhabited island big enough to hold a settlement is also a natural reserve . 
  space is not a commodity in the boot . 
  lol yeah , tell that to libya . 
  they menaced multiple times to end all discussions with europe if they saw non libyan vessels in their waters . 
  i ca n't pinpoint the law in the uk code . 
  but i thought there were strict limitations on who can see security footage . 
   lets you share `` subjects of interest '' with other facewatch users even if they have n't been convicted . 
  ie the entire world . 
  one does not require a special permit to become a user . 
  security guards and similar profession need some scrutiny , and even them ca n't see * other premises * footage . 
  exactly , there 's plenty of old mines that can be made viable for nuclear waste storage . 
  and technology can work in making them more and more efficient and safer . 
  there is an immense potential energy ready to be exploited but irrational fears block it , it 's enraging . 
  this should n't stop renewable energy development , just assisting it while it gets enough pace . 
  that 's citizen arrest , most countries in the world have it . 
  can the citizen be held responsible for injuries , even the minor ones , inflicted to the criminal and how does it cost to prove yourself innocent ? 
  the focus of the argument was that most countries make you pay more in fines and fees if you try to stop a burglar then to just letting him go with your stolen possessions . 
  the only effective defense for this is getting a burglary insurance that covers every medium price possession , which honestly is just absurd . 
  * ... has taken my sight , taken my speech , taken my hearing , taken my arms , taken my legs ... *, 
   but ... 
  nuclear !, 
  * * is what led to italy 's referendum on closing our nuclear power stations :(, 
  i 'm baffled by the fact that this does n't violate privacy laws . 
  bad italy , bad !, 
  never mind what happens in the uk . 
  related : france is not alone here , if a thief is not directly threatening your life you essentially have to let him rob you . 
  you have to just call the police and wait , legitimate defense is close to impossible to prove , and even if you manage to do so you 'll owe thousands to a lawyer and will have wasted multiple hours going to court . 
  why ? 
  because it 's quite common for a burglar to sue the victim that injured him . 
  the sad part is that the majority of the population shares the idea that people have to wait for the police to arrive and stop the burglar ( like he 's gon na wait ... ) so things are hardly going to change . 
  they are n't guarding the business ' interests , they are guarding a vital infrastructure . 
  when choosing to deploy a limited amount of troops it 's only logical that they are used to guard something related to italy . 
   images and videos of the incident showed dozens of youths tearing down fences , throwing beer bottles and fireworks at police , and chanting slogans against the proposed centre for asylum-seekers . 
  acting like an ape , way to prove your point of view . 
  idk lol, 
  while also guarding the dam , yes . 
  i have written my previous comment poorly . 
  subtitle :  troops will provide security for contractors from an italian firm who have been given the job of repairing the massive mosul dam after it was seized last year by isil italians troops are protecting an italian business . 
  and now i 'm hungry . 
  they did n't do a background check though . 
  big difference . 
  you know the eu is doing things right if those tech giants act so scared .

  are you kidding me ? 
  renzi divided italians to remain in power . 
  this constitutional reform will not be managed to be modified for 30 years keeping political caste in their armchairs keep doing elite 's interests . 
  please stop here . 
  you called `` again '' a democratic process a `` populist revolt '' . 
  you are again setting `` what would be better '' which rests a relative concept , in terms of different interests . 
  in yesterday 's [ la7 piazzapulita 's opening ] ( http://www.la7.it/piazzapulita/rivedila7/piazzapulita-lascia-o-raddoppia-puntata-01122016-02-12-2016-199501 ) , the m5s leading exponent summarized up their positions and plans . 
  i do n't know how to express this concept in english , they are inherently populist in the sense that they are the only party in italy representing the common people at the moment . 
  ( edit : not demagogist , property of all italian parties ) these fear mongerings resemble same fears that ( media ) accompained trumps victory or brexit vote . 
   pure luck respected security procedures, 
  if there 's a accountable person for this , it 's renzi 's `` i will resign '' . 
  therefore you are citing just another plus of voting no , from a protester 's perspective . 
  if you are comparing a democratically elected m5s governance to arab springs , then you are out of your mind . 
  the funds should be equally distributed, 
  it 's not like the prime minister has the presidente della repubblica 's power to call elections . 
  renzi might not resign , that 's how far he can push . 
  there is very little market for 25 mq apartments in italy and other countries because of `` staying at home longer '' when young and sigle . 
  and economic reasons , eg lower median wages than other states . 
  therefore lower rents . 
  the picture would be different in 60mq 's case . 
  hug of death, 
  yes , economically speaking , either lower the profits or compensate with `` national pride '' sales . 
  in today 's cars and tech manufacturing , automatization has already taken most of the work anyway . 
  it does n't seem a wise investment unless factory work would be paid way less than european counterparts , or automatization would take most of the job . 
  i would n't worry too much , in close future living outside urban areas will be seriously more appreciated . 
  the problem of this reform is that it does n't reform for the better in any way . 
  it does not address none of these problems singularly , not changing in any way for the better . 
  it 's vague , and meantime complicated , because it 's written badly and because to face any of these questions there will be needed specific laws . 
  changing this way means nothing to me , and i 'm sure it will carry bad things for my country in the short and long time . 
  you can disagree on this , but on 4th of december i vote on the reform , not for next parliament . 
  the constitution reform does not give back to the parliament the capability to make laws against today 's problem that is that laws are made by the government . 
  less deputies , in part chosen more locally , will ease mafiaish corruption of them . 
  costs reduction could take place in other forms , they simply voted no to that multiple times . 
  many public services that nowadays do work well and do not press on public balance anymore will be given back to the state , that with lack of coordination will for sure worsen them . 
  moreover it wo n't be possible to spend less consistently , same personnel will work , only conditions and practices would become harder . 
  the reforms italy demands are others , for example it should shock fellow europeans that civil justice simply does not work anymore in less than 8 years . 
  in addition to this , renzi himself has shipwrecked his career , the no will win to make him go home . 
  but around what percentile of wage goes into taxes in spain ? 
  rome is shit to daily live in . 
  bad public transports and traffic/chaos . 
  high cost of life , and general inefficiencies , compared to italian cities average . 
  beautiful environment in free time though . 
  imho of an outsider , only the queen can stop it at this point . 
  i can see what populists there are in italian politics , though no major party is anti-eu . 
  italy can fall into a anti euro currency for rational reasons next year , but no plan has been made yet . 
  great ski slopes, 
  yes , but it 's not like that outside top touristic center and season . 
  it probably remains one of the most beautiful cities in the world to visit if you do n't go in summer . 
  it 's full of art . 
  but it literally stays afloat with that income , because otherwise , withouth maintenance , palaces would collapse . 
  therefore this statistics is stupid, 
  well , our politicians do their best to make rich way richer while normal people get poor and do nothing , what outcome would you expect ? 
  i would read a good article about this theme , detailed with well researched wide economic figures . 
  this explains the nine non-euro countries . 
  even if it was * just * french , spaniards and italians , it would be a concern . 
  off course i do n't know 180 million people . 
  in italy every word from germany is called a berlin diktat . 
  you are the one who can not see . 
  do n't believe me then . 
  i do n't know . 
  i 'm certainly no international politics expert , but i 'm sure a big part of europe wo n't trust germany 's proposals until the political layout has changed into something not seen as a unwanted dictator anymore . 
  absolutely , i meant germans should change in order to get better paneuropean relationships, 
  let 's see what happens up to january , though europeans do n't like merkel , germany should change imo . 
  he created this uncertainty when he said exactly these words some months ago .

  the title is a false statement, 
  in the lead years many people died for terrorism . 
  being recognizable in public is a principle that every italian agrees and identifies on .

  there 's a 1:250 ( costantine time ) model made under mussolini , now stored in the roman civilization museum in the eur district , that you can virtually visit [ here ] ( https://www.google.com/culturalinstitute/collection/museo-della-civilta-romana?projectid=art-project ) .

  it seems like you do n't know that there is a step between normal pasteurized and uht , which is microfiltration . 
  it tastes like the normal one , and it must be refrigerated , but it lasts a lot longer , 15 days . 
  yeah , but it 's two methods to manage the same thing . 
  or are houses going down and being rebuilt in germany ? 
  they are not , the property is owned by fewer people than it is in other countries , where `` the family '' is the centre of the society , instead of the individual . 
  i know first handedly the downsides of this , but generally rents are really low now and many think there could be a house bubble popping sometime soon . 
  it 's not going to happen , because the population really believes in putting the money into property . 
  therefore they spend less and economy is shit . 
  but still, 
  i know, 
  in reality average ** wealth ** of italians is much higher than german , because of distributed accumulated property value . 
  it 's the ** product ** that is higher there . 
  except black market, 
  schr\u00f6dinger military, 
  no , some sources like the annual study on drugs to the parliament shows a 32 % have tried it . 
  op 's source says 29.3 . 
  sincerity appreciated, 
  mostly normal people who also regularly consume and give it to friends for special price . 
  but a big part ends into street sales , which is almost totally composed by immigrants . 
  op try to get more shades into next map ; an example : italy has 29.3 , while france has 30.6 , and denmark 36.5 . 
  quite misleading . 
  then propose a alternative to tap water that does not make it worse . 
  i never drank bottled , and i 'm sure it 's psychological for the most part , but somewhere it is needed .

because it does n't work , the only reason why dealing with the migration crisis or the economic crisis has been so hard is that each member state was thinking for itself instead of actually doing something about it . 
  if we had a federal union we could do much more . 
  if there are talks about a unified army or an european finance minister it means we are already going in that direction , so we might as well become the european federal union right away . 
  it really depends how the whole process would work , either way sooner or later the politicians would have to choose between less power or no power and the smart ones would get on the less power train making it even harder for the others to avoid complying with the referendum . 
  not sure how the process of becoming a federation would be , would it be a thing just a day after the referendum ? 
  if so , they would have no power to begin with . 
  would it be a transitional period of a couple years ? 
  then if they do n't do their job they could get fined by the eu which would have federal authority over them . 
  btw if such referendum is won with a qualified majority , i do n't think the population would be quiet and leave the government do as it pleases . 
  so what would you expect them to do ? 
  it 's not like they have any power over the army so how would they stop it ? 
  btw i do n't think politicians losing power will be a problem , you could have said the same thing when we made the european stole and steel community or when we made the eu or pretty much every time we give a bit more power to the eu . 
  the constitution gives the power in the hand of its citizens which than choose some people to work for them . 
  if there is a lawful referendum where a qualified majority votes in favor of a federal union , the politicians would have to accept it since they would not have much choice . 
  it 's not like they have to , the idea of the federation is to put together our resources and improve our union and therefore the countries that make it . 
  we already are a weird kind of almost federation and we surely are more than a simple confederation , there are even talks of an eu military , we have an eu parliament and we have an eu currency . 
  if we become a federation in my opinion most of the current problems would get solved much quicker and effectively . 
  with that said , i do agree that right now it is not the right moment since it probably would require a referendum in each member state and there is no way that the european federal union would win . 
  it 's not like the uk cared much about creating a strong national identity , the less united means the less dangerous . 
  we have been united under the eu and its previous iterations for a long time , we are n't going from totally separate countries to a union but from making the current union a more centralized one . 
  on another note we do share a common identity and there is no denying it , if i can live in rome or madrid or berlin and have pretty much a similar life it means we are n't much different . 
  sure you can find differences between european countries but they become nothing if you see how similar we are when put in comparison to african , asian and american countries . 
  you should learn a bit more about india , they have 23 official languages and 122 major languages and 1599 other languages ... way more diverse than us for sure . 
  if you want to stay in europe you have belgium and switzerland , a bit less extreme but still countries with different languages . 
  have you ever heard about a nation called india ? 
  if a developing country can manage it , we should as well . 
  just one word : india . 
  btw if the current eu can work with different languages i do n't see how it would be a problem if we became a federal union . 
  more than the reason it is a symptom and while the country is trying to fix the internet problem , we are ' t really fixing the real disease that caused the symptom . 
  first they are affected , second they are smaller . 
  just to be clear it 's not like italy does n't have internet coverage , for example i live in a small town of 1000 people and i get 20mbps . 
  do n't think we are n't upgrading the infrastructure as well since the plan is to get 85 % of the population to have 100mbps or greater and 100 % of the population with at least 30mbps by 2020 . 
  adding to that , italy is actually investing quite a lot and the infrastructure is getting way better every year . 
  with that said , it is still hard to get fiber optics to a small town on the mountains . 
   there was a significant difference between the generations , with just one in three 65-74-year-olds using the internet at all , while among the 14-34 age group , that percentage was 92 percent . 
   `` if twitter forces me to see these things , then they 'll have to see them too , '' so ... how does it work ? 
  does a twitter employee come to your house and make you use the app and see them ? 
  yep, 
  no problem . 
  poland has a 44-44 split with the rest neutral . 
  i really do n't know where you got the data but is not correct and you can check the raw data i used . 
  i misunderstood you at first , yes you are right you could read the data in a different way . 
  i think this map is a fairly logical way to put the data on a map divided by just a couple of colors , but of course there are many other maps that could be done with the same data . 
  belgium has a 51 % of people that do n't trust the eu ( do n't know where you found that 46 but is not the correct number ) therefore gets to be the red . 
  funny thing is , they trust their own national parliament and government even less . 
  the numbers are really low , it 's not like they super love the eu ... it 's more about them hating their own government/parliament more than the eu . 
  if you think about it , it does make sense . 
  made it : https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6r60g1/trust_in_eu_national_government_and_national/, 
  in three different surveys they were asked how much they trusted the eu/national government/national parliament , this is a map that shows which institution europeans trust more . 
  lots of data so if i made any mistake , let me know . 
  edit : just noticed i missed luxembourg , it should be red , therefore more people trust the national government . 
  by the way , an interesting fact : most countries have less trust in their own government and parliament than the trust they have in the eu . 
  here is the raw [ data ] ( http://i.imgur.com/bjtpjwv.png ), 
  i rather have no italy than another fascist italy , i do n't want my country to become like the hellholes some of these people are coming from . 
  just to be clear , i am talking about the rule of law which means the country has to follow the laws to do anything . 
  if the country can start following only the laws it likes than it means the country is destroyed . 
  it would n't be the democratic republic of italy , it would be fascist italy . 
  if you go against the rule of law , the country is destroyed today . 
  i am more afraid of my country not following the rule of law and possibly become again a dictatorship than of an african smuggler . 
  i obviously want the situation to be fixed but you might not realize that going against the rule of law means destroying the country . 
  even if they were enemy combatants you ca n't shoot them if they surrender , that would be a human rights violation and would go agains the geneva convention , maybe the most you could do is take them as prisoners of war . 
  i too think that it is a lot but in every city i have been , going from the airport to the city is always expensive since they know that you do n't really have much choice . 
  they have even the crew asking for asylum and the captain under charges of human trafficking ... that is too much to be natural , they have to be performance artists or something . 
  are they trying to be funny or is it just something that comes natural to them ? 
   so for me the only logical solution is to up the stakes for the smugglers , meaning their lives . 
  are they really ready to bet on that . 
  you mean the death penalty ? 
  we as a union do n't do that and for good reasons i would add . 
  i could understand if you want to make the prison sentence be a lifetime one but i do n't see how the death penalty would help at all . 
  just to be clear i am talking in the case they surrender , of course if they use force the navy will reply with force . 
  we just have to arrest them so if they surrender there is no reason for the navy to shoot at them , just to print a clear picture : they use small boats with no weapons ... i do n't see how any of them would not surrender if approached by the italian navy . 
  mostly help with processing them and therefore send those that do n't have a right for asylum back . 
  well if the process is faster , it means it would be easier and faster to send back those that do n't have a right to asylum which most of them do n't . 
  as far as fixing the actual problem , we are at least training the libyan coastguard . 
  what comes next should be fixing libya while striking a deal with tunisia and egypt to open their ports and therefore stop the flow to europe . 
  yep , but the ticket from stansted to the centre of london was n't that much cheaper either so it does n't really matter . 
  you will always have to spend the money to get from the airport to the city . 
  found this :  there is a train going from brussels zaventem airport to brussels central station every 10 minutes between 5am and midnight , 7 days a week . 
  the ride takes 18 minutes and costs $ 12,70 as i was saying , it 's not like going from the airport to the centre is going to be that much cheaper anyway . 
  they get dropped on those island or at most in sicily which is an island as well but you ca n't expect a tiny island like lampedusa to hold that many people , there is n't even the physical space to hold them all there . 
  in theory , they would wait there to have them processed but since there are too many of them , they get redistributed on other ports as well where we have other centres where we hold and process them ... problem is that even those centres are full now . 
  as the articles says , italy is making new laws to make the whole process faster and the eu is proposing to give us some money and people to deal with it . 
  yeah ... if you watch a map , lampedusa is even closer than malta and it 's not like a small island nation like that can take all of them , and it would still and european problem so i do n't see what that would change . 
  as far as tunisia and egypt , as i was saying , they do n't allow them to dock so unless you can convince them ... they ca n't go there either . 
   forbid it for a week , state it far and wide so it reaches the people abusing this whole situation and see how there would be zero shipwrecks there . 
  i understand people in the north did n't care about this before these people reached your land but even when there was no ngos in the mediterranean sea and libya had a dictatorship , we still had plenty of people coming to italy during the summer . 
  we can limit the amount of people coming here , but if you really think they will become zero you are deluded . 
  it 's the only one that lets them dock . 
  btw italy is closer than you might think . 
   why not give the `` lets save them and drop them off at the nearest land instead of acting as a ferry service '' solution ? 
  the problem is that laws are generic and not just about specifics , i understand why if you save someone from a shipwreck you do n't drop them on just the closest land but on the closest ** safe ** land . 
  for example if for some reason i was on a ship and i happen to be saved near the north korean coast i would like to be dropped in south korea . 
  of course that is an extreme example but i would imagine is what the law is designed to stop . 
  it would be nice if the situation was simpler , italy ca n't possibly take more people and something must be done so i would like a solution that does n't lack pragmatism and does not hurt our rights . 
  as i understand it , they are n't necessarily `` brainpower '' but just manpower as in the italian cost guard could use some help . 
  you do have to depart in specific dates and lose pretty much any kind of extras but since the flight is even less than 2 hours , it does n't really matter that much imho . 
  they offer the same cheap prices for brussels as well . 
  i di n't pay for any extra so just those 20 $, 
  i paid 20 $ to go from my local airport , not a big one , to london and come back ... i would say they are pretty close to free already . 
  ** translation : **  if the italian government considers it useful , the eu commission is ready to `` mobilize emergency funds up to $ 100 million for measures needed to enforce the minniti law , and in particular to speed up the asylum and repatriation process , and to assist communities and local authorities that host migrants , and support integration . '',

  there are already 81 millions german citizens . 
  migration is probably even less then the error tolerance of that projection .

  but without an additional scenario the whole sentence is only offensive . 
  we 're talking about regulating hate speech , not offensive . 
  if matters escalate at a level requiring an official definition it will be the role of the judiciary system . 
  hate speech is incitement to violence and discrimination due to race , ethnicity , religion , sexual orientation or gender identity , anything else is n't hate speech . 
  the only time when the legitimacy of hate speech is called into discussion is , at least in the country i live in , to justify orthodox and discriminatory ideas . 
  afaik the sexual and gender parts are lacking from bulgaria , germany , italy , latvia and czech republic , and this should change . 
  there 's a difference between offensive and hate speech .

  this has left italy without a say on eu migration in the cabinet , despite being at the center of the refugee crisis .

  it would cost a ton of resources . 
  the alternative is housing them in empty barracks and other abandoned/dismissed buildings in the city area where services and infrastructure are already present , thus achieving a better integration on top of a massive saving in costs .

  the reasons to adopt the euro were purely political . 
  the increase in efficiency and trade provided by the single currency can be ( and have been ) counteracted by macroeconomic instability . 
  which is due to how the exchange rate and thus the interest rate can not be naturally stabilized in case of an asymmetric shock . 
  italy became one of the sick men of europe mostly due to the euro . 
  germany passed from being the sick man of europe to its powerhouse , mostly due to the euro . 
  source : italian majoring in economics in the nl . 
  edit : i 'd like to add that these are initial issues , we do not know how the situation will progress . 
  it went much worse in the short-run for the us when all the states adopted the dollar . 
  or anywhere else really . 
  no , the central bank 's main instrument is the interest rate . 
  most central banks have some inflation target . 
  however in case of negative output gaps the cb can , does , and should counteract them . 
  which germany did several times but to smaller extents than other eu countries . 
  that 's like the high school microeconomics dude . 
  huh so that 's why you gave up pretty much every power your central bank has ? 
  well you do n't know how the erm worked . 
  the countries had no control over their currency anymore , the only one who had was germany , which did n't have to abide to national rules anymore but those of the ecb . 
  you 'd be in spain 's situation right now if it was n't for the euro , if it was n't for us . 
  it was an external shock to the economy that had little to do with the national central banks ( or politics for what matters ) . 
  it was the central currency duty as such to deprecate for the benefit of the rest of the soon-to-be eurozone . 
  while most countries valued the european project more than national interests and remained in the system , some ( such as the uk ) did not . 
  which was the same situation france and italy were facing . 
  germany could have devalued the mark in order to stabilize the situation across the continent . 
  yeah , i mean , how you passed from being the sick man of europe to being its powerhouse in less than a decade while several european countries saw the opposite path has little to do with the german cannibalisation of other eu markets . 
  it 's all about them reforms , right . 
  with a gdp ( ppp ) lower than both italy and france since the early 70s and several housing crisis the uk was not really that much competitive . 
   the only reason why their ems membership failed is that they valued their own currency too high for polical reasons no , the reason is for the most part the one i mentioned before . 
  at least that what i was taught in my macroeconomics courses in the nl . 
  [ as always ] ( https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/69/df/2c/69df2c209416c45fcbb3eb76c1fde9a5.jpg ) . 
  yeah [ always ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/00/roman_empire_trajan_117ad.png/250px-roman_empire_trajan_117ad.png ) i mean [ always !, 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ef_english_proficiency_index#2016_rankings ), 
  blow me . 
  simply because while the deutschemark was the central currency in the eu during the transition process to the euro germany did n't depreciate its currency , causing french and italian economies to pass from stable growth to stagnation and recession . 
  the uk would have seen the same fate if they did n't get out of the erm just in time . 
  yeah cuz you 'd lose . 
  you 're our eastern european bro !, 
  auguri !, 
  i did n't mean to include the uk when i mentioned the eu . 
  i did because your point was that all powers spy to the same or similar extent as the us does . 
  i still do n't see any source for that french spying operations allegation . 
  i know what the fvey is , i wrote a paper about it . 
  you 're not providing any argument for your point . 
  never heard of it , sauce ? 
  certainly eu countries do n't , not to that extent , especially with an ally . 
  some countries want to avoid war at all costs you know . 
  not really , i doubt any other country reads merkel 's private cellphone messages and calls . 
  `` nation '', 
   both things happened ( or in the case of brexit , is due to happen in the near future ) . 
  we 're not talking about hypotheticals where they did n't happen . 
  we 're talking about their impact on events today . 
  yeah and the fact that you 're irish and not british it more important than whether your companies pay an extra 10 cents for exports to the uk . 
   tdor was a criticism of the eu . 
  as such bojo 's politics play a fundamental part in it 's validity as a source . 
  hell , it argues turkey should be admitted to the eu . 
  ( something bojo keeps flipflopping on ) sure because no politician has ever pushed an agenda for the sole purpose of climbing the political ladder . 
  also a person can never change his mind throughout more than a decade . 
   friend , you 're the one arguing otherwise . 
  i 'll give you a free tip though . 
  lay off the ad hominems that do n't add to the context of what you 're saying . 
  says the knobhead who used them several times in this short conversation . 
   to english speakers they are out of place . 
  weird i thought i was an english speaker . 
  well i guess you speak for all of us . 
   utter nonsense . 
  you 're talking about events that occurred 8 generations ago , and saying they matter more than current/recent events ? 
  there is absolutely no basis for this . 
  the facts that i do not live in austria and speak italian instead of german do have a certain degree of relevance in my daily activities . 
  and this is just one small event . 
   brexit matters a hell of a lot more to current irish policy towards the uk than the anglo-irish treaty of 1921 no it does not . 
  if your country did n't get independent from the uk there would n't even be an irish foreign policy . 
   so ... you agree with the `` views '' of boris johnson , i would n't broadcast that he 's an amazing academic , with a vast knowledge of the ancient world . 
  the fact that he 's an utter cunt in the political stage does not make him any less knowledgeable . 
   it should be perfectly obvious that things that happened centuries ago are less important than current events are you a parrot or just stupid ? 
  no it 's not , the fact that 200 years ago my region was freed from austrian occupation has a much stronger influence than anything that has happened in the last 5 years . 
  i 'm atheist but region was practically law and culture , which through the centuries defined many mental frameworks we still use today . 
  and this is not even my argument . 
  the book `` the dream of rome '' took this position , which i agree on . 
  you fucking knobhead . 
  that 's such a retarded question i wo n't even answer it . 
  the roman empire was christian before monarchies arose . 
  yeah call me back when you 're in the g8 , or even g20 . 
  no , but they 're somewhat relevant . 
  this is just a guess , eh , but a few thousand years have a stronger impact than a few decades . 
  they surely are n't in the eu . 
  it has nothing to do with terrorism . 
  europe has always defined itself by being christian . 
  actually the m5s would be penalized because a yes vote would solidify renzi 's power . 
  the reasons why turkey has n't joined yet are economical ( poor institutions ) and cultural ( they 'd be the first and only islamic nation in the eu . 
  the reason is pretty complex and dates to centuries back before the unification of the country . 
  but long story short one general thought `` you know what 's cooler than one aircraft carrier ? 
  two . 
  uh , i 'll go get my horse head . 
  we have twice the number of your aircraft carriers . 
  come and get us ping pong . 
  i have no idea why the balkans were included . 
  i would neve eat their food . 
  we do . 
  oh i want to help people so i have a big ego ? 
  great logic right there .

  oh for sure , but as things stand he 's barred from public office and i do believe that stands until he wins an appeal ... considering he was trying to worm his way in as president of the republic that 's a huge blow to him . 
  while it is far from the best it has at least managed to convict the very same man who is responsible for turning it into a joke . 
  hey guys , should we tell him ? 
  libya is not in the middle east by the way ... 
  do keep in mind that the question is `` have you ever been unfaithful '' ... lots of people cheat in their teen years because hormones and relationships not being seen as serious . 
  many people have also just fucked up once in their life . 
  this graph does n't really give you any idea of how many people actively cheat . 
  pretty sure the guy was poking fun at the militarization of american police . 
  oh yeah in virginia the liquors situation is the same . 
  today me and my friend were going to do brunch at 11 . 
  we realized last night that everyone is out of vodka and the liquor store wo n't be open till 1 today so we had to reschedule brunch for 1.30 ... 
  new orleans is one of very few places in the us where you can have open containers of alcohol outside of bars and private property . 
  it felt a little nit like partying back home . 
  im so with you man . 
  i had so much fun when i visited new orleans for this exact reason . 
  good thing i am only on facebook to keep track of all the cool pictures of me people take at events rather than to look at what others are posting ~, 
  im expecting them to show up on netflix with an expanded budget for wrecking things and building death contraptions on wheels, 
  oh yeah because if someone calls you up to ask for your approval of the dictator you totally believe that they have no idea or record who they are calling ... 
  in none and i did n't state that they are . 
  those were mmeant as two separate statemets . 
  so what passes for a source around your parts is dropping extensive wikipedia articles that do not even address what is being talked about ? 
  offspring in mammals becomes a separate body only following birth . 
  technically speaking embryos are more akin to a parasite, 
  there is plenty of downvoted comments at the bottom for you to go join . 
  you sure seem to be very obsessed with anuses . 
  luxkily for you this ruling should allow you to finally leave the closet . 
   you have to understand that from my point of view , abortion is murder . 
  well luckily there is no scientific evidence that this is the case . 
  a embryo is not a baby . 
  if you want to maintain your outdated point of view in the face of scientific evidence you are fred to do so . 
  however you should be prepared to be regarded as a dinosaur for clinging to your irrational belief , as society becomes more and more progressive and illuminated by scientific knowledge . 
  you have to remember that while everyone is entitled to their opinion that does not mean all opinions are equally valid . 
  in this specific case your opinion that abortion somehow equals murder is one that lacks any evidence to back it up and thus should be irrelevant to the public discourse and public policy should not be based upon it . 
  anyway as we were saying your way of thinking is luckily going extinct . 
  and not to be patronizing but at 18 you likely have no idea of the kind of sacrifices that having a child entails . 
  give it a decade of living away from your parents and you might even reconsider your position . 
  now if you will excuse me i have some celebrating to do since my life is fluorishibg instead of me being stuck raising my exgirlfriend 's child . 
  thank god for abortions !, 
   i 'm not selfish enough to kill a baby just because it would make my life a bit harder to keep it . 
  and i am not selfish enough to allow an embryo to develop into a baby that is unwanted and that i could not possibly afford to raise . 
  this ruling does not affect you in any way , you can still pop out all the kids you want if that 's what you desire from life . 
  it does however offer protection to those who do n't share in your particular opinion and should go a way to ensure that they do n't have to resort to dangerous back alley abortions in those backward countries where the religious opinions of a few are put above the medical needs of the many . 
  and let me guess the people you are talking about are your friends from the church youth program right ? 
  luckily for us that 's not how the majority of young people think . 
  if you ever end up having an accident and getting a girl pregnant before you have any stability in your life you will be very glad for this ruling . 
  speck is not bacon either . 
  i dont see you eat in bacon straight off the rasher without cooking it first ... 
  seriously it makes my blood boil when people try to whitewash it and pretend like the allied command had no clue about the camps until they started making territorial gains in continental europe . 
  mafia is commonly used to refer to more than just cosa nostra , it is an umbrella term in italian . 
  the point that was being made above is that saying `` ndrangeta mafia '' just sounds wrong in italian , just like `` mafia cosa nostra '' sounds off . 
  it 's just not how the word is used and any italian knows what you are talking about just by saying ndrangheta or cosa nostra . 
  this used to be the case . 
  nowadays the real profit for the mafia is up north , they have invested their illegal gains in legal industries up north . 
  we jews make plenty of fun of ourselves , thanks !, 
  and there is a difference between making fun and making hateful statements against a minority that has been historically persecuted . 
  i wish i had a proper winter , i 'd switch my dirtbike over to a snowbike kit and tear up some mountains ... instead i just have to contend with black snowy slush making my bike skid all over the city . 
  a wall built out of bombs ? 
   ... did you look at my flag ? 
  i 'm italian . 
  they just opened the first dominos in milan this week with three more to open by end of the year . 
  apparently the place is half deserted . 
  i do n't really think that you can compare covering up the cultural heritage we should be proud of and having the decency of not answering the door naked ... 
  anybody got a good list of these out of the way places to hit up ? 
  planning a motorcycle trip this spring and while i am hitting the capitals i do n't want that to be the focus of my trip . 
  by providing shelter from the apocalypse apparently ? 
  you are missing the point . 
  this is n't about belittling individual choices . 
  it is about recognizing that society does in fact create expectations for individuals based on their sexual identity . 
  it follows quite obviously that societal expectations create a pressure to conform and fulfill that role . 
  so in your example , nobody is actually telling a woman who decides to fulfill a traditional female role that their choice is only due to society . 
  instead it recognizes that that pressure exist and there are individuals whose individuality is stymied by the social pressure . 
  the whole reason we do have programs that encourage women to go into science is that we have come to understand that the social image of the woman as caretaker is restricting to individuals and women can be perfectly good scientists or lawyers or whatever else they wish to be . 
   as far as i 'm aware it 's just a theory right ? 
  are you implying theories are not evidence based ? 
  i do n't think you understand what a scientific theory is ... 
  oh man , one time i went to subway on my motorcycle to grab a quick bite . 
  i was in a bad mood for whatever reason , and did not want to interact with anybody , when on my way out a group of these gutter punks tries to engage me in conversation , probably to beg for some cash . 
  when i just ignored them and started putting my helmet on one of them launched into this whole rant about society and i quote `` just cause you guys ignore us does n't make us go away '' . 
  it actually made me laugh internally and cheered me up a tiny bit . 
  i guess apple will manage to spin taking features away as innovation this time ? 
  right , but for a phone that does n't do anything really new ? 
  this is my main complaint with american pizza ... back home i could have my own pizza for lunch and be fine , in the us that 'd put me at like , 50 % over my daily caloric intake, 
  oh no , you do not get to blame us for the burned , oversugared mess you pass for coffee, 
  when you need to cover everything in sugar to make it palatable for you ... yeah , that 's the kind of sense of taste you can expect a fussy child to have . 
  i mean there is something to be said for people that never developed an actual sense of taste , and just cover everything in sugary sauces instead ... 
  america just needs to stop its crime against pizza . 
  pizza is supposed to be a personal dish , ai n't nobody taking a slice off my pizza but me . 
   the vote showed we dont dont like you all that vote showed is that a bunch of impressionable hillbillies could n't be bothered to find out about what the eu does until after they voted for leaving it . 
  eu countries combined still have more gold medals than anyone else , so even with quotas , assuming you only have the best european athletes participating , you 'd still see the eu bring home the most gold . 
  god i miss home ... 
  honestly i have never even heard it referred to as a christian holiday before this thread , always celebrated ferragosto instead . 
  stop building your own strawman of leftists, 
  the clintons have always acted like rules do not apply to them , mostly because in their experience they indeed do not . 
  they also do not seem to grasp that they can be fact checked in seconds thanks to the internet , which is one of the reasons that hillary 's constant lying has made her approval tank amongst millenials while she is still popular woth baby boomers who get their news from the same media that support her and wo n't question her two faced nature . 
  so they have less gun crime than other states ... and yet way more gun crime than places with sensible gun regulation . 
  you mean the privately owned telecoms that use infrastructure built with public money and then gouge people for using that infrastructure ? 
  yeah not getting a lot of sympathy from me out of this one . 
  what i really ca n't figure out is where they left east and west dakota, 
  hello from milan , please excuse us as we [ upgraded your dish ] ( http://mangiarebuono.it/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/cotoletta-1.jpg ), 
  i mean that 's not aby better is it ?

  but then again who knows ? 
  as i said-either add all the regions or none . 
  [ here they are ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/regions_of_italy ), 
  i personally do n't see why this comment got so downvoted . 
  if anything turkey belongs in asia much more that in europe . 
  most of it 's territory is in asia most of it 's population is in asia the language is much closer to arabic than to any european the religion is the same as in the middle east ( asia ) the culture is more asian than european turkey , through all it 's history has been a big threat and enemy to european countries , not the other way around . 
  i do n't see why they try to be in europe so badly . 
  is it a shame to be asia to them ? 
  because that 's the truth . 
  i thought we already talked about this germany ... 
  [ northern italy was hit by a tornado ] ( http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/video/2013/may/05/northern-italy-tornado-hail-video ), 
  i am talking about immigration and immigrants that stay for the rest of their life . 
  especially those who come from outside of europe . 
  schengen is awesome concerning economies since it makes tourism easier and it makes trade much easier and faster . 
  not to mention how comfortable it is not to wait for hours at a border . 
  i see . 
  no i am against non-european multiculturalism and i 'm pretty sure that is exactly what op wanted to know . 
  i failed to understand you . 
  what hegemony ? 
  i have nothing against other europeans but i do think it 's better for everyone to stay in their country seeing as some europeans countries ( bulgaria , romania , poland ) have a population on the decline and desperately need their people in their country not in another one . 
  i see . 
  well ass holes . 
  but come on , why not feed poor people ? 
  i 'm not greek so i 'm not aware of the other actions of gd . 
  and you ca n't compare them to hitler . 
  thanks to hitler 60 million people died . 
  who did these guys kill ? 
  they just give away food as they see fit . 
  at this point i 'm just starting to wonder when war will break out in asia . 
  as i said-they can feed whoever they want to . 
  yes , what they do is immoral . 
  yes , what they do is unfair . 
  and yes , thanks to them some people will go to bed with full stomachs . 
  you must be american . 
  plus would you rather have the people starve ? 
  well if i want to give out free food i 'd give it to whoever the fuck i want . 
  if i want to i 'll just give free food to people that have two different eyes . 
  i do n't see why they ca n't spread their resources the way they find necessary . 
  i think that europe is already way too multicultural and i would like it if we were less multicultural . 
  i see but if the uk leaves the eu does that mean that all of these products will stop being sold here ? 
  i mean if the uk leaves think we can still do business , no ? 
  i mean the eu in general . 
  so basically oil since we have the other things . 
  we can get oil from elsewhere too ( probably for a big more money ) . 
  what you are basically saying is that if scotland were to leave the uk ( i mean it 's scotland that provides the oil right ? ), 
  the uk would be useless . 
  as i said-it is better for you guys to stay in . 
  i 'm uninformed ... what do you guys sell to us ? 
  in my opinion * nothing * serious would happen . 
  economies-i do n't think the uk either helps or ruins the economies of anyone so not lots of change here . 
  immigration-the uk would stop getting so many immigrants from eu countries such as bulgaria , romania and poland . 
  that is if you decide to stop them you wo n't be forced to by the eu . 
  also you wo n't have to give them equal job chances by 2014 . 
  so that changes for you guys . 
  politics-it will be much more peaceful . 
  nobody will disagree with * herr * merkel . 
  no big debates since you guys seem to be the only ones who disagree with general decisions . 
  defense-we 're currently not at war so nothing would change . 
  if war had to break out i 'm pretty sure the uk would still be on the side of the eu so no big change . 
  if the uk decides to not help the eu than we lose a nuclear power . 
  no major changes . 
  i think he uk would lose more than the eu but whatever . 
  could anyone explain to me how these `` studies '' are done because obviously i fail to understand them and how they are done . 
  really ? 
  no basis ? 
  how would you explain the sharia then ? 
  many are * still * suspicious is wrong . 
  many are beginning to be suspicious and with time there will be more and more . 
  i do n't care about the bullshit you think-islam is violent , it does n't respect human rights . 
  so are most of muslims . 
  islam is scary . 
  you are right . 
  i did say it will take more time . 
  what we ( as a continent ) really need is a strong leader . 
  one that will not compromise and will do anything for our well being . 
  a strong person . 
  i see merkel is trying to be that person but she 's just not good enough and she never will be . 
  the truth about the warsaw countries is that while the change really needed to happen it did n't have to happen so fast . 
  the local economies should have had more time to get used to the new system . 
  calm down bulgaria 's population wo n't be replaced by immigrants . 
  it will be replaced by the native turks and gypsies . 
  i know it sucks but unless we do something that 's the way things will be . 
  i really like the eu as an idea and i hope it stays and expands hopefully adding all countries in europe ( which will surely take more than 10 years though ) . 
  we should really make the euro official everywhere but that would take longer because countries such as bulgaria and romania need to be more stable economically . 
  otherwise the euro will fuck them up just like it fucked up italy . 
  the country needs to ready for it . 
  get rid of all borders . 
  100 % free trade . 
  united health care and infrastructure and education . 
  while every country should have it 's own juridical system we should all accept common laws . 
  this will take more than 10 years . 
  the way things are going though europeans wo n't last really wrong . 
  we are currently being replaced by foreigners and we all know how their countries looks like . 
  the same is going to happen here . 
  well if you are born in denmark wre n't you danish ? 
  i love how the us brainwashes people into being patriotic for a country that is barely has a nation . 
  come on people i realize that not * everyone * is uneducated , criminal , slave trader . 
  some are most recent add ups but still immigrants and do not really respect immigrants of any sort . 
  there are a few exceptions . 
  ok ... i said they are unwanted now not that they were unwanted then ( which they were but i had n't said it yet ) i never said unclean either .

  yep . 
  many young people - at least in the centre/south - want to join the armed forces not least because for many of us this may be the only chance of ever getting a decent job with a decent pay , timely paycheques , an actual contract and benefits . 
  hell , if you manage to join you can even hope to retire one day !, 
  at this point they do n't even need recruiters or campaigns of any kind so many are the people who want to get in ; problem is , the positions available are very few and assigned through open competitions ( in 2014 there were some 3000 candidates for 167 vacancies , and i 'm talking about ncos so nothing special really ) . 
  i find this a tad absurd . 
  & nbsp ;  how does your country view ... conscription ? 
  & nbsp ; we 've had conscription from 1846 to 2005 - it 's been suspended ever since - so not many of those who 've had the chance to ` go under the arms ' miss it . 
  but i like to think that it provided , at the very least , an occasion for many 18-year-olds to actually do something useful with their lives which , due to the hostile socio-economical climate , has now become sort of impossible . 
  this said the general consensus among the ` older ' generations is that conscription made you a grown man with balls and a spine . 
  if you managed to survive all the hazing going on there that is ( dangerous pranks , juke-boxing , brawls , etc. ) . 
  & nbsp ;  how does your country view ... military spending ? 
  & nbsp ; depends on who you ask . 
  politicians of all parties have been desperate to cut anything but their fat salaries so you can imagine just how beneficial such a policy may been for our armed forces ( but there 's plenty of waste , especially among the top brass ) . 
  ordinary people do n't care that much about it . 
  & nbsp ;  h\u010di & nbsp ; bless you !, 
  i spent around 10 , 20 quid for each photocopy i bought from the uni 's printing shop ; the professors themselves made these . 
  you can also ask them to send you the relevant pdfs/slides , most will comply . 
  naturally there were a couple of courses which required actual books but you can easily find second-hand editions around , and even the '' required '' textbooks never costed more than 30 $ . 
  actual monarchist here !, 
  here 's a few corrections : 1 ) emanuele filiberto is not - and has never been - the heir to the italian throne , seeing how he was born well after his father was disinherited by the late king himself in 1970 . 
  amedeo di savoia-aosta is the current heir , the u.m.i. 
  recognises him as such . 
  2 ) the guy in question is not a prince ... or even part of the royal family for that matter . 
  neither is his father . 
  3 ) we have n't had a monarchist party since the '70s ; the u.m.i. 
  is simply an organisation ( albeit one with royal assent ) . 
  roman here . 
  currently living with grandpas in a council house ... 
  i happened to lose my previous job and could n't find another ever since , parents got divorced so i had to move there . 
  at the moment i 'm an apprentice electrician under my father but i get no money out of it . 
  it 's not that bad because my grandparents truly need a hand with chores and i 'm glad to help , it 's the least i can do !, 
  the flat in question ( 80 m \u00b2 ) is located on the third floor of a condo from the 1920s with no lift and external piping ; this means you get warm water in summer and ice-cold in winter . 
  nice . 
  stairs can be a bit dangerous because the marble used in most steps is still that from mussolini 's times and it 's slippery/sloped/chipped in more than a few places . 
  there 's a kitchen with a giant-ass hood right above the stove - a relic from the times in which these used to run on coal - plus two bedrooms , a bathroom and a living room . 
  the layout of the house is kinda weird due to it being basically a looong corridor and all the rooms have high ceilings for some reason . 
  rent is 300 $ / month , minus the bills but including heating and other expenses . 
  & nbsp ; edit : in case you were wondering , council estates are fairly normal places in italy ... not necessarily a hotbed of crime and corruption . 
  in fact , ours happens to be fairly nice ; it 's mostly families with kids and there 's even a garden where they can play . 
  edit/2 : yes , they still have a rotary phone and the wallpaper is utter shite from the 1970s , when diarrhoea was all the rage . 
  many , if not most people , hardly give a fuck nowadays but one of my grandfathers had his property seized then had to flee tripoli with his family in 1970 ... when the local italian and jewish communities were forcibly expelled by gheddafi 's new regime that is . 
  he was glad to hear that the old bastard had been shot by the rebels even though the libyan government of the time was about to finally unfreeze these people 's social security accounts ( with relative benefits ) and pay them indemnities after 30 or so years . 
  we 'll see if he lives long enough to see his hard-earned money back or if anything good at all comes out of such a clusterfuck . 
  but , dude , she looks like she belongs to friggin ' jurassic park or something . 
  even then zara was the only dalmatian city to be part of italy . 
  and it had an italian-speaking majority ... not exactly what i 'd call a colony !, 
  the transition itself was fairly gradual , it was the prices that doubled almost overnight !, 
  i agree , but then how can they guilt-trip the government into milking the rest of us for more money ? 
  ( oops ... 
  i really meant `` autonomy '' . 
  you mean student unions ? 
  pretty sure we do n't have anything even remotely comparable to fraternities over here . 
  hell , we do n't even have dormitories or proper campuses at that ... 
  anyway - these exist within the student council which , at least theoretically , is the body representative of all the students ( duh ! ), 
  but what you actually get is a system with a myriad of one-person parties ranging the gamut from `` nazi-eco-stalinists '' to `` marilize legajuana '' to `` altar boys , inc. '' nobody really cares about . 
  except for the latter ; they 're said to be well-connected with certain professors and the many hospitals that are run by the church . 
  boring , useless but at the same time kind of harsh ; basically a left-over from the 1940s . 
  i may be slightly biased , though ... not least because i flunked a couple of years !, 
  the honour goes to [ napoleone di buonaparte ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/napoleon ) ... we 're talking about the kind of guy who first invades a foreign place with the support of local revolutionaries , then promptly betrays them , then proceeds to loot countless artifacts from all over the peninsula so as to ship them to paris and * then * sells venice with its istrian/dalmatian possessions to the austrians just because he could therefore ushering some 200 years of oppression and brutality throughout north-eastern italy which , fyi , ended in an even more tragic bloodbath ( of the kind you had to study in high school ) . 
  second pick would be [ this guy ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pietro_badoglio ) - when he was n't too busy sabotaging a couple of war efforts or committing war crimes on the side he managed to get hated on by royalists , fascists , partisans and common people ... all at the same time !, 
  i speak the roman dialect ... or whatever 's left of it ... which , in case you do n't know , is considered quite coarse and tends to be looked down upon by pretty much everybody else . 
  teachers have always given me shit because of my accent , which is why around the tender age of 8 i started talking like one of those anchormen you see on the telly . 
  later in life i just stopped caring and reverted to my native accent - much to the the joy of my own family !, 
  & nbsp ;  [ ... ] how does it differ from the standard language ? 
  & nbsp ; it used to be * quite * different but now that dialect has an awful lot in common with standard italian ; but still , pronunciation is not exactly the same and neither is the vocabulary . 
  the prosody too is different . 
  si sounds fairly uppity , fast-paced and ... singy-songy whereas the roman variety flows more slowly , is kind of monotone and tends to have that heavy/slightly slurred feel to it ; * doo giiive ya n'aideea , ding ov an idaaalian whoo 's ander anesdesyyy * . 
  romans also chew and garble words , whose endings get decapitated ( too lazy to pronounce all the syllables ! ) . 
  btw we also have a tendency to pepper our speech with profanities , which is what it makes it so damn colourful ... 
  really . 
  also a good place if you 're into postage stamps ... 
  somehow i pictured the guy squatting * and * wearing an adidas tracksuit while doing the trash-typing !, 
  [ * i 'm sorry dave , i 'm afraid i ca n't do that . 
  * ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arj8cagm6je ), 
  fair enough , but * that * napoleon sold much of italy to the austrians and then he became emperor anyhoo ... ... let 's just say that napoleon 3.0 x was a vast , * vast * improvement over his predecessor . 
  & nbsp ; edit : we may be willing to forgive you ( but only if you allow us to clone aliz\u00e9e ; you know , for science ) .

  shall we mention all the priceless art you guys have stolen ? 
  i wo n't even talk about the * gioconda * because it 's the only one painting you 've actually bothered to buy . 
  how nice of them !, 
  but we 'd already given them most of northern italy to trample on , and for some 200 years at that . 
  it 's only fair . 
  ** fluent in ** : english , french and modern greek . 
  ** can understand ** : veeery limited german and croatian ( it 's a long story ! ) . 
  ** currently studying ** ... polish , because it 's just * so * damn smooth . 
  & nbsp ; as far as italian schools are concerned , we attempt to learn whatever mangled version of english our professors are trying to teach us . 
  in middle school you could - at least theoretically - choose between latin , french or spanish . 
  i say * theoretically * because the first year of ms we had textbooks but not a teacher ; the second we got neither ; during the last one our 14-y-o selves had a true bombshell for substitute ... you can see were this is going . 
  it 'd gotten so bad i resorted to just speak italian while adding an - s at the end of every word !, 
  ( still passed the final middle school exam with flying colours though ) . 
  & nbsp ; edit : south-tyroleans also get to learn german at school . 
  edit/2 : do n't know about the * valdostani * but i 'm pretty sure that they , like leprechauns , do n't exist . 
  ** vatican city ** ... 
  i can just leave home , temporarily immigrate and buy medications ( but not condoms ) 22 % off . 
  ** san marino ** ... used to be that tax-haven next door ; now it 's just weeaboo central . 
  cheap katanas , anyone ? 
  ** france ** ... the best thing about it is that there 's a rather conveniently-placed mountain range separating us . 
  ** switzerland ** ... order , precision , efficiency , peace , and everybody actually minds its own business ; this goes without mentioning the landscape , high wages , quality of life and strong privacy laws . 
  what 's not to like then ? 
  ** austria ** ... the country that gave us mozart , his balls and sachertoerte .

  of course le pen is the worst choice . 
  more like a return to the dark ages , but hey . . great fun . 
  now it 's your turn . 
  that of russia fuckin scares me ... 
  edit : leo xiii , my fault, 
  she is just 38 years younger than italy itself . 
  we had the second king of the monarchy when she was born and this man was our prime minister back then . . https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/luigi_pelloux 20 us presidents ( from mckinley to trump ) and 11 popes ( from leo xiii to pope francis ) . 
  we have had 63 governments in 70 years . 
  in the first republic , 1946-1994 , that 's because there was a pure proportional law and the political party in power ( the christian democracy ) decided to separate the roles of prime minister and secretary of the party . 
  in the second republuc , 1994-now , that 's because we often ended up with two different majorities : one in the chamber and one in the senate ( this happened clearly in 2006 and 2013 , and to a relevant degree in 1994 and 1996 ) in italy , a government needs the support of both houses to remain in life . 
  the chamber is elected on a national basis ( you can vote if you are 18 ) the senate is elected on a regional basis ( you can vote if you are 25 ) the system was designed by the christian democrats and the communists in 1946-1948 : both parties were afraid of the risk that the other force was able to win the elections . 
  the senate also used to be elected for 6 years ( this was reformed in the 50s ) while the chamber is elected for 5 years . 
  we are about to vote a constitutional reform on sunday , which is also about removing the power of the senate to veto or vote a motion of no confidence against a government . 
  and , at the moment , the senate has a pure proportional law while the chamber has a two-round system . 
  `` no '' is ahead in the polls , though , and if it wins renzi will resign and we 'll add a new pm to this image . 
  exactly , she is actually voting against what she wants . 
  the man is somehow right because we recently approved civil unions , but the majority of the lower house had to reach a compromise with the majority of the senate and removed adoption rights . 
  but the girl is wrong , ok renzi will resign if no wins but both a yes and a no lead to the necessity to change the electoral law of the senate ( and that of the chamber too , probably ) . 
  so there will be a government even if no wins , some sort of grand coalition maybe . 
  she votes no cause `` renzi go home '' . 
  he votes yes so gay couples will adopt i mean , ok , but i thought we were talking about a specific reform . 
  for a catholic , the pope is the successor of peter who was appointed by jesus as leader of the church : so he is the vicar of christ and he has the power over the rules of the church : this law regarding abortion is n't really a fundamental dogma . 
  the pope ca n't amend the bible or change `` holy traditions , the reformation happened cause secular leaders wanted to control religious affaires in their own countries . 
  thank you . 
  she sounds crazy . 
  what 's her plan regarding the eu ? 
  does she actually want to leave or is it just anti-bruxelles rethoric ? 
  does le pen want to repell that ? 
  yeah , the left is in great trouble everywhere ... my personal point of view is that this is bad . 
  `` populist '' movements are gaining ground at the expense of traditional left-wing parties , and changing the system in nationalism vs globalism , instead of centre-right vs centre-left . 
  spain : the right is in power poland : the right is in power ( pis is a right-wing party , right ? ), 
  germany : it 's gon na be led by merkel in 2017 again . 
  italy : renzi risks to fall for this referendum france : looks like fillon is going to be president uk : conservatives are in power and i doubt corbyn will win in the next elections us : total republican rule, 
  a ) they are not tied together in the sense that the electoral law is already into effect , it 's not in the referendum . 
  it may change if yes wins , it may not change if no wins ... who knows . 
  b ) it 's not an immunity from prosecution . 
  senators can be prosecuted just like every citizen c ) law-decrees should be used only in case of emergency and necessity , so emergency decrees is kinda a correct term . 
  the reform does not give the power to the government to force the parliament to vote on a bill in 70 days . 
  it 's the parliament that decides wheter to vote a government 's bill in 70 days or not . 
  and even if the parliament decides to vote the bill in 70 days , it 's completely different from a law-decree ( which is already into efffect at least for 60 days , no matter what ) because the parliament can still reject it . 
  so it strengthens the parliament . 
  55-45 for no is the most recent poll . 
  it 's an `` illegal '' poll btw , cause we ca n't have it in the weeks of the referendum . 
  it says that cardinal norbert will become pope instead of cardinal simplicio in the conclave of the 4th of december ( lol ) . . it 's a scientific poll though . 
  a ) labour market has been reformed . 
  i do n't know what more we have to do ... b ) the banks are reported on the verge of collapse since years , and yet they are still there ... it 's becoming a sort of weird game to predict the apocalypse of our system . 
  c ) true that , the debt is big . 
  but the default is unlikely . 
  d ) the economist says that the problem of italy is its unwillignes to reform ... so vote no to a reform aimed at create more stable governments and reforms easier to do ( like whaaat ? ), 
  e ) berlusconi became pm without this reform . 
  mussolini became dictator because of unstable governments that weren `` t able to deal with difficult years . 
  weak democracy leads to dictatorship . 
  f ) the economist keeps confusing the electoral law with the constitutional reform g ) the senate is elected , okay it 's a strange type of elections but it 's an election . 
  just a different one , cause the new seante has to represent the regions . 
  citizens will indicate which regional councillor should be senator , and their respective regional council will ratify that decision h ) senators have no immunity from prosecution . 
  i ) yeah we pass more laws than other countries . 
  and that 's because all of our laws are made by governments that keep change . 
  in fact , the legislative power is in the hands of the government that uses `` emergency decrees '' to pass laws , cause the italian parliament just ca n't do it with two different majorities with the same powers . 
  shitty situation ( with the current system ) . 
  the reform will actually strengthen the parliament . 
  the government will only be more stable , not with new powers . 
  l ) oh yeah , a new technocratic government ... that will avoid grillo and not strengthen him , for sure ... #believethat, 
  grillo ha diffamato pure rita levi montalcini , e non sa distinguire tra persone perbene e disonesti . 
  i can see it . 
  but no one won the elections in 2013 cause we are in a system with three major blocs . 
  so what do we do ? 
  a ) we keep going to elections just for fun b ) we do some sort of institutional reforms so we can have a winner you ca n't criticize renzi for the way he took power and at the same time say no to his reforms cause he is `` unelected '' . 
  if we want pms `` elected '' we shoud find an `` unelected '' government that does this kind of reforms . 
  otherwise it 's a neverending contradiction until we go back to two blocs instead of three . 
  no i do n't mean the car accident . 
  a lot of stuff , just google it . 
  that 's how it works in parliamentary systems, 
  wait a second , if yes wins we have just one majority ( that in the lower chamber ) needed to form the goverment . 
  that is also true in countries with proportional systems like germany . 
  the electoral law is not part of the referendum . 
  it could change if yes wins or remain if no wins , who knows . 
  and even with that electoral law i 'm not sure governments will last for five years , but at least we should avoid to have a government depending on two different majorities . 
  it 's especially bad for the parliament , because it forces the government to do everything with `` emergency decrees '' instead of having normal laws passed by the parliament . 
  you got ta be kidding me ... he is a tax evasor with some serious problems with justice ... that is just his propaganda, 
  that article is complete bullshit : it 's full of inaccuracies and contradictions . 
  i have no time to answer to every idiotic statement in there . 
  just read the comments to the article and you 'll see . 
  all clown governments of the last 40 years are supporting a no , i wonder why ... a no is just going to end a phase of reforms and make new ones harder to do . 
  so i do n't see your point ... 
  2017 is going to be the end of this identity crisis for the netherlands . 
  pes and alde are federalists but wiki sonetimes says federalists and sometimes pro-eu, 
  five stars are both pro-eu and anti-eu . 
  they are also both pro-immigration and anti-immigration , pro-lgbt rights but not really etc. 
  in this way they are able to be voted by everyone . 
  they say they are no left nor right , but they are actually both a left-wing populist party and a right-wing populist party . 
  i 'd say they are a mix of trump and jill stein . 
  if the democratic party is there , forza italia and m5s should be there too . 
  absolutely . 
  right ... but if he wins the referendum , 2017 will be fun, 
  only when you are there, 
  you wipe your royal ass/s, 
  you ca n't use that language now, 
  #jesuissicily edit : fuck this shit , i ca n't do the hashtag edit2 : i just pasted what you wrote .

  awful ? 
  awful ?!, 
  you take that back , chocolate-filled cornetti are just the best !, 
  i 'm not a frenchie and i 'm * so * not gon na have some cardboard for breakfast ... 
  not particularly , at least here in rome . 
  the only ( truly ) local sweets we can boast are * pangiallo * and * maritozzi * but i have n't seen those in a looong time !, 
  personally i happen to be torn beween multiple delicacies ; my favourites would be either horse beef or * fegato alla veneziana * ( pork liver with baby onions ) . 
  another , * very * particular dish i enjoyed very much is * animelle * ( sweet-bread ) . 
  if you 're brave enough you might also want to try veal brain - it 's so light it literally melts in your mouth !, 
  have you guys already forgotten who 's heavily influenced your beloved cuisine first ? 
  if it were n't for caterina de ' medici and the thousands of courtiers she brought with her , there would be no modern french gastronomy to speak of ... :-), 
  you * do * know that the eu is n't a country but rather 27 separate states trying to push their own agendas , right ? 
  :-p edit : what you guys see as a shockingly pro-russian stance is regarded as a reasonable defence of our very own interests here . 
  do n't forget that the sanctions you 've fought so much for have bitten , hard ... and not just russia . 
  you might also be ( un ) surprised to learn that russophilia has long become a right-wing affair !, 
  our history with russia is nothing new , though , they 've always been an important commercial and diplomatical partner of ours . 
  anyhoo - lately we 've been focusing more on its up-and-coming ( not to mention resource-rich ) neighbours such as azerbaijan , kazakhstan , turkmenistan , uzbekistan ... we should proceed in that direction imho . 
   am i right ? 
  yeah , you surely are . 
  never seen a wooden building here ( except for those tacky garden sheds people like so much ) . 
  our closest equivalent would be the half-timbered homes in the alps but as the name suggests , they 're only partly made of wood ... 
  yes . 
  if only to make our lives slightly more bearable ... 
  surely i must 've heard about that woman somewhere else ? 
  i bet this one loon is n't new to such things ... 
  it 's basically italian with the genders reversed !, 
  you still have lol , though . 
  i think it 's a nice series - albeit there 's very little in the way of spoken language ... 
  good ol' * central * italy !, 
  thanks for reminding the world of our existence . 
  as we use to say whenever a northerner gets a bit too fond of himself ... 
  [ * pbbbbbbbbbbt !, 
  * ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vehxvzmeiyu ), 
  milan used to have one , though . 
  and so did naples ( until 1980 ) therefore you guys are by no means an exception . 
  i might also add that the kind of * via milano * we got here leads straight into a rather smelly , loud and dark tunnel ... ... that 's some truly powerful imagery if you ask me . 
  as it 's already been noted almost every town here 's got a * via cavour * , * via garibaldi * , or a * via vittorio emanuele ii * ( most of the references to his successor were expunged after the war ) . 
  other common names i 've noticed include * via/corso umberto i * and * via roma * but streets dedicated to the first two queens are relatively easy to find as well . 
  every other town 's also guaranteed to have either a * via piave * ( the country 's main front in ww1 ) or a * via dante * . 
  & nbsp ; ** fun fact !, 
  ** mussolini decreed that every big and medium city have a main street dedicated to the capital in 1931 ... 
  oooh , so the vatican 's got lots of money ? 
  and their buildings do n't even pay local taxes ? 
  who would 've ever thought ... 
  they are n't even trying to hide the monies anymore , mind you !, 
  our relationship 's rock-solid . 
  probably san marino ... and if it was n't behaving so badly , russia . 
  nobody expects the spanish inquisition !, 
   so there is no active movements for independence right now in italy ? 
  no , no , i was not clear enough . 
  there actually * are * some separatist movements left but they 're small , irrelevant and often made fun of . 
  hell , most of these happen to be even more irrelevant than the monarchists are ( and i 'm one ! ) . 
  * the one in south tyrol used to be a real nuisance ( think of a slightly less deadly equivalent of the eta ) back in the day but now the province 's long been autonomous , it gets a whole load of public money/subsidies and many south tyroleans hold public jobs - so the movement has effectively been neutered . 
  oppression ? 
  hardly so . 
  * as for the valle d'aosta , they actually fought off a rather clumsy french attempt at annexation in 1944 and with the kind of statute they got shortly after , they certainly have little intention of leaving italy anytime soon - not least because the place 's almost completely italophone now and the use of french/patois is fairly limited . 
  * in sicily there used to be two strong independence movements between the latter stages of ww2 and 1947 . 
  the king graned the island autonomy but the new administration soon became a hotbed of inefficiency and corruption , while the place has n't improved that much ... a few have even considered revoking the statute !, 
   i heard there is a right-wing party in the north that wants the independence for the south , am i wrong ? 
  you mean the northern league ? 
  that separatist agenda they were ( or were not , see below ) pushing in the '90s had no basis whatsoever in either history and culuture . 
  unlike catalonia , which is a * real * entity with a culture and a people behind , padania was an artificial construct that encompassed all of the northern regions - which prior to the unification were a hodgepodge of different states with different dialects , cuisine , etc. 
  - even though their idea of ` north ' was quite fluid and rather incoherent at times . 
  it often even included central italian regions such as the marches . 
  the motivations for this were purely economic and parochial in nature , as all the league wanted was not seeing part of their precious tax money being redistributed among the other regions , particularly in the south . 
  their separatism was little more than smoke and mirrors ; needless to say , few took that proposal seriously ... not even the league itself . 
  when the old party leadership proved really no better than the sterotype of the corrupt southerner they despised so much ( the founder 's son - a real tool if there ever was one - did n't even finish high school but somehow got a degree in albania and a place in the regional administration ; he was also routinely given party money ; the party made deals with the * n'drangheta * etc. 
  etc. ), 
  in 2012 , the nl almost collapsed and the line was subsequently changed . 
  `` no more padania . 
  no more separatism ( not the real goal anyway ) . 
  no more shitting on southerners . 
  instead , let 's go get all those sweet southern votes by taking it out against dem evil immigrunts , gypos and moosleemz ! '' . 
  & nbsp ; edit : a last consideration . 
  it 's also worth noting that while catalonia or or navarra are fairly ` big ' entities their closest italian equivalents , except for the islands , are a bunch of tiny little provinces spread trougout the peninsula - each with its particular dialect , cuisine , customs and rivalries . 
  campaigning for their ` independence ' would make little sense . 
  & nbsp ; ** tl ; dr ** the northern league has * looong * become a generic , xenopobic right-wing party . 
  if there 's something i appreciate about my own country it 's the fact that any such initiative would very probably end up drowning in a sea of hysterical laughter and jeers ... to say the least . 
  other students would have a field day with it . 
  but seriously , what happened to anglos and their common sense ? 
  if those guys are anything like our politicians then they 're * so * not going to declare things . 
  after all , this still a ** local election ** , not a referendum , in which the winning parties are there because of a ** minority ** ; as far as independence is concerned that 's not much in the way of legitimacy ( no enough votes , so the results are hardly representative of the popular will ) at least because what mas plans to do is not only illegal but also something along the lines of me trying to declare the room i 'm in a sovereign nation . 
  and when confronted with the hardships an unilateral declaration would likely entail , either the whole alliance breaks ^ ** 1 ** or the guy steps down ... always assuming mr. mas actually manages to get elected as president , which is n't a given because something something political allies . 
  therefore 1 ) the current , shaky coalition will probably fall after a month or so of boisterous claims ; 2 ) there 'll be both local and national elections in which a similar , but a clearer scenario will emerge ; 3 ) the new local and national governments surely wo n't consist of people like mas and rajoy head-butting each other just for the pleasure of doing so . 
  more reasonable colleagues will hopefully take their place and start talks . 
  4 ) a middle ground will eventually be reached and catalonia will get a revised , expanded statute ... 
  even though they do n't get independence , the catalans will have brought the spanish state to its knees and forced it to listen to their demands , which is already a big step forward . 
  the very fact of there being talks will please most and the new agreement is going to please even more people except , of course , for the hard-liners . 
  & nbsp ; ** 1 ** - people have lives besides politics and politicians are people too ; regardless of their beliefs , both would n't probably risk the relative comfort of their lives for what is basically a scary leap in the dark with more cons than pros . 
  they also ca n't tell the rest of the world , or at the very least the bits that count the most , to fuck off either !, 
  debatable . 
  if our very own history , as well as the years spent getting bored to tears while being forced to read * the betrothed * , ever taught us anything ... is that even the plague itself was preferable to a spanish administration !, 
  still , they 've been damaged by the quakes . 
  nope , i was actually referring to [ these ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ponte_principe_amedeo_savoia_aosta ) [ two . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ponte_giuseppe_mazzini ) if they close , half of rome is fucked . 
  no sarcasm involved - restorers really * did * clean and reinforce the monument 's facade ( special cements were used , and the old iron supports that were keeping certain stone elements together were replaced with a few more made of a particular titanium alloy ) . 
  as far as a thorough reconstruction of the colosseum is concerned , well ... this is kind of a minefield !, 
  and italian archaeologists tend to be veeery conservative in that regard , so . 
  pls gib job, 
  bullshit , the colosseum 's just been restored .

  and as a eu citizen i resent that . 
  i have faced italian corruption all my life , even when i moved abroad . 
  because my family is still living there . 
  the only possibility to get rid of it is transparency . 
  every country has that problem . 
  america has it - there are bribes , `` lobbying '' , that happens behind closed doors . 
  no records of it , and nobody to tell you what happened except parties with very clear interests . 
  it 's usually to the detriment of the people , and i expect that it 's to the detriment of the people here . 
  well all the italians and spaniards in london would rejoice to hear such beautiful predictions i 'm sure . 
  here is the actual quote from the article , which makes it sound like much more of a threat than that :  in the beginning of february , [ dutch finance minister and eurogroup president jeroen ] dijsselbloem told varoufakis `` you either sign the memorandum that the others have signed too , or your economy is going to collapse '' . 
  how ? 
  `` we are going to collapse your banks '' . 
  it ** is ** a greek letter after all, 
  this baseless speculation does n't help in a climate where both sides need to keep a calmer head , it even actively hurts if you 've seen the rhetoric passed around this subreddit in the past few weeks , so forgive me if i refrain from it . 
  eh , it 's a wild idea with no merit anyway , but if i judge based on what i 've seen , i 'd believe insider trading of lagarde and the rest before varoufakis . 
  100 % guaranteeing no deal is n't an exclusive right , it could be done by either side , and many times there were proposals and counterproposals advanced with more often the imf shooting down the agreement , i believe . 
  i 'm a cynical bastard and that 's a little too cynical for me even so , but i 'll say this : i 'd more readily ascribe motivations like that to padoan , schauble , and pretty much all the rest of the eu finance ministers before i got to varoufakis . 
  it 's par for the course to resign after you lose a vote , like the opposition party leader in greece ( who campaigned for yes ) just did . 
  but in my opinion it takes a special kind of courage to resign after your side has won a vote and popular mandate , knowing that it might be for the best . 
  that tells me he 's not interested in he being the one who negotiates the deal ; he 's more interested in a deal being negotiated . 
  i think those who ascribe political and selfish reasons to him are a little misguided . 
  he put the * possibility * that his resignation would be to the interest of his country above his own political interests . 
  that 's as unselfish as he could be , in my opinion . 
  i wish i had politicians as disinterested , and perhaps as devoted to the interests of the people over their own , as him in my own country . 
  also would it hurt people if you read his damn statement ? 
  it 's like three paragraphs . 
  he was asked by tsipras himself to step down to facilitate talks , so he did it . 
  comments about rats fleeing sinking ships are a little out of line . 
  right , these are the nominal targets they set , but i believe they do n't have a lot of credibility anymore with how they assess their nominal targets . 
  they assign some blame to the first quarter 2015 , but then go on to say how these nominal assumptions changed based on targets not met by year-end 2014 ( when obviously syriza was not in power ) and fluctuations due to markets or unwillingness to privatize ( understandable that a country would n't want to sell all its assets at cut-rate prices in the middle of a crisis ) . 
   the 2014 primary fiscal balance fell short of the program target by 1.5 percent of gdp . 
   the projected privatization proceeds under the program were $ 23 billion over the 2014 -- 22 period . 
  half of these proceeds were to come from privatizing state holdings of the banking sector . 
  however , given the very high and rising levels of nonperforming loans in the banking system that in turn will require setting aside the bank recapitalization buffer as a potential backstop , it is highly unlikely that these proceeds will materialize . 
  they also go on to say how they assumed that borrowing costs would normalize for greece , which has n't really happened at all . 
  there 's also a long section on debt sustainability after that . 
  i 'm not going to attempt to summarize it , but the gist is that even with debt relief , debt dynamics are very fragile for greece and further concessional financing would be required to guarantee stability . 
  they themselves provide one example of a possible solution :  as an illustration , one option for recovering sustainability would be to extend the grace period to 20 years and the amortization period to 40 years on existing eu loans and to provide new official sector loans to cover financing needs falling due on similar terms at least through 2018 . 
  all that said , i do n't place extreme faith in their analysis , which is always disposed towards austerity and mass privatization as the only possible policy option , and which looks to regain stability in the next 50 years , not even in the short term . 
  of course it 's not a consensus , i would be very surprised if the imf agreed with them on all points of fiscal policy . 
  the primary reason being - which is acknowledged in your link - that the imf is not willing to participate in any bailout whatsoever . 
  it identifies the need for one , but wants to stop short of saying we should have given one , therefore it goes on with the old austerity melody . 
  the summation in your link is ,  in short : two different views on what is sustainable and how to get there ; a tacit recognition of the need for a third memorandum , more reforms , more austerity , and concessions ; and a nod towards a haircut as long as it is someone else 's money . 
  not quite a consensus . 
  which i mostly agree with . 
  but i stand by my impression that it verifies the main point of the greek government 's position : debt is unsustainable , and there is need for debt relief . 
  if they agreed on that , and they do , the disagreement on austerity or not could go on the back burner . 
  or not , but any kind of agreement is positive . 
  it 's not against his government . 
  it pretty much confirms his , and varoufakis ' , positions on the unsustainability of greek debt right at the time when they were elected five months ago , and the need for debt relief . 
  here is the whole report so you can read it too . 
  https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/scr/2015/cr15165.pdf it 's a little strange how these findings by the imf are largely not taken into consideration when the institutions come together to negotiate with greece . 
  certainly , i would love to . 
  it 's a little hard to sift through them all , there 's quite a few . 
  so it 's possible they will have to form coalition to rule ? 
  is the sentiment in spain that he 'll not be voted again in the coming elections ? 
  and thus we come full circle to what some , like the british , knew all along since the early 90s . 
  there can be no effective currency union without fiscal union , no common currency without wealth transfer . 
  it was an endless debate in the house of commons in the years leading up to the formation of the eurozone - and the reason the uk is not using the euro , obviously . 
  [ there 's a much referenced lrb article by wynne godley ] ( http://www.lrb.co.uk/v14/n19/wynne-godley/maastricht-and-all-that ) that explains what 's always been wrong with the euro and how it would have to end in disaster for countries like greece , portugal , ireland , spain , and anyone not competitive with german industrial efficiency . 
  bear in mind it was written in 1992 : these have been known issues for a long time . 
  and it 's not like no one knows today . 
  [ adam posen was broadcasting the reality of this situation on vox just yesterday ] ( https://www.vox.com/2015/6/29/8863313/theres-a-simple-solution-to-greeces-problems-but-europe-wont-try-it ) . 
  there was a wealth of good discussion about this in an / r/economics post yesterday , [ np link here . 
  ] ( https://np.reddit.com/r/economics/comments/3bmq7j/greece_confirms_that_it_will_default_to_the_imf/csnla6y ) some of the info there i used above . 
  hold on a second . 
  can you explain a little more what happened today , and how it relates to the gag law ? 
  from what i understand , he announced something supposedly very optimistic today that he conjured out of thin air , to counterbalance the negativity of yesterday 's legal act , correct ? 
  i 'm gon na use that as the title of my next sci-fi novel . 
  somebody else has to make it first and then discard it for us to find it . 
  well , as long as the debt is recognized by some sovereign entity , then it 's fair game . 
  conceivably the families of the victims could take their case to the hague and have it ratified there before starting to seize assets . 
  they tried to seize assets by just having it ratified by greek and italian courts , but again , that 's not the point i was making : the greek state and the italian state did n't try to seize the assets of the german state in a breach of sovereignty . 
  private citizens did . 
  oh , there 's a world of difference . 
  a court-ordered seizure on behalf of a private citizen does n't mean a state is doing it . 
  private citizens can go to court against a state ; but that 's entirely different than state vs. state . 
  i agree that it violates the sovereignty of another country , but such things have happened many times on behalf of private creditors and declared legal by various entities of whatever standing , national or international . 
  argentina 's assets for example are still in risk of seizure worldwide because of past defaults . 
  case in point an argentinian ship seized in africa by a court order on behalf of a us hedge fund . 
  does it violate argentina 's sovereignty ? 
  of course . 
  but it still happened . 
  no , it did n't happen in this case either . 
  the government of greece did n't try to seize assets , private citizens did . 
  the relatives of war victims . 
  also i think the seizure itself was n't declared illegal , just the trial that resulted in the seizure , because the german state had judicial immunity , or that it can not be tried abroad for acts committed as a sovereign state . 
  that 's very interesting . 
  however that does n't concern intra-country debts , it 's war reparations on behalf of private greek citizens , which was initially rejected even by greek officials from what i can see . 
  and , it should be said , lots of countries have asked germany for war reparations for massacres during ww2 . 
  italy included , like i said above . 
   italian court tried to seize german assets hit me with a source , i ca n't find anything in english or italian other than things about war reparations for war crimes against italians during ww2 . 
  i hope to never see the day where germany , or any other european country , will find it worthwhile to seize another european country 's assets . 
   greece basically pays no interest to the ecb or efsf debt no interest ? 
  http://graphics.wsj.com/greece-debt-timeline/ go down the list and find all the ecb entries , the interest is included . 
  for example , there is even a $ 3,5 bn payment due in august of this year under 6.1 % interest . 
  are you just trolling here ? 
  this is my last response to your idiocy . 
  first you say `` nothing is produced fast '' to justify austerity , and then when i say , why then does the imf expect greece to produce fast reforms and make its debt sustainable yesterday since it 's apparent it will take time , you reply with some handwaving explanation about `` modern world making things easier '' . 
  your faith in a humanity consisting of people such as you is entirely misplaced .

  we ca n't compete , longest italian word is : `` precipitevolissimevolmente '' , that means excessively fast, 
  ah , thank you !, 
  i thought this expression did n't exist in english , added in my vocabulary, 
  must be a romance thing ahah , swearing in french must be so cool because even bad words sound sweet, 
  the expression is used here too, 
  you need to know the existence of this welsh city called : * llanfairpwllgwyngyllgogerychwyrndrobwllllantysiliogogogoch, 
  vulgar way to say `` testicle '' , it 's used to indicate someone who is an idiot or a dumbass . 
  in formal expressions it 's used in the phrases `` giramento di coglioni '' and `` rompimento di coglioni '' that literally mean `` testicles turning '' and `` balls breaking '' , used to when someone is really annoying or boring . 
  the translation might be `` asshole '' but they are different body parts so it 's not right . 
  it 's a very useful word , trust me . 
  you kidding , i grew up watching that show , they even made one series about the human body but i do n't know its name . 
  one of the best kids show ever . 
  it 's like the thing every teacher make kids watch at school . 
  there are so many : * [ monster allergy ] ( https://youtu.be/6xwdbueqafg ) * [ la compagnia dei celestini ] ( https://youtu.be/w-yyexsitqc ) / street football ( favourite cartoon ) * [ huntik ] ( https://youtu.be/kjs4ynd8gco ) * [ tommy & oscar ] ( https://youtu.be/b4g3rfq7uuw ) * [ geronimo stilton ] ( https://youtu.be/wi5mujqwhw0 ) * [ lupo alberto ] ( https://youtu.be/qpr7wpq9gxk ) * [ code lyoko ] ( https://youtu.be/1rzmvdqxyvq ) * [ martin myst\u00e8re ] ( https://youtu.be/qd8q0thdufg ) ( also this , what a great show ) * [ team galaxy ] ( https://youtu.be/nr3sqpk1gbm ) * [ pap\u00e0 castoro ] ( https://youtu.be/bneaige6s7w ) / les histoires du p\u00e8re castor * [ c\u00e8dric ] ( https://youtu.be/ryg3adriuiu ) * [ martin matin ] ( https://youtu.be/rgplwkqkupm ) * [ titeuf ] ( https://youtu.be/quk8wdujz9q ) * [ pingu ] ( https://youtu.be/sct5j7quo54 ) * [ detective conan ] ( https://youtu.be/kzkfbkky7qk ) / case closed ( still a fan ) ** talking about teen series : ** * [ melevisione ] ( https://youtu.be/6sjsmw7sv3o ) one of my favourite , and imo , best italian show ever made . 
  * [ grani di pepe ] ( https://youtu.be/p50ykrqozc4 ) / die pfefferk\u00f6rner / the peppercorns ( i love this too ) italian cartoons used to be awesome , i realized they used to broadcast a lot of french cartoons but i do n't mind that , apparently rai and france t\u00e9l\u00e9visions used to switch cartoons with each other and even created some together . 
  i also used to watch many british cartoons like bob the builder , teletubbies ( favourite childhood show ) and postman pat . 
  plus disney channel , cartoon network and well known cartoons like the fairly oddparents , pokemon , digimon and dragonball . 
  it 's very common , cursive is considered the most good-looking way to write and teachers pretend students to write in it . 
  personally , after i finished middle school i started writing using print letters , i write faster in that way and i think it 's more readable compared to `` my '' curvise . 
  i find print letters clearer than it , i only write in cursive during tests , my notebooks would be a mess if i write only in it . 
  that 's how i learned how to write in cursive, 
  words with '' - gli '' like `` fo ** gli ** o '' ( sheet of paper ) , `` fo ** gli ** a '' ( leaf ) : many people instead of saying - glio/a say - io/ia . 
  it 's very common , i have a problem with it . 
  definitely interesting . 
  i think it 's the second most popular beer but also nastro azzurro is liked by many people, 
  being an italian and learning swedish would definitely be funny considering words like `` fika '' and `` kaka '', 
  oh thanks , edited that . 
  yeah absolutely , jokes about bitches are the norm when they teach that argument, 
  edited , thanks, 
  weird , i used google translate and it translated the word , anyway , kaka reminds the word `` poop '' so i 'll change that !, 
  my friend `` rutto '' means burp in italian , anyway here 's a list : * skopare : pair of shoes ( norwegian ) , to fuck ( italian ) * kuulo : hearing ( finnish ) , ass/butt ( italian ) * minkia : mink ( romanian , albanian ) dick ( italian ) * kojon : into the leg ( lithuanian ) vulgar way to say testicle ( italian ) * trojka/tr \u00f6ja : three ( bosnian ) sweater ( swedish ) bitch ( italian ) * kaka : cake/cookie ( swedish ) poop ( italian ), 
  definitely when you can easily go there by car , riding through central europe , or even better , by plane, 
  apparently the problem is the lack of funds . 
  there are a lot of backgrounds behind it , there 's a wikipedia page dedicated to it : https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/strait_of_messina_bridge, 
  we ca n't build a bridge between sicily and calabria , imagine building that kind of tunnel, 
  i think moretti is the most popular beer here . 
  anyway , i 've found this map on the internet with the most popular beers by country : http://www.ilpost.it/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/birra4.png, 
  i mean it happens but i do n't think that often , tbh i heard more stories about teenagers dying by jumping off the balcony rather than tourists . 
  i think writing using your own alphabet is way better than using latin . 
  on important events like the olympics it 's necessary because most people use it , apart from that , you also have declensions and some letters that do n't exist in latin . 
  i have seen the `` greeklish '' and i have found it more complicated to read than the actual greek . 
  well that 's true , i have to confess that i did that too for the same reason , but when i visit a country i usually want to eat the food made there , eating lasagne in france did n't feel totally right for me, 
  i 'm almost sure they do that everywhere , it depends on people, 
  why ? 
  the most atrocious thing are tourists that go to italian restaurants in paris, 
  how could they think this was a good idea, 
  they do that to get noticed by foreign girls, 
  everything that concerns two consonants : * words with * - glio , - glia , - gliu * ( figlio `` son '' , foglia `` leaf '' ) ( i still have problems with this , i tend to not say the consonants and just pronounce the vowels , one of the biggest mistakes in italian grammar ) * words with * gn - * ( gnocchi ) * words with * sc - * ( scivolo `` slide '' ) * words wirh * - scia , - sciu , - scio * ( asciutto `` dry '' , sciocco `` silly '' ) * words with 3 consonants like * str - , spr - , scr - '' ( struzzo `` ostrich '' , spremuta `` squeezed '' ) * words with `` pn , ps , pr '' ( pneumatico `` tyre '' , psicologo `` psychologist '' , produttore `` producer '' ) ... 
  there are others but these are enough . 
  personally , as a kid , i also had , and still have , a problem with the letter `` x '' , i struggle so much pronouncing words like * extra * or * fuxia * ( fuchsia in english ) , i tend to not pronounce the sound `` ecs '' and just say `` es '' so instead of saying `` ecstra '' i say `` estra '' . 
  i sometimes feel uncomfortable for this . 
  we use a lot of loanwords , sometimes a bit too much if you ask me . 
  it depends , some words are pronounced like you would pronounce them in english ( like facebook ) but we mainly pronounce them like italian words . 
  social networks like snapchat or instagram are not pronounced like an english speaker would say them , we have a different pronunciation of the letter `` a '' . 
  it also happened that with the growth of social media english verbs got `` italianated '' , for example : * to chat , became * chattare * * to ban , became * bannare * english words usually sound so cool that even our government decided to call our new job law : `` job act '' instead of `` rforma del lavoro '' . 
  we sometimes use english words even when it exists the corresponding italian word and as long as i love the english language , i think it 's pointless . 
  ours is so much perfect that nobody drinks it to not make it bad, 
  definitely free healthcare , it 's absolutely the one thing that i 've always liked about my country , hope this will never change . 
  i should n't say this but san marino is really cute and nice , also , although it 's not that hidden , mont saint-michel in france is beautiful !, 
  obviously , the zones you quoted are good too but in general s\u00fcdtirol is considered the richest region, 
  we are beautiful , yes and we talk with our hands , yes ( not the way you think though ) . 
  talking about economy , probably `` trentino-alto adige '' , `` trento '' is the richest and the best city to live in italy according to newspapers edit : also bolzano, 
  i 'm sure nobody does that , maybe elders , it 's more a dinner dish . 
  it 's alright but sometimes a bit boring , i prefer going to international subs , also , although we are like 60,000,000 people in italy , there are few people that are active , post things and news . 
  but that 's also a reason why i love reddit , nobody that i know uses it . 
  tbh i never read the actual classic italian books , i really liked : * [ la solitudine dei numeri primi ] https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_solitude_of_prime_numbers_ ( novel ) by paolo giordano * the solitude of prime numbers * in english * and i 'm currently reading [ sostiene pereira ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/pereira_maintains ) by antonio tabucchi * pereira maintains * in english, 
  not * le petit prince * ? 
  san marino for australia , or better , vatican city . 
  aussies are cool . 
  of course , we eat pasta but definitely not at breakfast . 
  i know elders in my region that eat soup or whatever they did n't eat for dinner but i honestly just need a cup of milk or coffee , some biscuits and i 'm fine . 
  i honestly do n't see the problem with eating pasta at dinner , a big plate of `` spaghetti alla carbonara '' is what i need at the end of the day !, 
  i honestly ca n't think of many acronyms , just a few : * cmq = comunque ( anyway ) * nn = non ( not ) * apparently it was too long * * xk\u00e9 = perch\u00e9 ( why ), 
  i 'm sure they did but as the others said when i have to write something i think about how it sounds in my mind and if it sounds wrong i change it, 
  i like pineapple pizza, 
  never been in veneto so i do n't know , why ? 
  yes , it is . 
  it 's even the only with 2,000,000 people in italy . 
  second biggest is milan with around 1,000,000 people . 
  tbh , i 've never heard it , maybe it 's more common in the north , i do n't know . 
  sorry , my bad ahah, 
  apparently `` quad '' comes from english and it 's an abbrevation for `` quadruple '', 
  it has a future as a eurovision song, 
  history . 
  naples is badville milan is fogville rome is ... 
  i do n't know , the people who live there usually consider it the biggest city in the country so maybe they are a bit presumptuous , also , they ca n't stand the fact that milan is being more important, 
  everyone !, 
  we are also taking a petition to change the religion of vatican city to make it an european mecca !, 
  anyway , we will make the place blow up if they do n't agree . 
  there are many , some people say they are police officers , some say they are part of the income revenue authority or some simply ask for a glass of water . 
  i think few people still get scammed , they are constantly telling elders to not open the door to strangers . 
  anyway i do n't live in a big city so i definitely know the half of the scams that might exist in bigger cities, 
  i did n't remember darude was finnish ahah i actually really like that song, 
  i have heard many people also like queen and rolling stones but not sure about it, 
  lol ahahah well , right now definitely but back then , she was very [ gorgeous ] ( http://hbz.h-cdn.co/assets/cm/15/03/54bc1ecec0311_-_hbz-sophia-loren-20-1964-rexusa-210677bq-xl.jpg ), 
  anyway italians and portuguese get along well too southern europe axis confirmed, 
  i like these : * [ bomboloni alla nutella ] ( http://blog.giallozafferano.it/vickyart/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/bomboloni-nutella-senza-patate-4.jpg ) * [ cardinali ] ( http://forum-ricette.cookaround.com/foto/data/8000/dscn00338.jpg ) * [ pesche ] ( http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_q2eyjzbvs8y/soyvxphc-6i/aaaaaaaaclc/a3mnjclwfnm/s320/p1060424.jpg ) and i add [ cassata siciliana ] ( http://www.gelarmony.it/public/images/cassata-siciliana.jpg ) and [ bab\u00e0 ] ( http://lacucinadirob.altervista.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/bab\u00e0.jpeg ) although i never had them but they are very popular, 
  mm i honestly do n't know what to say, 
  bucharest never fell !!, 
  true .

  you know the people have a point . 
  to a certain extent they are right . 
  i for once also do n't agree with the huge part of the eu 's immigration and over-tolerance policies . 
  i am too lazy to read everything but i 'm sure that even id it 's really racist that is far from being a daily habit . 
  never ever . 
  give me any example . 
  that 's irrelevant . 
  maybe from all these stories someone figured that they should learn more about the countries that are being mentioned . 
  does not mean they do n't know where those countries are . 
  dear / r/europe . 
  i can see what you think about this mistake . 
  the problem is that we are not being very tolerant . 
  we must realize that not all countries are as fortunate as ours . 
  one of these countries is the usa . 
  so here i propose this . 
  let us help the less fortunate americans who spend all their money on war . 
  let us gather some money . 
  an insignificant amount but we can make a difference . 
  let 's buy maps for the less fortunate americans . 
  so that every senator in america can afford a map . 
  if we all spare some money every american in a high place will have a map . 
  then , we can go even further-imagine how happy americans would be if their kids had available maps in schools . 
  map of the world for every american school . 
  this is a dream . 
  a dream that we can make come true . 
  maps for the usa . 
  we can do it-remember not everyone is born with the same opportunities we have . 
  if my dreams comes true we can achieve even more-first grade history and geography books for the american senate and one day-even schools . 
  this is one of my favorite subreddits . 
  i mean you learn a lot of stuff you share people 's culture , hear opinions and stories , discuss many problems . 
  now i have never ever seen racism here . 
  truth is that these days when people see an opinion they do n't agree with they just say `` that 's racist '' and it 's like they won the argument . 
  one of the few things that pisses me out . 
  otherwise let 's hope our numbers increase . 
  27,003 so far  . 
  well i think that `` behead those who do n't believe in islam '' is worst than `` burn churches '' or `` burn mosques '' . 
  i have not gone against minorities . 
  back that up . 
  and yes , i do think we are way too tolerant to any bitching . 
  i have a vague idea about mohamed merah but i do n't know what the reactions were . 
  as you said different places different reactions . 
  excuse me ? 
  that protests that are religious ( regardless of the religion ) and/or promote violence and threaten people ( especially the majorities ) should be forbidden . 
  i 'm sure you would have a different opinion if a bunch of christians went on the street with signs such as `` burn all mosques '' . 
  i think it 's normal that people are happy that those terrorists were caught . 
  i personally see nothing wrong with that . 
  i 'd also be harry if some terrorists were caught in my country . 
  but these protests are promoting violence and they threaten people with different opinions . 
  also they bash our systems and they want to impose their barbaric laws on us . 
  protest against what ? 
  basic human rights ? 
  well now we 're not nationalistic and tolerant . 
  [ guess where this got us ] ( http://imgur.com//a/iolco ), 
  ok i 'd like to say that i 'm strongly against the over-tolerance of minorities . 
  i think they should be not assimilated . 
  such big countries are federations for a reason . 
  i do n't want a federal eu . 
  what happened with freedom of speech ? 
  i agree the book might be offensive but nobody forces you to buy it . 
  and for all you immigrants that will say `` oh i 'm muslim i 'm not like that '' . 
  good for you-when you migrated you agreed to the terms and conditions . 
  also germany is really sensitive over racist things . 
  i think they would have banned it is it were so bad . 
  i am referring to all of these as one . 
  i mean the country is created to be home of the nation that is composed of the people that keep that culture . 
  is that not so ? 
  i do not see what is wrong with nationalism and loving your country . 
  really . 
  czech republic here comes democracy . 
  prepare to be liberated . 
  i do n't see why you have to be so oppressed . 
  i do . 
  i need to feel allegiance . 
  i do . 
  i 'm not discussing wheater belgium is a real country or not i 'm just saying that us real countries have national pride . 
  i 'm under the impression that the eu is more of an economical union than a military one . 
  some people on this subreddit talk like they want to eliminate current countries and make the eu all one bigger country . 
  there are things that we should do together but we should all keep our national allegiance so that we can keep different cultures . 
  `` in varietate concordia '' remember ? 
  and taking one 's army is eliminating some of the local patriotism . 
  first of all i think you are a hypocrite . 
  i agree that 's is rather stupid to call the greeks pigs but calling the russians fools or the swedes suckers is not any different . 
  another thing-do you feel like everyone should like the euro ? 
  i like it and i like eu but there are people who disagree and that 's ok-they have an opinion . 
  we ca n't all be the same . 
  italy also got screwed by the euro . 
  should we just say it 's not true ? 
  what is more-what is wrong with being nationalistic . 
  yes i 'm proud of my nation and that is good . 
  same goes for other people . 
  comparing modern europe with 1940 's germany is rather ignorant . 
  first of all if you decide to open a book ( or even wikipedia ) you 'll realize that from 1939 to 1945 there was war . 
  where is there war now ? 
  in fact i feel like we 're way too tolerant . 
  we accept all kinds of immigrants the majority of which are just welfare seekers . 
  how is that policy of over-tolerance anywhere near to nazi germany ? 
  i doubt we can do without guns . 
  we do have to kill some animals once in a while do n't we ? 
  also when did cars become so necessary ? 
  we could just use horses or something .

  yay , we 're in too . 
    take control of a nuclear power plant  this is a much more likely target . 
  after the recent attacks though , i 'd have those fuckers guarded 24/7 . 
  also , just because you have control of a reactor does n't mean you can set off a meltdown or similar . 
  this is probably the hardest of all , you 'd need to have clearance over multiple security layers , and have a plan to get any radioactive material out without getting noticed , or a platoon/company of special forces with modern equipment and knowledge of the plant . 
  translation  half of the taxpayer 's income does not exceed 16.430 euros , according to the department of finance of the treasury on 2014 tax returns ( those presented in 2015 ) . 
  the total declared income amounted to around 817 billion euro , for an average value of 20.320 euro . 
  compared with the previous year there is an increase of 0.4 % , `` a moderately positive result when compared to the performance of the nominal gdp , which recorded a decrease ( -0.7 % ) . 
  good . 
  both of the parties involved in that protest would have clashed almost immediately . 
  the horror ** **, 
  get a room already . 
  have fun . 
  heh , the top right one is pissed he 's being caught . 
  it 's just a tad bit old : 5459 days more or less . 
  the telegraph : * clickbaiting before it was cool . 
  * also , confirming a sacking \u2260 outlawing criticism altogether . 
  the first that comes to mind is the narrow margin that health services can charge . 
  oh no , the european nightmare :( europe is doomed . 
  another way to tell it : ** death to the poor !, 
  ** sidenote : lol , germany not a `` nanny state '' , yeah on alcohol and smoke maybe . 
  but everything else ... 
  i love this , but i kinda want to see a raving hitler irl . 
  italy - armistice of lyon , 1504 . 
  kingdom of naples under spanish influence and duchy of milan under france . 
  if one wanted to put a milestone to the italian north/south divide this would be it .

  were n't arabs the baddies now ? 
  i propose an abortion of the abortion ban . 
  private pensions `` raw '' payout , benefits and other subsidies are not included . 
  the uk has a peculiar pension system , a parallel for italy is state subsidies for pensioners that comply with various requirement . 
  austerity worked for spain . 
  the us debt also nearly doubled , something that an economy already over 120 % could n't afford even if allowed . 
  i oversaw that , added . 
  french data on public debt rise and gdp growth looks quite grim . 
  [ france ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/economy_finance/eu/countries/france_en.htm ) has more margin then [ italy ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/economy_finance/eu/countries/italy_en.htm ) but the relative situation is worst , ouch indeed . 
  translation of the most relevant parts :  at the start of 2016 18,1 million pensions were given out , with an `` high concentration in lower tiers '' . 
  the national institute of statistics ( istat ) notes that [ ... ] women with pensions below 750 $ are 77,1 % . 
  this is not a poverty index in itself , since a lot of pensioners have other source of income or assistance . 
   51 % of pensions erogated in 2015 were of assistential nature . 
   [ ... ]  63 out of 1000 pensions are for assistance [ eg disability ] .

  will he manage to brainwash enough people before the march/april elections ? 
  a somewhat obsolete one , but anyway : an italian , an american and a german sit together for lunch . 
  suddenly a buzzing is heard . 
  the german brings his hand to his face , thumb to the ear , little finger to the mouth , and talks for a while . 
  then he says : `` see ? 
  zuperior german engineering allows me to take care ov important business with telephone embedded in hand ! '', 
  a few minutes later a faint beeping is heard . 
  the american pokes his cheek with a finger and talks to himself for a while . 
  `` see ? 
  superior american technology allows me to take care of important business with a telephone embedded in my tooth ! '', 
  after a couple minutes the italian farts loudly . 
  everyone looks at him agape , but he confidently says : `` eh , it was just a fax . 
  i can read it after lunch . '', 
  they need to voluntarily register themselves - you can not force them . 
  and since technically they 're not under arrest holding them anywhere against their will is a grey area . 
  compound that with the fact that each country does n't really mind if they go away and here 's your conundrum served . 
  of course , but the root is still fuga . 
  and refuge comes from the word ` fuga ' , which means escape . 
  in italian you can also use ` profugo ' which is similar to the greek word , and still contains the same word . 
  you do know that you never get to elect the president , right ? 
  it should be covered in the civics books you get in school . 
  you elect the parliament and they elect the president . 
  this did not apply specifically to renzi , this has been so for a while . 
  drop them in the water ? 
  uh , unpleasant and illegal . 
  enter libyan waters without permission to drop them off ? 
  aww , now you 're violating a nation 's borders , is that an act of war ? 
  and they 're not going to admit being libyan any way . 
  drop them somewhere at random ? 
  oops , there 's international laws against that . 
  what else ? 
  they 'll simply say they 're not libyan . 
  also libya would have to agree with the repatriation , otherwise you can not simply show up and drop people there . 
  how do you close a sea exactly ? 
  does the plan also involve watching people drown from afar ? 
  either they do n't tell what their original country is right for this reason or their country has no functioning government/doesn ' t give a damn and is happy to let them go . 
  it 's one of the checks and balances of the state . 
  the judicial power can not act against the government directly . 
  the parliament has to approve proceedings against a member of the parliament before they can take effect . 
  italian : 's \u00ec ' for yes and ` no ' for no . 
  we also have ` ni ' as a fusion of both of them , meaning that something is only partially true . 
  a sort of `` well , yes and no ... '', 
  it 's the same deal with colors , species , whatever . 
  the distinction between dialects and languages is entirely arbitrary , so you have people arguing about where to draw the lines . 
  for some they 're all dialects , for others they 're all different languages . 
  sardinian is considered an entirely separate language rather than a dialect . 
  dialects are often actual separate languages , with different origins and influences , so they can be very different from standard italian in grammar and vocabulary . 
  in addition , in the last few decades , they were seen as the mark of the uncultured and their use was discouraged in schools and educated families . 
  today you only see dialects used among older people or close friends generally , but never with strangers or in tv unless for characterization purposes . 
  there 's nowadays a sort of revival of dialects as a way to recover past cultures and traditions , songs and literature , to the point that some regions want to instate a dialect class in schools , although this is generally seen as a political initiative to foster ` localism ' and independentism . 
  actually it should n't go to a vote , being an issue of rights . 
  our equivalent of the supreme court was called to sentence on the matter like the us one , but they found that it 's something that the parliament should address . 
  no automatic gay marriage , but there 's a gap in the law that must be filled so that the equality of rights is maintained . 
  you can not turn them back . 
  international law , treaties and agreements forbid it . 
  libya does not want foreign ships , so no . 
  furthermore to return them they have to provide their identity , which they refuse to do . 
  the latest poll places agreement with gay marriage at about 57 % . 
  support is much higher among young people and center/north italy . 
  ** italy ** ** tv ( main channels ) ** * ** rai 1 , 2 and 3 ** are state tv channels , whose directors are named by government commissions and therefore are generally aligned to the ruling party . 
  that said rai 3 has always been much more left-leaning than the others , while rai 1 was always the more conservative one . 
  the ** rai news ** channel has a reputation of being fairly balanced . 
  * ** mediaset channels ( canale 5 , italia 1 , rete 4 ) ** are berlusconi 's tvs , so they 're pretty much his mouthpieces . 
  it 's been years since i last watched them , so i 'm not sure about their state now , but during berlusconi 's golden years they were pretty ludicrous in their news spinning . 
  * ** la7 ** is somewhat of a third party , despite being controlled by an entrepreneur with some connections to berlusconi . 
  it has so far proved to be one of the most balanced news sources , with a bit of a leaning towards the left . 
  ** newspapers ** * ** repubblica ** is probably the most read newspaper and is definitely center-left ( pd ) aligned . 
  it used to be much more ` serious ' that it is now , but it too fell to some clickbaiting practices . 
  known also for the ` sidebar of crap ' which is full of the most useless pieces of news ever . 
  * ** corriere della sera ** is the main ` moderate ' newspaper , with slight center-right preferences , but generally fairly balanced . 
  * ** il giornale ** used to be one of the most respected right-wing newspapers , but is now a berlusconi-controlled rag , causing the loss of 10 points of qi when actually read . 
  * ** libero ** and ** il foglio ** are even worse right-wing and populist ` things ' . 
  if not already indoctrinated you 'll want to gouge your eyes out . 
  * ** il fatto quotidiano ** started out as a radical unaligned paper , but seems to have now taken to heart the m5s ( grillo 's ) cause and is generally anti-governative . 
  * ** il sole 24 ore ** business newspaper . 
  tends to look at the entrepreneur 's side of things . 
  there 's a lot more newspapers , each tied to one specific party or faction , with several more regional ones , but they 're probably less relevant . 
  [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lp2udyzxp6g ) . 
  it 's still used as the reference for cringeworthiness several years after the fact . 
  it also helps to mention that the guy was minister of cultural heritage and the mentioned website cost something like 40 million $ , ending up being little more than a static page with a few pictures and horrible translation errors . 
  in italy there have been countless attempts at passing some sort on law on civil unions or associated variants , and they always got stuck on fights on minor points such as the name , the process , the tax effects , whatever until the government collapsed and the next one had to start anew . 
  in the meantime several cities decided to go ahead and open the registries to same sex unions no matter what , causing a number of reprimands , threats of consequences and stuff like that . 
  the supreme court has already cast doubts on the validity of such practices , recommending however that a law be made soon to address the issue . 
  as of now in fact it is possible for someone to get gay-married several times in different countries in europe , since the italian records office will not accept the marriage and will give the go-ahead to foreign offices inquiring about the marriage state of that person . 
  this could be fun in a few years time . 
  anyway there is yet another bill about to be discussed to enable same sex unions and this time it seems that renzi will see it through like he 's doing for other stuff , so maybe we 'll stop being gray on all these maps soon . 
  the expo is another name for the so-called world fair , which is held every few years in a country , a bit like the olympics . 
  this time it is being held in milan , around the theme of sustainable food production , more or less . 
  protests happened for a number of reasons : it is may 1st , which is always a good day for protests ; the expo is seen as a red herring to promote globalization and multinational corporations , which are seen as the mail culprits of the economic crisis and of unsustainable industry ; the expo itself is seen as a waste of money that could have been used for better purposes , and also it was the center point of yet another corruption scandal about tender assigments and shady business practices ; there were also several reports of workers being recruited with ridiculous contracts and meager pay , while the recruiting agencies pocketed a good chunk of the money . 
  there 's never a lack of reasons to protest ... 
  italy would probably be last in this ranking . 
  after ww2 , when italians voted to become a republic , the savoia royal family was exiled with a ` temporary ' article in the constitution . 
  said article was only removed a few years ago , and until then the savoias contented themselves with occasional off-the-scene comments nobody cared about ( and with the family head guy mostly coming off as an entitled jerk ) . 
  after the exile was repealed they tried to somehow become relevant again , including trying to launch the wanna-be prince as a singer with this [ masterpiece ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiill79mu7q ) here ( he 's the off-key middle guy - the lyrics talk about his heartfelt nostalgia for italy ) and maybe some reality show appearances . 
  all attempts failed rather badly . 
  nowadays nobody really cares about them apart from some fringe monarchist groups and nobody knows where they ended up . 
  i 'm gay , so i 'm probably biased , but i 've met an increasing number of people who do n't hide their being gay . 
  i work in software development and i have a few openly gay coworkers , and several people i 've talked with about being gay have been very supportive . 
  i know that it really depends on the place , but it seems that things are definitely improving . 
  appeals are a right of both parties .

wow ... the things you learn . 
  did we give a train to gaddafi ? 
  keep in mind that none of our trains are actually * that * bad - quite the contrary - but belgium and the netherlands recently purchased a rather terrible batch of pax trains from ansaldo breda . 
  the project seemed ... ~ ~ good ~ ~ decent on paper but turned out to be quite flawed , to say the least : mechanics tried to fix them several times to no avail , and the trains just had to be sent back to the factory . 
  i am sincerely appalled by all this . 
  `` how much did the new sofa cost you ? '', 
  `` oh , just a million '' . 
  convos like this are still fairly common , and my parents are still thinking in lire ... also , when i was younger i managed to amass some 75.000 l. - the pocket money of ( a quarter of ) a lifetime . 
  then we went with grandma at the bank in order to exchange the money , and the teller only gave me 35 . 
  euros . 
  i 'm still disappointed to this day . 
  nope . 
  i swear i had just read `` eu to provide armenia with fresh air '' . 
  the * coperto * is illegal in rome ( and the surrounding lazio region ) , though . 
  i very much like the [ monument to victor emmanuel ii ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a2/piazza_venezia_-_il_vittoriano.jpg ) , as well as the parthenon in athens : ca n't wait until they finish all those restoration works ( but i know well i 'll be probably old and senile by then ) . 
  thanx both . 
  oops !, 
  no , i meant swedish meatballs ... what 's the correct name ? 
  i love you , sweden : without abba , * k\u00f6ttbullar * , paradox games , garlic-flavoured crisps and ... uhm , * swedish women * , life would n't quite be the same . 
  but i also love you , greece because of the people , of the culture , and * tzatziki * . 
   do you think it is going to be beneficial in general ? 
  * no , i do n't think so . 
   or is it going to a tread for the sovereignty of european people ? 
  * yeah , it might very well turn out to be such a thing ...  do we have to worry just reading what have been already leaked ? 
  * yes - and i do n't like how both parties are negotiating the whole thing behind closed doors . 
   what is the coverage of the demonstrations , if any , in your country ? 
  are there a huge movement in your country ? 
  * the whole ttip issue is getting blissfully ignored by our local media . 
  however , the farcical * five star movement * is - unfortunately - the only one publicly opposing the treaty , which was also criticised during the latest rally in rome ( it took place earlier this month in the circus maximus ) . 
  but what about eu food regulations ? 
  i 'm afraid that the other party wants us to lower them in the name of business and this is something i am not willing to concede ... 
  i 'm also concerned about the many traditional food products covered by the pdo/pgi/tgs labels , which can only be produced in certain european regions . 
  in my opinion , letting the americans freely export their counterfeit version of , say , * parmigiano reggiano * will be detrimental for us . 
  i 'm not surprised in the slightest - the russians have been pulling out this kind of shit for decades now . 
  in italy we 've got * euro * [ \u02c8\u025buro ] and * centesimo * [ t\u0283en\u02c8tezimo ] , whose plural is * centesimi * [ t\u0283en\u02c8tezimi ] . 
  the plural * euri * , while not grammatically incorrect , is frowned upon by most but can often be heard in rome . 
  thank you both !, 
  but what do the people think about it ? 
  is the public opinion favourable to such a development or ... ? 
  just curious , is there any chance that moldova could be ( re ) united with romania ? 
  he 'd better watch out , kim jong-il was an internet expert too ... 
  they come from all over the world , really - but there are mainly americans , british and germans . 
  i used to see lots of japanese too but now there are far more chinese tourists ( some shops are already looking for mandarin-speaking applicants ) . 
  there are n't many russians around , but they tend to be high-end travelers ... where i live ( borgo pio ... near st. peter 's ) you 'd be hard-pushed to spot a single roman ; and if it were n't for the many italians that everyday try to get into the nearby vatican pharmacy - where medication costs 20 % less than over here - i 'd end up thinking to be the only italian in that part of town !, 
  it 's a good plan , but should n't the government focus on removing all those overhead cables first ? 
  i thought both genoa and naples were among the biggest ? 
  just shut the bloody fuck up , asshole . 
   you get croatia and we slovenia + triest , deal ? 
  seriously , wtf spain ? 
  also - was there any need whatsoever to bring back that priest from the ebola-infested backass of nowhere ? 
  perhaps , the fact that the place you 're currently living in was part of italy might have something to do with the locals ' knowledge of italian ? 
  by the way , i live right next to vatican city - i think it counts as a state border , does n't it ? 
  - all i ever see is grumpy swiss guards , health pilgrims ( the vatican pharmacy is just a few blocks away and drugs cost 20 % less there ) plus a shitload of tourists . 
  yep , that 's my impression . 
  renzi is also the ( not that much ) left-wing equivalent of berlusconi , minus the wild sex life and media empire . 
  gaddafi was tolerated mainly because of oil and the fact that italy ( a nato member ) was the biggest - if not the * only * - commercial partner of libya at the time . 
  the regime also proved useful in preventing many immigrants from reaching the italian shores , and this is exactly why our politicians kept dealing with him no matter what ... at least until shit began hitting the fan . 
  i dare say we shot ourselves in the foot in 2011 . 
  well , this is what happened . 
  nope . 
  * before !, 
  our president appointed them . 
  ok , it should 've been `` two unelected pms '' . 
  ( i mean monti & renzi - letta was both democratically elected * and * a footnote to history ) . 
  daaamn , bulgaria , you 're catching up fast ... ... but wait until you get three unelected pms in a row . 
  on the other hand , many of the southerners i 've spoken to think we 're rather * unfriendly * ( go figure ) . 
  also , we 're supposed to be lazy folks who speak in a rather unpleasant accent ... just ask any northerner . 
  why is latium captioned as `` gays '' ? 
  i do n't get it . 
  i 'm afraid that was greece . 
  we did not have many problems while invading your country in 1939 ... 
  [ data expunged ], 
  it could be argued that not even italy as a whole has got what you 'd call a `` mediterranean '' culture ... 
  i think we 'd all vote against any and all such proposals . 
  both ** rome ** and the surrounding region of ** latium ** have been under papal control from the early middle ages till 1870 , and many people would n't be ok with the idea of giving up our sovereignty to an obscurantist theocracy ; this goes without saying that our head of state may very well be a foreigner , so here 's another point against . 
  besides , latium per se is one of the few regions totally devoid of any independence movement : the only shining moment of our history was 2000 years ago and since then we have mattered very little on the international , or even domestic , stages . 
  we 're mostly renowned for our earthy cuisine , the fact of speaking a bunch of dialects which are widely regarded as silly ( or unpleasant ) and generally lacking a well-defined , separate culture . 
  in other words we 're just ordinary italians and little more ... the very idea of becoming something else is pointless . 
  unsurprisingly , my former university 's near the very bottom ( # 202 ) . 
  and that 'd be rome 's main uni . 
   a new election . 
  i think this government will fall ( ... ) i have never experienced this , the last one was in 1958 . 
  wow , and to think we 're used to having the government fall every year or so . 
  ;-) btw , do you think this new party is really willing to address the immigration issue ? 
  what about the equality policies ? 
  are they going to change something ( please pardon my skewed , and a bit clich\u00e9d , perspective on sweden ) ? 
   libya ~ ~ is ~ ~ ** was ** the most developed country in africa ftfy  eritrea is the north korea of africa . 
  that 's true . 
  to be fair , we lost control of eritrea after 1942 and then our former colony was merged with ethiopia in the '50s . 
  the current ~ ~ government ~ ~ dictator , isaias afewerki , came in power after the country 's war of independence ( which ended in 1993 ) so the human rights mess we know today is * not entirely * our fault . 
  actually , eritrea was in the past a decent place to be and the same could be said of somalia before siad barre 's rise to power ( which took place in 1969 , nine years after the country 's independence ) . 
  * what ? 
  we had colonies ? 
  really ?!, 
  * jokes aside , i think the prize goes to ** eritrea ** , our very first colony ( 1882 ) . 
  the country , and more precisely its capital , asmara were - and still are in part - a slice of italy in east africa : there are lots of colonial-era buildings standing , many eritreans speak or ar least can understand our language , some thousand italians still live there and asmara itself has got an italian high school ... plus there 's plenty of good italian/eritrean food to be had . 
  it should also be noted , though , that the current eritrean government is doing its best in order to prevent people from appreciating their country . 
  * ** somalia ** would be a close second ( indeed , it became our second colony in 1890 ) but many people , including our rather short-sighted political establishment , seem to have forgot the country 's very existence after the fall of the communist regime in 1991 and the following year 's military intervention ... much to the somalis ' dismay , it seems . 
  * we are too ashamed to even think about ** ethiopia ** having ever been an italian possession ; besides , we were there for only six years or so . 
  enough said .

  ( for the same reason , i foresee r/europe 's users becoming fluent french speakers by the end of 2018 . ), 
  i find amazing that in 1995 he predicted that  there is in our future internet populism , in which the emotional response of a selected group of citizens can be presented and accepted as the voice of the people at the time most of us thought that internet was finally freeing information from biased media corporations , and predicted a future were everyone was more informed and aware ; fast forward to 20 years later and we are vocally asking big media corporations to limit the freedom of speech over their networks because the reach of populist bullshit over the internet has become a threat to the whole idea of conscious and informed democratic participation . 
  they still absorbed the former anti-communist electorate , keeping in line with the historical bipolar system . 
   also this is nothing compared to the crisis of 1993 1992 was a bigger political scandal , this is a crisis of democratic institutions . 
  parties collapsed back then , but politics and the idea of parliamentary democracy as a representation of the people 's will survived . 
  for the past 5 years , however , the link between parties and their electorate ceased to exist . 
  when historical parties are unable to comply with their mandates , because the only possible outcome of the elections are unstable coalitions with the natural enemy , when a third of the voters decide that their identity is better represented by a post-ideological party , when we are unable to stop and rewrite the rules to remove ourselves from the dead-lock , the problem becomes too big to avoid acknowledging it . 
  the second republic started the moment the first ended , but right now it 's been over for 5 years , we have n't moved forward an inch , and we have no clue on how and when we will fix a system that is broken . 
  also , the five star movement was already a party filling newspaper headlines in 2011 . 
  some explanations on what 's happening in italy and what was the real meaning of the referendum : - italy is facing its biggest political crisis since the birth of the republic : we 've got a populist right-wing party that was n't able to reform itself after the downfall of berlusconi , a left-wing struggling to find its place in history ( both ridden with scandals ) , lega nord rebranding as an alt-right party and a crazy post-factual , post-ideological populist party with no precedents in the western world . 
  - this heterogeneous clusterfuck of mutually exclusive political interests means that we are now unable to organize ourself with a proper government . 
  after a brief , hated , coalition government led by appointed eurocrats ( 2011 ) , we voted a parliament with no clear majority . 
  ( 2013 ) to appoint a government , in italy , you need to gain the majority of votes in two chambers elected with different rules ( but with the same role ) , and our past election laws do n't work anymore , in a political spectrum that has become tripolar . 
  since the 5 star movement does n't do alliances , the center-left had to form a coalition with their natural enemy , berlusconi , the guy they depicted as satan for 20 years . 
  they choose a catholic moderate as coalition leader , with the task of fixing the election law before going to new elections , but of course it did n't work . 
  - ( 2014 ) here comes renzi : he 's always playing attack . 
  he stated the weakness and staleness of the ruling coalition , went straight to berlusconi and negotiated with him the new institutional reforms , then forced letta to resign and was appointed as prime minister with the same task of rewriting the rules of the game in order to break the mexican standoff . 
  - the reforms : a strongly majoritarian voting system with a second ballot , to ensure a winner after the elections , and a constitutional reform that diminished the role of the high chamber , removing the need for the government to juggle with two different majorities at the same time . 
  - those reforms needed years before they could be approved , meanwhile he used his strengths to turn the weak coalition he inherited into his own majority . 
  he kicked berlusconi out of the window , breaking his party in two and keeping only the more centrist mp as his allies , reformed the job market , the school system , the public administration , passed civil unions , and many other reforms , while fighting on many battlegrounds ( europe being one of them ) . 
  - he was forced to always reshuffle all his cards in order to keep the momentum of his leadership alive , but it also meant that everyone started building a resentment against him : the leftist members of his own party were unhappy with his ways and the populists movements campaigned relentlessly with their anti-establishment propaganda against him , because behind his dynamic leadership there were many unresolved weakness : he was n't chosen by popular vote , the economy never got the boost needed to fully restore confidence , immigration became a huge problem , he had to seek many compromises in his policies due to the heterogeneous nature of his majority , and he was n't able to distance himself from the many scandals that hit his party , even if they were linked to the former party ranks . 
  this especially in the south , were he was n't able to push his new political ranks into leading party roles and was forced to keep the old , nepotist oligarchy , alive . 
  - back to the reforms : more than a year into the process he 's now lacking the full backing of berlusconi 's party and he 's leading a smaller coalition , unable to change the constitution on their own . 
  he has to go through a referendum . 
  he also stopped being perceived has a temporary coalition leader with the task of fixing the system , he 's become the leader of renzi 's party , pushing for renzi 's system . 
  he went all in , once again . 
  - he lost . 
  his strange political ride , the third longest government in italy 's republican history , lost its momentum and had to stop . 
  we are now back to stage one , and i have no idea on what the fuck we are going to do now . 
  [ did n't you hear the news ?

  well , simply from the fact that they are shutting the fuck up , you can point out that they are not italians . 
   there should be a warning specifically for czech tourists that warns them not to go mountain climbing in flip flops and beachwear . 
  few years ago we opened a cable car over monte bianco , it comfortably takes tourists up to 3500m on the mountain . 
  so many idiots were going up wearing flip flops and beachwear that they had to issue multiple warnings . 
  the panoramic terrace is fine , but of course they all think it 'll be a great fun to have a run on the glacier too ( dangerous and for mountaineers only ) .

  unions have long opposed a national minimum wage because it will end up undercutting most of their bargainings ( that cover most of the workforce ) . 
  do n't be to cocky . 
  getting a law fifteen years later is n't that weird . 
  center-right governments opposed the law , the 2006 center left government lost its majority before their civil union proposal could be approved , so the law was brought back to the table only when they regained a majority , 7 years later . 
  in countries with no national cap , salaries are independently negotiated with the unions for each job sector , 0.00 $ is misleading .

  this thread reminds me why i stopped posting on r/europe . 
  today is the most important day for italy , it remembers the end of fascism and the birth of modern italy . 
  in 1943 we did n't switch side : italy signed an unconditional surrender , the fascist regime did n't , turning northern italy into a nazi-puppet state ( hence the nazi-fascim definition ) . 
  a new war started , with many meanings : it was a civil war between fascists and antifascists italians , a liberation war against the german occupation , and a class war led by italian communists against the former ruling classes . 
  ( claudio pavone , a civil war , 1991 ) . 
  the great work of the allied powers made it possible for all the parties and men that opposed fascism to fight together with a common , greater aim : free , democratic italy . 
  communists fought alongside catholics , socialists and liberals ; monarchists with republicans , and by the end of the war they all dropped their ( deeply divergent ) political claims and choose to sit together in order to write a new , antifascist ( and republican ) constitution . 
  today we do n't celebrate winning the war , we celebrate those men who fought together to win our democracy back , after 20 years of totalitarian regime . 
  being born under a regime does n't make you a fascist ( or a nazi or a communist ) , the great violence and deprivation of rights that keeps totalitarian rulers in charge is not a joke . 
  disagreement is outlawed , not inexistent . 
  all those parties , who formed the national liberation committee in 1943 , managed to survive underground for two decades after being banned , their leaders faced death and prison and managed to rebuild a country torn by a civil war into a modern western democracy .

  i know , but many italians still think of slovenia as an eastern european country , it 's not a statement about your or their wealth , just an old mental scheme that will take some more years to change . 
   i hate when people say that baltic 's are in east as well to be fair , people in their 30s and older grew up in a europe divided in two , it 's not a perception you could wipe out easily .

  the list works well as a `` list of 250 good and very popular films that you should absolutely not miss if you are male and under 30 '' , but as a `` best 250 films ever , ranked '' list it 's indeed full of major wtf : two films from the godfather trilogy , a batman tie-in , fight club , and the third part of tlotr make the top ten ( with shawnshank on top ) , schindler 's list , indiana jones and private ryan are the three top rated spielberg 's movies , the departed comes before raging bull and toy story 3 way before the first , l\u00e8on is considered the second best film ever produced in europe , donnie darko , etc. . . 
  some filmmakers are starting to experiment with on-demand distribution , in my opinion with mixed results : - [ leos carax 's holy motors ] ( http://holymotors.co.uk/ ) , 10 # - 30 days access - region locked < -- are you kidding me ?!, 
  - [ larry clark 's marfa girl ] ( http://larryclark.com/marfagirl ) , 5 $ - 24h access - no region lock , french and italian subtitles available < -- yes , please anyway , ~ ~ holy motors is wild , marfa girl good if you larry clark ~ ~ i hope european distributors will really move in this direction , i 'm sure that there are plenty of people like me willing to pay 5 $ to watch films that they will otherwise torrent ( because they do n't get a release , because they come out in cinemas but there 's some italian cunt dubbing over isabelle huppert , because i do n't have a blue-ray player nor a television set and itunes movie is a joke over here ),

  [ okay ] ( http://i1.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/000/082/456/okay.png ), 
  yes , i 'm mainly talking about people eating their food in a locked bedroom to avoid any kind of small talk . 
  people sharing a flat without acting like bff is normal everywhere and does n't need a special tag . 
  i think that the concept of `` zweck-wg '' ( people sharing an apartment to save money but refusing to have any sort of social interaction with their house-mates ) , can sound a little alienating and bizarre to non-germans . 
  aaand that 's why i voted for france . 
  that 's ... not very flattering .

  i 'd much rather spend that money to find these people jobs instead of sending it to a country i do n't care about . 
  if you explain to what benefits this bring to our countries i will be thankful . 
  and if they are significant i will be happy to apologize . 
  besides , colonialism ? 
  how is it our fault ? 
  what you think they would n't have done the same ? 
  of course they would . 
  everyone want power and land , even africans . 
  we were just the ones who happened to have the better technology , so we conquered them . 
  should i feel guilty that rome conquered france and pay something to the french ? 
  should the austrians feel guilty for conquering northern italy ? 
  should they pay me something ? 
  that 's just how history goes . 
  i was actually waiting for such a comment . 
  i think yours is a joke but for everyone who is really going to say `` racist '' let 's clear up what the word racist means . 
  a racist person is someone who thinks and says that one race is superior to another . 
  a racist comment would be a comment expressing a thought that one race is superior to another . 
  nowhere in my comment , or as a matter of fact anywhere have i said such a thing . 
  besides the fact that i do n't give a fuck for kenya has nothing to do with the fact that they 're black . 
  i also do n't give a shit about belarus . 
  to be honest i do n't give a flying fuck for kenya . 
  ca n't eu money , obviously given by eu countries , i do n't know , stay in the eu . 
  i 'd understand giving away if every eu country was as rich as luxembourg , but that 's not the case . 
  plenty eu countries , my own as well , could use that money . 
  we do n't owe kenya anything and frankly i find this ridiculous , and i also see it as someone taking money from my pocket to give it to a country i do n't care about , and also one i 'm not in a union with . 
  it was before the revolution . 
  and not much , like we were for the new year , i do n't remember if it was 2010 or 2011 . 
  the funny thing was there were images of their former dictator and especially [ this one ] ( http://www.immobilier-neuf-tunisie.com/img-immobilier-neuf-tunisie/president-tunisie.jpg ) . 
  me and a friend started calling him raul for whatever reason . 
  anyway , as i said i 'm not sure if it was 2010 or 2011 but i 'm leaning towards 2011 since i remember talking about the revolution that already happened with my buddies at the gym the same year . 
  we were in a closed hotel community so i would n't know how things were going outside but i can assure i did not notice anything . 
  we went on a trip in the desert with jeeps , we even went to where star wars was filmed . 
  we went to a nearby mall ( a small pathetic excuse for a mall but you get me ) to buy souvenirs and still we did n't notice the revolution , although i was there right in it 's heart . 
  i have had experience in africa , although only as a tourist . 
  i 've been to egypt and tunisia . 
  egypt-well first of all it 's really really really really hot . 
  definitely some things worth seeing-the pyramids and karnak . 
  it 's worth going there and visiting . 
  hotel hygiene is ... let 's say they have a different standard than ours . 
  i 'd suggest pay a bit more for a nice place . 
  many scams and when they offer you camels for your wife i 'm almost sure they mean it . 
  same with tunisia . 
  fun trips . 
  but i would n't regret going there . 
  as for the relationships , i have almost no idea . 
  i remember berlusconi made some anti-immigrant pact with libya but that was in the days of gaddafi . 
  i 'm pretty sure italy has apologized to ethiopia 1 million times so far . 
   what do you think of the continent 's future as it relates to europe ? 
  many things . 
  on second though , when someone calls us eurofags we can be like : look at russia . 
  you can ignore the statistics all you want but that 's not going to change them . 
  not only about race or ethnicity . 
   one who regards or treats the members of a group it includes ethnic groups but it 's not only about them . 
  pedophiles are also a group . 
  i have the / r/europe survey . 
  if that not sufficient i understand you . 
  close your eyes to the real facts , because they make you feel better . 
   show me the facts and i 'll show you where they 're a myth obviously unable to do that , now are you ? 
  our women could be the same as our men , our children . 
  it 's not that much big of deal , it 's of an expression . 
  when i say `` my sister '' it does not mean i own her or anything . 
  she 's just my sister as i am her brother . 
  do you get me ? 
  what am i really ? 
  please tell me !,

  posted in this same thread if you cared to read . 
  plus pay attention to all the article that even we on / r/europe have quite often . 
  police station besieged . 
  some norwegian woman arrested for being raped . 
  it 's full of source but you would n't be interested in reading them since they do n't fill in with your butterfly and roses world in which multiculturalism is heaven on earth , higher crime rates among immigrants do n't exist , and we 're all just the same . 
  a beautiful rainbow of people living all together in peace , we 're all tolerant of each other . 
  and where we give home to these people , tormented by war and gruesome laws . 
  well now it is us who is tormented by them and it 's our women who are afraid to walk the streets more than ever and it is us who are about to be ruled by such laws . 
  it 's europeans that do n't have a job . 
  it 's europeans who wo n't have a home . 
  also would you people *** please *** learn what bigot means . 
  a bigot is someone who is intolerant of those who are different in anything including opinions . 
  you 're just as bigoted to my opinion , if not more , as i am to islam . 
  we 're all bigots . 
  you 're against pedophiles ? 
  so am i. 
  we 're bigots . 
  this word is so commonly misused and misinterpreted it is starting to give me headaches . 
  stop throwing the word bigot around as if that 's your huge discussion winning secret card that destroys all opposition . 
  also , you 're calling me offensive words . 
  how dare you than preach to me about offending others ? 
  that irish guy has a lot to do with the immigrants . 
  also i 'm not spewing things . 
  i 'm stating my arguments . 
  i 'm actually trying to teach you something about the world . 
  but you 're not actually interested in changing your mind and learning something ? 
  of course you 're not . 
  you 're just waiting for your little chance to say : hey look this guy is racist , and you 'll have your little victory over the far leftist crowd . 
  i mean yes , you 're the defendant of the weak , of the innocent minorities that never do anything wrong , or at least never so more than europeans . 
  you 're a hero .

  i ca n't imaging how daunting that may feel . 
  that feeling of uncertainty . 
  well as long as he lets them ... 
   now that i 'm borderline jaded . 
  for a second there i misread `` borderline jihad '' ... 
   they are most likely very often over 18 but `` lost '' their papers and claimed underage to get asylum more easily yeah he could very likely be one of those . 
  that does n't necessarily mean it was n't both . 
  yeah i can see that . 
  personally i 'd think this kind of `` overly accepting '' behaviour could be detrimental in the long term and not so much because of a direct terrorist threat . 
  i mean there 's too much difference from the incoming cultures versus the domestic ones so taking in so many in a such a short time span is a recipe for trouble in many aspects of society let alone possible terrorist attacks . 
  whoa that escalated quickly . 
  anyway i 'm wondering myself why there would be many refugees from afghanistan in germany atm . 
  probably because i did n't know there was an on-going war over there . 
  well they 're saying it is an asylum seeker from ochsenfurt . 
  mentally ill or not he apparently shouted allahu akhbar while attacking . 
  now i do n't know which of the two sides you 're referring to by `` their narritive '' . 
  true that . 
  most victims around the world are muslims themselves . 
  but at the same time we ca n't enforce certain pc school of thought that does anything to deny the attachment of terrorism ( and other problems ) to islam as if we were comparing oranges with apples . 
  it 's tricky but a ( hardly achievable ) balance needs to be found . 
  `` the perpetrator attacked the passengers with an ax and a knife . 
  a spokesman for the bavarian interior ministry said he shouted ` allahu akbar ' ( god is great ) . '', 
  yeah but 17 ?? 
  i do n't know maybe it 's me but i think it 's very sad . 
  just because surprises can be good or bad . 
  a 17 y/o terrorist was a thing yet to be seen in europe . 
  certainly not a good thing . 
  and not in a good way either . 
   sky is already reporting a ` terrorist attack with 20 victims ' ( quickly corrected to axe-wielding attacker injures four on train ) . 
  well the news has just been breaking . 
  that has to do with the way the news go around in the first moments of something happening . 
   it would stop this continent 's drive towards mass-hysteria about terrorism well mass-hysteria or not we would keep witnessing terror attacks in our continent . 
  it might not be helpful but it 's understandable . 
  i ca n't see how that could be any better , though . 
  is this sarcasm ? 
  7/10 needs more concrete . 
  so is southern . 
  almost as if there was a cycle of seasons that repeated itself every year ... mmh interesting . 
  that sounds like a very reasonable and controlled reaction . 
  well it 's naive that you think that anything can be justified once a majority agrees to it . 
  even a majority vote does n't rule out critical thinking on whatever matter . 
  but i can see you 're more busy with blaming the west for anything that happens anywhere so i 'll leave you to that . 
  next time you ca n't find your remote control or there 's a traffic jam i 'm sure you 'll be thinking about us . 
  sincerely , the west . 
  let 's make greece meg\u00e1li again !, 
  wow your head 's spinning right now . 
  no one 's saying coups are cool , but what erdogan 's doing in turkey surely is nightmare fuel . 
  in the west we have freedom of speech and that includes being able to commentate what 's going on in the world from brexit to turkey . 
  period . 
  the coup seems to have failed ... obama was very well informed and he backed up erdogan before anyone else !, 
  erdogan 's not gon na give up . 
  he 's got several men loyal to him . 
  a civil war is n't a too far-fetched possibility . 
  they said erdogan has been arrested . 
  together with the military chief of staff . 
  the military has sent emails to the journalists and have announced the coup on twitter . 
  they claim they have seized power over the country . 
  people are saying that the state owned tv has been shut down . 
  cool . 
  but i also value democracy and overthrowing someone is n't a good sign for it . 
   i wonder who he 'll blame . 
  maybe putin has a hand in it ... just saying . 
  do your social media work ? 
  they 're saying they just blocked them . 
  there 's always worse than x. ... a military dictatorship is one of those things . 
  i heard on tv that this could be a ** coups d'\u00e9tat ** . 
  bloody hell . 
  i hope it is n't true ... edit : tanks , planes on the bosphorus . 
  is someone trying to overthrow erdogan ? 
  edit : a turkish military helicopter could have just opened fire on the office of intelligence . 
  edit : the army is now searching the police and seizing their weapons . 
   the left and center parties have no plan , that 's why people vote far right . 
  yeah , but the far right only pretends to have a solution . 
  however i think the left is in complete denial ... what have we come to ? 
  yeah we all better start typing `` je suis nice '' really fast , cause otherwise these attacks are n't going to stop themselves . 
  probably because you already live or have lived in turkey . 
  or because not everyone has the same reactions . 
  you did n't see any tourist in sorso ? 
  no people at the beach , in the restaurants ? 
  by tourists i do n't necessarily mean foreigners ... no running water after a certain hour could happen for a drought but for a limited time . 
  or if someone 's working on the pipes . 
  i 'm not offended , it 's just genuinely funny to me . 
  i 've been to a couple reggea concerts there in sennori in the summer . 
  there were some tourists , definitely a couple foreign low-level performers ( general levy for example ) and young people everywhere with the latest pieces of technology in their hands and weed and beer . 
  i mean , no different than most places.the experience of some 80 year olds does n't say much the current state of the town . 
  what i 'm saying is that the overall impression about this little town is n't that accurate about the town itself , let alone `` most of italian society '' especially considering that sardinia is a little bit like france 's corsica in being its own thing . 
   north east sardinia oh now i get it ... 
  i live in northern sardinia myself and the the town of 150 ' 000 you also talked about is my hometown . 
  when i stumble into places like the one you described it 's like time traveling . 
  those places are no representation of life in my town or ( most of ) sardinia . 
  let alone italy . 
  however they do exist . 
  i 'd probably have a similar reaction to your own if i visited some scottish village or the like . 
  edit : by the way i just read that the town you went to is sennori . 
  i 'm laughing my ass off ... people do work there . 
  i think you got told a bit of a fairy tale ... maybe an augmented recount of the life over there . 
  my high school friend lived there i 've been to his house and i assure you they had access to water . 
  and fireworks in the summer and even tourists cause the beach is n't far from there . 
   germany/germania etc. 
  is what the romans called the region , and derives from latin .

  oecd is n't the bible . 
  this index wants to describe `` quality of life '' basing it on income and education ? 
   now , do you seriously think these people have an higher quality of life than the richest 10 % in portugal , which has free healthcare as well ? 
  tell me , do you ** seriously ** believe that ? 
  10 % of the americans are uninsured, 
   the poorest 10 % in the united states have a higher quality of life than the poorest 10 % in britain , germany , france and italy , and a better quality of life than the richest 10 % in portugal . 
  i highly doubt it . 
  while i 'm sure that the us are maybe the best place where to be rich , i doubt it 's the same for the poor people . 
  what is the poverty rate in the us , 14 % ? 
  and part of these people are living in extreme poverty , just like everywhere else . 
  now , do you seriously think these people have an higher quality of life than the richest 10 % in portugal , which has free healthcare as well ? 
  i just do n't believe that . 
  maybe this map is about the standard of living , at most ? 
  do n't forget standard of living are only one part of the quality of life . 
  no , the author made all the stereotypes on its own, 
  well i was n't even born too when she made his films but she 's pretty known anyway, 
  is n't she famous in hungary ? 
  in italy she is , was one of the main pornstars back in the 70/80s . 
  she has even been a member of parliament in 1987-1992, 
  more like shitpost :d, 
  those were the google results , these maps are from nationalstereotype.com instead, 
  all of these maps were made by a bulgarian illustrator afaik, 
  `` pirate state of naples '' lel, 
  * this article is 12 months old *, 
  there is a time for everything . 
  immigration does exist, 
  that 's the black economy , it 's not counted in the gdp , guess why grey/black economy in calabria is equivalent to 55 % of their gdp ( despite it does n't account for it ) . 
  in italy some businesses did 1:1000 despite the official 1:1927 rate, 
  yes , we are an industrial powerhouse , the 6th in the world . 
  if i recall correctly, 
   but directed towards hi-tech sectors and not infrastructure projects , right ? 
  no iirc , just less money overall . 
  several bike paths in northern italy were built with eu funds for example . 
  but most of smes are in northern italy , though . 
  and the transfers from northern to southern italy do n't work , i watched a video some days ago where boldrin ( an italian economist ) explained that southern italy was doing relatively well in reducing the gap with the north and in building new infrastructures efficiently , until 1971 , when public expenditure for southern italy skyrocketed bringing rife corruption and above all clientelism , and arguably these transfers ( for $ 80bn/year ) are one of our main problems . 
  the money going south are n't exactly used to compensate the structural economic differences between the north and the south . 
  how would hypothetical transfers from germany work ? 
  as handouts , investements , tax reliefs ? 
  about the smes , i talked about that [ some days ago ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4r4lkr/growth_in_real_per_capita_gdp_from_1995_to_2014/d4yodse ) . 
  i found [ this graph ] ( http://www.confartigianato.it/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/us_22072015_a.png ) , about the employment in the manufacturing enterprises having less than 20 workers . 
  this represents the 38 % of the italian manufacturing workers but just the 14 % when it comes to germany 's . 
  bigger the company the more competitive it is , also the medium/big companies have a much higher abiity to export , this is one of the main reasons we are stagnating . 
  i know , last year we had an awful natural change , it 's up to migration fixing it . 
  we 'll see if the automation will have big effects in our lives ... you have to take it into account too when talking about next decades, 
  alright , we attract eastern europeans too , if there are jobs available . 
  the italian citizens have been decreasing for years and years , it 's just the residents ( ie the migrants ) who make the population grow . 
  economy has to begin growing steadily again , the non-mena migrants will come with that . 
  surely we will suffer a lot of problems with arabs in the next decades , there are already some little * molenbeeks * in milan and turin . 
  but we do n't have other choice , if our women do n't have children we ca n't force them or gift them billions euros if not tens of thousands yearly . 
  i do n't agree , investements in infrastructures are vital . 
  i do n't speak for all southern europe but at least for italy , it 's a country with an high cars/trucks density , and several statal roads should be in better conditions . 
  also we export goods by land , we do n't export services : infrastructures are needed , really , otherwise it 'd fuck our already slow growth . 
  italian population is not in free-fall btw , neither is spain 's . 
  this year ours shrunk for the first time ever by a little , due to a -200 k natural change partially covered by a 80k net migration . 
  reducing the natural change ( not necessarily by increasing natality but even by reducing mortality ) more the recover of the economy in the next years ( + migration ) is likely to make the population raise again . 
  often mother benefits do n't work , unless you gift women a shitload of money to have children . 
  immigration will cover the natural population decrease , eu population is already shrinking but it 's covered by it . 
  even in mali women do n't have 8 children per couple ... 
  it 's a good way to save money too ... 
  * no worries * . 
  the government balance is the difference between revenues and expenses made by a country . 
  almost of all the eu countries have a deficit , germany and few others ( luxembourg and estonia iirc ) have a government surplus . 
  eu can fine countries with such deficit at  3 % of the country 's gdp , because having a large deficit increases the country 's debt too much . 
  the trade balance is another thing , it 's the difference between exports and imports : again , most of the eu countries have a trade deficit , but germany , the netherlands , italy , belgium , ireland and some in eastern europe . 
  the eu can fine countries with such surplus at  6 % of the country 's gdp , because having a large trade surplus may damage other countries ' ability to export . 
  you 're confusing trade surplus with government deficit, 
  yes , indeed right yesterday the amount lent to the smes in the april-june period is back at pre-crisis level, 
  i hope you know the difference between the real economy and one bank ... 
  the economy . 
   with the italian economy going down faster than berlusconi on a model source . 
  no , it has to do with the italian economy much more than you think , half of the amount is held by italian savers and cutting their shareholdings would damage the internal economy . 
  maybe it may a bit higher ... but at most some tens of thousands people . 
  no way they have 25 % of their population being there illegally . 
  greece has 11 million people, 
  san marino 's lifespan is 84 years, 
  when one is sad , he could always think we could have had this man as head of state .

  no , the ones you took are the metropolitan areas , except for milan , which has 1,3 m inhabitants in the city itself and 6-7m in the metropolitan area . 
  rome has 2,7 m inhabitants , metropolitan area of 4,5 m. 
  naples has 950k inhabitants , metro area 4,5 m. 
  turin has 900k inhabitants , metro area 2m people . 
  palermo has 700k inhabitants , 1,2 m counting its metro area . 
  ... are n't them in madrid ? 
  more companies than citizens because it 's a tax haven eheh, 
  they do that with pretty every kind of map . 
  same . 
  maybe they all live inside the petite couronne ? 
  it is miles of course , do n't you see they are even taller than where the moon is ? 
  yes you are right , there are lot of macro-economics stats to look at . 
  i was just pointing out that in most of the cases nominal gdp is better than gdp ppp . 
  ppp should be used only with overvalued/devalued currency , e.g. 
  in the case of russia . 
  otherwise , it inflates too much the level of richness of the poorer country . 
  the nominal gdp actually tells the richness produced in the country . 
  watch your mouth , i am a personal friend of the rothschild family and i wo n't hesitate to use my connections against you . 
  i 'll make sure tke sky above your home will be covered by chemtrails , your own bank account will be blocked by us , your movements shall be traced . 
  you and the other r/conspiracy maggots wo n't stop us . 
  * you are fucking dead , kiddo . 
  yes but how about the chemtrails ? 
  i thought the same .

  but i think it 's absolutely normal to fall in love for new places . 
  for example i 'd like to visit other countries and to relocate abroad , mainly because i 'm a curious guy . 
  i 'd love to live in a big metropolis and sometime making a long journey by car to the british and irish countryside . 
  here we have a lot of building in the older side ( mainly rented by university students but also by sienese families ) but also outside the centre of the city in suburbs . 
  in suburbs you spend less money and you could have to take a bus to go to the older part of the city but on the other side you are surrounded by the countryside ( and siena has chianti hills on the north-east side , `` montagnola '' and the plains of rosia on the north-west side , arbia river , its valley and the way to val d'orcia on the south side . 
  here in siena rents are : central ( into fortified central zone ) about 650/700 $ for 50mq . 
  outside centre ( 2km or more ) 500/600 $ for 50mq . 
  i 'm not involved in agricolture but my family has a farm of about 130ha . 
  we have two wheel tractors and two big caterpillars and another one smaller . 
  we have also two big farmhouses ( more or less 4.000 mq in total ) . 
  we produce wheat , barley , sunflowers , clover seeds , field beans , oats , hay and we have 250 olive trees for olive oil production . 
  when i was a child my granpa had 10 employees ( because we had also 200 cows ) , now the farm is managed by my brother . 
  i identify myself as tuscan and european . 
  personally i presume anything below tuscany is south and , at the opposite , anything above tuscany is north . 
  this only for historical and cultural reason , so `` south '' and `` north '' not only geographically . 
  i 'm tuscan :p ( actually centre-north ) . 
  i wait until green light turns on . 
  i 'm pissed off by people who does n't respect rules . 
  and same thing here in tuscany : a lot of germans , dutch , french and some briton with their humongous caravans trying to drive in our countryside roads . 
  i 've studied english since i was 11 , but at that time english lessons at school were a joke . 
  at the age of 35 i decided to go to university ( for a second degree ) so i 've been re-studying english for three years and in june i have a mandatory c1 exam ( cambridge cae ) and another exam about journalism and media translation from english to italian . 
  i 'm really scared because i 'm not so good in listening or in use of english even though i speak a lot with english speakers and i read every day ... poor me . 
  i 'm not so nationalist though . 
  well ... he could be only another historical famous person of our collection . 
  i agree , moreover he has had more chicks than trump . 
  best friends foreva ... i assume , 
  ahah i 've been waiting the first french triggered by my provocative assumption . 
   actually he was italian by his culture and ancestors , furthermore he born only one year after the french `` occupation '' of corsica which was genoese . 
  ~ ~ to be fair he was actually genoese ~ ~ . 
  edit : his ancestors were actually tuscan , from sarzana . 
  it 's the same thing if you define dante , boccaccio , simone martini , savonarola , leonardo , giotto , masaccio , puccini , machiavelli etc. . . as italians instead of tuscan . 
  probably he has been the first and the most revolutionary and visionary man of europe 's history . 
  proudly yessss ... [ berlusconi ] ( http://www.milanolife.it/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/incontro-in-via-rovani-tra-silvio-berlusconi-e-vladimir-putin.jpg ), 
  he was a brave italian guy but he stolen too many pieces of art here . 
  thank you , really interesting thing . 
   schwarzbrot i really love it . 
  here in italy i buy the flour with seeds to make this type of bread by myself . 
  so producing a lot of movies is the sign of a well developed industry . 
  i 'm glad to read someone who have a genuinely passion for this industry . 
  here we have the same problem , italy is well known for its comedies and we have had great american actors in our films ( especially during the 50 's and the 60 's ) . 
  today is really difficult to find a good italian sci-fi movie or a horror but , as you know we were really good in some genres : western , horror , drama , historical etc. . . our industry includes also commercials ( i have a friend of mine who works in milan on food commercials for the arab market ) , non fiction movies ( documentary for example ) , and corporate videos ( mainly for institutions or corporations/business ) . 
  personally i work as a director and ( mainly ) as a video editor for multiple productions but i live in a beautiful , rich and at the same time little city , so it 's impossible to work for great projects . 
  when i finish my studies at university i will relocate abroad in europe , i really need to see new places , people and be inspired . 
  comedies are the cancer of cinema , especially in italy . 
  we produce a lot of these movies for tre reasons ( mainly ) : the starring actors are well known as comedians in tv shows , scriptwriters are lazy or not so courageous , average productions are not so rich ( under 1.5 million euros ) so they are focused on low budget screenplays . 
  i 've seen two turkish short films last summer in a festival , very interesting productions , good actors and well directed . 
  yes , probably given the mutation of movie industry in the last years it would be important to develop some alternatives to increase distribution and fruition . 
  co-productions at a european level could really important in some big project though . 
  oh my god , i know what you mean when you talk about bad acting ... 
  ahaha my bad . 
  i did n't want to be offensive . 
  i think videogame industry now is generally too developed so it 's even more difficult starting from scratch in producing a new videogame . 
  but probably in some niche of the market is possible to have some satisfaction yet . 
  ah ok , thank you for the answer . 
  really interesting , in italy i 'm also part of a cinematographic association and we produce an international short film festival . 
  i 've seen also some short films produce in denmark but also in sweden and other scandinavian countries , generally are a really decent level of narrativity and technical stuff . 
  interesting , do you have also a movie industry in the netherlands ? 
  yeah , i know pretty well media production in the uk  i only hope brexit would n't sink my dream to be there for working in the industry ... i 'm concluding a really hard route and are 3 years i 'm preparing to relocate because even though italy has a good media industry you have to cope with high taxation rates or poor and mostly unpaid freelance works ( `` unpaid '' because some client does n't pay your bill or pay it after 6 months ) . 
  really interesting , so i assume you produce movies using english instead of danish , is it right ? 
  for instance here in italy we have a lot of facilities for movie productions in rome while in milane there are media/tv facilities . 
  our industry is well developed but probably only in these two cities , in the rest of the country there are only small video productions companies involved in little projects such as commercials for local broadcasters , wedding videos or corporate videos . 
  yes , it sound absolutely familiar because italian is directly influenced by tuscan . 
  our accent is recognizable and funny and at the same time is deeply related to standard italian . 
  in italy , i think the funniest dialect is spoken in tuscany . 
  i think a united state of europe is not a choice but it 's the destiny of our continent . 
  so , you like or not , this is the future we will face . 
  attention : in italy we use the word `` dialetti '' in a wrong way . 
  in reality , according to sociolinguistics the term `` dialects '' is used to describe a language and its regional variations . 
  in italy we have non only a standard italian but also dozens of other languages . 
  we have also dialects of standard italian and dialects of the other languages . 
  for example we can recognize a sort of standard veneto language and its local variations ( dialects ) . 
  to sum up : a dialect is different from a language . 
  the first is only a variation in intonation and in some words , the second have different words , pronunciation and sometimes syntax . 
  i think the smell of shit is caused by the farms along the highways . 
  4000 $ for a year ? 
  i 'm not so sure money are the worst motivator , according to many economists and nobel prize winner kahneman . 
  in that video they assume money are not a useful motivator in some type of activities , it would be interesting to see some experiments to demonstrate that assumption . 
  i got it . 
  thank you for your interesting point of view . 
  probably some economist have made some studies and calculations , i 've studied some of cognitive economy but nothing more :d, 
  obviously i 'm playing the devil 's advocate because ubi has ( in my opinion ) some dark corners . 
  these are my doubts : - how much money could be this income ? 
  - could it be a wide spreading of low pay jobs ? 
  - how these low pay jobs could maintain a decent level of productivity given that workers are not stimulated by other incentives ? 
  it sounds good for me too . 
  could be interesting to calculate how much it would cost so evaluate it . 
  i see your point but i 'm more focused on the psychological effects of this choice . 
  i mean , it is absolutely clear that a positive stimulus is better than a negative one , so generally workers ' productivity increase when they receive bonuses as well as it decrease when they are punished . 
  i could be positive on universal basic income but what is the limit to avoid people prefer to stay at home rather than going to work ? 
  for the rational choice , a citizen earning ( for example ) 800 euros/month could decide to stay at home instead of working , because he/she can live in that income . 
  welfare probably is more selective and less `` universal '' . 
  by the way some people seem to be welfare state `` addicted '' and stay out of work for years . 
  mmm do n't know ... 
  hiring more people for few hours each is a contract sometimes used in italy and it is called `` contratto di solidariet\u00e0 '' ( solidarity contract ) . 
  but i do n't know if it works , on the other hand , it is actually a good thing automation and technological improvements , probably it is necessary to push companies in that direction thank to tax discounts . 
  how to push people receiving such income to work productively ? 
  this thing is against the `` rational choice theory '' . 
  yeah , we love fika very much . 
  in italy monarchy was a joke . 
  i think many italians would like to have their former dukes or princeps back instead of the savoia family .

  when my daughter was born , the city planted a tree in the woods in her name , but i did n't know it was an old tradition . 
  in italy we have [ carnevale ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/carnival ) in february , thought to be derived from the ancient roman festivals of saturnalia and bacchanalia . 
  on january 6th we have [ la befana ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/befana ) , an old woman riding a broomstick and delivering gifts to children ( traditionally , dried figs and tangerines to good kids , coal to naughty kids ) . 
  befana is probably descended from the sabine/roman goddess named strina . 
  in sicily on the night between november 1st and 2nd there is the day of the dead , when the dead visit the houses of their relatives , hiding gifts for the children around the house , typically candies and sweets prepared especially for this occasion ( `` bones of the dead '' ) . 
  the cult of perchta was also present in northeastern italy , known as berta , bertha , or frau bertha . 
  the goddess and the demons appeared in folk tales until a century ago , and there is still a saying in italian to indicate a remote past , `` quando berta filava '' , i.e. 
  when berta was spinning , a reference to the legend of [ frau holle ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mother_hulda ) . 
  most people do n't know it , but it 's a reference to pre-christian , i.e. 
  very ancient , times . 
  on january 6th in friuli great bonfires are lit , where a puppet ( representing a witch ) is burned . 
  it 's a reminder of pre-christian rites . 
  on the same day , a witch on a broom ( la befana ) brings gifts to children , a tradition originated in central italy . 
  only half of it , the occupied south . 
  in the north hitler reinstalled mussolini and the puppet state known as [ italian social republic ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/italian_social_republic ) . 
  according to your logic , italy should have been on the winning side at the end of the war , while instead it lost some territory to yugoslavia . 
  i 'm no expert , i read it on wikipedia : http://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/doppiaggio#la_tecnica, 
  they keep everything ( soundtrack , sound effects , laugh tracks ... ) but the dialogues are dubbed . 
  the production of the movie/tv series provides the dubbers with an audio track without the spoken parts . 
  everyday in large cities and tourist places in italy . 
  sometimes the police chase them away and they move a few meters down the street , other times they 're just tolerated . 
  i 've never experienced anything so extreme when i was in school , nor have my children so far , but i guess schools in southern italy are in a worse shape than those in the north . 
  canicatt\u00ec , a small town in sicily . 
  ac in schools is such an extravagant concept . 
  the school system in italy is so broke it can barely afford to pay teachers ' salaries . 
  parents often have to provide for essential school supplies out of their pockets . 
  exactly . 
  or , more frequently , no kids . 
   `` op z 'n italiaans '' is shagging her armpit . 
  not sure if there 's any truth to that . 
  wait , you mean not everybody does it ? 
  a titjob is a `` spagnola '' ( spanish , feminine ) in italian too . 
  there must be something going on in spain worth investigating . 
  are you thinking of spain ? 
  not in all languages . 
  we call it ue , which is quite the cacophony . 
  festung europa sounds much better . 
   in italy people sleep siesta there are indeed many differences between italy and sweden , but i 'm sure we do n't sleep siesta , whatever that means . 
  i 'm well aware of the fact that the us military [ has its own reasons for being here ] ( http://www.tomdispatch.com/blog/175755/ ) , and i 'm not under the illusion that us troops are here for our protection , although they still are a formidable deterrent . 
  i see having us bases in italy as part of the military alliance we 're in , but being on good terms with the us is also good for business : several italian firms have had access to lucrative us military contracts ( for example beretta for sidearms , fincantieri for building us coast guards ships ) , and there were also contracts for reconstruction in iraq and afghanistan . 
  however , the relationship with the us has n't always been easy : during the [ sigonella crisis ] ( http://everything2.com/title/the+sigonella+crisis ) in 1985 italy made clear that the bases are in italian territory and that they can be managed by the italian state in any moment , and the [ cavalese cable car disaster ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cavalese_cable_car_disaster_\\ ( 1998 \\ ) ) of 1998 strained relations between the us and italy . 
  i 'd say italian media cover national news 95 % of the times , then we get 4 % of news about the us ( because it 's cool ) , and 1 % for the rest of the world . 
  younger generations have n't experienced the cold war , that could explain the different disposition toward the us military presence in europe . 
  is italy ( or europe , in general ) an attractive destination for us military personnel ? 
  i mean , in terms of your career development , not for tourism potential . 
  interesting how renzi 's statement regarding the use was essentially ignored by the italian media , that focused instead on the revision of the stability pact . 
  on why the us military would want to keep its bases in europe , see for example [ the pentagon 's italian spending spree ] ( http://www.tomdispatch.com/blog/175755/ ) . 
  this is taken from the peace treaty with germany , revised in 1990 ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/treaty_on_the_final_settlement_with_respect_to_germany ) :  germany was to limit its combined armed forces to no more than 370,000 personnel , no more than 345,000 of whom were to be in the army and the air force . 
  germany also reaffirmed its renunciation of the manufacture , possession of , and control over nuclear , biological , and chemical weapons , and in particular , that the nuclear non-proliferation treaty would continue to apply in full to the unified germany ( the federal republic of germany ) . 
  no foreign armed forces , nuclear weapons , or the carriers for nuclear weapons would be stationed or deployed in six states ( the area of berlin and the former east germany ) , making them a permanent nuclear-weapon-free zone . 
  the german army could deploy conventional weapons systems with nonconventional capabilities , provided that they were equipped and designed for a purely conventional role . 
  germany also agreed to use military force only in accordance with the united nations charter . 
  article 11 of the constitution of italy reads :  italy repudiates war as an instrument of aggression against the freedom of other peoples and as a means for the settlement of international disputes . 
  italy agrees , on conditions of equality with other states , to the limitations of sovereignty that may be necessary to a world order ensuring peace and justice among the nations . 
  italy promotes and encourages international organisations furthering such ends . 
  this has n't been changed since 1948 , but it did n't prevent italy from bombing serbia and sending troops to kosovo , iraq , and afghanistan on `` peace '' missions , while , especially in afghanistan , troops were involved in actual combat duties . 
  for the limitations imposed to italy by the 1947 peace treaty , see articles 55 and following of the treaty ( http://www.diecifebbraio.info/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/treaty-of-peace-with-italy.pdf ) . 
  in short , no nuclear weapons , max . 
  250,000 soldiers , 200 tanks , no aircraft carriers , no bomber planes , max . 
  200 fighter planes . 
  the rules have been bended over the years : for example , we have two aircraft carriers , but i think they 're officially classified as helicopter carriers . 
  germany can not build a powerful military , because it 's forbidden by the wwii peace treaties . 
  italy has similar limitations . 
  until the treaties are revised , the us military is needed in europe . 
  not me , i 'm glad they 're here . 
  europeans will soon learn to disregard renzi 's empty rethoric . 
  well , we did this trick ( bar the citizenship part ) during the 2011 refugee crisis , but france and germany were n't enthusiastic about it . 
  amazingly accurate ( i think i speak american english ) , but i do n't understand how they came out with the singaporean dialect .

  what 's the story behind this medieval knight ? 
  my main sources on the soviet union : mihail geller , aleksander nekric : storia dell ` urss dal 1917 ad oggi , 1984 . 
  ( an italian translation of a russian book ; i do n't think it 's been translated into english ) . 
  francis spufford , red plenty . 
  inside the fifties 's soviet dream , 2010 . 
  a unique mix of fiction and history that gives an insight on the reasons for the decline of the urss from the '50s to the '70s . 
  anne applebaum , gulag : a history of the soviet camps , 2012 . 
  it 's fun and requires some memory and attention . 
  you can find the rules here : http://www.pagat.com/fishing/scopone.html, 
  there 's also the `` scopone scientifico '' variant of scopa , where all the 40 cards are handed to two teams of two players at the beginning of the game . 
  i remember hot sicilian nights being played away this way when i was visiting my relatives . 
  it probably depends on the area . 
  my daughter is in school now ( in the north ) and less than 1 % of the students opt out . 
  catholicism in italy is a mandatory subject in schools of all levels , but individual students can opt out ( they are not always offered an alternative program , however ) . 
  the religion teachers and the programs taught are chosen by the church , but the state pays their salaries . 
  there are 2 hours a week in primary school ( grades 1-5 ) , then 1 hour all the way to the maturit\u00e0 ( high school diploma ) .

  definition : * as a noun : physical injury , especially that which is deliberately inflicted . 
  * as a verb : to physically injure . 
  how can you say that physical harm is wrong and then say that spanking kids is okay ? 
  it 's literally a contradiction . 
  thankfully people demonise it , such violence has no place in our societies . 
  what 's so ridicolous about the illegality of harming other people ? 
  as long as you finish a 5 year high school , no matter which type , you can go to university if you are able to pass the admission test , which is usually pretty easy . 
  high schools also offer evening courses for students with jobs . 
  if you abandoned school or performed poorly there is n't really anything `` institutional '' to stop you from going back to school , the biggest problems would be time and money . 
  that 's correct , article 75 prevents it so you 'd have to change that first . 
  a referendum is n't the only way to get out though . 
  the problem is that it 's just one of the possible gestures and it means a specific thing , in the memes they use it for everything . 
  no , i do n't trust the parliament and the senate either , i will never trust them . 
  what is that money for if there 's no tuition fee ? 
  what 's the difference between the grant and the loan , are they given to everyone who goes to university ? 
  the redditor / u/fishfingerpies was talking about believed the same :  i dare you to go to woolwich , birmingham , bradford and dewsbury holding a bottle of wine and see how quickly your ignorant and protected bubble will burst . 
  you do n't have to drink the wine , just hold it when you go to those place . 
  i dare you . 
  america is n't fucked , at all . 
  individual americans who are poor might be though , hopefully not . 
  nasa budget for 2017 is more than 3 times that of esa : http://spacenews.com/senate-bill-gives-nasa-19-3-billion-for-2017/ http://www.esa.int/about_us/welcome_to_esa/funding it 's also made up of many countries , so i do n't think it 's a fair comparison . 
  yes , but i 'm very bias given that it 's a field i love and i 'd like to work in when i 'm done with my studies . 
  anyway , other than the obvious scientific and technological advancements , it 's a good return on [ investment  ( http://www.esa.int/our_activities/space_engineering_technology/a_solid_investment )  every $ 1 invested in space returns an average $ 6 to the wider economy . 
  maybe we should cut back on our 23.4 billion [ military budget ] ( http://sociale.corriere.it/234-miliardi-di-euro-la-spesa-militare-nel-2017-in-italia-piu-21-in-dieci-anni/ ) ( just for italy ) , and put some more money in the 5.75 billion budget [ for esa ] ( http://www.esa.int/about_us/welcome_to_esa/funding ) . 
  between mandela , sanders and thomas paine , `` libertarian left '' . 
  this political compass is fucking bullshit . 
  what do abstract art , astrology , etc. . have to do with political philosophy ? 
  and how come sanders , who 's basically a standard social democrat , is so close to chomsky who is an anarchist ? 
  and jill stein is to the right of sanders as well . 
  about cup , how can anarchists be in the same party as stalinists , trotskists etc ? 
  underrated?i had a very different experience since he was the author we spent the most time on . 
  i liked montale , he did n't buy into that `` poeta vate '' bullshit and his view on suffering was interesting , a shame he was the author we spent the least time on . 
  we have a very different taste i guess . 
  it is random in the sense that they had no idea about that person being the berlin terrorist , of course if he was behaving suspiciously it was n't random . 
  those were two simple policemen doing their everyday job , it was n't the special forces or something , there is no reason with the information we have to believe they had knowledge of his location , given that they figured out who he was later . 
  i do n't know the answer but let me say something : this guy could have easily committed another attack on italian soil yesterday . 
  did anybody have a clue he was here ? 
  he was stopped for a random id check , if he wanted to who knows what he could have done since he was also armed . 
  i do n't think that they consider changing president every year a bad thing , quite the opposite . 
  the one guy i met and several others online said it , even though they never lived in italy nor they knew the language . 
  if people ask to you about your ancestry of course it is n't a problem for europeans for you to say that you 're 35 % polish . 
  but if you are talking about _ who _ you are , your identity , and you say that you are half polish without even having lived there or without knowing the language that is going to seem weird to a lot of us . 
  blood is basically the least important thing that connects you to a population . 
  so basically all the future children of the people that migrate from the rest of the eu will have the citizenship or the possibility to acquire it without even having a limit in the amount of times it can be passed down ? 
  jeez , once is already one too many , that 's just silly in my opinion . 
  that 's weird to say the least , at least with the italian citizenship ( as far as i know ) if your father did n't get it you ca n't either , if people got it automatically half of the us would be `` italian '' lol, 
  i 've heard that from a ton of people , it 's even worse since if your father/mother has the italian citizenship you can get it yourself , so there are people that have never stepped foot in italy and have it and it somehow makes them fully italian now . 
  i agree with you , . researching your ancestry is interesting but you ca n't force it `` into '' your identity . 
  [ here ] ( https://www.google.it/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;rct=j&amp;url=https://m.youtube.com/watch%3fv%3d0uc63zdcdro&amp;ved=0ahukewihvbu58pnqahvoghqkhtamc-8q3ywigzaa&amp;usg=afqjcnepj28tqup4ohfhx_y0u8bpjs_2tw&amp;sig2=zxvll2qrj4rvwvbyj8vivw ) you go . 
  i dislike it , unless you actually want to talk about something , for example one time an old man on the train asked me about the book i was reading and i gladly talked to him about it . 
  if it 's small talk , no thanks . 
  we use profe as well in high school lol, 
  that 's my point though , i think that `` italian '' is wrong , but not because everybody was roman , the opposite . 
  do we view the british empire from some place other than britain ? 
  what are you on about ? 
  it started in rome and then they conquered other territories . 
  and yes rome was a city as well , do you think there were no cities at the time ? 
  of course you were part of the empire but you were also part of your city . 
  people at the time `` feeling '' as citizens of the empire is entirely irrelevant , the point is that it started in italy and they then conquered other territories . 
  and please stop saying that we should read an history book , it makes you look like an asshole . 
  could you elaborate on what you think about the work culture ? 
  to me catholicism is pretty close to being a cult , it is n't a cult just because there are way too many members so it 's not easy to control . 
  at the end of the day the difference between a cult like jahova 's witnesses and catholicism is the amount of absurdities they believe in and the fact that while cults are mostly irrelevant , the catholic church has some power . 
  do you actually say `` pietra '' ? 
  i 've always heard `` carta forbici sasso '' . 
  note how i emphasised the word `` freedom '' , you have to understand that most people want it but there are various different definitions of it , you ca n't just claim that everyone that does n't accept your definition is anti-freedom . 
  it 's pretty clear that you do n't understand this since you keep using `` freedom '' as a buzzword , pushing the `` i love freedom and you do n't '' narrative so that if feels like you * have * * to * be right . 
  do n't downvote him just because you disagree with him . 
  * dio * * can *, 
  there are 3 other regions like that : valle d'aosta , friuli venezia giulia and sardegna . 
  also s\u00fcdtirol is n't a region by itself , the region is trentino + s\u00fcdtirol ( trentino - alto adige ), 
  he is n't going to have a problem with most university students . 
  when i went to the uk it felt like another world to be honest , to get on the bus there was an actual * queue * , i mean like a proper queue where there was one person behind the other in a line . 
  here i see that only at the post office , usually when people try to get on buses they try to be as close to the door as possible and they try to get into the bus at the same time . 
  it 's a bit different with people that commute by train , they seem to be more civil . 
  it does n't really have a meaning and it 's used to emphasise a variety of different things . 
  i can try to explain it with examples for example when something bad happens : '' i got into an accident '' `` eh * pota * ... '' and that means something like : `` shit happens '' . 
  or if someone says something obvious : `` were you at school this morning ? '', 
  it 's monday '' . 
  when you 're taken by surprise : '' * pota ma ?!, 
  * '' when you disagree with someone : `` pota , per me ti sbagli . '', 
  --  `` in my opinion you 're wrong '' . 
  when you agree with someone : `` pota ma hai ragione ! '', 
  --  `` but you 're right ! '', 
  and many other things , you can also add other words to give it a different meaning like : * cazzo * , * figa * , * enculat * ( all swear words by the way ) . 
  for example if you 're late and you could n't do anything about it : `` sei in ritardo !, 
  which translates to '' you 're late '' , `` of course i 'm late , there was traffic '' . 
  and * pota cazzo * means something like : what did you expect me to do about it ? 
  if somebody let 's you down , he does n't listen to you or stuff like that you can say : `` pota ma alura enculet ! '', 
  which basically means : '' well then you can go fuck yourself '' . 
  `` enculet '' is `` vaffanculo '' in italian which is `` fuck you '' in english . 
  it seems like we use * pota * for everything , but we do n't . 
  in my city we have a word that does n't even exist in italian : `` pota '' . 
  we use it a lot but i ca n't really explain what it means ... 
  yeah but why does that matter ? 
  being a sect is not necessarily something bad ... 
  to be honest we have our fair share of nonsense over here as well . 
  in italy there are 250000 jahova 's witnesses and they believe all the creationist stuff too . 
  do you `` use '' them for self defense as well or are they only for recreational use ? 
  in the season finale of the walking dead they filmed the same scene twice ( one for tv and one for the blue ray i guess ) because there were too many swear words , but in that same scene they showed two people getting their head smashed with a bat ... that 's kind of weird .

  the centre-left party ( pd ) has the majority only in one of the two chambers , so it needs to form an alliance with another party to get enough votes to form a government . 
  now , they ca n't form an alliance with berlusconi 's coalition because the voter would revolt ( and i 'm sure you 'll understand why ) so the only party left is the beppe grillo 's one . 
  he 's a comedian and his party does n't really have an ideology nor a real program , his party was only formed as a protest against the politics in general . 
  he has a few proposals ( some impracticable ) but his intentions were n't to form or participate in a government , but to create an active opposition and discuss about the single law proposals . 
  so he declared that his party wo n't vote in favor of any government , so pd has no way to obtain the majority it needs . 
  til i have to move to austria, 
   yet , a recent article published in the italian daily newspaper la repubblica reported a growing demand among the public for original language films , citing the influence of increased online streaming , television channels with multilingual options and a greater knowledge of english among the younger generation . 
  the article mentioned is about a theater in rome which had the original version of django unchained . 
  i went there , the theater was full , me and my girlfriend bought one of the last tickets . 
  this is the example that things are changing here , younger people now know two or more languages and the english language is starting to catch on with older people too . 
  still , we are well behind the nordic countries , and it will take decades before dubbed version will disappear from theaters . 
  also , the italian dubbing industry is now only a shadow of its past . 
  the dubbing of * rocky * made stallone appear more talented that he actually is , for example . 
  now , we have nepotism and decline , and the cited movie * a king 's speech * is the example of a failed dubbing . 
  i saw the movie both in its original version and dubbed version and the difference is remarkable . 
  i know that not everyone understands english and that reading subtitles is annoying , but sometimes you miss part of the atmosphere of a film watching it dubbed . 
  * django unchained * was a clear example , with the different accents , the harsh words , the excellent acting . 
  hell , there were few lines in italian , too !, 
  careful , the carrot may contain horseradish . 
  ... but the socialists had the majority for the last 6 years , did n't they ? 
  for `` madrid '' you mean pp ? 
  do n't . 
  reason : berlusconi is still alive . 
  the italian pm does n't get elected , he is appointed by the head of state ( giorgio napolitano ) and confirmed by the parliament ( elected by the people ), 
  you forgot berlusconi, 
   some peculiar images have come to light , including two apotropaic phalluses -- probably dating from after the fire in 217 ad -- which were supposed to ward off bad luck . 
  yeah , that 's exactly the reason why i drew penises when i was a kid . 
  i do n't feel offended by the comment , but i want to rectify the opinions of the people with prejudices and stereotypes . 
  italy has many problems , some more important and some less important . 
  the key is that many italian problems are undervalued ( like the impact of the mafia and the berlusconi 's influence during the last 15 years ) , while many other problems are still overvalued just because they became stereotypes from a past era . 
   when a study does n't rhyme with reality , it 's prudent to go by what you do rather than what you say . 
  so , the study i linked in my comment does n't rhyme with reality ( the reality i live in ) , but the study you refer to does ? 
  your source is dated 15 june , but you say that :  this year , as of november , 105 women in italy have been killed by husbands or boyfriends . 
  well , you obviously have another source you are not linking . 
   domestic rape became a crime just 15 years ago . 
  you 're right , but you deliberately omit the fact that a woman could still denounce her husband as he committed an act of violence against her person . 
  it just was n't clear , and the 1996 law improved the legislation on the matter . 
  as i said in the previous comment , italy has a problem related to domestic violence , but i can assure you that this priest is not expressing a * common italian sentiment * . 
   gender stereotypes are deeply rooted - contributions by italian men to domestic chores is among the lowest in the world this is quickly changing as the new generations take over . 
  all of my friend of my same age ( 25-30 ) share the housekeeping duties with their partner . 
  my grandfather does n't even know how to cook a scrambled egg , but my father cooks for the family and cleans the house . 
   women on tv are rarely given the chance to speak . 
  in 2006 , only 2 percent of women on tv were linked to issues of social commitment and professionalism . 
  that 's just plain false . 
  only by watching the berlusconi 's channels you would see a much higher percentage , so imagine what the total percentage is . 
  the problem here is that you probably refer to an istat survey made in ** 2006 ** . 
  in the meantime , things have changed for the better . 
  the sole fact that you , here , are reading a news about a priest making those declarations is because of the outrage caused by him in italy . 
  i went to a catholic school for 15 years and i can say that the reality inside the church is much different from the outside . 
  they are stuck in the 50s , with the women ( nuns ) who are completely under the men 's ( priests ' ) power , following their commands . 
  there is the real problem , not in the whole italy . 
  wait , you are exaggerating . 
  this is absolutely not a common italian sentiment . 
  domestic violence sadly is a problem affecting the whole europe and especially italy , but it 's not a lot worse than other countries : [ link ] ( http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_memo-10-430_en.htm ) as you can see in [ this graph ] ( http://europa.eu/rapid/exploit/2010/09/memo/en/m10_430.eni/pictures/10000201000008fd000008fd6f47c2e6.png ) , the vast majority ( 86 % ) of italians say that domestic violence is unacceptable and should always be punishable by law . 
  the problem arise with the 5 % of the population saying that domestic violence is always acceptable or acceptable in certain circumstances . 
  moreover , the news related to the priest 's declarations was the top news on most newspapers . 
  even the vatican tried to silence him ( it 's too much even for their standards ) . 
  one litre of fuel in this case is 1 litre of hydrogen , so common mileage and fuel consumption does n't apply in this case . 
  with the same example , a nuclear powered car would have a huge mileage . 
  just imagine that a litre of uranium gives more than 1000 tj of energy through nuclear fission . 
  so saying that a hydrogen powered car has a high mileage is just stupid . 
  a carbon fiber and aluminium chassis means that the `` car '' will cost way more than the $ 10,000 predicted , when it will have to meet the minimum safety specifications . 
  this is not the first nor the last example of low-weight hydrogen powered car . 
  when asked about the best dish of the english cuisine , a londoner friend of mine answered `` curry chicken '' . 
  i do n't think that the default is a viable option . 
  it 's not just that it will hurt badly the italian economy , it 's more that they won ' let italy default , as it could lead to mass default of other countries like greece , portugal and ireland . 
  moreover , the italian debt is held mostly by italian investors . 
  i may be wrong , but i do n't think that london opposes the scottish independence like madrid fiercely does, 
  actually , berlusconi 's party never took more than 38 % of the votes . 
  nevertheless , it 's a shame that 40 % of the voters are so easily brainwashed . 
  moral of the story : do n't let a single entity or person own the majority of tv channels . 
  i drink cappuccino all the time at any time . 
  bring on the sottovoti . 
  at the beginning i did not see the coat of arms on your flag and i thought you were going to perform a * crimean * on gibraltar . 
  the winner of sanremo goes to eurovision . 
  which is like sending the winner of miss universe to a `` weirdest costume '' party . 
  couple that with the extremely low quality of il volo 's music . 
  if last year elio e le storie tese had won sanremo , they would have gone to eurovision . 
  that would have been funny . 
  you probably mean economically infeasible , as it is totally possible in scotland . 
   most of the illegal drugs market is made up of cocaine , heroin and meth . 
  where does it say that in your source ? 
  genuinely curious . 
  now i would like to know where did nauru send its prisoners ... 
  and , according to this map , both are about as emotional as japanese ... 
  both . 
  she has her own political ideas , too , which consist in populism and extreme-right clich\u00e9s ( xenophobia , homophobia , bigotry ) . 
  she is famous for this phrase : `` better fascist than fag '' ( * fag * as a translation for a derogatory term for `` gay '' ) . 
  she often said that she is proud of being fascist , too . 
  i wanted to be formal and precise . 
  this is reddit , where people complain when you are not precise and complain when you are too precise . 
  she 's a national politician , she 's from rome and current mp . 
  as you can imagine , she 's a moron and sadly there 's people who still vote for her ( i think it 's because of her last name ) . 
  right now , she is a member of berlusconi 's party . 
  it seems to me that the slow and smooth transition between the franco 's regime and the ~ ~ democracy ~ ~ parliamentary monarchy did n't help to create a taboo around his figure , like it has happened in germany and italy . 
  i mean , in italy , for example , at the end of wwii there was a lot of hate against fascists , leading to the ban of fascist ideas throughout the country ( and a clear ban integrated in the constitution ) , and i think that the sudden change in the government helped in creating a strong cultural taboo . 
  you can still see some swasticas around , though , and italian police is still filled with fascists ( see genova 2001 ) , so we can say that there are idiots everywhere . 
  well , i 'm italian and i would vote portugues cuisine for the same reason as yours . 
  man , i suddenly want to visit portugal once again ... 
  that could be a self-parody,

  the eu is for europeans . 
  it 's not just a name . 
  it 's a union of europeans . 
  we ca n't just add all of the fucking world in the eu . 
  that defeats the purpose of the eu-being a power that can be competitive . 
  continent . 
  russia : most of russia 's population is european . 
  russia 's culture is european . 
  russia has 2/3 components to try and join the eu . 
  turkey does n't have one . 
  why would non-europeans join the fucking european union ? 
  are you retarded ? 
  it 's a damn european union . 
  the un is for the whole world . 
  how can you not comprehend this simple concept ? 
  greenland is oversea territory of denmark and it 's population is insignificant . 
  definition is pretty strict . 
  the ural mountains , the caucas mountains , the mediterranean , the bosphorus , the atlantic , the northern sea . 
  you have to be part of europe to be part of the *** european *** union . 
  do you not see why this is necessary ? 
  yeah but you have to be at least partly in europe ** and ** have a mostly european ( living in europe ) population ** and ** have european culture . 
  you have to be fit in at least 3 of the conditions to even try to be in the eu . 
  both australia and turkey fail on two of them . 
  european culture is n't enough . 
  you have to have an almost entirely european population as well and turkey has neither . 
  no , i just think that cultures should be distinguished and not mixed too much in order to preserve their integrity . 
  right , which belong to european countries with european culture . 
  the geographical qualification is wrong and badly done . 
  if turkey is in i 'd like to see my country out please . 
  no , point is for european nations to unite in order to stand a chance in a global competition against everyone else . 
  against the usa , china . 
  europe as one , so we can stand our ground . 
  similar unions are taking place in africa and asia with the same purpose . 
  if we accept , say , china we are defeating the whole purpose of the eu and are going to be thrown around all the time . 
  right , except this is the eu . 
  you know , the * european * union . 
  by your logic we should accept japan in the eu-they qualify in every way . 
  at least they have european ( greek ) culture . 
  too bad they are n't in europe . 
  yeah , everyone is trying to bring some `` if '' or `` maybe '' . 
  democracy is a system where throughout a set period of time , people get to chose the people who rule them according to their ideas without engaging in any violent actions . 
  that is democracy . 
   do you think there 's a democratic system ( as in terms of voting ) preferable over others ? 
  yes . 
  you get to chose . 
  in italy 's case you get to chose who 's going to fuck you up . 
   do you think europe can be more democratic ? 
  according to the definition of democracy it already is democratic . 
   do you consider the eu a democracy ? 
  it is such by definition . 
  how dare you not have a home ? 
  well i was confused when i saw your downvotes too but youknow , it 's how the internet work . 
  i upvoted you if that 's of any consolation . 
  i think i can answer this one . 
  for the record i would never and have never voted for him . 
  so berlusconi is a very influential person . 
  his propaganda is in every house . 
  the owns mediaset who enlarge his influence on italians 100 times . 
  owning such a huge media network is huge . 
  he is super rich , and when you hear him talk he actually sounds like he wants to do something good for italy . 
  berlusconi also gathers every person that is a bit rightist . 
  because the other main choice is a leftist party who basically want to give citizenship to everyone born in italy and other stupid shit like that , people on the right go for him . 
  he has very nice offers . 
  he promises things such as the removal of certain taxes but he never does . 
  or if he does he just replaces them with other , equal taxes . 
  but people believe him . 
  due to berlusconi i start agreeing with some ancient geek phillisophers-people in charge of countries should not be given any private property . 
  i 'm not a fan of the idea but berlusconi makes me reflect . 
  if he was n't so rich , italy would n't be in seep shit right now . 
  yup . 
  you see , i 'm not saying he has to give a fuck about italy . 
  i do n't care if he does . 
  the guy is was a kid when fucking mussolini was in charge . 
  but leave italy alone for god 's sake . 
  you know , i just do n't get it . 
  i do n't get berlusconi . 
  i understand some people , evil people who did horrible things . 
  i understand mussolini and hitler . 
  they may have been evil but they had an ideology and were people who loved their countries . 
  they thought they were doing it for the good of their nations . 
  yes , he may have been a murderer but he wanted glory and a big empire , to be remembered for ever . 
  he believed in an ideology , he wanted to change the world for the better . 
  he was a vicious criminal , but he did it , in his eyes , in the name of the chinese people . 
  i understand the slave owners-yes , they were evil , but in their minds they though they were doing the right thing by exploring some people for the benefit of others . 
  these are all bad people . 
  but they stood up for something . 
  their twisted logic made them to believe they are good people . 
  because the way i see it everyone wants to be good , even if they turn out evil . 
  but berlusconi ? 
  i do n't understand him . 
  i just do n't . 
  why ? 
  how can he do this to his own nation ? 
  has he no shame ? 
  i can not describe him . 
  i do not see any kind of logic in him or his supporters . 
  i mean okay , the supporters-they may be stupid . 
  but him ? 
  he 's not stupid ... 
  i truly believe berlusconi is worse than hitler .

  apparently portuguese can easily understand and speak spanish while spaniards tend to not really understand them . 
  personally italians can understand spanish , not everything obviously , but if we speak slowly we can talk to each other . 
  i can understand some words in portuguese if i read them but not really if i hear them . 
  we just get along well , that 's it . 
  spanish girls love italian accent , italian girls love spanish accent , we both like to get drunk ( i guess ) , our languages are kind of similar so we can easily understand each other and we are both economically fucked up . 
  we are made for each other !, 
  love your username, 
  like at the eurovision song contest, 
  we have trash bins for each material ( paper , glass . . ) in every neighbourhood . 
  then a trash truck comes in the morning and empty them . 
  when we talk about italian colonies i think of eritrea , ethiopia and somalia and our influence was n't really strong . 
   how do you feel about your former colonies ? 
  what ? 
  reading the comments below scandinavia seems the place for you , i do n't know any pasty that has cinnamon here , but i might be wrong . 
  i think it 's more common in northen europe . 
  i mean , after a certain amount of time questions get repeated . 
  tbh i still find them entertaining but yeah they are almost all the same, 
  might be, 
  check the mirror maze on pet\u0159\u00edn hill !, 
  i just imagined a tourist wearing a t-shirt with the text `` i love sweden '' while walking in the bike path, 
  unfortunately , i have seen more italians littering than tourists ... 
  what about waffles ? 
  relevant username, 
  wait , do they really teach friulan at school ? 
  i did n't know that, 
  i think i risked to get run over by a car at least twice in the uk . 
  especially one time when i watched in both directions , and there was nothing , and a car from the right suddenly appeared near to me . 
  your variety of cakes is impressive !, 
  also , when i had baked potatoes i ate like five of them , peel included . 
  god , they were melting in my mouth . 
  the classic `` breakfast bar '' is composed by [ cappuccino and cornetto ] ( http://katyvsfood.altervista.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/dscn0636-2.jpg ) ( that is basically an italian croissant ) . 
  anyway , our breakfast is composed by sweets like biscuits , cornetti , bread with chocolate ( especially nutella ) or jam , yogurt and cereals , accompanied with coffee , milk or tea . 
  mainly coffee or milk though . 
  it 's very common !, 
  i do n't like them that much but many people love them . 
  anyway it 's a dangerous activity , unless you are an expert , each year there 's at least one person who get intoxicated by mushrooms . 
  we mostly gather [ porcini ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/boletus_edulis ) and [ cardoncelli ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/pleurotus_eryngii ) , ( i do n't know their english names ) , i guess, 
  i would be nice and maybe answer them for the first minutes . 
  if he keeps speaking italian i would talk to him in italian if i see he can take a conversation . 
  otherwise , i would probably stop him and start speaking english . 
  i heard americans pronouncing italian words many times and it 's always weird and funny , mainly because for non-italians it 's hard to pronounce words with double consonants that are pretty common . 
  on the other side , italian girls love spanish accent, 
  honestly , it 's not that big deal . 
  it probably influences our ability in speaking foreign languages but it 's not a problem . 
  i mean , i 'm used to it but i understand that for the other people it might be weird, 
  that 's interesting , i did n't know the majority of the countries do n't use dubbing apart from kids shows edit : and . . 
  i do n't get the downvote for saying something way far from being offensive . 
  i knew that shows are not dubbed in the uk and in ireland because , obviously , they speak english and the majority of the films are in english , and also in scandinavia . 
  i did n't know about the netherlands and about the balkans . 
  i think that 's one of the reasons why italians and spaniards get along well . 
  we can easily understand each other . 
  when i listen to a spanish song i can understand the half of the words i hear . 
  also the sounds are very similar . 
  yeah spanish and italian are very similar , if someone talked to me in spanish i would be able to understand at least what he 's trying to say , although i would not get all the words . 
  for an italian , french is not so complicated when you know how to read it , many words are similar , i can easily understand and translate a small text or a song written in it . 
  about portuguese , many people think is similar to spanish but i 'm not able to get it like i understand spanish . 
  if you made me read a text written in portuguese i would understand some words but it 's harder . 
  it 's the same here , there 's a big business behind dubbing, 
  we dub everything so i watch films and tv shows dubbed in italian . 
  i only use subs if it does n't exist the italian version , apart from youtube because although i understand english i prefer using them, 
  sweden has always seemed an indenpendent country to me but i do n't know, 
  it 's better to stay away from the balkans affairs, 
  i would prefer corsica to be honest , i 've always considered it like a second sardinia who just speaks french, 
  almost every region asked once to be independent, 
  oh you are right , it was late and i wrote it 2 times thank you , edited it, 
  disney characters had and still have a huge impact here . 
  mickey mouse is called `` topolino '' in italy and the comic with its name is one of the most popular comic series ever here . 
  the stories are written and designed by italians and i used to read them so much . 
  they also include donald duck and the other main disney characters . 
  who knows , maybe france will give corsica and nice back to us or slovenia will fight to reconquer trieste or croatia will give istria back to us . 
  yes , they still exist . 
  especially in sicily and campania , they are less powerful than before , thank god , but they still run a big numbers of illegal activites in italy especially concerning drugs , guns and prostitution , some examples : * the campanian mafia called camorra still threat people in certain zones . 
  people who own a shop in those areas have to pay an amount of money , called `` pizzo '' , a sort of payoff , and if they do n't do it will burn down or place a bomb in their shop to destroy it * they are also responsibles of a big numbers of corruption in the building industry . 
  here , when there 's the need to build something , from a school to a football ( soccer ) stadium , the organisers do a sort of competition to find a company that is going to do the work . 
  mafia usually bribe these people to make sure they win , and when they do , they get paid by them for doing the work but they do n't care about doing a good job so they use cheap materials to have a bigger profit . 
  * they also do many extravagant things . 
  although they have less power than before they are still respected by many communities . 
  during religious processions , that usually consist in carrying a statue of the virgin mary around the city where it 's taking place , in some small towns , when the statue passes near to the local `` boss '' house , they stop it and let it bow to it , to show some kind of respect to this person , like saying that even someone like the virgin mary is inferior to the boss ' authority . 
  * another examples of ridiculous stuff they do to show their wealth is this event that took place last year . 
  a mafia boss died and his family obviously decided to organise a funeral in his honor . 
  the family took things way too far and rented a carriage driven by black horses to carry the coffin , an helicopter that was throwing roses petals and big poster with the deceased person 's face with the text `` you are the king of rome '' , all of this with the godfather soundtrack as a background . 
  this thing caused a lot of controversies and the government told about the fact saying the they must do something to stop this kind of acts . 
  read more about it here : http://www.ansa.it/english/news/general_news/2015/08/20/godfather-style-funeral-for-mafia-boss_391c2c77-983e-4253-8350-0c93cfa64c9c.html they are still dangerous but not like before , the `` big '' bosses are all in prison or are becoming old and the families are losing the recognition they had before . 
  although in some areas , especially in southern italy , they run many activities and are still respected by the local communities . 
  edit : i 'm not an expert , i do n't live in these places so i might be wrong about some things . 
  also , mafia is not like before , do n't think about al capone or that stuff . 
  * alfredo sauce exists here * pepperoni pizza is a traditional italian dish * spaghetti and meatballs are a thing * we are all tanned, 
  yeah roman and neapolitan are perfect for swearing . 
  actually no but they use it for foreign names . 
  if the father is unknown they use the surname of the mother , or if he 's adopted , the surname of the adoptive father . 
  in italy children always receive the surname of their father . 
  i know some people who now live in italy but that are born in russia and ukraine . 
  their names were written in cyrillic but here they are written using latin aplhabet . 
  i actually do n't know if they allow people to do that but i 'm almost sure they just write `` ivanov '' and apply the italian law . 
  if you knew all the bad words and blasphemies that exist in both italian and dialect, 
  `` italy is a democratic republic , founded on work . '', 
  best joke ever, 
  agreed . 
  * italy * sardinia * europe, 
  `` the intouchables '' is one of my favourite films,

  also i doubt this trade deal will change anything with chinese people lifestyle . 
  edit : oh , btw you are implying that a better lifestyle means adopting democracy . 
  i personally do n't agree , besides , it has still to be proved . 
  japan 's right . 
  making more business with china implies less ability to speak against its crimes . 
  yeah , you just pictured the most likely scenario ever . 
  who has n't done that at least once in his/her life ? 
  if i sell it at any point i have to buy a new one at the same price per square meter , so i do n't have money to spend . 
  otherwise i can rent a new house , but my money will decrease . 
  except you ca n't spend it, 
  if you sell it you need to buy a new one, 
  yeah , i get it . 
  let me be more clear : it 's a useless and purely theorical wealth index . 
  so it 's a fake wealth idex . 
  if you have money because you own a house then you do n't have any money . 
  so we italians are richer than the germans ? 
  no way, 
  and weed, 
  both and none of those . 
  truth is somewhere between those extremes, 
  yes , but do n't you think citizens should have a bit of precedence agaist non citizens ? 
  i am actually shocked it wasn already so, 
  you choose to live in a country , you need to respect local laws . 
  do n't want to be submitted to barbarical laws and savage illiterate people ? 
  do n't go live in places like saudi arabia . 
  that 's because he was working for spainish crown , not because he was spanish citizen or born in spain . 
  study your history please . 
  if the prince is offended by our art he can stay in his medieval country, 
  he might be the biggest political mistake americans could make . 
  he 's the american berlusconi . 
  what kind of activities did you guys do in nothern italy ? 
  that 's my place and i know nothing of it, 
  we still need nato , especially considering vlady putain 's new imperialistic wave, 
  any european country is more or less a us vassal state . 
  but us are interested in a compact europe and army , because they have 1 point of contact instead of 20 something . 
  i 'm pretty sure the french will be sad af about vlady putain non coming, 
  to help people visualize who the foreigns are , i suggest they apply yellow stars on their sleeves . 
  it was about time, 
  this is totally fucking inacceptable . 
  and honestly i do n't see how the will do it , considering they wo n't have right to vote while they exit . 
  lol, 
  it 's a system that their politicians made , so it 's still citizens ' fault, 
  then berlusconi pops in : `` no , i will fuck you both ! '', 
  he 's really awful at diplomacy . 
  that 's sad, 
  domenica means `` day of the lord '' , with `` dominus '' meaning `` lord '' in latin, 
  generally speaking yes , but it has nothing to do with this, 
  what values ? 
  read again the article, 
  i kinda agree with the guy . 
  you do n't share our values , you leave . 
  that 's how you know for sure farage is an idiot, 
  but if the brits sell their arms to the saudi , how will they accomplish even the simpler tasks , live open doors or eating ? 
  i 'm european and i do n't think this sub is biased or too american oriented . 
  someone has to pay for this, 
  i believe if they doped handicapped people as well they would n't count in para too, 
  it was a joke about russia not being europe, 
  you mean 4, 
  not only that . 
  otherwise , even early hitler and mussolini were democratics . 
  yeah sure , of course !, 
  next week they 'll attack themselves again for some reason . 
  no hate but ... you need to be retarded to call that `` beautiful '', 
  yeah , the stupid one . 
  this is the stupidest thing i 've seen here on r/europe, 
  i did n't avoid anything , i just made my previous post clearer , but of course if a person just do n't want to understand a point that he will never understand it , no matter how clear is the explanation . 
  and i 'm saying that i do n't care if us electorate likes him or not , i think he 's worthless and i will countinue to think this way and i 'll say it every time i want to . 
  tacobenderz feels probably the same . 
  if you say that consensus is what ultimately counts in democracy you 're saying : `` any politicians is a good one as long as people vote for him '' . 
  so according to your point putin or orban are good politicians . 
  so we 're supposed to like him because he 's supported by a significant portion of his electorate ? 
  i do n't think so ... 
  it 's not surprising at all ... 
  british politicians stopped their campaign because of this . 
  i 'm impressed by their fairness . 
  but then again , i 'm italian so maybe i 'm just bad accustomed . 
  we 'll never know , my friend !, 
  you 're too weak and poor to occupy any big eu country . 
  also , russia have to discard all swamp cards, 
  who can tell why , uh ??? 
  `` it could become even smaller , if you know what i mean '', 
  in your ass , russians !, 
  well , if russia leaves the euro cup soon , france will avoid to pay milions of $ in damages . 
  come on . 
  that has never happened . 
  like , never ever . 
  turkey is geografically half europe , so that is half a mistake . 
  israel on / r/europe is 100 % mistake . 
  the fact that yours is not the first mistake does n't make it less of a mistake . 
  so we wo n't accept turkey in the eu . 
  that 's fine for me !, 
  this is / r/europe not r/somewherebetweenafricaandasia, 
  i kinda expected this video . 
  good . 
  it 's not acceptable they wo n't accept their own people back !, 
  what really scares me is that the turks still seems to like him, 
  do you think you can talk them into reason?don ' t waste your time . 
  lol turkey will never join eu . 
  but then again you ca n't expect meaningful ideas from christiantoday.com, 
  those were a joke .

  so , please again , tell me : in which way net neutrality regulations are bad ? 
  and i guess you are one of those claiming that with even less regulation , 2007 crisis would n't have happened , right ? 
  oh , and what about pollution effects ? 
  because you know , it 's not like air is n't public . 
  oh , or that trump instead thought the opposite . 
  ^ ^ / s  reading 120 laws for a glorified bake sale is a little much you 'll certainly agree . 
  people who want to open a bakery and make bread find this out the painful way . 
  yes , yes , yes . 
  every country has these stories . 
  i wonder how the grass can always be greener on the other side of . . * every * fence ? 
   this is where you get the `` stupid '' eurosceptics . 
  100 % european union has something to do with bakeries . 
  k.  when you keep hearing about such examples , you might start to think that there is some kind of connection . 
  for the moments , the only complaints i hear , is indeed plebs on tv that speak with no actual clue of what they are talking about . 
   that says more about you than anybody else is my point . 
  the warning was too late . 
  if you repeat a lie often enough , it becomes the truth . 
  right ? 
   weapons are goods . 
  analogy stands . 
  weapons in you analogy stands for * problems * . 
  same for shitty ideas . 
   remember mercantilist france before the revolution ? 
  nope , and i 'd like to remember you world has changed in the last couple of centuries and half . 
   also , are you implying people who do not agree with you are stupid per definition ? 
  nope . 
  the determinant is what , not who . 
   single market ! = free market . 
  you said above not even the us are free [ and libertarian i guess ? ], 
  enough by your standards . 
  so , i wonder if you are n't just complaining world is n't what jhon locke was dreaming . 
   also , protectionism towards non europeans is a thing . 
  see , not so clever anymore . 
  oh right , eu is famous for being some medieval commune . 
  i guess even all those attempts to lower duties with ukraine , or russia , or us or whatever was just red herring . 
  definitively nothing that had to do with the past , more than with actual people desire . 
  and please , could you explain in which way uk would become less `` protectionist '' by raising other walls ? 
   as an exercise , find , in your opinions , better arguments for what `` they '' want . 
  i find 100 % of people that want uk out do n't even know that meps are democratically elected and all . 
  i find 100 % of people that want uk out do n't even know that `` council of ministers '' is n't some sectarian reunion in the basements of bruxelles with freemasons and satan , but the very ministers that all the eu citizens have appointed by themselves for their countries . 
  i also find 100 % of people praising trump claiming he 's `` different '' just because he 's , you know , `` new '' . 
  failing to remember * who * have been toxic members of the government and which not . 
  forgetting * who * has always put those people in power in the first place . 
  failing to recognize what have been actual negligence or malice and what instead a genuine sharable mistake . 
  we might even discuss all day whether clinton is in the hands of big corporations that pay her campaign . 
  and this is fine after all : the end justifies the means and it 's marketing , not ideas , what in the end makes you win . 
  trump ** is ** the corporations on the other hand . 
  and the only things that seem to conceal this evident fact , are . . his promises . 
  you can even have just two turkeys , and he will promise * three * apiece . 
  and people buys it !, 
  because there 's no such thing as `` wrong '' . 
  everything is an opinion !, 
  economy ? 
  finance ? 
  climate ? 
  physics ? 
  fuck em , unless it 's history anything can still be . 
  and i find this behaviour quite childish . 
  be it `` make america great '' again ( has america ever lost that status ? ), 
  or be it `` foreigners fucks [ us ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4ocej2/britain_first_just_used_a_picture_of_czech_wwii/ ) '' . 
   free movement of weapons and shitty ideas . 
  mhh interesting . 
  so the eu would be free movement of weapons ? 
  really clever similarity . 
   same goes for the rest of it . 
  oh right . 
  anybody said . . single market ? 
   not true either . 
  trump appeals to the white lower class in america which is more conservative . 
  brexit voters are coming from both left and right . 
  see it as an intelligence divide , rather than class . 
  simpler , is n't it ? 
   it was however an association of states with similar regulation and foreign policy , even a common market mhh [ no ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/communist_international ) ? 
  it was an association of parties , and none of them was legally connected to the other . 
  unless you are talking of the `` soviet union dictatorship '' stage , where i totally do n't even see this . 
   why you are throwing two distinct protest movements together which advocate for quite the opposite ? 
  because they appeal the same animal instinct to find scapegoats . 
  this . 
  also , let 's not forget for obscure reasons , australian government can fine and imprison everybody that `` talks '' about it . 
  because people complain when money goes out of the country ? 
  indeed they did with turkey agreement . 
  it 's not like they are n't complaining of the opposite too then . 
  because they send said boats in papua , which accept them under a huge payment . 
  there 's no magic involved . 
  all developed countries already exploited the shit out their mountains . 
  if it made economical sense , it has already been built . 
   sure this is not the end of reaching a fully renewable energy supply but one big milestone on the way . 
  i 'd swear norway does this on a monthly ( if not weekly ) basis . 
  though it 's not eu . 
  and i honestly do n't see why that should change anything . 
  it 's not like on the other hand land is something that does n't require constant care with fertilizers , herbicides and all . 
  you see , the problem basically arises from putting expectations of an objective before its premises in the first place . 
  the result is wishful thinking . 
  but let 's discuss with order . 
  first , when doing ** apples to apples ** comparisons a couple of iea projections are totally [ ok-ish ] ( https://www.iea.org/publications/freepublications/publication/technologyroadmapsolarphotovoltaicenergy_2014edition.pdf#25 ) ( ca n't speak for others since numbers do n't [ compute ] ( https://www.worldenergy.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/wec_j1143_costoftechnologies_021013_web_final.pdf#page=12 ) with [ source ] ( http://www.seia.org/research-resources/bnef-new-energy-outlook-2015 ) ) second , we have `` mixed data '' issues . 
  somewhere they talk of ghg-free , somewhere else they write of `` fossil-free '' , in other news they say `` renewable '' , here and there they refers to `` solar and wind '' , full stop . 
  it 's no big magic to speak towards a nuclear for baseload , hydro for storage and wind-solar for remainder grid , a bit more instead if we start to pretend exceeding 2 \u00b0 c scenario damages costs with grid costs is also going to square the circle . 
  third ( not very important but still ) i saw they are using quite outdated ( or biased , in their tone ) sources , like when [ referring ] ( http://www.forbes.com/sites/christopherhelman/2015/05/01/why-teslas-powerwall-is-just-another-toy-for-rich-green-people/ ) to [ batteries ] ( http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-05-06/tesla-s-new-battery-doesn-t-work-that-well-with-solar ) . 
  last but *** most *** they are full of shit and do n't even check/mention their sources . 
  they bring up 3 cents / kwh in dubai , falling to notice that 's [ not ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/solar_power_in_the_united_arab_emirates#dubai ) unsubsidized ( and no acknowledgment for `` their special climate '' either ) .

you really mixing things here . 
  i have no doubt that russians are trying to extend their influence everywhere . 
  however , people tend to greatly overestimate their ability to do so . 
   if someone says that soviet occupation is a myth and we have an apartheid regime the one doing so ca n't be a russian puppet . 
  just an idiot or someone appealing to specific and small demographic groups . 
  i doubt that russians are that dumb . 
  their propaganda is usually much more subtle , unless they fall into a panic mode like with mh17 . 
  when you can everyone you do n't agree with a russian puppet , it only works in favor of russians . 
  this what irks me , if you listen to all of this nonsense in mass media for the last couple of years you 'd get impression that literally everything is infiltrated by russians and this is simply not possible . 
  this white noise only helps the actual russian operations to go unnoticed . 
  if this article is not propaganda on itself then i do n't know what is . 
  considering that mccarthyism made its glorious return in the recent years , seeing politicians smearing their political opponents by calling them ~ ~ red ~ ~ russian puppets , is n't something new . 
  erm ... were they ever our allies for real ? 
  well . 
  maybe because it 's your own little squabbles and it 's up to you to fix it ?!, 
  if you do n't have enough popular support within the country and have to rely on outside `` help '' , then you 're not a legitimate politician in the said country . 
  the only thing `` the west '' should be concerned about is preventing russia from meddling in our affairs , that 's it . 
  and we 're already doing that successfully by pressuring their economy and draining their human resources as many highly educated and able russians are leaving the place . 
  russia is already screwed in the long run as it wo n't have enough money to sustain anything but its very basic needs and no hope of growth because human potential will be lost by the time their masses realized what 's going on . 
   russia ` actively involved ' in french election meddling , senate intelligence committee chairman says statement like that make the us involved in french election meddling as well . 
  shhh ... do n't break the narrative !, 
  russians are clearly training child soldiers !, 
   no one wants to give her money on principle seriously ? 
  principle ? 
  totally no political pressure involved , right ? 
  yes . 
  definitely . 
  rather they have a well justified beef with nato . 
   ca n't just move out and find a better place unless you 're able to pay twice as much . 
  well . 
  is n't it the point of capitalism ? 
  you 're getting exactly what you 're paying for . 
  i see you never rented a municipal apartment . 
  it 's cheap but often subpar and poorly maintained . 
   landlords ca n't just say no based on ethnicity why not ? 
  what 's stopping them from doing so ? 
  why not ? 
  which law prohibits him from doing so ? 
  meaning ... you notice curry getting in and out of the apartment or while taking a dump on the porch ? 
  we 're not talking about any contract term but about this one specifically . 
  how are you going to enforce it ? 
  how ? 
  how are you going to enforce it ? 
  also , it 's not only curry . 
  it 's everything . 
  these people do n't even notice or think about it because they lived like this their entire lives . 
   we should just ban all brown people his property , he can do with it as he please . 
   just restricting it in the lease unenforceable . 
   let 's fight with the way he said it . 
  why ? 
  he did n't call for action with his statement . 
  he 's not trying to incite violence or anything . 
  he 's not accusing them of any crime . 
  it 's his right to say whatever about whomever . 
  freedom of speech is as important as freedom to manage your business and property the way you see fit . 
  i guess none in this thread lived in a dorm with indian or pakistani students . 
  that was awful . 
  everything stank . 
  i had to rent an apartment instead and it took quite a bit of money to get my things rid of this horrendous smell . 
  this has nothing to do with racism , it 's the reality of things . 
  edit : i 'm frankly fascinated how easily people disregard others private property rights in this thread . 
  that 's going to be normal . 
  many landlords refuse to rent their property to students . 
  trivialization of violence , how nice . 
  because it 's an inconvenient page in recent history of our continent , totally peaceful since ww2 . 
  what a surprise / s, 
  if you look at the history of any of the ukrainians posting in r/europe you might notice that these are basically propaganda outlets , posting same articles and comments again , again and again . 
  exceptions are very rare . 
  most of the russians we see here , i suspect are `` russians '' from r/the _ donald . 
  it 's a popular flair there . 
  appeasement politics must go on . 
  it 's not like it ever backfired / s, 
  a song contest organizers can easily enforce rules while the so called `` international law '' is unenforceable imaginary guideline easily broken by anyone with at least a little bit of ability to project power . 
  even french managed to break all possible rules in libya when they started enforcing a no-fly zone by bombing the shit out of the country and sending spec ops units in . 
  any consequences ? 
  none whatsoever !, 
  maybe should restrain from using quotes from fiction bearing no relevance in the real world . 
  also , i 'm not sure you realize what `` rebellion '' entails . 
  do you want scores of turkish refugees running from the bloodbath that would certainly erupt in turkey in case of an all out rebellion ? 
  imagine syrian situation on steroids . 
  and you can be sure these refugees will blame us for all of their issues . 
  russians are illiterate in terms of the ability to use english . 
  you , just like many , confuse the opposite view on the events with `` russian trolls '' . 
  using your logic you 're a ukrainian troll simply because of your stance on the issue . 
  there should be a rule of some sort limiting the ability of countries that participate in any ongoing conflicts to enter the contest . 
  it 's getting annoying that the same country turns eurovision into a political shitstorm for a second year in the row . 
   it was predictable . 
  now i need to take some popcorn for tonight sheet show from russians . 
  and yet , so far the thread is filled with ukrainians , not russians . 
   the leader of the free world define `` the free world '' . 
  yeah . 
  just like with those soviet propaganda posters . 
   why do evil people always win ? 
  do they ? 
   why ca n't every evil person just die simultaneously ? 
  oh the irony ... 
  i see we 're starting a new cycle of anti-turkish political propaganda . 
  guess everyone is tired of the russians-did-it narrative , need something fresh . 
  and when confronted you can always hear the same reply `` i did n't vote for it '' and yet that 's how direct democracy works - tyranny of the majority , silly that people fail to understand it . 
  because the only thing that triggered your sudden need to return to your roots is brexit .

  guys , guys slow down a little bit . 
  ** this is all speculation ** and renzi still has n't unveiled his plan-b if europe completely turns its back to italy . 
  rumor has it ** italy might even pull back the sanctions against russia and putin ** . 
  this would be a huge blow to europe especially at this particular time . 
  eastern europe says mediterranean immigration is not their problem ? 
  then putin is n't italy 's problem . 
  i do n't know if all these rumors are just rumors or are being leaked by the government itself . 
  all i know is it 's gon na be `` fun '' to watch . 
   speech on democracy and freedom of religion halted oh the irony !, 
  btw as i understand it the social democrats and the greens were elected by the swedes . 
  thus the swedes agree with how things are going . 
  i would n't ever support such policies but who am i to judge the swedes on their democratic choices ? 
  if this is the way they want it then let them have it . 
  everya organizationa goesa througha rougha patchesa buta thea eua willa seea througha . 
  i thought i could lend a hand so here 's a translation into italian . 
  no need to thank me . 
  oh thanks for the automatically * \u00fcbersetzed * article . 
   some of them come from ` safe ' countries , all of them have already finished the asylum process in italy . 
  really ? 
  they finished the asylum process in italy ???? 
  that 's an accomplishment for us . 
  you know , on average it takes 2 years for authorities to determine whether an asylum seeker is effectively a refugee or just an illegal immigrant and then do nothing about it in either case . 
  proud moment for my country right now . 
   it is pretty much nonsense to construe a right to stay in hamburg out of the western engagement in libya ( which germany didnt even take part in ) . 
  i could n't make any sense of what that guy was saying ( sorry , not good with accents and sound quality is bad ! ), 
  so i trust you with the information about the rights he claims to have . 
  anyway these people are n't even libyan , they come from countries below the sahara so i do n't know why western engagement in overthrowing gaddaffi would have anything with their right to live anywhere in europe , granted they 're not refugees from nigeria or something . 
  i 'm not your bro , dawg . 
  i see you become less talkative when presented with proof . 
  that 's good . 
  but you still seem to be unable to follow up on finer reasoning such as political far-sightedness and international relations which have nothing to do with morality but everything to do with france being politically blind and recklessly causing awful consequences for everyone . 
  i agree with you 100 % . 
  i 'm really fond of languages and dutch is a particularly * gezellige * one . 
  i would hate to see languages disappear . 
  however languages influence each other all the time and often receive buttload of words and expression in situations of bilingualism ( think middle english and old norman french ) but then only a small part of it eventually sticks . 
  language contact is a language 's evolutionary process just as natural as time passing by . 
  and i take it for granted that you 're not resentful for speaking modern dutch instead of old dutch . 
  so dope , bruh !, 
  * swag *, 
  lol in sweden you find more people against immigration among immigrants than among native swedes  anyway the attitude towards immigration is n't an on-off switch where you 're either in favour or against no matter what . 
  it 's more of a spectrum and even among the lefties , especially the older ones , you 'll find those who wo n't go beyond a certain limit . 
  obviously this reasoning does n't include the extreme left . 
  likewise the centre-right often has a generally positive attitude towards immigration such as in italy . 
  more immigrants = more people noticing and having an opinion about it . 
  that 's all , and it concerns europe not only as a subreddit but also as a continent . 
  maybe you have n't realised this because you live in croatia and ( i suppose ? ), 
  you have n't been hit by the migrants and refugees wave . 
  this is just an assumption based solely on your flair though . 
   yeah sure , totally rewrite the chronology of events that are only 4 years old , nobody will call you out for that . 
  if only the internet had a way to save the chronology of the events through the news articles that were written at that time ... [ here ] ( http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/hillarys-war-how-conviction-replaced-skepticism-in-libya-intervention/2011/10/28/giqahgs7wm_story.html ) how hilary clinton talks about berlusconi being mad about france 's decision to unilaterally attack libya . 
  he even threatened to not lend italian basis for the no-fly zone and accused sarkozy of overriding un maybe it was n't important news in your country but this is common knowledge in italy because we saw the situation unfold before our eyes . 
  this is a 2011 article about how berlusconi was at the theater celebrating 150 years since italy 's unification . 
  sorry it 's in italian and could n't find any english source but it says how italy 's major representatives were reached by the news that france would 've attacked libya the next day no matter what . 
   not what happened . 
  france and the uk did n't take libya 's oil . 
  it was only air strikes . 
  no presence on the ground , read the article . 
  that 's exactly what happened . 
  maybe you should read a bit more than a wikipedia article before you 're so sure about something and french total got a big advantage in the aftermath of the revolution and later lost it . 
  the fact that france did n't ultimately succeed in its goal makes sarkozy look even more stupid because he caused this mess for nothing . 
   link your sources . 
  moreover , the libyan situation is not worse than before the operation at all . 
  here 's for you a source from der spiegel from february 2011 where [ some italian representatives predict the future ] ( http://www.spiegel.de/international/europe/libyan-crisis-italy-warns-of-a-new-wave-of-immigrants-to-europe-a-747459.html ) . 
  this is just one excerpt from it : `` italian ministers now warn that if his libyan government collapses , people will flow across the mediterranean : a ` biblical exodus ' '' moreover europe 's initial involvement was a no-fly zone and italy repeatedly warned the allies not to abruptly overthrow gaddafi during the following days . 
   the libyan situation is not worse than before the operation at all . 
  wow this is the final token that shows you do n't have the slightest idea of what you 're talking about . 
  - libya today does n't exist anymore as a state , - it is nobody 's land where there 's one internationally recognized government that barely controls its patch of land , - another newborn government in another city that aims to eradicate the first one , - about 130 tribes that claim their own rights to power and land - islamic fundamentalism has never thrived more in libya - isis affiliates control and profit on the migrants ships to italy and europe . 
  but yeah situation is not worse < this is sarcasm by the way . 
   yeah sure , they warned and then immediatly bombed the country . 
  they 're really committed to their opinions !, 
   france warned about iraq and did france bombed iraq ? 
  no they stayed out of it . 
  because if you know a retarded guy that you can not stop , you at least join in to try and influence the course of the events , maybe limit the damage rather than turn your head the other way . 
  italy had economic interests in libya and france saw a chance to get a slice of the cake through `` unorthodox means '' . 
  italy wanted to defend its interest and , as the source i linked to you proves , knew beforehand that the aftermath of the bullshit arab spring/gaddafi overthrowing would have been nothing but chaos and migrants ships from everywhere and italy would have been the first ( but not the last ) one to pay the consequences . 
   total got kicked out of the country yeah now , you 're right but total was the first major international oil company to ramp up production in the aftermath of the uprising . 
  the fact that france did n't ultimately succeed in its plan does n't mean they did n't try , actually it makes sarkozy look even worse . 
  france decided overnight to attack libya and as the airplanes already took off italy had to decide whether to join along and thus have a chance to defend its interest in libya or watch from afar and let france and england split the loot among themselves ... italy warned against eliminating gaddafi because chaos would 've ensued soon after but no one listened and fast forward ... guess who was right ? 
   italy is a grown up country able to makes its own decision . 
  so is france and just like any other grown up it should 've owned up to its own mistakes . 
  i thought we all had learnt that the approach of `` remove dictator , install democracy and leave asap '' did n't work , but no . 
  so it 's just a coincidence that france used their military prowess only on libya 's dictator and now has good deals for that sweet , sweet libyan oil ... 
  but i 'm sure france is going to liberate many other countries without oil anytime now . 
  it 's neither * viewed * or * perceived * at all . 
   the two are inextricably linked , and the fact that they are inextricably linked is precisely the reason why we ca n't just send back every boat that comes over the sea . 
  what about those who do not apply for asylum at all ? 
  or what about those who go through the process but are then denied the status ? 
  the emergency at sea is one thing , but once they 've been long rescued , they 've been on our soil for 1-2 years and they 're not refugees that 's illegal immigration with no ambiguity whatsoever . 
  frankly if italy only had to deal with boats full of deserving asylum seekers we would n't be facing such a crisis . 
  only about 20 ' 000 people got asylum in italy . 
  we could take care of them pretty easily on our own , but then politics and the electorate have all the right to discuss and then decide how strict they want to be when it comes to illegal immigrants ( months , years after they 've been rescued at sea ) . 
  expulsion is a valid option cause no international regulation prevents that . 
  and also they should decide on how severely expulsion should be enforced , if that 's the case because their 's many shades of strictness on that regard . 
  that 's why / u/maestroni 's referendum proposal has nothing to do with refugees by itself . 
   in order for you to be an illegal migrant you 'd have to be in the country illegally , it 's not illegal to seek asylum those who apply for asylum are not many among immigrants , and even less are those who are granted such a status . 
   why would you need to have a referendum on something that 's already illegal , unless you wanted it to be legal ? 
  it 's not only about declaring it illegal but the policy a country adopts on how to treat illegal immigration : what are the measures that ought to be enforced once said immigrant is proven to be illegal ( that is he 's not applied or he 's been denied asylum ) ? 
  do we want a strict regulation or one that is looser ? 
  the answer varies from country to country and it 's up the people/representatives to come up with what they feel more comfortable with . 
  a referendum is one of the democratic tools that could clear the air on the issue .

  no way , what we need is a healthy fiscal competition among eu countries , otherwise people may not realize that their politicians ' retarded fiscal polices have adverse consequences . 
  good point . 
  also , he intentionally wants to cause a wave of criticism from his opponents , especially from abroad .

  no if you believe that he 's innocent and that he 's been framed by leftist judges . 
  berlusconi 's supporters think that the judges ' attempts to remove him from power are politically motivated .

  the calibre combined with the length of the barrel makes for an extremely accurate rifle , with a very tolerable recoil .

  the [ marcia reale ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvft615a14a ) ? 
  it seems perfectly normal to me . 
  in the middle age there were violent feuds among noble families in almost all italian cities ( see orsini and colonna in rome , for example ) . 
  living in a fortified tower was necessary if you did n't want to be slaughtered by your enemies . 
  to be honest , there 's not much information about georgia in our news . 
  i remember [ eduard shevardnadze ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/eduard_shevardnadze ) , and the russian invasion of 2008 . 
  there 's no generalized opinion/stereotype about georgians where i live . 
  * how often are you on reddit in an average week ? 
  every day * how often do you visit / r/europe [ 2 ] ? 
  every day * what country are you normally resident in ? 
  italy * do you speak any languages besides english ? 
  ( if yes : which and to what level ? ), 
  italian ( first language ) , german ( beginner ) and slovenian ( beginner ) . 
  * what interests you about europe ? 
  politics , business , economics , news * what are your favourite and least favourite things about / r/europe [ 3 ] ? 
  favorite thing is the interaction with other europeans : i 've learned a lot about my continent in the years i 've passed on this sub . 
  least favorite is the childish behavior of those who ca n't stand that sometimes people have opinions that differ from their own . 
  * do you have experience as a moderator or similar ? 
  just of a couple of very small subs , nothing comparable in size and complexity to / r/europe * why do you want to be a moderator ? 
  i like this community and i think i can contribute a little . 
  * why do you think you would be a good moderator ? 
  i 'm a poised middle-aged man who does n't like conflict . 
  i 've been on reddit for 8 years and i do n't think i 've never had heated discussions with anyone . 
  * do you have any expirence with statistics , datamining or reddit bots ? 
  no , unfortunately . 
  i can make automoderator perform some basic tasks , however . 
  * what is your opinion on the immigration megathread ? 
  what do you think went wrong ( if anything ) ? 
  i think the mods gave the impression they wanted to censor anything remotely related to immigration , thus fueling the extremists . 
  immigration is a hot topic in europe right now , people are going to post and discuss about it , and it ca n't be confined to a megathread . 
  * what 's one weakness you have ? 
  i like the us very much  besides that , there are some periods of the year when i do n't have much time . 
  * would you rather fight one horse sized duck or one hundred duck sized horses ? 
  one hundred duck sized horses , ducks can be nasty . 
  * what single word connects all of these three of the following words : europe , pussy cat , teacher ?

  it 's unbelievable how much like a caricature you sound :  if a cop smells marijuana , there is a reasonable reason to believe some has been smoked recently . 
  if a cop says you `` look high '' there is wayyyy more leeway and potential for abuse . 
  yes , of course . 
  if an abusive cop lies by saying you look high , you ca n't possibly nail him because there 's basically no way to prove you did n't look high . 
  on the other hand , if a cop says he smelled marijuana , you can totally nail him because we have time-travelling smell sensors that can show he could n't possibly have smelled weed . 
  wait , we actually do n't , a cop that wants to fuck you over can full well claim he smelled weed and toss your car with literally zero repercussions , even in the land of the free . 
   you 're a fucking racist i swear i had never met a real person ( i mean , beside a 4chan troll ) who actuall busts out `` you are a racist '' completely out of the blue . 
  what did i say that is racist , that snoop dogg is likely to be high after a concert ? 
   it does n't matter if he was high . 
  he was n't driving . 
  oh sorry , i keep forgetting that us law applies to the entire world . 
  no , it does matter if he was high , because drug use is actually illegal in sweden , even if you do n't drive . 
  they have a zero tolerance policy . 
  unsurprisingly , they enforce their own laws in their own countries , even on american celebrities . 
   a cop thinking you look high leading to you being pulled out of the car , searched , arrested , and drug tested sounds like something out of nazi germany . 
  `` papers please '' ahahahahahaahah fuck you . 
  your country literally incarcerates the largest number of people of all countries in the world , you wiretap everyone including your own people , you have a massive racism problem and a police force that ca n't go a month without killing an unarmed black man . 
  but sweden ( who has one of the lowest incarceration rates of any developed country and is a model of progressiveness ) is literally nazi germany because they pulled over snoop-fucking-dogg for being high , gave him a drug test and let him go . 
   as an american [ ... ] around here you need a whole lot more proof than a cop 's opinion on your appearance before you can be arrested/searched/charged . 
  you are right , in the superior american system the cop needs to say he smells marijuana . 
  based us of a has clearly superior protections . 
   furthermore , the general dismissal of any sort of racial profiling by swedish cops in this thread is kind of ridiculous ... 
  yes , because the entire world is america and the kind of race relations that you have over there clearly apply 1:1 in any given european country . 
  no , what is ridiculous is the insinuation that since it ca n't be completely excluded that some cops somewhere in sweden are racists , then this stop is suspicious . 
  it is n't . 
  they stopped him because they said he looked high . 
  i repeat , they * alleged * that snoop dogg looked * high * . 
  snoop dogg . 
  high . 
  what 's the relative probability that snoop dogg was actually high compared to the probability that these swedish cops stopped him only because he 's black ? 
   but all it takes is one cop with a chip on his shoulder to ruin someone 's life with a drug conviction except he was treated with respect , was free to tweet and instagram his way to the police station , had to give a urine sample and was thereafter let go . 
  no cuffs , no cops tossing his car , no over-the-top ridiculous shit like we see all the time in the great usa . 
   grenade yes , they are indeed using grenades . 
  now :  to me it sounds more like syria or some other conflict zone . 
  are grenades in syria being used at a rate of about 2 per month ? 
  are they being used to attack the exterior of buildings in what appear to be intimidation attempts against rival gangs ? 
  then no , to me it does n't sound more like syria or some other conflict zone , sorry . 
  to me it sounds like organized crime groups are having a gang war using what weapons they can easily procure , in this most likely a crate or two of ready-made small explosives from some wartime stock that they managed to acquire , with modes and intensities that look nothing like a major armed conflict . 
  the italian mafia uses khalashnikov rifles , if it interests you . 
  same weapons that are being fired all over syria . 
  does italy look like a conflict zone ? 
  neither does malmo . 
   if you hear that there 's been 18 grenade attacks do you think that sounds normal for a city in the western world ? 
  because the western world does n't have high-criminality areas ? 
  have you heard of detroit ? 
  baltimore ? 
  organized crime in my country kills many more people than this gang war in malmo and it 's all homegrown . 
  criminality is a criminality problem , not an immigration problem . 
  violent crime especially has only been going down while immigrant population has only been going up , a clear sign that the two are disconnected if there ever was one .

  i even have a cast in mind : - [ bruce willis ] ( http://i.imgur.com/nuum0wv.jpg ) as yanis varoufakis . 
  he has the bald head and asshole smile to rock the role . 
  - [ oliver platt ] ( http://i.imgur.com/nijk4i9.jpg ) as alexis tsipras ; he has the fat face to make him in a mumbling , foolish prime minister that strong-jawed yanis must save from himself . 
  - [ cate blanchett ] ( http://i.imgur.com/jxcbr9l.jpg ) as danae stratou : beautiful , artistic , intelligent , the real center of kind-hearted yanis ' life . 
  - [ bruno ganz ] ( http://tiviseries.mobi/wp-content/uploads/bruno-ganz-photos-1.jpg ) as wolfgang schauble . 
  not only is he a good actor with the right kind of face , he also famously already played hitler . 
   sch\u00e4uble vetoed the edit . 
  varoufakis said , `` i veto that veto . '' aaaaand now i want a sch\u00e4uble-varoufakis sitcom in the style of vicious . 
  no , it is n't lol . 
  literally none says `` i do n't like the french , their farmers are dicks to foreign producers '' . 
  it 's usually because some parisians have been dicks to them or old stereotypes from wartime propaganda . 
  to be fair , practically every country in europe believes that they are the ones doing it the right way and also the ones that do n't get nearly as much help from europe as they 'd deserve . 
   but you do n't have a lot of sheep near paris . 
  it 's also kinda hard to find melons in strasbourg . 
  so they are protesting against competition from products they do n't or ca n't produce ? 
   8 years is plenty for a person or even a political party to change . 
  of course !, 
  has he mentioned changing his mind since ? 
  after all , 8 years is plenty for a person to let it be known that the horribly homophobic piece that they wrote no longer represents his ideas , and that he no longer considers 6 % of the citizens of the country a horrible perversion . 
   what about the stuff you linked is homophobic exacly ? 
  the part where the party secretary is the author of a pamphlet denouncing homosexuality as an abominable perversion . 
  also the part where the sd are for legal discrimination of same-sex couples in family law . 
  also the part where they believe in the conspiracy of the fearsome homosex lobby . 
   and another standing up for fucking theocracy  but the moment you start defending the idea that religiously motivated bigotry is quite alright yes , that is happening . 
  that 's totally , totally happening . 
  the banners at the leftist pride march will read `` we love sharia law ! '', 
  and `` behead the gays !, 
  '' , that is a realistic concern that absolutely justifies supporting the sd in their activities . 
  no , i 'm willing to bet that the leftist gay pride march is not going to be `` standing up for fucking theocracy '' or defending the idea that that religiously motivate bigotry is quite alright . 
  i think they are going to be standing up for fucking minorities and defending the idea that religiously motivated bigotry needs to be fought against . 
   are you implying that the left owns gay rights activities ? 
  yes , that 's why they are suing for copyright infringement . 
  no , wait , that 's not happening . 
  instead , they are staging a counter-demonstration because they think that 's a shitty appropriation of symbol for ends that have nothing to do with the cause that the symbol stands for , * from the cause * that it stands for . 
  not from them , the loony lefties . 
  so the sweden democrats , [ a massively homophobic far-right party ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sweden_democrats#family ) , are for the first time flying the rainbow flag and it 's only as part of an anti-muslim media stunt . 
  but leftist organizations are crazy and hypocritical for protesting that , right ? 
  they should totally let homophobic racists appropriate gay rights activities for their shitty goals , eh ? 
  so long as they superficially claim to be pro-gay ? 
  it 's incredible how ready this sub is to swallow far-right propaganda . 
  every single thread about this event has been nothing but a barrage of `` lol stupid lefitists caught you in a contradiction '' thought-free comments . 
  no , swecuck has literally turned into 10th century islamic wars territory , except for universities which are full of genderqueer feminist professors teaching courses on the best kind of chains to use for the cishet slaves . 
  it 's true because / pol / and / r/european told me . 
   so who gives them the money to spend more again ? 
  aside from greece , which has been completely beggared , the rest of the european south still has open and historically low-interest access to the credit markets . 
  aside from that , and this is a crucial point that is oftentimes mixed , economic models of stimulus do n't require a high level of spending ; growth and contraction are related to the * change * in structural spending , not to the nominal level . 
  i 'm not well versed in anglophone animal tropes , but i 'm not sure `` lazy goat '' is much better than `` lazy ass '' . 
  to be fair , he 's accused of having fucked just the one underage girl , and he has had his fair share of part-plastic old hags at his high-class parties .

  yeah you never studied history and you are making thinks up as you go, 
  i 'm not telling that all of these where brave , it 's a summary and skipping a lot of thing . 
  the partisan brigades where n't all wiped out . 
  in '44 there was almost no partisan because mussolini was arrested in ' 43 . 
  all the groups that where against mussolini self-disbanded soon after . 
  from how you write you sound like one of those `` forza nuova '' or `` casapound '' people . 
  more power means that they could have probably taken greece without the german help . 
  the campaign in africa would have been slightly more successful even eventually the war would have been streatched a little more . 
  the final outcome would have not been changed with us coming to war and dealing blows after blows without being retailed back would still have means the axiss defeat . 
  lol . 
  i 'm not saying that it would have let the axiss win the war , but probably prolonged it . 
  and in this perspective it was a good thing we where n't ready, 
  yes and no . 
  the allied took all the help they could get . 
  some mafia family where happy to help others where not . 
  this is also why they could export themself in the us, 
  germany helped italy in that front because it was supposed to be the easiest front but as stated above we where n't ready for a war and had too much trouble . 
  since we where german allied they could n't show that italy was n't ready and they decided to help . 
  in the eastern front we where again with germany it was mostly directed by the germans and we where mostly helping . 
  the treaty with the uk have a huge impact on portugal history and breaking it would mean losing the favor of a good chunk of people supporting the regimen . 
  plus salazar probably decided to use the treaty as an excuse to not risk losing his domain on that country . 
  this would have allowed him to gain enought time to decide later if getting into war at the axiss side ( if the uk had been defeated ) or stay neutral ( if the axiss where defeated ), 
  as always , it 's not that easy . 
  italy was quite a new country facing a lot of problems . 
  in the beginning they did n't care who control them . 
  he was doing some decent work and even if his method where unorthodox he had things done . 
  this kind of totalitarism was n't only an italian problem . 
  german had his own and portugal too , had his own version . 
  these three nations eventually got closer , politically speaking . 
  and in the beginning people where fine with it . 
  but there there was the problem of hitler wanting to expand his domain . 
  now portugal managed to stay neutral because , while they had the same political line as germany and italy they also had the oldest treaty with the uk so they could n't go against uk but could n't get with them either , so they played neutral ( wich mean helping both sides ) . 
  italy did n't really had such a treaty to use as an excuse and was unprepared for was . 
  hitler ammassed military forces but forgot to tell his allies to do the same . 
  so yeah we where dragged in a global war without the equipment and the mans to do it . 
  at the end of the day we only had a few fronts open in africa and some of our man helped the german battalions . 
  still people of italy now where n't happy . 
  especially some of the bravest mostly living close the alps started mounting a resistence against the fascist regimen . 
  they where mostly small groups disrupting the military reinforcement and derailing trains ( the ones full of jewish people so that they could escape ) . 
  then the allied come from the south . 
  and they worked with the resistence ( the resistence knew the territory much better and provided some intel ) . 
  mossolini falled and they gotten rome . 
  it would have been a nice end of story . 
  but do you remember when i said that italians soldier where helping german battalions ? 
  as soon as the news reached them many of these german battalions started to kill the italians soldiers labeling them as traitors . 
  the areas that where still with a german control started to see entire villages killed . 
  the order was to shot at kneecap height so that children where hit too . 
  so yeah by thet time the temporary government decided to side with the allied to try to regain control of the northern side of the country . 
  if you 'd like to read more on the subject there a wikipedia article : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/italian_resistance_movement, 
  influence in the eu . 
  yeah . 
  economic power ? 
  it 's simply a rank up in the eu . 
  not more money floating into our boats . 
  it was due to the second paragraph . 
  after the allied got into italy and saized the area the resistence groups somehow got control in the peninsula ( pushed by the allies ) . 
  people where n't happy with mussolini 's decisions of the war years ( we where n't ready for a war , much less for one of that scale ) . 
  after the resistance got into control they decide to help the allied . 
  so essentially they changed the group that controlled the country and said `` hey , help us , ok ? 
  we 'll help with the reconstruction ok ? '', 
  italy : `` ok '' i think this will sum it up a little, 
  yes and not . 
  as far as i know i do n't disagree with them 100 % they have the problem that their employee hire foreign labor force to pay them less ( more than in italy less than locals ) to save money . 
  italian people pay part of the taxes to ch and part their country . 
  this essentially means sending money outside of the country . 
  on the other hand , this is something that does n't work well with the free market they are part of , and without the free market ... well switzerland would be rich as they are now . 
  they are quite happy to import goods from us and to keep their wages up thanks to the low cost of the imported goods and imported money . 
  so yeah , it 's quite complicated . 
  the thing is that i was n't comparing it worldwide . 
  i was comparing it to the others european elites like germany uk or france . 
  in a worldwide scale we are doing pretty well . 
  in an elite scale ( because we are still the 4th eu economy and part of the g8 ) we are losing influence and economic power . 
  not anymore thanks to brexit http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/france-britain-uk-world-s-fifth-largest-economy-brexit-eu-referendum-a7123761.html they where always toe to toe so it 's not unexpected, 
  - lol no without free travel you will have to go the same lenght as people from let 's say the us to work in the eu . 
  meaning that some people will have to go back home . 
  same from european worker actually in the uk . 
  the european court of human rights have nothing to do with the european union . 
  it 's a different thing . 
  some nations not in the eu are part of it . 
  so it 's out of the scope of brexit, 
  we where with the axiss . 
  the allied came and conquered . 
  end of italy 's ww2 . 
  the thing that most people forgot is that in italy there where lot of resistance groups all over the country that fought against fascist and made it easier to invade the place . 
  because italy is the 4th economic power in the eu . 
  as of now th rankings are as follows . 
  de , fr , uk , it . 
  with uk out of the eu , it will raise to the 3rd place, 
  sadly as it unfolded with times . 
  italy was one of the best countries in the 80s . 
  fast forward 30 years and we lost a lot of what made it what it was back then . 
  this also means that they can reduce overtime compensation and and increase taxation as they please . 
  plus they have tracking coockies all over the web . 
  i 'm sure you will pay that many $ $ $ if it was for the penis, 
  plus zuckenberg profile is on a different server . 
  just to avoid people looking at his privacy . 
  you mean any flight right ? 
  lisbon is quite cheap, 
  well ... it 's still funnier with the wrong word but ok . 
  we can build new ones creating new jobs .

  to truly solve this problem many social changes need to take place . 
  payed and longer maternity leave , some kind of privilege for a family with children . 
  i would personally do this : when a woman is pregnant i 'd give her , by law , 2 years of leave . 
  her salary before leaving will be cut 50 % , but she will still have 50 % of the money and her job will be there when she 's done . 
  meanwhile this same job is take by someone young and inexperienced who just graduated and is ready to face life . 
  doing that job he will get the other 50 % of the salary and gain experience . 
  that way we solve the problem with females who do n't wan na lose their job due to pregnancy and give an easy start in life for someone , thus reducing youth unemployment . 
  of course salaries need to be increased dramatically so one salary can provide a middle class life for two people . 
  what is more i would like to cut on the social welfare that people fit for work receive . 
  and cut deep . 
  the money we save will be given to some kind of privilege for families with kids . 
  and parasites who are able to work but unwilling to will stop leeching on the back of hard working people . 
  what is more-create more kinder gardens , more schools where the children will be taken care of the entire work they until they hit high school-that way the family can keep working and the children should have a nice , stable place to grow in . 
  more vacation days for people with kids , less taxes . 
  those are the privileges we talk of that the state can do . 
  from the germanic ones i can tell apart german , english ( duh ) and danish . 
  swedish and norwegian sound absolutely the same to me but danish is a bit less melodic that the other two scandinavian languages . 
  dutch is also easy to tell . 
  slavic get a bit tougher . 
  having lived in eastern europe for a lot of years i know 2 slavic languages-bulgarian and russian . 
  by the power of those i can tell apart southern slavic ( bulgarian , slovenian , serbo-croatian ) and eastern slavic ( russian , ukrainian and i do n't think i 've ever heard belorussian so yeah ) . 
  then i hear no difference at all between polish , czech , slovak . 
  usually when i hear people who are europeans i can tell where they 're from , not only by the language but also by how they look . 
  oh yeah and all slavs have absolutely the same english accent . 
  you want to know ? 
  there 's a few reasons imo . 
  you see back in the day and in less progressive countries women did n't have anything to do . 
  they got married and all they had to do is have children . 
  nobody asks for their voices , nothing . 
  just breeding/sex/cooking machines . 
  in modern european society women are equal to men . 
  they educate themselves , go to universities and all . 
  in the end there 's no time for a kid-always trying to climb up the corporate ladder . 
  when being an established person they are like 30 or so and it 's too late to have more than one kid , sometimes two . 
  same goes for men . 
  when they are ready for a family they are in their thirties . 
  raising your kids . 
  you see for a family on the third world the kid does n't carry the same value as in europe . 
  it 's a wealth thing . 
  if you 're wealthy you want to give your child the best possible with resources . 
  for an african family 7 kids without education and sometimes food means nothing because they live in the same conditions . 
  the european , having taste for what 's good in life-education , a full stomach , a car , clothes etc. 
  wants his children to have all these luxuries as well . 
  so the middle class can usually not afford more than one or two children . 
  no need for a work force and low infant deaths . 
  a third world family brings kids to the world because they need their help . 
  they 'll need those kids to help with all the work on the field , in the house and marry them to someone wealthier by which increasing the household 's prestige and wealth . 
  so third world people have kids to be served by those kids because it 's the only way to survive . 
  europeans have kids to serve the kids and make them nice human beings , which means giving them attention and in your 30 's you only have attention for a one or two kids . 
  no wonder my grandpa had 4 brothers and sister , 2 children and 3 grandchildren . 
  you see how it 's going downhill with introducing more equality and wealth to the average european family ? 
  you want europeans to have more kids ? 
  there two ways : one is very complicated reforms that will lead to more fertility the other is-take away gender equality , take away wealth and watch europe explode with kids . 
  this is not a culture or a race thing . 
  it 's all about how life is . 
  rich countries like japan also have this problem-it 's about the money which changes people 's priorities when it comes to children-from extra worker to legacy . 
  yes the mistake is mine . 
  very poorly put out on my part . 
  i meant that bosnians are slavs and albanians are also people who converted to islam because of the ottomans . 
  but still local . 
  saying `` go home '' to albanians is very similar to saying `` go home '' to slavs on the balkans , germanic people in northern italy or to germanics in britain . 
  it 's just stupid . 
  so hypothetically could i go to crimea to `` volunteer '' ? 
  but albania and that region * is * their home . 
  what are albanians/bosnians/kosovians ( ? ), 
  if not local slavs who were forced to take islam by the ottomans ? 
  that exactly and that land is as theirs as it is the serbs ' . 
  they are local , they are native . 
  that 's the joke . 
  i do n't get this concept . 
  how are there empty homes ? 
  how do they not belong to anyone ? 
  if they do n't why are they there ? 
  who built them ? 
  or do they belong to the government ? 
   i would highly doubt that he would consider himself italian when asked . 
  yes he would . 
  the notion of italy is as old as the roman republic . 
  the people of italy had special rights within the roman empire . 
   are you on drugs ? 
  totally not on drugs ... 
  seriously though the renaissance was still miserable for average people . 
  and what is david if not one of the most remarkable monuments of the renaissance and of italian art and culture ^ ^ and ^ ^ superiority ^ ^ over ^ ^ the ^ ^ ^ french ? 
  italy is far from being the only country with a culture ministry . 
  also , as it 's the country with most unesco sights in the world , it 's good to have this ministry to protect and care for them . 
  i care about it . 
  it 's a great piece of art from a time where everything was miserable . 
  still though it 's not like they vandalized it . 
  who the fuck cares if they made an ad using it ? 
  yep , the italian government has once again shown that it knows what the important things are and has it 's priorities set right . 
  edit : is my sarcasm not translating well ? 
  yes , i am aware of these things . 
  the `` c '' is boccaccio is a typo . 
  although divina commedia is the entire work of dante , inferno is by far the most famous part around the world . 
  from what i know only inferno is studied in foreign ( non-italian ) schools . 
  the vatican is n't italy . 
  many italians are able to speak some latin because , as you probably very well know , it 's studied in some high schools . 
  it was exactly my point but obviously people disagree . 
   lingering patriarchal culture , this week threw their weight behind an eye-catching proposal they say would boost equality and fight domestic abuse : a salary for women working in the home . 
  i do n't think you understand how capitalism works .

  foligno is what silent hill or raccoon city would look like irl ( surprised they did n't twin it with pripyat ? ) . 
  latina and pomezia should be nuked into oblivion , never to be rebuilt or spoken of ever again ... 
  * stability -1 *, 
  there 's no escape !,

  i agree that individual austrians probably did n't want a war but their government surely did , or else it would n't have sent that ultimatum !, 
  there 's no way it could 've stayed a local conflict - the russians were n't going to allow them to steamroll through serbia at their leasure . 
  and a-h was backed by germany , which was n't exactly a small power ... 
  yes - you 're most definitely right but then again , italy was n't the one who actually sent an ultimatum to serbia knowing fully and well that they could have never accepted it ... austria wanted war and ended up paying for it . 
  such is life . 
  & nbsp ;  anyway italy has already commited an unprovoced attack on its former ally austria in 1915 ... & nbsp ; oh but it 's definitely not like austria was n't planning to do the very same thing to italy in 1908 , while at the same time happily engaging in widespread discrimination of italians within the empire . 
  wonderful , wonderful allies indeed !, 
  ( especially if we include that other paragon of virtue , the german reich ... with genocides and all ... ) by the way let 's talk about that time after the annexation of bosnia , the one in which austria-hungary was legally bound by treaty clauses to cede some lands as compensation but decided that legal provisions did n't apply to them ? 
  why the dodecanese though ? 
  we only got that in 1912 after beating the ottomans .

  well , even from a purely infrastructural/economical point of view these regions are fairly similar to each other ( plus you 've got aerospace and big pharma in latium , steel plants in umbria , plenty of light industry in the marches and abruzzo ) . 
  as far as abruzzo itself is concerned , that 's a bit of an odd case ... culturally and economically-wise it 's part of the centre but istat considers it part of the south simply because it used to belong to the kingdom of naples . 
  speaking of infrastructure , the region is on par with the rest of the country and as far as commerce goes you ca n't really take it apart from latium ( civitavecchia , not ancona , is the main port of choice for the local companies ) . 
  it may be slightly poorer than the rest of them , but it 's miles ahead of the south . 
  no comparison . 
  and they 've got the infn ... 
  tbf nothing about these regions strike me as particularly northern but you might have a point about tuscany ; i still have my doubts about the other two , though . 
  do n't forget about latium and - depending from your pov - abruzzo . 
  not least because umbria and ( northern ) latium are basically interchangeable .

  you then assume i was implying that women should have an abortion if told to do so and that they are their partners ' / fathers ' property . 
  nice strawman there . 
  way to go . 
  like , i 'm sorry ~ ~ men ~ ~ single mothers ca n't ~ ~ get pregnant ~ ~ take care of their children by themselves for the most part . 
  i 'm still not ceding control over my ~ ~ body ~ ~ personal finances and the next 20 + years of my life to any random ~ ~ dude ~ ~ chick out there . 
  ** ftfy **, 
  then you are admitting that women always have a plan b if they do n't want a baby , but men do n't . 
  does this really sound fair to you ? 
   the medical , emotional and associated risks of a pregnancy is carried solely by the pregnant person . 
  so if my partner has an abortion against my will i wo n't be emotionally affected ? 
  or if i find myself a baby i did n't want in the first place i wo n't have to bear the psychological , and financial burden just because i am a man ? 
  having a child is not only about the nine months of pregnancy : it 's a process of 20 + years in which theoretically both parents should be equally involved . 
   this means they [ * pregnant people , i.e. 
  women , i suppose * ] ca n't have a say about what happens with the foetus , either . 
  [ ca n't they ? 
  ] ( http://lmgtfy.com/?q=abortion ), 
  vasectomies are n't 100 % effective and condoms sometimes break . 
  next . 
  the problem is , men have no say in the transition * foetus -  baby * . 
  and this is , like it or not , unfair ( despite your witty semantics ) . 
  ok , very nice and all , but what this man says has - thank goodness - zero influence on the matter . 
  he 's a priest . 
  here we 're talking politics . 
  different subjects , different people whose opinion is worth discussing . 
  milano centrale is quite cool tbh . 
  he specifically said he does n't want grillo or salvini to win the elections . 
  if were a right winger , he would n't have said so . 
  he said the lesser evil is renzi , and despite the leftist propaganda claiming the contrary , renzi definitely is n't for right wingers . 
  right wingers in italy now either vote grillo or salvini . 
  berlusconi is gone , renzi has the moderates and some of the leftists . 
  so no , op definitely does n't sound like a right winger . 
  yeah but this is a public discussion and not everyone speaks french . 
  please , english . 
   -  no ticumptalism ( ? ), 
  triumphalism maybe ? 
  i 'm sorry , but claiming that the situation in italy is anywhere near the one they have in greece is not `` writing the truth and nothing more '' : it is perpetuating misconceptions and idiotic propaganda . 
  have we got our fair share of issues ? 
  sure we do . 
  is the situation dramatic ? 
  there are areas where it is , but tbh there have always been . 
  but i can feel the pain and the anger in op 's words and i honestly ca n't say that we 're anywhere near that . 
  actually it absolutely is n't , but who am i to oppose your ( and many of my compatriots ' ) inferiority complex ? 
  oh do n't worry , we 're pretty good at that too !, 
  can you actually survive this kind of stuff ? 
  i mean , what are the temperatures ? 
  plus , is n't it hazardous to be that close to the engines ? 
  even though it is undeniable that norway has many more refugees per capita than italy , you just ca n't only take that into consideration : also the gdp and the population density are important factors to determine if a country physically can welcome more people . 
  and yes , you give more than us in foreign aids , but hey , do you really want to compare our economic situations ? 
  oh , btw , i 'm sure that if we save a few millions a year ( like what , 0,00001 % of our gdp ? ), 
  from our politicians ' salaries we 'll have solved our biggest issue and hundreds of thousands if not millions of other migrants wo n't have reached our shores in the meantime ! ^ s, 
   is someone from southern nigeria that claims they 're running away from boko haram a refugee ? 
  i do n't know the criteria , but i suppose they 're not . 
  there are interpreters and anthropologists whose work is to define where someone is from . 
  i for one would never be able to impersonate a neapolitan convincingly . 
  i guess that 's the same for a nigerian or a somalian . 
   if they 're refugees why did n't they stop in one of the numerous safe countries between their origin and destination ? 
  most of them do . 
  others either already have friends or relatives in europe , or choose to seek asylum in a developed country instead of moving to a poor and socially unstable area . 
  i would do the same . 
   i do n't care . 
  i do n't trust those people . 
  i do n't care of what what you care . 
  i care about facts , and facts ( see the economist article that was posted here few days ago ) say most of them are refugees . 
  even though i believe the uncr is still fair and it does n't need to be changed , i think italy should make the eu hear its voice on the dublin convention - it 's just ridiculous and ** that 's ** the subject that needs to be addressed . 
  the right of a person to see their asylum rights recognised should not be on the table . 
  since the journey is very expensive and physically exhausting , not to mention very dangerous , i guess it makes sense if many families decide to first send the man/father so that he can build some economic stability before the rest of the family arrive via more `` traditional '' routes, 
   whoever promises to send everyone back to libya . 
  whatever they promise , ** nobody can ** . 
  it 's against international agreements . 
   being a refugee is about safety not economic upliftment . 
  and also being able to have a family without seeing them starve to death etc. 
  you would be absolutely right , ** if ** : * most of the people who flee from war-stricken areas did n't look for refuge in nearby regions ; * the socioeconomic situation of such areas were comparable to even the poorest countries in the eu ; * there were n't strict criteria to determine whether the migrants who reach our shores are actually potential refugees and , most of all , the majority of their applications were declined . 
  do i really have to tell you all these premises are false or you can do your homework and find that out yourself ? 
  not sure if you 're joking or just plain ignorant . 
  anyway , [ nigeria ] ( http://lmgtfy.com/?q=boko+haram ) and [ mali ] ( http://lmgtfy.com/?q=mali+civil+war ) are n't the best example you could 've picked . 
  that 's a bit simplistic , let 's just say they 're in a very complicated and dysfunctional relationship, 
  you could start posting in english only yourself . 
  the italian pm , which you 'd know if you 'd read the article, 
  it 's a quote from renzi, 
  ... and i 'm sure that your opinion is worthier than the lives of thousands . 
  honestly , i have no idea . 
  theoretically , it could be done by seriously enforcing the state 's presence in the most crime-stricken areas . 
  to be fair , many historians believe that the fascist regime effectively dismantled mafias in the south this way ( and that they were brought back after wwii ) . 
  the thing is , that would mean creating a police state in some regions , and that 's both a huge investment and a terribly unpopular choice . 
  but i 'm not an expert and this is a very complicated issue : it 's about culture , society , politics . 
  let 's just say that if you want to fight mafias , you need to address corruption and infiltrations first - and it seems this government is going that way , but this is surely not something you sort out in a year or two . 
  what do you mean ? 
  if you 're asking about the everyday experience , yes it is different . 
  there are towns in the south completely controlled by mafias : racket ( the so-called * pizzo * ) , violent crimes , drugs : it 's all about them . 
  it 's much more entrenched into the everyday life and society . 
  from what i 've heard , you just * feel * that it 's there . 
  but that does n't mean that mafias do n't operate in the north : in fact , the richer an area is , the more profitable it is for them . 
  although certainly much , much rarer , racket is still a thing in the north . 
  honestly , i have never happened to feel the presence of organised crime in my area myself , even though it often turns out they infiltrate events , banks , companies . 
  let 's just say that the money they make in the south , they invest it in the north . 
  probably it has much to do with the south-north situation . 
  i mean , if the overall gdp stagnates , that might very well mean that lombardia , veneto and piemonte have grown just as much as germany and the uk , but sicily and calabria are still deeply in recession . 
  that means that , unlike more homogeneous economies , gdp growth in italy does not affect the population that much . 
  there are much more important factors such as unemployment rate ( which is fairly low in the north , which often means that when people get new jobs they get them in the south ) .

  caravaggio was an incredible talented painter during the counter reformation and he had very influential friends ( cardinals and nobles ) . 
  some of his paintings caused scandals : for example the `` death of the virgin '' because mary was depicted as a suffering and common woman , without any mystical feature ( plus , some say he used a prostitute drowned in the tiber as a model ) . 
  another painting , madonna dei pellegrini , which is 100 % sure that the virgin had the aspect of caravaggio 's lover ( another prostitute ) caused a scandal ... because the characters are barefoot . 
  so is possible that very few knew and did n't want his talent go to waste . 
  caravaggio used whores as models for mary . 
  there are some greek communities in calabria and puglia dating back to the byzantine empire . 
  after a quick research , i discovered that italian developed voi first , while lei was added later as a pronoun for important titles ( her majesty , his holiness ) , so that explain why lei was more formal than voi . 
  tbh nowadays is not something very talked about . 
  ah yes , in the south it 's still used . 
  in italy we use `` tu '' in informal speech and `` lei '' ( third person , literally `` she '' ) for the formal . 
  shopkeepers and bartenders usually use tu , except when the person addressed is an elderly or a known respectable member of the society ( lawyers , engineers , policemen ) . 
  teachers almost always use `` tu '' when addressing their students , except in university . 
  ( not all university professors use `` lei '' , tho . ), 
   are there maybe more than two levels of politeness ? 
  we have `` voi '' ( second plural person ) which was popularized by the fascist regime , but is now considered too formal and outdated .

  thieves !, 
   the city itself is a small version of amsterdam , with canals , bridges , cosy alleys and canal houses . 
  ... and none of the annoying tourists, 
  i 've been there a month ago , it 's one of the nicest cities in the netherlands, 
  impossible to sell anyway, 
  for the ones who criticize the building , remember that the architect was probably requested a shit-ton square meters in the same area of the building without touching it , its not that she decided to do whatever she wanted . 
  she was also very famous for her particular design , and still they chose her . 
  also , personal opinion - i love it !, 
  zaha in a nutshell, 
  really nice and fun,

   - sun does n't shine consistently enough + solar power is still the least efficient way of generating green energy . 
  i have lived in the netherlands , you get an english climate sadly  - wind turbines work , but we 'd need a metric fuckton of them , and they 're all out in the sea so i imagine they cost a lot to place/keep running . 
  also the potential ecological damage . 
  but i 'd like to find a study about this since it seems the most reasonable way . 
  sea turbines is definitely the best choice , the uk started investing a lot on them and seems to be a good idea, 
  not more than israel and iran, 
  i expect troubles, 
  2017 will be fun, 
  i am talking of the indipendent btw, 
  the guy idiotically tied the referendum to an approval of himself it 's gon na be brexit 2 : resignation bogaloo, 
  not yet , we have the referendum the 4th of december , it will probably fail and the government will fall, 
  holy crap , how much hate can you see on the comments, 
  mostly because it was 88 km deep . 
  [ meanwhile in italy ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmcz-ascdwm ), 
  it 's good manner to send a letter first, 
  i 'm sad i was only able to stay in troms\u00f8 two days , i had a wonderful time there, 
  because it is, 
  eh , it should n't be an indipendent country in the first place,

  is 2016 the year of the retarded politics ? 
  we like to complain of our politicians , but outside it 's often much worse, 
  while i think the same , it 's like sweeping the dirt under the carpet , it only postpones the problem, 
  putin be like `` why do i have to deal with this tool '', 
  plenty of russians in italy too, 
  even the sentence buying a country makes no sense,

  well basically you want your main trading partners to have a stable economy or your economy will go to shit too . 
  so you provide assistance when its needed in order to prevent a greater damage to your country 's current account . 
  greece seemed stable at the time , and other countries in the eu that did better during the crisis had to be bailed out several other times before . 
  as i already said greek officials lied providing accounting evidence that they were following the rules . 
  it was n't just latvia , it was the whole eastern block . 
  it used to . 
  while yes i do agree , one can not ignore such a substantial part of the population . 
  european countries by trading with it , the us by making russia weaker . 
  by '' you '' i meant '' y' all '' like they say in the us or '' yous '' like they say in ni . 
  yeah but that is what a being part of a country is about , you give up part of your freedom in order to get other benefits . 
  i meant that my comment was n't personal . 
  it 's not always about you draculix , jeez ... / s, 
  i was just referring to latvia . 
  tbh as long as it benefits 27 countries and it is only bad for one i ca n't give a damn . 
  why is it that all the baltic states people in this sub can not not talk about the ussr and victimise themselves on every occasion, 
   if that happens , do n't you think it 's messed up that the eu is bullying its members to stay in the union ? 
  every country makes sure that its regions do n't become independent and the country balkanise . 
  i do n't see why the eu should be different . 
  billions of euros will be lost and the risk for military tensions will increase . 
   shoving together countries with vastly different economical and cultural backgrounds and trying to fit them into one mold is not the way to go . 
  i do n't know dude , i can still eat my rag\u00f9 and play my football , nobody ever forced me to eat krauts and play cricket . 
  jokes aside international economic relations theory explains how countries that are geographically closer to each other tend to trade more , by trading more they become more integrated , more integration leads to the need to create supranational entities . 
   i 'm all for free trade , but the monetary union was a mistake , as seen by the euro-crisis . 
  yet the only way the eu wants to ` fix ' things is by integrating even further . 
  the euro crisis was n't created by the introduction of the euro . 
  it was created by the absence of control of the american financial market . 
  of course the euro made it harder for countries to adjust to the recession , but there are many good and bad things that come from a single currency market . 
   funnily enough , britain does n't even have the euro , so the brits were spared the `` pain '' of having to drop billions into the bottomless pit called esm . 
  it did n't work like that . 
  none of this works like that . 
   british people suffer because of their own stupidity  the eu loses an economically strong member ... and an adversary of european integration . 
  i mean this is not personal , it 's just that you created such a shitstorm out of '' muh britshness '' and '' muh jahbs '' , i kinda think a big part of the british people deserve a lesson . 
  this whole brexit thing is almost as dumb as trump in the us . 
  and anyways you guys have never been to kind to your neighbours . 
  i 'd like to remind you that the british economy was incredibly shit compared to italy 's throughout the 80s and 90s ( especially considering that it has been '' one of the permanent un security council members , a nuclear armed state and with huge foreign influence '' ) . 
  it is only recently due to an accrued political corruption , adopting the euro and the economic crisis , major investments in ee , etc. . . that the uk is doing better than us * right now * . 
  it is a simple principle , investors and financial markets hate volatility , a simple change in political leaders can lead to a decade long recession . 
  a brexit would make the uk a sterile place for doing business for years . 
  sauce : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_past_and_projected_gdp_ ( ppp ) _ per_capita, 
  yes and this is one of the reasons cameron regretted summoning a referendum . 
  if a brexit happens then the eu will retaliate by basically embargoing the uk so other countries do not try to leave too . 
  if it does n't happen the uk has no more cards in its sleeve to use against eu proposals/laws , no more special treatments . 
  in both cases the uk is fucked . 
  oh no worries , she 's gon na fuck herself in a few days . 
  then we can all fuck her . 
  it probably has nothing to do with the eu but people of european descent ( i 'm not sure about the rest but italy for sure ) all over the world can get an european passport . 
  in my mind it 's just stupid , your great grandfather was italian ... so what ? 
  you do n't even speak the language , you should n't be able to officially represent my country imo . 
  yeah clever ones . 
  i really hope for the first outcome you mentioned . 
  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_italian_inventions i 'm talking for myself here , but i guess even cities that are smaller than 2m inhabitants have created at least 3-4 inventions/discoveries that are better than melodium, 
  as if other countries did n't have violent '' fans '' . 
  berlusconi for us , cameron/farage for you , bush jr. / trump for the us , tony abbott for australia , etc. . . 
  doubt it . 
  yeah but that 's a recent shift , in the last 6 months and throughout the years before the majority was '' pro-stay '' . 
  - step 1 : have your justice system focus really hard on organised crime and corruption for a year or two ; - step 2 : let people forget about it and think things are okay now ; - step 3 : ??? 
  - step 4 : perpetual economic recession !, 
  pfff noobs , can you even call it corruption if you do n't have professional hitmen ? 
  check . 
  - bloody face pic ? 
  check . 
  - creepiness ?

  communist, 
  this is so clever !, 
  basically people who can not understand english very well will have even a harder time understanding important announcements !, 
  but most importantly , people who have to wait in the aiport for like 6 hours because of a flight delay will get even more pissed after listening to the same ditty a hundred times . 
  esti you of genius !, 
  i mean , the role of western powers in creating problems in the middle east is more of an historical fact rather than a conspiracy theory . 
  many european countries were already there, 
  pfff if you ca n't afford to waste an euro on a fellow european then get out of the union already , europoor . 
  then do n't smoke dumbass . 
  uk is the 6th for generosity . 
  yeah right , try asking a briton for a ciggy , it 's like asking them if they have a spare kidney . 
  swedes/finns : europe 's awkward kids . 
  in 2014 the us exported refined petroleum ( 7.1 % of its total exports ) , gold ( 1.4 % ) , soybeans ( 1.7 % ) , other vegetables ( about 3.8 % ) paper and other wood derivatives ( about 2 % ) , animal products ( about 2 % ) , etc. . . the us economy is based on manufacturing and services but heavily relies on natural resources . 
  much more than most oecd countries . 
  sauce : http://atlas.media.mit.edu/en/profile/country/usa/, 
  yeah it was , still more valuable than any slovakian degree . 
  you said bye/hi twice . 
  dumbass . 
  yeah the dutch anthem sucks dicks . 
  seriously . 
  what if i burnt a flag book in international waters ? 
  or , even better , in front of the un ? 
  reread what you just said . 
  you 're saying that everyone agrees with it , which is wrong . 
  most of the academia agrees with me . 
   not being as exploited as possible does not in any way mean you do not have any . 
  italy has access to massive quantities of raw minerals and fish , just to give a few examples . 
  these are quite profitable . 
  no dude , seriously , we have very little oil , coal , iron ore , natural gas , gold , arable land , etc compared to our population ... it 's a fact , not a matter of debate . 
  fish ? 
  there is not a single major country that has fish as its top exports . 
  even if we caught as much fish as we could we would destroy the ecosystem in such a way that the next year we 'd be able to fish a small percentage than the year before , and so on until it 'd be nil . 
  we have eu sustainability quotas over fishery so that this does n't happen . 
   and yet italy is somehow up to european standards . 
  it 's not an issue of climate in the current human lifetime ( at least in developed nations ) , it 's a matter of technology , especially in italy where the climate actually helps the production of many crops and gives a rich marine environment ( thus the fishing ) .

  the populism of big part of m5s is similar to that of the greens in the uk , usa , ecc . 
  they really do n't . 
  their platform is appealing to me but there 's no internal democracy within the party , they have a cult like following , they are owned by a company , ecc . 
  as an independent with the indirect support of minor parties like sinistra italiana , ecc . 
  for example , napoli is governed by a left wing independent who 's not backed by any major party . 
  they do n't ask people about every proposal but just a few key ones ( for example , how they should 've voted regarding civil unions , where they ironically did n't follow the majority of their voters ) . 
  they also chose their five man board , the european group they should have entered in , ecc . 
  in this way, 
  never tried to compared . 
  i have just said that he acts in the same way as him and idolizes or uses him as a media stunt . 
  there used to be a time when i looked at wikileaks in a good light but julian assange sold himself off to russia a long time ago and does n't care about average citizen 's privacy . 
  the difference between assange and snowden lies there in my opinion . 
  it 's far easier to respect the second whereas the first is in it for himself and himself only, 
  only in iceland . 
  in italy , we have m5s which is kinda like a mix of greens and pirates with an unhealthy dose of populism sprinkled on it libertarians got us abortion and divorce so they were relevant here in italy in the 70s at least so they will always be reminded nicely for those reasons, 
  it would but it 's likely that at that point the renzi government will try to pass another electoral law with the support of centrists that takes the senate into account too . 
  exactly . 
  we ca n't ask jordan or turkey for more either . 
  i will reluctantly vote for yes in the next parliamentary election because we are at a moment where we stability and because there are good parts about the constitution 's change like the abolition of perfect bicameralism . 
  at the same time , the constitution 's change could have been made more effective in how it 's worded and it gives too much power to one party and one man ( no one will have to depend on coalition partners anymore ) . 
  i 'm not fond of centralism either but devolution as it was done now was ineffective so it 's not much of a change at the next parliamentary election , it will most likely be sinistra italiana at the first round and partito democratico at the second . 
  if someone like fico or appendino is made m5s 's candidate , i may even be bold enough to vote them at the second round but it has to be either him or someone of its mold and not some extremely populist guy who has no idea about anything, 
  if m5s won the election , i am not sure they would last long at all . 
  they are very divided on several issues and the moment they will be in government , they will start struggling even more to stay united . 
  there are already fights from inside the party to gain the leadership . 
  you have di maio ( the closest to an average politician , he 's more moderate , charasmatic but has shown to be incompetent and even bordering on not caring about corruption in a few occasions ) , fico ( he 's your standard center left winger and barely even populist , well liked within the party 's mps but has the charisma of an ameba ) and di battista ( he is the most extreme of them , he goes throughout italy on his moto like che guevara and his jerseys and has made several shocking populist remarks and support the most crazy conspiracy theorists , he 's liked by the party 's voters ), 
  as i said , it 's a mix of things which pushed him to intervene . 
  intervention should have actually happened sooner if gulenist and a few kemalist members of the military ( so it 's said ) were n't opposed . 
  i do n't think he wants syrian clay , i just thinks he 's willing to do whatever brings him support and bringing syrian immigrants back to syria would brought him support, 
  i forgot to mention that a fair few amount of m5s 's first purged have all ended inside sinistra italiana or as generally left wing independents . 
  i remember orellana who was very vocal against grillo and casaleggio . 
   also how exactly would youn caracterize sinistra italiana ? 
  a mix of the greens with socialists ? 
  a mix of greens , socialdemocrats and democratic socialists . 
   what are their stances on europe , foreign affairs ( russia ) or economy ? 
  on europe , that it and its economical rules should be reformed from within . 
  in case it ca n't be reformed , then an exit should be a last resort . 
  on foreign affairs , they seem , like all italian parties , to want to lift sanctions on russia . 
  they are also against military interventions of any kind and want to cut costs of military ( like five star movement ) on economy , just look at podemos and uk 's current labour party and you have sinistra italiana . 
  anyway , their programme is n't completely formed yet . 
  they will have a congress on the 3rd , 4th and 5th of december 2016 where they will finally come up with a complete programme, 
   do n't forget that italy + greece are taking a massive hit from russia sanctions and it would do both our countries enormous favors to block these sanctions . 
  but we do n't because we are in solidarity with ee/v4/etc . 
  exactly, 
   but why does n't it taint the image of the movement , or makes grillo be perceived as having autorcratic tendencies ? 
  he is perceived as such already but the m5s ' average voter excuse is that grillo is only the face of the movement and that the rest of the party is what matters . 
   and why do n't those left-wing m5s voters vote for sinistra italiana , is it perceived as too establishment/corrupt ? 
  anyway , sinistra italiana barely has space in debates on tv and such and they sure do n't have m5s ' strong social network appeal . 
  aside from that , sinistra italiana 's ceiling is some 15 % of votes while m5s ' ceiling is much higher because they appeal to anyone from communists to neofascists . 
  grillo himself said that anyone is welcome in the party . 
  they somehow manage to make everyone happy by avoiding taking positions on any social question . 
  this means that although 80 % of the party 's mp wanted to vote in favour of civil unions ( and before that gay marriage or civil unions with step child adoptions ) , they decided to abstain not to lose voters on the right . 
  they win votes on the left with a left leaning platform and votes on the right with their strongly populist rhetoric and the strong leader . 
  also , at the time when five star movement experienced its boom , there was no sinistra italiana and the left could n't agree on anything . 
  they have a strict regulation on how their politicians behave which is very easy to breach . 
  their politicians should be suspended from the party even if they receive a warning warranty . 
  if their politicians are then condemned during the first process , then they drop their support altogether and are kicked out of the party but usually before this is possible , they hold some kind of vote on the internet about the whole situation ( of course only a few members of the party can vote and the voting itself is influenced by how questions are made which ensures that the leaders get the results they want ), 
  honestly , it depends on the case . 
  parma mayor pizzarotti is about the only one which came out of it well and is generally looked at positively from the average left and center-left winger . 
  he did a good job and has a good chance of being re-elected next year . 
  the rest of them have all disappears into anonimity, 
  yet i know a fair few albanians which came through illegal channels as well as a fair few polish or hungarian who did the same thing . 
  it 's not like there was no illegal immigration back then , it used to be a minor problem compared to now ( mostly because it concerned a few countries like italy where we have had famous landings from albania such as the vlore ship or [ the tragedy of otranto ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tragedy_of_otranto ) ) but it was there, 
  but after 2004 , we got flooded with low skilled people . 
  i would have waited a few more years before accepting them but i think it was a wise choice overall . 
  these two countries seem to understand eu 's principles but v4 ( especially hungary and , since pis took over , poland ) are more and more of a stumbling block both to eu solidarity and federalization . 
  if you are n't ok with it , just exit the eu . 
  we are doing that . 
  we are the ones who have installed the current government or tripoli would still be controlled by islamists and the choice would have been once again between islamists and a secular dictatorship . 
  we are the ones helping the current government and i think they would be glad to help us back , it 's just that they do n't have the means at the moment, 
  the problem is that hungary and poland do n't want to take even a low symbolical amount . 
  i understand your economical concerns but i do n't understand this super tough stance you have either . 
  why not accept like 4000 of them each ? 
  what would it change to you to do that ? 
   after the war in syria is over , we should sent them back . 
  every single one ... because having war in your country and having enough money to pay for entering the asylum lottery by being on boat in mediterrean sea just shouldnt be free ticket for life in europe . 
  depends . 
  if one has became a valuable member of society ( i.e. 
  found work and gotten citizenship or one of the two ) , i do n't see the reason for it . 
  and i want to add that this people often sold all they had in their home country to get a chance at being given asylum so it 's not like they have won the lottery . 
  they have to go far from rest of family , friends , the place they grew up in , they even often have to change their values , ecc . 
  so speaking of them as winning the lottery means once again dehumanizing them just like most people from v4 seem to do all the time, 
   you know that czech republic is net immigration land ? 
  we get more eu immigrants that how many czechs move to other eu countries . 
  visit prague and you will find fair share of italian youth working here . 
  i know but i was broadly speaking about ee . 
  your country has been the exception even when it comes to this refugee quotas problem as it has accepted a symbolic quota of immigrants which both hungary and poland refuse to do . 
  my problem is not with you , it 's with your allies . 
   it is nice that western countries help poor regions . 
  i think that poor people ( balkan , poland , south italy etc. ), 
  need help to get back on their feet . 
  i personally live near prague and our local gdp per capita is above eu average . 
  that means our region is not eligible for eu funds and subsidies . 
  i \u00b4 m ok that 1 % of our taxes goes to other people in europe . 
  i am too but because of the northern half of my country we have to pay well more than we receive despite my region being under eu 's averages  it is italy that shows no solidarity . 
  you just ferry the people across sea and then let them cross your northern borders . 
  unlike spain that is able to keep gibraltar straight safe . 
  this shows ignorance of what italy has to deal with . 
  just like spain has a deal with morocco , italy had one with gaddafi 's lybia . 
  now , there 's no stable government in libya and italy is trying to fix the situation there and has to wait for the government it supports to be able to control more than just its main cities ( they control misurata , sirte plus most of tripoli and its suburbs but very little of the countryside ) .

most older males are circumcised and think that it is positive , and therefore they think that their sons should also be like that just try to change the sentence to this :  most older males * have been * circumcised and think that it is positive , and therefore they think that their sons should also * undergo the same surgery * . 
  does it sound a little bit different to you ? 
  you are n't born circumcised , it 's not a natural thing , nor circumcision has any appreciable benefit . 
  it 's a cultural thing inherited from a religious tradition that only made sense because anything related to sex in the past was taboo , including cleaning their own privates . 
  some cities hold a book where the married couples can be registered , but it is n't institutionalized . 
  then yes you are color blind , i guess, 
  uh , similar shades ? 
  they are like the opposite of each other :d, 
  italy is one of the first to decriminalize gay sex but of course we still do n't have any for of legal union for homosexual couples . 
  yeah i just remembered about liechtenstein . 
  fuck liechtenstein , at least vatican have good art, 
  if they become a penis you will be the balls, 
  yeah i mean it 's their fault they were born in a fucked up country , right ? 
  malta gives 0 shits about their hospitality duties , they would rather have a immigrant ship sink in front of their shores than help them . 
  libyan , too . 
  you know , after the bombardment and everything ... 
  uh could you link the article ? 
  this statement resent stupidity . 
  nah we were pretty fucked much before 2012 , for example , berlusconi had to resign due to spread in november 2011 , and the situation was already pretty grim . 
  still , the fact that italy is seen as a `` pig '' like a country that lives on the shoulders of other eu countries yet we are 3rd in place for contribution somewhat pisses me off . 
  til removing one of the most sensible parts of a sexual organ is a `` cosmetic procedure '' inb4 general butthurt, 
  in italy we do it , too . 
  italian here , i just realized it . 
  i mean , if does n't * literally * mean smith , it 's a slightly archaic term . 
  smith would be `` fabbro '' or `` ferraio '' though the latter is n't used as much . 
  i guess op was talking about european union, 
  but from spain to china going west or east ? 
  the fact is , those technological breakthroughs are already happening . 
  they are happening since 20-30 years ago an everything that is accomplished is that wealth is going into the hands of the few people who make/control those innovations . 
  or maybe other countries think we are too good, 
  he seems like the right man in the wrong place . 
  he probably could have done many good things in a country that was n't already doomed . 
  greece was already beyond fucked . 
  might be a surprise for you ... 
  i 'm surprised it 's not a lot more . 
  i bet the south ( and old people ) brings the percentage down quite a lot , today my fb has been a explosion of rainbow flags ( i live in the north east ), 
  i absolutely agree , it 's fucking stupid and useless . 
  people in that rally might be hundreds of thousand but they do n't represent the majority of italians . 
  despite what other people are saying there i do n't think islam represent a `` violent '' threat to europe . 
  however you need to understand that most countries in eu come from centuries long fights to become democratic and secularized ( or at least close to that ) . 
  most of our constitutions and law are written to put like freedom and equality on top of everything and that is n't really why most religions preach . 
  it is no surprise then that a culture/religion like islam which is really involved in what people can/cannot do is n't seen so well . 
  how many people are we talking about ? 
  every map projection is weir by definition . 
  lol i thought it was a limo too . 
  i was like `` yeah cause everyone has money for that , what a stupid ad '', 
  i would n't mind , too . 
  pass was not stolen . 
  or , more simply , google is a better search engine than duckduckgo, 
  more like classic statue in general . 
  the title of the submission is the same as the title of the article . 
  this is a , beautiful news . 
  they used the recoil of the guns to change direction . 
  do n't question the methods of great russian navy capitalist scum . 
  and homosexuality, 
  so what ? 
  she bullshitted . 
  prime ministers are n't elected . 
  just a nutjob then ? 
  from the article :  the government has now officially accepted that it 's a human right for parents to circumcise their sons . 
  nobody here is talking about people choosing to circumcise themselves . 
  and jew . 
  and widespread in most of us . 
  so , is killing infidels a human right or not ? 
  how is yemen 's government stance on drone strike any relevant ? 
  they are n't striking yemen 's government , they are striking terrorist , causing also many civilians causalities . 
  for fuck sake dude . 
  the guys from / r/bitcoin i guess, 
  bitcoin is there . 
  pretty sad to be honest . 
  however , it is much closer , and we partially depend on their oil and gas . 
   because if not , it is the right thing for a left-leaning party to govern with a center-left policy approach . 
  you need to form a consensus that is acceptable to 50 % + of the population . 
  see , this concept is something that since at least 1994 is completely foreign to the italian public . 
  every single person has their own ideas , and everyone is either for * all * or * nothing * . 
  no middle ground . 
  and if you try to build coalition then you are just a slimy politician trying to hold his chair . 
  5sm and other parties actually have their foundation on fomenting the hate on this kind of things . 
  transition government . 
  the south definitely had a greater support for the no . 
  but the regions where lega nord is stronger also voted for no , leaving basically just the central italy with a slight yes majority . 
  maybe you ca n't expect to have an immediate change after a major reform ? 
  maybe it takes months or years to have noticeable effects ? 
  this vote wo n't lead to immediate elections , we will have a transition government until the elections next year , but a lot of things can change in the meantime . 
  it should be remembered that renzi was already defeated once ( in the primaries of his party ) and came victorious later . 
  exactly , i voted yes but it 's not easy to see what are the pros and cons of this reform . 
  to me approving it was just slightly better than leaving things as they are now . 
  it would probably be better if they just let us vote point by point . 
  that 's not surprising . 
  the sad thing is we are letting them do it . 
  even worse , some are actively helping them . 
  yeah you are right,

  is there a subreddit for overly-explanatory political comics ? 
  how did you get scammed ?

found [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lndehlnx6wg ) interview he gave at the italian television . 
  roughly translated : `` we 're going to respect the 3 % limit , not everybody does but that does not mean that other countries have the right to decide over france or other nations , in other words , to be more clear : we respect the 3 % limit but we respect also the decisions of a free and friendly country like france and i believe that nobody has the right to treat other countries in the way they treat students . 
  if france has made this decision they have their reasons and i 'm with fran\u00e7ois hollande and manuel valls , naturally italy 's situation is different and we 're going to respect the 3 % limit that we 've been imposed . '',

  good news from malta !, 
  now my country is the only one left in western europe that has still to legalize it , what a shame . 
  interesting video , but they 've made a small geographical mistake : carrara is not on the adriatic ( east ) coast but on the thyrrenian ( west ) one . 
  it is indeed . 
  but , at least over here , it 's not caused by the eu rather than by local politicians and bureaucrats , who are often corrupt . 
  as crazy as it might sound , a more centralized eu governance would help in solving the problem , by taking away the decision-making power from the hands of the corrupt people . 
  it was ( at least politically ) in the 1940s though , morocco and algeria were still french territories . 
  i think it 's not unethical if you 're really interested in that country 's politics ; if i moved to another country i would still vote in italian elections . 
  on the other hand , if you do n't really care enough to be informed it 's better that you do n't vote . 
  lack of money and housing cost are important factors , but another concern is lack of stability ; in the past here a lot of jobs were basically `` life-lasting '' , nowadays many people work for a while in a place then their work contract is n't renewed and have to find another job somewhere else , in another town or even in another country . 
  in these conditions it 's impossible to plan in advance so a lot of people just prefer to not have kids . 
  yes , around 80.000 people [ according to wikipedia ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/griko_people ) . 
  i do n't know if a greek person would consider them to be greek though , they mixed a lot with southern italians over the course of time . 
  this is an interesting post . 
  while i 'm a huge supporter of unrestricted immigration ( for selfish reasons , too : i want to be able to move wherever i like ) i agree that assimilation into the new culture is a crucial point . 
  especially in regard to sharing the `` western '' ideals of freedom and tolerance . 
  having said that , i think assimilation is a combined effort : the immigrant must do everything in his power to adapt but he should be put in the condition to do so . 
  a possible solution might be to force immigrants to take free language courses which also teach the culture and values of that specific country , and periodically test them ; those who fail the test would then be expelled . 
  do n't know know if that 's feasible but selective immigration sounds more rational than `` everybody is welcome '' or `` keep them all out '' . 
  ultimately i agree with that redditor that wrote that this subject should be dealt with from a `` centrist '' point of view , leaving all ideologies aside . 
  i was n't expecting this result to be honest . 
  i 'm disappointed .

  many people i know are against the euro , their argument being `` with the lira i could buy more stuff '' . 
  they might be right , but i think that quitting the euro right now would do more harm than good . 
  sound strange to me , because the aspirated c should be only between two vowels . 
  so we 'd still say for example `` un cane '' but we would say `` una hasa '' . 
  anyway i live on the coast so it 's entirely possible that the accent varies a bit . 
  true , it 's mostly accent and pronunciation though , and the usage of some words that are n't used anymore in standard italian . 
  while northern and southern dialects are much more different and almost incomprehensible to someone who only speaks the standard language . 
  my regional dialect * is * my country 's official language . 
  i live in tuscany , italy . 
  here in italy we have many immigrants , mainly from eastern europe ( especially romania ) and north africa , due to geographical proximity . 
  the attitude towars them is mixed , usually old people are quite xenophobic while young people are more accepting , however due to the economic crisis people are starting to feel resentment because they think that immigrants took all our jobs . 
  romanians are unjustly hated because some ignorant folks tend to confuse them with the romani gypsies ( who are the minority most difficult to integrate ) . 
  overall i 'd say immigrants here are more or less integrated and most do some low paid job that italians do n't really want to do . 
  sure , there are also a few criminals but it 's just the usual crimes ( drug dealing , theft ) and not serious stuff like rioting/religious fundamentalism/terrorism . 
  i think my country is still safe from this point of view . 
  indeed . 
  also , from one of the captions :  frankfurt 's mayor , peter feldmann , has called for all of frankfurt 's construction sites to allow graffiti on their perimeter fences . 
  we need more mayors like him . 
  in the latest local elections the independentist candidate got only about 3 % of the votes though . 
  it 's pretty much a fringe movement , nothing like catalonia for example . 
  `` we 're all tired we want our documents/papers '' with lots of grammar and spelling mistakes . 
  the sea inside ( spain ) is probably my favourite ; other good films not yet mentioned in the thread : black book ( netherlands ) , last year at marienbad ( france ) , the turin horse ( hungary ) . 
  it would take many years but we 'll inevitably get there . 
  italy , spain and portugal are drinking and watching the football game on tv , wondering how will they pay the bill because none of them have money . 
  they 'll probably ask for credit saying that they 'll pay the next time . 
  greece is already drunk with ouzo at the start of the night and the owner ( germany ) threatens to kick him if he continues drinking . 
  france is at the counter , trying to order his drink in french instead of english and then gets mad at the bartender who does n't serve him . 
  belgium is at his side still undecided on what to order . 
  uk is always complaining that the bar is shitty , the other patrons are dickheads and the drinks suck , but in the end he always stays until bar closes being friendly with everyone . 
  poland and ireland just met and they 've instantly become best friends . 
  bulgaria and romania are outside the bar , pissed that the bouncer ( netherlands ) does n't let them in . 
  romania then decides to go to visit his friend moldova instead . 
  the balkan countries are loudly arguing with each other , except slovenia that left their table and went to sit with austria , czech and slovakia , pretending not to know his former friends . 
  estonia wants to talk with her crush finland , but he 's more interested in chatting up sweden and denmark , so she goes back to the table with lithuania and latvia . 
  luxembourg is dressed like a hipster and is drinking an unknown craft beer . 
  andorra , liechtenstein , monaco , gibraltar and san marino are underage and ca n't drink so they order a coke . 
  malta and cyprus just entered the bar but nobody noticed them . 
  turkey is very religious and does n't go to bars , while iceland lives too far away and rarely shows up . 
  russia keeps drinking vodka from ukraine 's glass , the other patrons are irritated by his behaviour but nobody has the balls to do anything to stop him , so russia continues to harass ukraine . 
  switzerland and norway do n't like the atmosphere of the bar , but they still want to drink , so they buy a bottle of the most expensive wine and then drink it outside . 
  - czech republic : the wealthier ex-communist country , high standard of living , great geographical location right in the heart of europe , and prague is a lovely city . 
  also cheap beer . 
  - romania : similar language and fast internet , plus my gf is from there . 
  - estonia : from what i 've read looks like the country is modernizing very fast and catching up with western europe , and tallinn looks a very nice city . 
  your ghettos look better than many residential areas here . 
   about the way people see the world , religion , work , politics , morals ... etc. 
  i agree but those are individual choices that do n't depend on nationality or ethnicity . 
  you could probably find that you have more in common with someone from the other side of the world who shares your mentality and political beliefs than with your neighbours or the people you 've grown up with . 
  i disagree with the other posters , the town of venice is quite liberal compared to the rest of the country and up until now has always had a centre-left government . 
  it 's the countryside that is conservative . 
  the venetian separatist movement is almost non-existant , the indipendentist candidate got like 3 % of the votes in the latest regional elections . 
  the problem with the daily mail is not that it 's right-wing , is that it 's sensasionalist low quality journalism . 
  the telegraph , for example , has a conservative slant but it 's a way more reputable news source in my opinion .

  or , you know , just drop dead . 
  we do n't really have ghettos , luckily . 
  and i 'm quite sure living in italy is much better than living in most african countries , nowadays notwithstanding . 
  it 's like people forgot what eu already told scotland back in the referendum days : if they secedes from a eu country , they 'll have to apply for eu membership from scratch, 
  actually , i think they do n't need the permission of the parliament , as may did unilaterally told euratom they 'd leave with the article50 letter . 
  which means they 'll automatically leave euratom no matter what . 
  also , given uk is a kingdom i 'd say the crown moving their royal undersides to fix the fuck ups of the parliament would be perfectly in line with the nature of the kingdom . 
  dunno , i 've read the law directly . 
  yeah , except the law explicitly states it 's only for children of legally here foreigners . 
  so , not `` anyone '' -, 
  not necessarily . 
  a planned exit , after years spent preparing the alternatives to the eu laws and institutions , plans for the post-exit trades and political agreements with eu , etc , etc could end in short-term economical harm but longer-term greater benefits . 
  basically , it would just require everything uk did n't do . 
   for example , it 's not clear if we 're going to ask to stay in euratom after all . 
  uk explicitly asked to exit euratom alongside exiting the eu . 
  so , yeah . 
  good bye euratom for you . 
  no , it 's not . 
  please educ * notices flag * ... no matter . 
  which would surely result in asking the eujc which would , imho , tell it can be reversed \\ nullified with an unanimous vote of the eu28-1 . 
  which uk would be extremely unlikely to get unless they basically beg on their knee promising to forfeit their special-snowflake status, 
   this could take a while yeah , which is why it was supposed to be the first point on the list . 
  so much wasted time . 
  killing yourself faster than the light-deprivation ? 
  ours is healthy, 
  because it is . 
  for honest ngos , this code of conducts means next to no change whatsoever to their operations , except for the `` judicial police officers '' aka coastal guard who do n't have any power on a foreign-fagged ship in international waters . 
  their main role would end up basically being witnesses should anything happen . 
  like , making sure the ngo which received a help request did at least tried to communicate with the libyan authorities to determinate if there was the need for them to help ( because , say , the nearest libyan ship was more far away than them ) it 's mostly to curb on the spot any less-than-savoury idea some might have to use ngos as a taxi service . 
  i frankly do n't understand why some ngos , especially the bigger ones who already are likely to do all of this themselves , would have any problem with this code of conduct . 
  which would be perfectly fine : `` sorry eu , our politicians lied to us . 
  we do n't want be part of a political union , only a common market . 
  let 's now discuss the best method to conclude our unfortunate political partnership so to make a new and better for both market-only agreement . '', 
  this is what , more or less , everybody was expecting uk to do ( minus , maybe , blaming their politicians ) . 
   i do n't see who in the eu would want to give it a worse deal than norway : norway . 
  there is also the fact uk did actively and , most important , publicly undermined and insulted eu as well as looking like they are untrustworthy partners . 
  you do n't get the same benefits of those who has been putting efforts in being honest trading partners . 
  it does n't look good for those coming after : `` look , we can take everything good , get away when we do n't want to pay our share and still getting a good deal ! '' . 
  and those honest partners would not like being put on the same as them . 
  therefore , while hardly anything `` punitive '' , they will not get a deal as good as others, 
  it 's also worth of note that the agreements with switzerland are basically the `` guide to what not to do '' because it 's a complete wild mess of a jungle of treaties , legislation etc. 
  it 's quite likely that , at some point in the future , eu and switzerland will negotiate a new all-comprehensive agreement which will be probably technically worse than the current one but so much simpler it will be seen as an improvement . 
  and it will be better than whatever uk will get , as switzerland governments acted as reasonable , responsible adults most of the time ( some bullshit once in a while happens to everybody , uk really put effort in exceed the bullshit level ), 
  yep . 
  in every high school you get to study at very least the inferno part . 
  one page of commedia , three pages of explanations of references . 
  the map lacks vatican city, 
  now imagine having to study it all at school . 
  footnotes included . 
  uk is the one asking in first place . 
  so it 's up to them . 
   pizza with pineapple [ ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqlbwogt8em ), 
  which , again , nobody really wants . 
  at least until the actual effect of brexit will be seen . 
  i always seen the whole `` bill + citizens ( + irish border ) '' as a `` proof of willingness '' . 
  like it 's useless to talk about trade with people who do n't pay their bills and do n't care about the well-being of the citizens . 
  an implicit `` those are the starting topics , once we 've made some reasonable progress on those we can begin to expand the conversation to others '' for switzerland , i was just listing another `` abormal deal '' which likely taught eu to not repeat such thing . 
  for the same reason we have written laws about not killing , stealing , etc. . . 
   so ... law needs updating , closing that loophole . 
  basically impossible . 
  it would require ships to discriminate between helping people from a sinking ship and ... helping people from a sinking ship . 
  until one rescues them , it 's impossible to actually know who they are . 
   ( by `` handle '' , yes i 'm talking about ethnic cleansing . 
  superfluous and both time - and resource-hogging . 
  armed pacification of countries actively not doing their job would be more than enough . 
   what happens if you do n't lol ? 
  your own laws decrees you are forced to do it , so there is n't much to do except withdraw from the echr which nobody wants, 
  when you joined the eu , you did agree to play by the eu rules . 
  if you do n't agree on some rules , there are various methods a country can employ to change them , if they can . 
  nobody 's forcing to stay . 
   either that sentence is filled with shit or the eu commission is planning on giving all turkish citizens freedom of movement before 2019 or , and this is more likely , they did learn from the deals with switzerland and turkey and uk itself and they decided on this for new deals . 
   because that 's what i 'm reading right here you are reading wrong . 
  he 's saying `` move your ass with the withdrawal part so we can talk about the actual post-brexit deal '', 
  makes sense, 
   house prices fell 1 % mom , again the consensus was an increase . 
   should n't that be a good thing in uk right now ? 
  ue has been trying to convince uk to not do it , but did n't did anything to stop them . 
   people knew what they were voting for . 
  i would n't bet on it . 
   you have interpreted the idea of britain being subject to the same conditions , but legally out of the eu , as a win . 
  not a win , a `` least loss '', 
   because of the conditions we were subject to within the eu , which one ? 
  all of them ? 
  some of them ? 
  can you honestly state most leavers did actually know what were those conditions ? 
  we generally eat a lot of meat , but in small amounts . 
  if you are n't eating a steak you are eating cured meat in some dish , and if not you are going to eat some souce with meat in it . 
  no , no , the voters voted to get out of the eu . 
  ask ten , you 'll get eleven different reasons . 
  so , as long as the uk is outside the eu there is not betrayal of the voters . 
  unless you mean they all voted to improve the economical situation . 
  then the brexit has been a betrayal because it 's bound to make it worse . 
  no , you will have worse conditions . 
  eu is simply not going to let you having an even just similar deal than before , which was an absurdly good deal compared to everybody else except , maybe , swizerland . 
  and nobody wants another switzerland-type deal , not even switzerland . 
  yes , that 's why we must at least try to be better . 
   pick them up , give them food and shelter and return all of them from where they came . 
   sure , if one ignores libya is in a state of war ( constitution basically makes impossible to send people back in war zones ) then the only thing we need if for libya to accept those people back . 
  all of them . 
  you have to cross yourselves out , so do n't worry about that .

wait . 
  the us does n't have legal abortion ? 
  what the fuck ?

  numbers are wrong , italians speak 2 languages ? 
  it 's more likely that 1.9 % of the italians speak english, 
  holy shit . 
  first of all , i live in den haag , not amsterdam . 
  do n't assume things about random people on the internet unless you 're sure you 're lying to yourself if you seriously believe that dutch people do n't speak english . 
  i do n't know dutch ( yet , i 'm learning it ) and i literally have 0 problems , i legitimately never encountered someone that can not at least do a basic conversation in english . 
  even the friendly grandma managed to spurt a `` oh ok . . it 's very hot today , are n't you hot ? '', 
  when she saw me yesterday with black long jeans and white shirt at the tram station in bierkade , after trying to talk in dutch  retty sure 99 % of ethnic dutch ( about 80 % according to wikpedia ) speak just dutch and ugly accented english hahahahahhahahahahahha . 
  just not true . 
  have plenty of dutch friends ( before you start shouting shit , i do n't have any italian friend here apart from my best one that made me come here ) , and they all speak english . 
  and no , they 're not redditors nor gamers . 
  they 're normal people with all kinds of education , from vmbo to bachelors . 
  also , as a non native english speaker it 's far easier to understand swedish / dutch / danish / finnish people speaking english than real englishmen , it sounds ugly to you because you can recognize dutch accent . 
  it literally happens 20 times per day when people talk to me in dutch , i asnwer with an `` excuse me , i do n't speak dutch very well '' and then we keep talking about whatever the fuck we had to talk about . 
  i never had an episode of someone cutting the conversation because they do n't know english . 
  are there people that do n't know english ? 
  i 'm sure of it . 
  the turkish lady near my house does n't . 
  also something must be wrong with your brain , considering all the insults that you managed to make after one `` are you high ? '' .

  there 's a difference between opinions and facts . 
  europe is not under martial law , and there is n't a mass murder of europeans going on . 
  you can say that terrorists attacks are n't gon na decrease because muslims do n't want to integrate ( and would n't agree with you ) and we can debate about it . 
  disregarding facts and statistics is just dumb . 
  it 's the same when people say us is n't the strongest economy in the world .

  but it doesnt fit what trump told you !, 
  did he * lie * to you ? 
  europe is n't getting bred out nor killed nor anything else ? 
  in fact we 're mostly fine ?? 
  we can count our terrorists attacks in the last years on our hands ( and it should be 0 ) , i wonder if you can do the same with mass shootings . 
  time to kick out every ~ ~ american gun owner ~ ~ muslim i guess . 
   jesus lord almighty , rise from your knees , europe . 
  stop giving in to the false song of globalism . 
  i 'm so sorry to watch you all surrender your civilization and the progress that you 've made in the last thousand years . 
  it 's so sad . 
  jesus is out of fashion here in eu , we only have allahu / s edit : also i 'm sure that you 've never seen a muslim a moroccan or a syrian in your life . 
  stupid uneducated fucks edit2 grammar, 
  i did !, 
  in nl right ( not to be a pot head btw i know the stereotype ) i really trust merkel and macron , the fact that he got elected with sucha big % gave me a bit of hope . 
  also the fact that m5s is losing a tiny bit of ground in italy, 
  i should specify that i am from southern italy , the situation is completely different in the north, 
  i cant say the same for italy , but i 'm pretty optistimic about europe in general . 
  when you move you 'll realize how bad italy is . 
  it 's not even comparable in any way, 
  i agree . 
  the problem is that a good % of millennials are expatriating . 
  if the good brains get out it 's gon na be a big problem . 
  i 'm really worried, 
  it will get worse . 
  the younger population in their 20 's are all getting the fuck out of here . 
  literally in masses . 
  there 's an exodus to nl and germany, 
  it 's a us thing . 
  we do n't go by race but by nationality ( apart from the old farts and the uneducated ), 
  i do n't know why either actually , i do n't think i really want to know, 
  amsterdam is a nightmare . 
  tried to move there but i just could n't stand it ( in den haag rn ), 
  god i smoke once a month ( maybe ) and this makes me feel like a pothead :(, 
  is it really frowned upon ? 
  did n't know that . 
  i guess that 's why my dutch friends never smoke or talk about it ( i 'm in den haag ), 
  and ford fiesta edit : til i do n't know shit about cars,

  most foreigners from poor backgrounds do get into ghettos and create their micro cosmos where they maintain their own traditions and culture without properly accepting the ones of the country that is hosting them . 
  being born from a couple where at least one parent is italian is one thing , it is another if both parents come from a different nation as children get a lot of their beliefs and values from them . 
  a kid born in britain from a very religious couple coming from the middle east , living in an area inhabited only by like-minded middle eastern individuals who is sent to a muslim school will not become your average british citizen but rather a stranger to british culture . 
  does it make sense to give him british citizenship even though he holds none of the typical british values and is more attached to hi country of origin that to the country which provides all services to him and that has accepted his parents ? 
  the kid of a middle eastern couple open to integration who live in a culturally diverse area who goes to school with british kids will likely grow up to be british through and through and therefore should be guaranteed citizenship without question . 
   you did n't answer my question though . 
  i do n't like most pop music in the uk , i do n't like a majority of the popular tv shows . 
  at what point do you draw the line ? 
  i am not saying we all must be clones following a perfect outline of say britishness or italianness , of course that would be absurd . 
  however , things like knowing the language , respecting the authorities , respecting certain liberal principles upon which the nation is built and so on are things that should be required . 
   is born in and lives their entire life in or is born by foreign parents . 
   i 'd like to move to france soon but my spoken french is very poor . 
  does that mean i should n't be allowed to ? 
  do you want french citizenship and access to french welfare ? 
  if yes you should not be allowed to get citizenship unless you intend to learn the language and to integrate . 
   the idea that countries should have one universal culture and kick out anyone who does n't match up is ludicrous if you want to reap the benefit of a country 's economy you should be willing to integrate with the local culture . 
  i am talking about any foreigner who comes into a country and refuses to behave and integrate . 
  he might be muslim , jewish , catholic , buddhist atheist , white , black , brown , or green for all i care , if he/she/it refuses to integrate he should not be allowed to stay . 
  where did i mention religion exactly ? 
  can you please point out in which comment in this discussion i mentioned religion ? 
  because i did not and you are talking out of your arse . 
  because expecting foreigners to integrate is anti muslim , k . if they do not integrate they have no right to stay . 
  a kid born in italy by foreigners is a foreigner , once he reaches 18 years of age he can apply for citizenship as any other foreigner . 
  change the law . 
  then they should rethink the way they award citizenship to people who are raised in ghettos . 
  asking for people to integrate is stupid ? 
  if one is not willing to adapt to a nation 's customs and language he should go . 
  it 's not like they could do anything about it . 
  4 years of nothing , that 's the proof , if they had proof it would not take them so long to even start prosecuting them and be done with it . 
   what ? 
  fishermen are free to move in waters . 
  the marines are supposed to shoot only after provocation . 
  this is international law . 
  there was no provocation from the fishermen and no warning shots . 
  you 're deluded if you think this is acceptable by international law . 
  the nia has charged them with murder after an investigation . 
  they did provoke the marines and the charges are laughable at best . 
  they have been detained since 2012 , four years , and the indian government is yet to provide proof of anything they claim , after four years ... 
  it happened in international waters , they are being detained illegally . 
  i think fishermen who move toward a ship that is being escorted by marines to protect against piracy regardless of warning shots are not exactly innocent nor poor victims . 
  the indian government is still to prove any of their claims after years of detaining the two marines , either the indian government is utterly incompetent or it does not have a strong case . 
  either way the two should be freed and tried in italy under fair circumstances . 
  what ? 
  this is utterly false , they are only regarded as murderers by left-wing circlejerks . 
  there is no evidence they committed a crime , they should not be tried nor held in india as the incident took place in international waters and they acted well within the boundaries of the law . 
  edit : by the way , did you make a new account just to troll ? 
  i am not supporting the view i am just pointing out you misinterpreted his words . 
  an actual effort to protect european borders and european identity could result in a more united europe . 
  no , he is saying that a lack of masculinity is what causes men to be abused , he is not saying that it is a justification for the abuser to abuse . 
  true , but it does not change the fact that your previous statement is incorrect ( unless you referred to hitler and not austria ) . 
  what are you on about ? 
  when hitler was born the austro-hungaric empire was still up and running . 
  i know you guys are hiding * terra irredenta * somewhere !, 
  / s jokes aside , i know a couple of austrians , they are like germans but ... better actually , yeah less smug i 'd say . 
  usually we associate to austria the same traits and stereotypes we associate with germany , only the good ones though , no nazi jokes for you . 
  the first thing that comes to mind when thinking of austria is history , the 19th century to be precise , especially italian independence :p, 
  ok , lets remove churchill 's statues around britain , he was notoriously racist and often spoke positively of fascism before the war , likewise we should remove from washington all the statues of founding fathers that owned slaves . 
  but why stop here ? 
  let 's destroy every monument to any king that took part in the crusades , let 's destroy all buildings and infrastructure built by imperialist powers with money they got from colonies and let 's revise the whole of human history so it is less offensive . 
  only if they were white though , you would not want to discriminate the rich cultures of others . 
  they could have stopped anywhere in between turkey and denmark . 
   but those immigrants , also woman and children could n't live in their homecountry any more . 
  some of them can not , the others , most in fact , are economic migrants . 
  enough with this fairy tale of the poor migrants fleeing from certain death , it 's a myth , only a minority flees war . 
  tell me again , why do some people want turkey to join the eu ? 
  they burnt cars , damaged shops and private property , they injured a few cops . 
   what was the population of france at the time man ? 
  of italy ? 
   no seriously , how is 1.6-1 .7 million people over 38 years comparable to 1 million in one year with many more to come . 
  is that supposed to be an answer ? 
  last time i checked population increases over time , and having occurred over a ** 38 ** year period it had surely less of an impact than the migration of millions of middle eastern and north african men would have on europe today . 
   did you miss the part where we lynched italian workers one instance . 
  one . 
  oh maybe there were a few more accidents , so what ? 
  did that prevent italians from integrating ? 
  did we commit terrorist attacks killing hundreds of french citizens on multiple occasions ? 
  anyway , nice way of skewing away from addressing the topic of uncontrolled immigration in europe today by talking about unrelated past events and by making absurd comparisons . 
   yup . 
  for example the flux of italian immigrants between 1876-1914 is estimated at 1.6-1 .7 million people . 
  when france had a population of 40 million . 
  so imagine the syrian crisis only 4 times as worse . 
  ok , aside the fact that you are diverting the discussion , are you a moron ? 
  no seriously , how is 1.6-1 .7 million people over 38 years comparable to 1 million in one year with many more to come ? 
  counting that france and italy share a common religion , a border and have a similar culture ? 
   whom should i blame ? 
  you guys voted for mussolini . 
  look at how beautiful scores he made sure , let 's ignore that women were not allowed to vote , let 's ignore violence and political repression along with murders and intimidation . 
   is n't what germany is currently trying a more moderate approach ? 
  the refugees welcome rhetoric is already getting replaced by one trying to contain the number . 
  honestly moderate is one word i certainly would use to describe the german government . 
  arguably a bit late for that , better than nothing , sure , but before things will get moving i am afraid the situation will worsen . 
  anyway , i hope thing will change swiftly . 
   yes that is absolutely true but we accepted international obligations when our states signed the geneva conventions . 
  that does n't mean we have to take everyone from all the world but it means that if someone comes to a european country with a legitimate claim to asylum we have to grant it . 
  indeed , but there are better ways to do it and ways to avoid getting unnecessary amounts of economic migrants along with refugees . 
  we could pick them up from camps and checking their background and their eligibility for refugee status prior to allowing them in . 
  also we should actively prevent traffickers to ship migrants across the mediterranean . 
   i totally agree on that and gladly that is not happening . 
  are we not getting a majority of young male immigrants from the middle east and north africa ? 
  and has the german government not admitted that many of them are not qualified to work or integrate in the foreseeable future ?

  at this rate we will be bringing them in as soon as they get their feet wet , while getting on the boats . 
  i m pretty sure that getting some sweet tourist moneyz isnt that bad though . 
  maybe the swedes are already very healthy and every piece of machinery works just fine . 
  alan partridge : `` one of the benefits of global warming and international terrorism is that more people are holidaying in england . '', 
  heart disease kills more people than car crashes , who cares about car crashes , amirite ? 
  even though i think the situation you 're describing is a bit too much , i agree that the situation around gare du nord is the emblem of a `` fuck it , there 's nothing we can do anymore '' mentality . 
  i have visited paris a lot of times and i love it but last year i needed to take the train to london so i booked a hotel near gare du nord . 
  what an awful situation . 
  basically in europe it goes like this : people vote for the left ? 
  `` i applaud the maturity of people ! '', 
  people vote for anything that 's not the left ? 
  but . . but ... they 're holding cute drawings and stuff ... 
  just to clarify : i m not implying that sweden is a soviet shithole . 
  on the contrary , give how far ahead you guys are i was surprised that this kind of ugly appartment blocks actually exists there . 
  wow . 
  this think looks like the cities i build when i play tropico and i opt for the cheapest , ugly , soviet-like apartment blocks . 
  according to the italian newspaper la stampa they 're tunisians . 
  \u0391ccording to the newspaper la stampa they were tunisians , pissed off because they 'll be returned to their country . 
  and let 's not even count the nigerials , senegalese etc etc. 
  no i wasnt . 
  it 's probably the post traumatic shock that makes them refuse identification , right ? 
  and the only cure is free moneyz . 
  ofc it is farfetched . 
  the same way , someone who says that is escaping from war , famine and who knows what else and complains about the shelter or the food is a bit suspicious . 
  sorry , i always forget to put the / s :d, 
  it 's clearly a pic that was photoshopped by far-right extremists . 
  no , i wont live in a camp because whenever i went to another place i had valid paper . 
  they come illegaly , dont want to get identified and you expect us to do what , send them to tuscany for romantic weekends ? 
  it 's only until we clean up some palaces and move them there . 
  i m not a native italian by the way but i have been living here for the past 20 years so i consider myself at least part-italian  edit : they could be pulesi . . or pulani . 
  edit2 : google says pulesi . 
  even if there are n't any gypsies involved people automatically connect romanians with crime , drinking etc. 
  granted , we have a lot of romanian immigrants who do exactly that but the big part of the romanian comunity is just people trying to make a living , working hard and trying to be part of the local comunity too ( you cant say the same about , let 's say , the chinese ) . 
  you could say that about everyone in the balkans ( i 'm greek by the way , dont let the flag fool you ) and their shitty balkan mentality . 
  am i right ? 
  huh ? 
  huh ? 
  arent things a bit better for you guys nowadays ? 
  romanian comunities are big and common in major cities , everyone has romanian people he knows and certainly people dont think automatically for every single romanian that he 's gon na steal their wallet . 
  i 'm not saying that the negative bias hasnt disappeared but things are changing . 
  having said that , for fuck sake , enough with the fuckin manele . 
  he did the right thing . 
  immature people might think that the guy stabbing people while yelling allah akbar was a muslim and , you know , discriminate him . 
  wait , i forgot the / s. 
  nah , there are thousands of job opportunities for illegal illiterate africans . 
  we have still many supermarkets without an african beggar at the door , shaking a paper cup . 
  i saw the guy 's video here on reddit , it was hilarious . 
  here it is : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=syslezhbpus, 
  in that case i will be waiting for the `` in communist norway . . '' jokes . 
  now that i think about it , if there 's a proletarian revolution maybe prices in norway will become a bit more reasonable and i 'll finally be able to visit you guys !, 
  by all means , keep spending then if you 're happy with it . 
  give them more so they start being middle class without actually having any qualification and then be surprised when people who actually have to work for a living get tired of these handouts . 
  on the other hand norway is rich , maybe you guys are just cool with all this . 
  other countries arent , so they might understandably start getting a bit pissed off after they realize that affordable housing , free healthcare and free education is producing this kind of behaviour . 
  my girlfriend is romanian . 
  the easiest way to piss her off is to imply that gypsies are romanian . 
  she gets so angry she starts trembling , she cant even pickpocket people on the bus . 
  they have things in common , right ? 
  for example , in many cases collecting an std or a pokemon involves going to a public park . 
  i think it was denmark . 
  weird . 
  every neapolitan i know never stops saying `` toledo station , the most beautiful there is , toledo station , best in europe , have i told you about the toledo station ? 
  thing is those countries will tell you `` hey , why are you dumping them here , they didnt leave from our coasts '' and will not accept them . 
  that 's the major problem . 
  there 's a crisis going on , we ca n't afford parachutes . 
  the guy wasnt killed by a death squad while he was feeding baby deer . 
  it would have been a nice sign to say those things to who ? 
  his fanatic pals would always consider him a hero who killed infidels , even if he spent the rest of his life in prison making toys for kids . 
  the rest of us already consider him a criminal . 
  yeah , i dont have doubts about it . 
  they 're saying that he reached torino ( via chambery ) and then took the train to milan . 
  what would that change ? 
  he 'd get quite a few years in jail ( paid by your tax money ) and he would have all the time in the world to radicalize other people . 
  good . 
  one figlio di puttana down . 
  where would you have gone ? 
  i know , i know , it 's a pretty common problem in italy ... we keep them all . . 
  you cant send moroccans and algerians back !, 
  there 's war where they came from !, 
  throw in some ironing as well and call it `` perfect wife competition '' just to piss of the feminists . 
  bulgarian probably . 
  uuuh ... for the time being more cancerous cells are being injected in the body , hoping that the tumour will eventually become gentle and caring and will turn himself into a useful organ . 
  there have been similar incidents in greece with immigrants groping women during the new year 's eve celebration . 
  there 's usually a big concert in omonoia square in athens where people gather for some free entertainment and in those instances there were videos of women getting surrounded and molested by immigrants . 
  basically , for a big chunck of people , immigrants are just huge pile of cash . 
  you onle have to see who runs the `` cooperative '' to get an idea . 
  lying about anything in order to claim benefits makes a person horrible and a parasite . 
  it 's valid for the refugees the same way it 's valid for a 40 year old sicilian who lies about being blind in order to get a disability pension . 
  well , maybe more prisons will be built and more people will be hired as prison guards etc. 
  refugees are a gift for the economy i tell ya !, 
  but if we do how will 25 year old nigerians reach the free-for-all european buffet ? 
  you must be extremely fast . 
  seriously ?? 
  how long did that take you ? 
  well , at this point we 're a third world country , it makes sense that out twat pm would join other third world leaders in praising a dead dictator . 
  i come from a tiny town in greece ( for greek standards it 's a town , here it would be a village ) . 
  there were very very few things to do there unless you wanted to spend the entire day sitting at the bar , lazily drinking a frapp\u00e8 . 
  when i came here to study i was amazed of the possibilities i had ( bookstores !, 
  museums !, 
  stadiums !,

  after all , we are on reddit . 
  haters will say it 's photoshop . 
  except khan was voted before the terrorist attacks happened in 2017 . 
  and the last significant islamist attack in london was in 2015 . 
  and khan has been in politics since the early noughties . 
   his whole appointment is a sign of european defeatism , tells the muslims that if they create enough friction they can expect more political power . 
  the waldo moment can be summarised in `` what if beppe grillo was a blue bear ? '', 
  they discovered that their flag was identical to that of haiti during the berlin olympics . 
  after that , liechtenstein put the crown on their flag . 
  `` i 'm not so important '' he seems a cool guy . 
  is that a hot dog ? 
  and . . ? 
  the islamists are sitting there beating their dicks to some midget porn , when they suddenly realize that it would be nice to bang some virgins , so they grab their knifes , and go absolutely haram . 
  yeah , evil government that regulates things so we do n't die in crash accidents or by food poisoning !, 
  literally hitler !, 
  rome is for many ways stuck in the 70s . 
  yep , we were quite late in women 's rights . 
  btw , the referendum was the first time women were allowed to vote . 
  pomodoro ( tomato ) means golden apple . 
  nero is back in town, 
  well , i guess the population will grow unless something really horrible happens , but i think the most worrisome country is nigeria , especially with the threat of climate change . 
  people are also shitting on actual refugees saying they are rapists or undercover terrorists . 
  somalia ... overpopulated ? 
  the people do n't seem to like him . 
  afghanistan has jungle fever . 
   most stories involve a franco-canadian alliance against the usa , but psychologist simon williams warns not to read too much political background in the tales of frantic lovemaking at international summits . 
  you know , i 'm pretty sure people do n't read slash fics mainly because of the political commentary of the author on the world . 
  even if said fanfiction involves two world leaders . 
  yep , same thing for apartheid government and colonialist forces . 
  why the fuck did i watch this before going to sleep ? 
  great meme war ?

  it is . 
  europe 's fate changed dramatically ? 
  costantinople `` fall '' was just a matter of time . 
   mother rome a cheap imitation, 
  lost ? 
  costantinople in 1453 was just a shadow of its former self , it was depopulated and crumbling . 
  if it 's still relevant is because the ottomans made it their capital . 
  nice uniforms :d, 
  and that , kids , is why you should always lock the doors !, 
  you already stole some of the decor during napoleonic era . 
  context ? 
  when time comes ? 
  yeah , but they were filthy altaic unthermenschen !, 
  scots have a different culture than english , to be fair . 
  it 's scary that a lot of people wo n't care because they were muslims . 
  can you point a `` post-modernist '' ( is this a new buzzword ? ), 
  that said so ? 
  tnx, 
  people should n't blindly support a country just because it alligns with our goals . 
  we should always denounce wrongdoing . 
  wow , the guy is really a sack of shit . 
  edit : i 'd put a nsfw next to the link of that cartoon . 
  ah , in that sense then maybe they are like the relics in european churches . 
   swords and staffs and such , of david , saul , moses , joshua well , those guys are considered prophets in islam, 
  you realize that most of the commenters do n't really support his stance ? 
  less than half of the voters voted for trump . 
  and the turnout was incredibly low . 
  i could be wrong , but looks like kurds in turkey are very conservative . 
  not really surprising if you come in rome . 
  they are nice chaps , tho . 
  who are they ? 
  the m5s ( 5 stars movement ) has a lot of anti-vaxxers among their ranks . 
  sardinian is officially considered a different language and is protected by the law , just like german , friulan , albanian , greek etc etc. 
  yeah , because nato will totally leave that sweet strategic locations . 
  and i do n't think alienating turkey is the best idea . 
  i 've come to greece and i loved lamb gyro !, 
  lamb gyros is better . 
  so gyros are made from pig-fish hybrids beaten with a huge dildo ? 
  the guy is probably a troll . 
  their post history screams satire . 
  thank god we have the famous islamologist / u/acidpeace that have enlightened us !, 
  historical people stop being people and become symbols . 
  take genghis khan for example : did he murder , rape and pillage an entire continent ? 
  yes . 
  he is the main reason we know a country named mongolia exists ? 
  also yes , so i get why the people of mongolia are proud of him . 
  same thing for a guy like stalin : in the eye of russians he is the man who won the great patriotic war and elevated ussr at the rank of great power . 
  also , churchill at his worse was still better than hitler . 
  in rome , colosseum/vatican city . 
  vienna , budapest and prague were all under austrian empire . 
  ah , you have seen berlusconi 's new political program too !, 
  or you could be kidnapped and forced to fight : the von wallenstain method . 
  really ? 
  man , that 's awful . 
  sure , but i think that even if germany won ww1 soviet union would still have been a thing . 
  the russian revolution was literally fueled by germany . 
  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/war_crimes_of_the_wehrmacht#rapes_2 here you are , i did n't want to link it because i ` mon mobile . 
  according to some estimations , wehrmacht raped something like 10.000.000 women in urss . 
  well , japanese government still denies their war crimes . 
  german and japanese athrocities were much worse than all the allies combined . 
  they actively encouraged their soldiers to commit war crimes . 
  edit : we also committed our fair share of war crimes . 
  human nature is communitarian at its core . 
  i 'm sure this thread will be level headed and rational .

  there are also provincial and municipal police forces that for the most part do things like traffic violations , working public events , but in the larger cities they have a more enhanced role . 
  1 ) if you work for the `` polizia di stato '' you wo n't be shifted around . 
  since the `` carabinieri '' are technically an arm of the military , they can be moved around and even sent abroad . 
  i think that there is a less personal relationship between the police and the community , but you have to understand that the country is much more densely populated . 
  the idea of a sheriff and deputy for a rural county in montana that knows everybody 's name is n't possible . 
  i like it better personally because i feel that the forces are more organized and have more accountability . 
  the highest authority for the nypd is the mayor of new york , whereas the highest authority for our police is a cabinet-level minister . 
  it also sets a standard for the level of policing . 
  you 're going to get the same thing in milan as you will in the middle of rural basilicata . 
  2 ) yes for the most part . 
  like i said , i feel that they are more organized , and more accountable . 
  i think that it is a more respected position here than it is there . 
  i have always had positive interactions . 
  if you are respectful to them , they are respectful to you . 
  since gun-ownership is n't nearly as common , police have less of a reason to be fearful/suspicious . 
  3 ) not particularly . 
  we do n't have the same anti-government tradition that the us has . 
  we are n't inherently skeptical in that way . 
  there is a lot of overlap between the two national forces , but not between the national forces and the regional ones . 
   would sacrifice everything we have economically well i 'm glad you 're prepared to do this because it 's what it 's going to come to . 
  oh , hahaha , well then i apologize then . 
  so was your original comment a satirized version of the press narrative or was that honest ? 
  is it exaggerated ? 
  obviously . 
  is it any less exaggerated than your version ? 
  nope . 
  but you guys insist that the eu are bullies and you are innocent little victims . 
  well now you can see it from the other perspective and understand why everybody here and in the eu is sick and tired of putting up with the uk 's bullshit . 
  no other eu country has anything even close to the level of self-importance that the uk has . 
  yeah but many industries are covered , we 're not the only country that operates this way , so does austria i believe , and probably others . 
  i meant does any country not have anything, 
  are there eu countries without a minimum wage ? 
  consumers in the eu 27 : 440 million consumers in nz : 4.5 million consumers in australia : 23 million consumers in the us : 320 million consumers in nz+aus+us : roughly 350 million that 's still a smaller combined market , and the eu is in progress with a deal with the us . 
  and all of these will take years for the uk to sign especially given that before brexit they had n't had trade negotiators in 40 years . 
  and it also requires negotiating with trump . 
  by the way , this does n't even include all of the other free trade agreements that the uk currently has access to as a member of the eu , nor any of the ones that are currently being negotiated . 
  so yes , you 're right , there is no winner because the eu is losing 290 billion pounds in exports . 
  but the eu is only losing 8-17 % of its exports market while the uk is losing 44 % . 
  the uk exports 8 % of its gdp to the eu . 
  the eu-27 export 2 % of their gdp to the uk . 
  there are no winners to this scenario , but i think it 's pretty clear who the bigger loser is . 
  the height of british exceptionalism . 
  i do n't remember who said it in a thread on this sub yesterday and i 'm too lazy to search for it , but somebody said something along the lines of `` the british do n't want to just be an equal part of a 28 nation bloc , they want to be recognized as equal to the other 27 nations combined . 
  of course this is an overgeneralization and oversimplification , but it seems like there is some truth to it . 
  the british see themselves as too good to be part of a union with continental europe . 
  well i think you 're all in for a rude awakening because the uk on its own does n't have the economic or geopolitical clout moving forward to retain a position as a great power . 
  here is a more accurate depiction : uk : can we join ? 
  de gaulle : no . 
  we do n't want american influence and you guys are to different ideologically . 
  uk : seriously dickhead ? 
  we literally saved you from actual nazis de gaulle : wow , you guys really do think highly of yourselves . 
  eu amongst themselves : what assholes those islanders uk : phew what a looney . 
  anyway , can we join when he fucks off eu : fine uk : i ca n't help but notice we think we 're paying too much because we 're special and we should be paying less than everybody else . 
  eu : fine , you can have 1/3rd of the extra back . 
  uk : can we rush to a single market in services and expand into eastern europe ? 
  eu : that 's going to take a while . 
  we 're integrating as fast as we can , but services takes longer to integrate . 
  maybe you guys should stop being roadblocks to every integration attempt . 
  eu : we want to create a single currency so that we can enhance integration and trade uk : no , we do n't want to have anything to do with that because we do n't trust you . 
  eu : we want to have uniform workers rights among the single market uk : no we do n't want to have anything to do with that because you guys are lazy fucks . 
  eu : we want to create a border-free zone to more easily enable free trade uk : no , we are too cool for that . 
  cameron : hey guys , i know that this is kind of annoying , but my party is having an internal split , and i told them i would get us a better deal within the eu . 
  eu : you know that this is a 28 member bloc and you are n't the only ones that matter right ? 
  cameron : yeah , but our voters do n't realise this . 
  eu : okay , fine , here are some concessions , but you have to respect the most basic and fundamental rules of the organization . 
  uk : we want to leave uk 3 hours later : wait what did we just decide to leave uk 5 hours later : wait , no we don `` t know what we 're doing eu : so you guys said you wanted to leave , what 's going on with that ? 
  uk : we do n't know what we want yet . 
  you see , you 're a really important trading partner with us but we do n't want any of the downsides that come with being members here . 
  we really just want to trade with you but our people do n't want immigration . 
  eu : okay , well can you hurry up and decide cause this uncertainty is killing us ? 
  uk : stop being mean to us , you 're such bullies . 
  give us what we want or we 'll destroy you . 
  the uk gov and british press have already done this . 
   i would say that an fta gives access to the single market under the terms of the fta . 
  it is not the same as membership of the single market . 
  this is what i meant , just in slightly different words . 
   `` canada has no access to the single market '' strikes me as simply wrong from a linguistic standpoint . 
  you 're right , but my understanding of how people tend to use this language is that membership of the single market = unfettered access to the single market = access to the single market, 
  okay , i was under the impression that the leave campaign insisted that this was possible . 
  but we both recognize that that 's impossible and a pipe dream . 
  you 're much more reasonable than most people on here . 
  okay , that makes sense . 
  but did n't boris johnson and others insist that post brexit the uk would still have `` access to the single market '' i.e. 
  unfettered access to trade with the eu without having to accept the costs i.e. 
  but that 's not a penalty . 
  a penalty is deliberately doing something unnecessary to attempt to screw over the uk , and the eu has n't indicated any intention on doing that . 
  the eu has basically said if you want to leave the club go ahead , but do n't expect any of the exclusive benefits that club members get . 
  that 's not punishment , that 's just common sense . 
  okay . 
  but an fta is n't the same thing as `` access to the single market . '', 
  i think we 're saying the same thing just harping on the very specific definitions of single words . 
  it 's a bit more complicated . 
   having a badge that makes all doors open automatically when you approach . 
  this is definitely a good description of access to the single market , but having an fta with the single market would be more like needing to request a key for each door , having to show proof of compliance to somebody every time you want to enter the door , only being allowed to carry certain things through the door and paying a fee whenever you use the door . 
  the single market is n't as easy as tariffs vs. no tariffs . 
  if that were the case then there would be no difference between ceta and being a member of the eu . 
  access to the single market means unfettered access for goods , services , capital , and people . 
  the best you can get without being a member or having deal like norway , switzerland , or iceland , is an fta which would remove tariffs and quotas but would keep all non-tariff burdens in the way of trade , and would not necessarily cover services and agricultural products , and would almost certainly not include passporting rights for british businesses . 
  there are key differences between fta with the single market and access to the single market . 
  the british wo n't get access to the single market without accepting fom .

  spain 's fine , the portuguese took latin and made a language with fucked up pronunciation , nordics are respected . 
  romania is gypsyland , albanians are violent , other balkan states we do n't really have an opinion on . 
  russians are generally liked , although come and buy up a lot of property and occupy fancy areas , which is a little frowned upon , but people like putin for some reason ( italy and russia have historically always been close ) . 
  there are n't any real rivalries ( at least from my perspective ) , like i see in other comments here , unless we 're talking about football . 
  i might just be ignorant though . 
  like i said , all i mentioned before pales in comparison to what we say about each other . 
  i 'm not sure what you 're asking ... if someone from a developing nation meets the immigration requirements and does n't break the law , then that person is eligible to move in , and probably will . 
  i do n't think people have a problem with that . 
  whether thats a * right * , well i suppose that depends on your definition of it . 
  if moving to a richer country means that the person 's basic human rights ( safety , food , water , shelter , basically the stuff in the un charter ) , then i guess so , but that is rarely the case . 
  the two main northern irish parties . 
  sinn fein is republican ( meaning they want a unified ireland ) and are more left wing . 
  the dup is unionist ( meaning they want n. ireland as part of the uk ) and is very right-wing . 
  you can see that they would n't get along . 
  very . 
  towns/provinces even have their own dialects which vary greatly , basically making them languages in their own rights . 
  then there 's the food , economies ( north/south being the most obvious split there ) and a myriad of varying local customs . 
  certain areas are more ` regionalistic ' than others , and while obviously the country is n't on the brink of civil war i think its safe to say italy is n't quite as unified as other countries are . 
  remember , italy only came into being in 1861 . 
  i guarantee you california uses way more ac than italy , and they have comparable climates . 
  compared to the us , yes . 
  obviously many homes have it , but often its just in the bedroom to keep it cool at night . 
  there was a pretty big heat wave in 2003 i think which convinced a lot of people to buy one . 
  however its a lot less necessary as houses here are built to stay cool during the summer . 
  they do n't elsewhere ? 
  thats different . 
  the italian states of old had a lot more in common than modern european states have today . 
  watch football and be at the appropriate level of decibels . 
  portugal and spain dont have the vatican within its borders though . 
  still , you do n't have to be religious to be prime minister . 
  i 've never heard renzi mention god . 
  gay marriage might take a while but itll happen soon i think . 
  in italy generally the more south you go the more important catholicism becomes . 
  however i would say that the most devout catholic here is not as religious as the most devout protestant in the us . 
  most people are ` passive ' catholics , meaning that they respect the church and its institutions and celebrate basic christian holidays while believing in god , they wo n't go to church on sundays or anything like that . 
  baptising your child is just seem as ` the thing to do ' . 
  not much thought is put into it , its more cultural than religious . 
  americans seem to exaggerate european hate speech laws to be honest . 
  only in extreme and blatant instances are they put into effect ( to my knowledge at least ), 
  isnt the tea party part of the republican party ? 
  and the us libertarian and green parties are n't major parties , lets be honest here . 
  then elect people who know their shit . 
  you had a chance with sanders . 
  my point is that puritanism has had a significant influence on american culture , while puritanism only existed briefly in england and no where else in europe . 
  french sometimes do to be fair . 
  makes sense , they 're only part barbarian . 
  i ca n't tell if you 're being serious or not . 
  did you not study puritan literature in school ? 
  even i did and i went to an international school . 
  read some puritan literature from the time and you 'll see major themes still lingering in american culture ( only when working is one truly living , wanting religion in government , `` in god we trust '' , trust no one , extreme individualism , etc ), 
  but it does work ... the rest of the 1st world is proof of that . 
  but anyway you 're missing the point . 
  in america it seems like every time a regulation or government program is formed , its perceived as totalitarian . 
  the only case in which it seems somewhat justified is policing but thats another matter . 
   nationalism is a bad example , americans are extremely paranoid about the government , so they 're `` nationalism '' is more patriotism `` we hate our government , but love our country . '', 
  come on , america is n't nationalistic ? 
  give me a break . 
   ( before you say trump telling people to do similar things , that is 1/3 of the party and that is a small fraction of the country . ), 
  so even if america at large was majority right wing , stuff like that in europe historically usually would n't happen . 
  we 're talking about the republican party no ? 
  so why ignore trump ( or cruz for that matter ) . 
  on borders , europe has a thing called the schengen agreement . 
  all countries ( which is n't every european country ) in this agreement basically have open borders with each other , which means no passports are needed . 
  however , britain is not part of schengen as it is an island . 
  however , it is part of the eu , which means that it does have to accept eu citizens ( they do need a passport in this case ) . 
  ukip , the party i mentioned before , want to leave the eu to `` take back control of their borders '' ( a slogan of theirs ) and reduce immigration . 
  when you say they want immigration to be legal well ... legality is dependent upon who 's in government . 
  you really think the gop will make legal requirements easier ? 
  in short , because countries here were n't founded on puritan principles . 
  on the topic of totalitarian dictators ... its because we know what totalitarianism actually looks like to know that having universal healthcare does n't mean the government is stripping away our rights somehow . 
  totalitarianism is a bit more than that . 
  besides , american government is big as well , just in different ways so that more americans do n't even realise . 
  ok i 'll try to give a somewhat serious answer . 
  firstly , believe it or not , europe is not a single country , and each country has different politics . 
  with that being said , i guess one would find more resemblance ( although still little ) to american politics in the uk than anywhere else . 
  i guess ukip ( or at least the more free-market sect of it ) would be the closest thing to the republicans you would find there . 
  border control , nationalism , more right-wing socially , etc. 
  in italy i ca n't think of any to be honest . 
  like others have said , they 're perceived as absolute madmen . 
  i ca n't think of any socially conservative and fiscally liberal parties in the rest of europe , or at least not any notable ones . 
  even national front in france or golden dawn in greece are protectionist and state-minded when it comes to economics . 
  but yeah , republicans are madmen , a big part of what makes your politics a bit of a joke . 
  mostly just music . 
  not sure if you 're serious , but you 're gon na have to by waaaaaaaay more specific than that . 
  what are your criteria ? 
  what do you enjoy ? 
  is weather a factor ? 
  do you speak any other languages ? 
  believe it or not , there is no country named europe . 
  dont forget the shetland islands, 
  yeah thats true , my bad, 
  honestly its completely up to you . 
  all those countries are great options where you 'll have a good time . 
  i will say that denmark is generally the more expensive one out of those , with france/belgium probably being the cheapest . 
  however , if you only speak english then you might be more comfortable in denmark since virtually everyone speaks english fluently there . 
  i 'm italian . 
  no one cares about it here , we have greater things to worry about ( i heard about through reddit ) . however , when it is brought up , the general consensus is that she was at least somehow involved . 
  well rome is n't considered part of the north ... however , like i said i 'm not from there . 
  i do know of saltinbocca , which is a very typical dish specific to rome . 
  basically its scallops cooked with ham , wine , butter and sage ( there might be a couple of other ingredients but those are the main ones ) .

  try asking yourself a question : when did you choose to be heterosexual ? 
  did you have to think about it ? 
  did you decide , one day , that you liked girls ( if you 're male ) ? 
  could you decide to like guys for a couple of days to see how it 's like ? 
  is it natural to like pizza ? 
  is it natural not to like broccoli ? 
  they 're healthy , so would n't one be better off by just deciding that they really like them and just eat broccoli forever ? 
  i guess it 's hard to imagine that someone really only likes people of the same sex , or maybe that it is not just a strange fixation . 
  speaking for myself , as a gay man , i never had to doubt it . 
  i knew since i was a kid . 
  i have always been very masculine , always liked ` male ' things and yet i only like men , physically and emotionally . 
  and believe me , i spent many years trying to ` choose ' , to change , with various methods . 
  i guess you do n't have to think about it when you have no reason to , but as someone who has had years to deal with it i could probably decide as easily to be straight as being a few centimeters taller . 
  with the upcoming elections the amount of utter craziness that is going on is bewildering . 
  berlusconi has switched into high gear now and every day we have a new surprise , but he 's not the only contestant for the grand prize of crazy ... 
  southern italy has the stereotype of being a bit more backward regarding social issues , being also more religious . 
  and yet there are 2 openly gay regional governors in italy , and they 're both in the south ... 
  yes . 
  the strange thing is that he 's not directly candidated for any position , nor plans to , but he 's the de facto leader of the party . 
  in italy there has been a major loss of voters from the right wing . 
  what gained are non-voters and , well , the ` fuck-em ' party . 
  a short explanation : last year , at the apex of the bond spread crisis , where things seemed dire , berlusconi resigned and we got a ` technical government ' . 
  this government focused on taking debt under control through austerity measures , with the support of both the right and left moderate wings . 
  fringe parties instead went to the opposition , while a newish party started gaining a lot of votes : a stand-up comedian turned opinion leader founded a new party based on the core idea of `` send all those fuckers packing '' , proposing a selection of candidates via cv , short mandate limits and stuff like that , so that all the ` old guard ' politicians would be ruled out . 
  he got a lot of audience and managed to place a mayor in an important city . 
  since last year there has been a major wave of corruption and embezzlement scandals , mostly ( but not exclusively ) involving right wing people in high places , resembling at times the famed bunga bunga parties . 
  the right wing parties have taken a nose dive in the polls , so much that the second highest party is the ` fuck-em ' party , according to several polls . 
  this general feeling of hate towards politicians and their privileges is starting to have an effect , so all parties are scrambling to find new , younger people to capture the disenfranchised voters . 
  according to the current polls the next elections should have a pretty strong left-wing majority ( albeit with a drift toward the center ) and a sizable component of ` fuck-em ' people . 
  these are seen as wildcards with no political experience , so nobody knows what to expect . 
  should you be interested in the polls go [ here ] ( http://termometropolitico.it ) and click on the ` sondaggi ' tab , then ' i quattro poli ' . 
  blue means right wing parties , red means left wing parties , green center parties and yellow is movimento 5 stelle ( the fuck-em people ) . 
  well , his party is currently down to about 15 % right now , after a new wave of arrests for people of his party that have been found embezzling money or wasting public funds in bizarre parties , trips and ` unknowingly ' purchased houses ( yes , this defense has been used a couple of times already ) . 
  we get a new case almost every day and 90 % of them involve someone from berlusconi 's party or one of his allies . 
  basically he 's bailing out so he can say he was not defeated , then who knows ... 
  [ presseurop ] ( http://presseurop.eu ) has translations of articles from the major european newspapers into several languages . 
  comments can be in several languages , but there is an automated translation service integrated with them so you can at least get an idea of what they are saying . 
  the stereotype says that they are lazy and work-dodgers , with an aptitude to scamming . 
  the fact is that a * lot * of southerners actually work in the north and they have been a big source of manpower in the past , often at lower price since a lot of people took any chance to emigrate northwards . 
  there might a bit of a bias against southern people in the north , but i would n't say it 's the average opinion . 
  the indepentists are mostly the people from lega nord , which is probably the craziest party in itally . 
  pick the most ignorant , racist , rude and shameless people and put them in a party , and you have lega nord . 
  they change their mind every few years about being allied with berlusconi and select their leaders based on the number of `` fuck them '' they can spew per minute . 
  anyway , they peaked at 10 % a few years ago due to their xenophobic policies , but now they 're down to 5-6 % now and no other party wants to touch them , except maybe berlusconi 's one , depending on how many votes they 're worth . 
  it does not seem that he will . 
  it 's getting late to start something now , as the elections will be in april . 
  on the other hand the right wing parties are so scattered and disorganized that they are really down in the polls and keep going down , but it 's not the left wing that is gaining : the votes go to abstention or to our version of the ` pirate party ' . 
  it is likely that anyone with a minimum of credibility could gather some following on the right side , since there 's nobody at the moment . 
  there is currently a rather remarkable wave of inquiries and arrests at all levels or politics in italy , and lots of crap is pulled out in the open . 
  it 's starting to look like the whole mani pulite thing from 20 years ago , that left the whole political system shaken and led to berlusconi 's ascent . 
  for now the vast majority of cases is affecting the right wing parties , and especially berlusconi 's one , so much that berlusconi himself is ditching the party and several members are running for the lifeboats . 
  they 've found cases of basic corruption , international money trafficking , abuse of power and finally mafia influences at several levels . 
  left wing parties have been involved as well , even though they just had a few cases of embezzlement , so far . 
  people are already pretty fed up with the political class , and this is throwing fuel on the fire , especially given the looming elections in a few months : a kind of ` pirate party ' is probably going to be the second most voted according to the current polls . 
  i just hope that this time the arrests will have more of a lasting effect ... 
  yes , it 's the generic ` asshole ' remark . 
  it pretty much means ` turd ' . 
  italian swearing has two broad categories : one involving various body parts and persons of interest to the addressee , like most languages , and one involving religious characters , like various saints , mary , jesus and god , coupled with a variety of nouns and attributes . 
  a good example is this [ video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuzv31vp5t4 ) of a venetian newsspeaker , with english subtitles . 
  some are in venetian dialect , but it 's italian for the most part . 
  i do n't know where you donated , but i 've never heard of such horrible cases . 
  cancer also ca n't be transmitted , as far as i know . 
  in general i 've never seen any judging done and the staff has always been pretty friendly . 
  if you 're referring to the screening form/interview i 've never found it to be particularly offensive . 
  it just asks if you have had surgeries or tattoos recently , or are engaging in unprotected or risky sex , and i do n't see anything wrong with that . 
  yes , you get a preliminary test with a drop of blood , which i believe tests your hematocrit level and you 're rejected if they are out of range . 
  some basic tests are always performed on the donated blood and you can request some additional non-routine ones . 
  italy : the exact details depend on what region you live in , but generally you get : - a day off work - some fruit juice/chocolate milk while you 're sitting there being drained - free breakfast at the bar - last time i got a cappuccino and a couple of croissants . 
  - blood test results . 
  within limits you can request specific tests on your blood , say iron levels or something like that . 
  if you enroll in a donor 's community ( giving your availability to be called in case of need ) you can also get small tokens like medals or plates when you reach certain donation thresholds . 
  i 'm italian and i do buy fresh milk if possible , but since i live alone i do n't drink enough to buy more than 1 bottle at a time . 
  so the rest of the milk i buy has to be uht ... 
  is n't that a bit like saying `` i do n't like english writers '' or `` i do n't like yellow stuff '' ? 
  meh , italy is hostage to the vatican . 
  whenever something ` progressive ' is considered all sorts of cardinals and priests start issuing prophecies of misfortune , and since half the parliament listens to them they immediately backtrack . 
  on the other side we have openly gay mps - the vicepresident of the main left wing party is gay , and also the governor of one of the southern regions . 
  we 've even had a transgendered mp , but even the left wing party has its share of catholics holding them back . 
  strangely enough even the leader of one of the rightmost parties , the one born from ex-fascists who then moved a bit towards the center , has come out in support to lgbt rights . 
  i went to oslo while on a tour of souther sweden + copenhagen with some friends . 
  we did n't get a good impression indeed ... maybe also because the hotel/hostel tried to scam us repeatedly : we booked a full 10 people room even if we were 9 ( paying for 10 ) and then we find that there are 9 beds and one is occupied . 
  we protest and we get handed a bed on wheels to place ` somewhere where it fits ' and too bad if we did n't get the room we paid for , they had extra people to place . 
  strangely , when i asked for a written receipt stating that we did n't get what we paid for a new room suddenly appeared . 
  oh and there was the parking to pay , it was n't included with the room . 
  oh , and the fee is for a whole day parking , until midnight , so if you stay one night you must pay 2 full days of parking . 
  anyway , i hope i 'll be able to go back an visit the northern part ... 
  i went many years ago , and i paid 18.000 lire for a coke and a coffee . 
  but they were served by a waiter with gloves on a marble table !, 
  it 's the cover charge . 
  basically a fixed charge that covers bread , dishes , napkins , whatever . 
  should be around 1-3 $ per person in middle of the road restaurants . 
  some restaurants do n't have it at all , some use it a bad surprise . 
  there are a few more things to see in pisa , but basically nobody knows about them , so nobody visits them and so they do n't even bother keeping them open or advertising them . 
  that said , a general rule of thumb is to avoid any restaurant or shop in the immediate vicinity of any famous landmark ( like the leaning tower , or any duomo , or whatever ) . 
  you 'll get crappy food and pay a lot ( hi , restaurant in the milan galleria ) . 
  to find the best restaurants ask locals or check a good guide . 
  generally nobody cares about religion , even in italy . 
  granted , do n't expect gay marriage or euthanasia rights anytime soon here , but asking about religious beliefs is considered somewhat strange and/or rude , and nobody ever thinks about it . 
  latin might help you learn italian , french or spanish , and maybe vaguely understand writing in those languages , but nothing more . 
  italy has visas for students , and some universities even have courses in english ( check politecnico di milano and politecnico di torino , if you are interested in science or engineering ) .

  you 'll have to eat some humble pie , eventually . 
  i think it 's inevitable that the uk will end rejoining the eu . 
  maybe not tomorrow , but someday . 
  it only takes one pro-eu government to do it . 
  watch out for us then :d, 
  the dutch/czech/romanian / german parliaments would have had to jointly approve the invasion beforehand . 
  after that they would comply i guess . 
  di maio , di battista , or the dark lord grillo himself might out-berlusconi him . 
  we have to respond to the german one now :d it was really funny !, 
  what makes you think people would n't change their minds until then ? 
  or rather , what makes you think in 2020 there would still a sufficient number of people in favour of brexit ? 
  maybe there could be a hung parliament , thereby making brexit impossible . 
  how are you going to get in then ? 
  were n't you guys a fan of * prosecco * ? 
  . . and so what ? 
  losing an election or condemning a whole country ? 
  which is the worst option ? 
  that would make them closer to europa !, 
  with 27 members it would take around 13 years to go a full round . 
  unfortunately the italian acronym , * `` fai l'italia grande ancora '' * is a bit nsfw ... 
  well he is not immortal , is he ? 
  ever heard of the `` bible belt '' ? 
  i ca n't see what states like the pacific coast states and the north eastern states have in common with the south and midwest , nowadays . 
   taking part in a decision that all * experts * consider a bad choice . 
  you know the drill . 
  that has been the point since the beginning . 
  why should we be worried ? 
  i can only hope i see it during my lifetime . 
  from : [ an america first energy plan ] ( https://www.whitehouse.gov/america-first-energy )  we must take advantage of the estimated $ 50 trillion in untapped shale , oil , and natural gas reserves , especially those on federal lands that the american people own . 
   the trump administration is also committed to clean coal technology , and to reviving america 's coal industry , which has been hurting for too long . 
   president trump will refocus the epa on its essential mission of protecting our air and water . 
  hardly encouraging . 
  no mention of climate change . 
  wow !, 
  that 's the definition of * presidential * right there . 
  he sometimes looks so harmless , and good-humoured . 
  if it was n't for his ideas ... 
  well it 's not sure that he 'll be reelected . 
  surely the americans will realise their mistake ... 
  * right ? 
  even in italy , with the vatican and all just a few meters from the palace , there are no priests involved in the ceremony . 
  there 's just the honor guard of the military . 
  the incumbent pm hands a small bell to the pm-elect ( which signals the beginning of a new legislature ) and that 's it . 
  the guardian posted this :  the old white house climate change page -- https://www.whitehouse.gov/energy/climate-change -- has disappeared like a species . 
  the old url redirects to a generic trump splash . 
  if le pen wins i think the only solution is cryogenic suspension . 
  maybe a set of bonfires a-la lord of the rings ? 
  dammit you 're right . 
  i should think through . 
  talk for yourself . 
  guys i 'm going to be off the net for a bit . 
  can anybody warn me if he launches icbms towards europe ? 
  there 's already a [ campaign song ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uu3kceec98 ) !, 
  imagine she 's talking about the eu !, 
  sounds like a knock-off of the chain [ eataly ] ( http://www.eataly.com ) . 
  our lord farage already called sweden 's exit as [ sexit ] ( https://youtu.be/fhlyrsltsrk?t=29s ) . 
  but that is not its real name . 
  it 's how it was `` sold '' to the media . 
  it actually is a bunch of `` legge xxx n. yyy '' and so on . 
  do n't you people in the uk eat food ? 
  you are just making these things become more expensive , people will still need them . 
  that explains it . 
  i do research in vr/hci and in more than ten years i have never seen russian researchers ( from russia ) at any conference . 
  would be great if you engaged more with the international community . 
  ~ ~ you ~ ~ we ~ ~ humans ~ ~ also do n't need to put any fancy kill switch on ~ ~ us ~ ~ any robot . 
  totally unnecessary . 
  ~ ~ you ~ ~ we ~ ~ humans ~ ~ also do n't need to put any fancy kill switch on ~ ~ us ~ ~ any robot . 
  totally unnecessary . 
  i wonder how it must be like being in the mind of an alt-right person . 
  are you american ? 
  the us has a `` single market '' between its 50 states . 
  you are free to buy something sold in california if you live in arizona and not pay any customs duties . 
  you can freely travel ( and move ) from one state to the other without needing to show your passport . 
  if you buy food or any kind of product in one state you will be sure that it follows the same federal regulations . 
  the uk is leaving all of that and will have to discuss its relationship with the eu from scratch . 
  it would be like texas leaving the union and having to renegotiate the rules under which rest of the usa trades with texas , what happens to rusa citizens living in texas , and vice versa . 
  thanks , but no thanks . 
  oh no , who will buy our prosecco now ? 
  christian fundamentalists ? 
  you 'll be amazed to learn that in several countries it 's perfectly acceptable to refer to a small part to mean the whole . 
  england to mean the uk or the other way around : america to mean the us . 
  imagine you had to pay customs duty to buy something sold in california if you lived in arizona . 
  imagine you had to show your passport while driving from one state to another . 
  the uk is going to have to negotiate how that will work . 
  while the uk was in the single market and the eu it all worked close to how it works in the us . 
  it can not . 
  once article 50 is triggered , you have 2 years . 
  after that you are out , deal or no deal . 
  a time will come when people like you will realise the terrible mistake . 
  please try to be more original in choosing the designs for your euro coins . 
  do n't put the king everywhere . 
  at last the uk will finally be forced to enter the euro !, 
  someday ... 
  the same rules for non eu players would apply i guess . 
  i think they need to play in their respective national teams or something like that . 
  will the uk be leaving uefa too ? 
  in exchange for eu citizenship ? 
  the point is that a referendum on the euro is not their first priority . 
  you are not the first to project the uk 's views on the rest of europe . 
  they have so many differing views that if the time comes they 'll rip themselves apart .

  how you got asuka there ? 
  thanks putin edit : i am irish now , liked it, 
  italy smokes , drinks , dont do physical activities and yet live longer then most europeans countries . 
  pasta is the secret . 
  there is this common troupe of poland being weak , but i doubt any country could take on fresh germany and ussr at the same time ... 
  i think that is hilarious that someone would type `` why is france so gay ? '', 
  in google expecting an answer for that . 
  probably children , i hope . 
  probably not a name you can use in formal reunions heheh . 
  aa , the glories of a state-plannified economy . 
  bureaucrats telling farmers what to grow , that will surelly suceed !, 
  with beer so good , who needs god ? 
  http://i.imgur.com/h7izmxy.jpg why poland doesnt have euro , doesnt use the euro , why it is not in the euro . 
  and why are they catholic ??? 
  that puzzles the italian mind i guess . 
  i am talking about an hipotetical attack on finland . 
  i agree with you , that is also very possible . 
  i am just a pessimistic haha . 
  well , i dont know how it is there in finland , but in italy being anti-eu is becoming increasyling popular . 
  i already can hear they saying : '' eu was supposed to make our economy stronger , but we only have become poorer since the euro . 
  eu was supposed to make europe stronger , but it did not stoped russia from attacking it . 
  and brussels standed idly while finland was being attacked . 
  what are we gaining from it ? 
  they take all and we gain nothing . '', 
  shit , i can already hear beppe grillo saying this . 
  politically , i think that eu would not be able to survive as it is today if it did not defended one member country from russia . 
  and any plans of an european federation would be completly and totally dead and obliterated . 
  estonia is not ukraine dude . 
  ukraine is in a political turmoil . 
  there are a lot of resonable people who does believe that ukraine took a turn to ultranationalism . 
  ukraine was a chaos and was not capable of repelling the disguised russian army . 
  heck , ukraine didnt even tought russia would do that . 
  ukraine gave a pretext to the russian people when they banned the law that made russian one of the oficial languages . 
  none of those apply to estonia . 
  do you have source for that 125 % thing ? 
  i am curious . 
  i am living in italy , and now today was a confortable 18-22 . 
  i was with a very thin jacket , but most italians were wearing heavy stuff , i am also mindboggled by that . 
  but in that matter , i was always different . 
  i think that in my 25 years living in brazil , i wear a jacket maybe 5 days every year or osmething like that , but most brazilians wear jacket whenever they find themselves bellow 25 degrees . 
  so idk ... i also start to feel phisically ill whenever i stay long hours in more then 34 degrees without taking a cold bath ... 
  this things are strange . 
  i am from brazil and no one let their kids outside if it is under 15 . 
  yes , positive . 
  not defending a member of the eu would be the end of eu . 
  russian rulers has being using that tatic for a while . 
  use a referedum and bam ! , everything is fine and legit . 
  do people really think that it was fair ? 
  that putin was going to accept a no ? 
  just because he is anti-american doesnt make him the good guy folks . 
  maybe its their fetish , being dominated by russians . 
  140 % crimeans want to be russians !, 
  they do at the bottom . 
  its in cyrilic , how should i be able to read it ? 
  that ukranian flag is quite beautiful . 
  specially when the little text is not even in english , and op didnt translated . 
  or pretty much every country in the americas should just go back to being portugal/spain/france / england 's territory . 
  seriously , 1654 ? 
  who the fuck cares about what empire used to rule a land 400 , 300 , 200 , 100 years ago . 
  the pope doesnt seem too happy hehe, 
  you are my favorite russian , and i know a beautiful red haired russian girl . 
  i believe he was testing in syria . 
  now is the real deal . 
  and i suspect that those votes were under tremendous financial and/or political coercion aswell . 
  anyone have a doubt that russian gov is just a huge mafia state now ? 
  alright , thanks for the civilized answer . 
  sincerelly , i dont understand your logic . 
  bouth regimes were killing left and right . 
  for diferent reasons ? 
  sure . 
  but it doesnt make any fucking diference , innocents where killed by the buckets in bouth regimes . 
  why , why do you say that ussr wasnt as bad as the nazis ? 
  i am puzzled . 
  how to explain this : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/joseph_stalin#calculating_the_number_of_victims why is that not as bad as the nazi 's holocaust ? 
  why killing millions because of political diferences or to pacify people is not as bad as genocide ? 
  i genuinely want to read your reasoning . 
  what many russians seem to fail to understand is that for many people in eastern europe , the soviets ( ussr isnt equal to russian people , even to russia ) were as bad as the nazism . 
  see some quick examples : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/katyn_massacre http://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/holodomor http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/warsaw_pact_invasion_of_czechoslovakia so what most russians see as liberating , most eastern europeans simply see as trading opressors . 
  `` although its authenticity could not be confirmed , parliamentary deputy hennadi moskal , a former deputy interior minister , published a document online detailing a plan to ** surround independence square ** -- the cradle of the uprising -- ** with snipers and open fire on the protesters below . 
  ** '' open fire on protesters would be a massacre . 
  `` massacre ( plural massacres ) the intentional killing of a considerable number of human beings , under circumstances of atrocity or cruelty , or contrary to the norms of civilized people . 
  the massacre on st. bartholomew 's day st. valentine 's day massacre amritsar massacre '' if surround and open fire on protesters is not a massacre , i really do not know what it is . 
  last i heard they have a lot of autonominity , and their language is used even in official documents . 
  but i dont really know much about it . 
  i was comenting on his great english skills . 
   i am a bit reluctant to spell this out , since as a matter of principle i categorically support the more liberal approach to regional policy common in the european union , including a large degree of linguistic autonomy at the local level . 
  was my favorite part, 
  dear god , doesnt that brings ukraine dangerly close to a civil war ? 
  it 's a tense , horrible situation , and it 's is so similar to syria that i do n't even know where to begin . '', 
  edit : no , i dont think that , but the original sentence does not help prove or disprove any point . 
  i wouldnt mind using it !, 
  people from italy are following laws and working in switzerland . 
  if the companies there are hiring italians is because they feel it is best for their interests . 
  italians are not going to switzerland to beg , to make crimes . 
  they are going to work . 
  and they keep going because it have work available . 
  switzerland have an unemployment rate of 3.5 % , meaning that there is plenty jobs and opportunities to the natives , and that they need the labour of surrounding countries , otherwise their companies can not grow . 
  lack of labour force is as big of a problem as lack of money . 
  a 3.5 % unemployement rate is ridiculously low . 
  it means that everyone can get a job , and whoever is unemployed is probably between jobs or looking for their first .

  f = ma is still a valid natural law in the rear seat . 
  no , i do n't feel bitter . 
  it is necessary to do a choiche , and unless we want to revive latin , we have to use a language that is already in use by someone . 
  but it is a bit annoying that native-english speaking countries do n't want to put a foreign language course in their schools ' core curriculum . 
  it would be nice , and useful , to have them learn at least the basic of a foreign language , as we do . 
  it 's impossible that genetics can change so drastically in such a short span of time ( 3000-4000 years are really nothing in evolutionary terms ) . 
  they worker harder , true , but so everybody did until a couple of hundreds years ago , but we do n't have paintings of a ripped soldier from 1600 or something like that . 
  ( plus , you really have to know what you are doing with your workout to reach a good definition . 
  no way you can sport a 6 pack just because you work in construction ) i guess that the real answer is that professional athlets were actually able to reach a very good shape , and then the sculptor just exagerated some feature . 
  you do n't really have to have just one model , you can use the torso of one athlet and the leg of another one . 
  do n't forget law . 
  civil law is a direct continuation of roman law . 
  my father did something very similar with my grandmother . 
  my uncle , his brother ( not twin ) , died 7 years ago of cancer . 
  the whole family , and i guess my uncle before dying , agreed to not tell her anything of the cancer and then of the death because she was fragile and had a lot of hearth issue . 
  they told her that my uncle was sent to africa by his company , thus he would not be able to visit or telephone her very much . 
  she used to have memory problems and she mixed up my father with my uncle all the time by phone . 
  so sometimes my father just went along whit it when it happened , and more rarely they would tell her that my uncle had visited her , but that she forgot it . 
  this seems like something mean to do , but she spent her remaining 2 years as an happy woman , instead as a grieving mother . 
  well , if you put it that way , schumacher litterally means `` shoes maker '' ... 
  neither did 99.9 % of us italian . 
  ferrari does not mean smith at all in standard italian . 
  it is probably a corruption of the regional word `` ferrai '' which means `` someone who work with iron '' * . 
  and even '' ferrai '' it 's not standard italian and is an old world . 
  the standard italian world for `` smith '' is `` fabbro '' . 
  it was n't the most voted party . 
  the numbers are out there . 
  it was n't . 
  nah , they speak italian and have the same culture ... they are way too small to really differentiate from italy . 
  take this sentence : `` we should build new houses '' . 
  if it is pronounced by mr x head of a ngo involved in assistance of the poors , it means one thing . 
  if it is pronounced by mr y , head of an huge building company , it means something different . 
  who said it * is * part of the context . 
  and you need context to fully understand a text . 
  that 's really interesting , it show how this is mostly a matter of culture . 
  here someone who receive welfare and spend it to live on his own would be seen as a freeloader by most people . 
  yup , there is a strong cultural component in this . 
  some countries just do n't have the `` go out of home as soon as possible '' , regardless of the income . 
  economic crisis is not the driving factor here , it is just causing that more people stay at home than usual . 
  it is mostly cultural . 
  there is absolutely no way that this is going to happen . 
  migration issues are a tiny speck of dust compared to the benefit of the schengen area . 
  that would be like cutting of your hand because you have a split nail . 
  in italy is two kisses , no particolar order . 
  man-woman / man-man / woman-woman , everybody kiss everybody . 
  in younger folks is less common to kiss man-man , but usually the same folks will kiss with no problem someone older than them ... 
  it 's even completely fine in formal situation , if you know already the person you are meeting . 
  it 's definetely worse , if you ask me . 
  but as i said it 's a different mentality , use of guns is seen as a relatively normal thing . 
  thus both criminals and police feel ok with using weapons . 
  some years ago a crazy man shot on the policemen guarding the government building during the ceremony of the formation of a new government , seriouously injuring two policemen . 
  he was blocked and arrested without a single shot fired by the police . 
  and italian pollice is ** not ** known to be particularly progressive . 
  it 's a different mentality . 
  americans tends to have a distrust for the government , any kind of government . 
  so a government with the capacity to watch them is hitting the wrong spots with them . 
  no , it works only with your own balls . 
  they may mimick the act of scratching `` their '' balls , usually saying `` let me scratch , even if i do n't have them ... '' again , this is pretty rude even with close friends ... 
  but it totally happens , sometimes . 
  yup , we `` knock '' , or actually just touch , iron . 
  the italian '' knock on wood '' is `` tocco ferro '' , which means '' [ i ] touch iron '' . 
  or we scratch our balls . 
  no , seriously , while the iron thing is to wish the good outcome of something , if you have to go against something bad happening , you are supposed to scratch your balls . 
  obviously that is ** very ** rude . 
  even with close friend is still borderline . 
  the reason why the law will be valid only next year instead of immediately is because the law to reform the upper house has still not passed . 
  ( this is normal , it 's a constitutional modification and you need a way longer process to do it ) . 
  it 's very improbable that the senators will decade when the new law will be passed , as that would basically be the same as dissolving the parliament , a power which his in not in the hand of the government or the parliament itself . 
  only the president of the republic can do that . 
  also , politically it does n't make much sense to put a deadline on your own government , i guess ... 
  who ? 
  tell me the sources , please . 
  the police should never beat the fuck out of anyone , no matter what . 
  actually they are anarchist , who are the polar opposite of the left . 
  it 's * the * world fair , actually . 
  the expo is just the modern name for the world 's fair . 
  you know , i never understood that whole `` italians talk with their hands '' until i had to explain how to reach a metro station to a tourist , and he could n't resist staring at my hands . 
  it was a bit rude of him , but that was the firs time i realized that i use a lot of very specific hand gestures . 
  that 's actually good ... 
  i mean , it 's gibberish , even if he mostly use actual words , but it 's refreshing to hear another `` version '' of what an italian accent sounds like . 
  honestly i have never understood where the `` it 's - a me mario '' accent came from ... 
  well , you can have an head of state democratically elected . 
  you have to give him no real power but a lot of `` representative '' power ( like he is the one who formally appoint the government and he is the one who do the end of the year discourse to the nation ) and make sure that he can be elected only by an high majority , thus being a person who is respected by more than one party . 
  during the peak of winter it 's dark at 6 o'clock everywhere in europe . 
  wait , gladio is n't a conspiracy theory in the sense of `` crazy stuff '' , it 's existence and it 's purpose as a stay-behind organization are an historical fact . 
  even the plane which was shot down it 's pretty much certain that something strange happened , but we do not know who did what . 
  public transport in europe is present almost everywhere . 
  a bus or a train will stop near where you live at least a couple of time a day , it is very , very rare to find a place that you ca n't reach without a car . 
  but it is actually pretty normal for the parents to drive their kids to school . 
  if we are talking about teenagers , some will buy a , hmm i do n't know the english name , a low power motorbike , which can be driven since you are 16yo . 
  stability . 
  luxembourg is surrounded by friendly and powerful neighbours . 
  imagine doing the same while bordering russia ... 
  if anyone is wondering , italy uses blue as the color for our sport teams because it was the color of the savoy house , which was the house of the king . 
  we just keept the color after we exiled the king . 
  yes , absolutely . 
  you guys in the usa are the only one with this strict no alchol rule . 
  do n't get me wrong , no parents encourage their kids to binge driniking or to get drunk . 
  but that a 16 yo at a party will drink alcohol is no big deal , everybody knows it . 
  it 's absolutely * not * encouraged , but it 's ok . a bit like `` do n't ask , do n't tell '' .

  i 'll see myself out . 
  the plebs are coming !, 
  a specter is haunting europe ... 
  oh probably yes . 
  legions were not permanently stationend somewhere . 
  even in russia the `` fasces '' are present . 
  interesting . 
  well muscovy considered itself the third rome after all . 
  uh i like your approach . 
   also the chi-rho was n't a western empire symbol you 're right on that , but it 's also the symbol most associated with the western roman empire now . 
  [ this ] ( http://imgur.com/ixdycmc ) maybe be a better alternative . 
  if you have better ideas feel free to post . 
  did not know that !, 
  interesting . 
  the fasces were the weapons of the lictores , which were the bodyguards of the roman magistrates . 
  the symbolism of the fasces suggested strength through unity , so that 's probably why they were used by various political entities in history . 
  well provinces did not have flags of their own ( not official one at least ) but we could use the flags of the legions stationed there , in hispania we have : [ legio vi victrix ] ( http://imgur.com/gtmu88y ) [ legio ii augusta ] ( http://imgur.com/1vwcvce ), 
  oh i see thanks !, 
  is ... is that actually a thing ? 
  what 's a rubberbandit ? 
  the only problem with that flag is the similarity with the fascist flag . 
  the thing the eagle is standing on are the `` fasces '' which in latin means bundle of sticks and from where the word fascism comes from . 
  the byzantine empire changed flags in its history ) [ holy roman empire ] ( http://imgur.com/6wtxfix ) i am all fine for this , 
  ehhh you make a good point , but i think missiles are not necessary the future . 
  electromagnetic guns i think will be a better alternative once technology gets better . 
  that said , i am obviously talking `` out of my ass '' , pardon my french , since i have no military knowledge . 
  also great username . 
  are you a transhumanist ? 
  oh i 'm not saying that they are onver and will never be used again . 
  i am just saying that the time where missiles were the ultimate weapon is over . 
  just like with cavalry and tanks . 
  more or less when we switched sides . 
  i feel though that the era of missiles is going to end pretty soon with ever more sofisticated pint defense laser systems . 
  awww no fiat, 
  [ see first point ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5ituif/some_interesting_facts_about_ancient_rome/ ) ( shameless self promotion ), 
  we should learn from the us recovery from the great depression . 
  heavily tax the wealthy and funnel money in the lower classes . 
  that 's how you breath life in an economy . 
  pretty good estimates anyway i have to say . 
  you might post this in r/theydidthemath, 
  oh ok i see what you mean . 
  i was more thinking of the area of the brain that we do not necessarily need simulated , like sense of smell or hearing . 
  that would cut out quite a number of neurons involved in those processes . 
  well you do n't need to simulate every neuron . 
  i would suggest privacy badger . 
  it is made by the electronic frontier foundation , a non profit organization , and not a for profit company like ghostery . 
  well i was asking mainly to know if it was something interesting to post . 
  but do n't worry !, 
  i 'll do my best !, 
  now i am picturing romans with wild west clothes chasing the latest gold rush in hispania . 
  it 's not actually the average face , iirc they took a couple of hundreds images and overimposed them one over the other, 
  ehi everyone !, 
  i wanted to ask what would you like to see in the next one . 
  i still have more than enough to make another post about rome , focusing on medicine and slavery . 
  otherwise we can explore medieval europe . 
  another idea i had was to explore the decision of joining the allies by italy in the first world war . 
  shh you know what i meant . 
  here in italy everyone has a bidet . 
  it 's only our ~ ~ barbaric ~ ~ rustic northern neighbours that do not use them . 
  the only ones that can bully finland are other europeans !, 
  the whole world is having less and less children , in just 10 years africa went from 5-6 children for woman to 3-4 . 
  it 's not something that is hitting only the west , here we just notice it more because it was already pretty low . 
  why socialism ? 
  it 's usually the right obsessed over protecting the european race and `` family values '', 
   because that always works out great . 
  why have a government at all sure r/anarcho _ capitalism and r/goldandblack would like to have a word with you .

  it 's pretty embarrasing however that we are 24 ^ th in culture considering we have in our country half the world heritage sites . 
  also 40 ^ th in science . 
  i 'm sure leonardo da vinci is proud of us . 
  why is luxemburg 100 ^ th in international peace and security ?

  wow there 's a whole article about pizza 's history . 
  well the legend says the first pizza `` margherita '' has these ingredients as a homage to the italian royal family . 
  margherita of savoy was the then queen of italy and had the new dish dedicated to her . 
  we were coming out of one of the biggest corruption scandals in our history . 
  [ mani pulite ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mani_pulite ) or clean hands . 
  right after a big war between the government and the mafia . 
  berlusconi was the product of a decade of government instability and this was the effect on our economy . 
  well that is true for every nation . 
  and southern italy was called magna graecia by the greek colonists . 
  italia was the entire peninsula up to modern day romagna, 
  what do you mean exactly ? 
  now i want a fanfiction fo this . 
  hold on i 'm going to r/writingprompts, 
  roman egypt was actually one of the richest provinces . 
  the roman occupation made the country prosper like never before , if not under the old egyptian kingdom . 
  and the germans and the turks and the russians ... 
  yeah . 
  our modern set of values all centred around greed is much better than the old one centred around pride . 
  while i 'm not gon na dispute the fact that romans were a militaristic society , they were far less violent than many other civilizations . 
  you ca n't govern a graveyard after all and the romans did it for a thousand years, 
  oh i do n't know sorry . 
  i was only trying to make a joke . 
   the average briton is n't willing to do because they do not give enough to live on . 
  it 's not like people like to be lazy even if there are open jobs , but it 's much better for a business owner to hire an immigrant that wo n't demand decent working conditions than a native .
