former soviet republics estonia and lithuania suffered falls of 57.1 percent and 55.5 percent , respectively . 
  so our export to russia dropped by by half . 
  so you know what happened ? 
  business started exporting to new markets . 
  our export in 2014 was the same level as 2013 and it is way higher than any year before . 
  oh , and russian export took massive drop unlike other countries . 
  unhcr camps are missing 3/4 of needed budget . 
  glad to hear there is a country in europe prioritizing country security . 
  are you planning to build great hungarian fence towards austria and ukraine / slovakia ? 
  and they will be back in one week if they have eu passport . 
  deport where ? 
  back home to india ? 
  this allows legal entry ( without visa ) via border check point and not anywhere you want . 
  journalist could stay 20 meters away and film . 
  she probably broke laws too , by entering country illegally as there is no `` schengen agreement '' between serbia and hungary ? 
  good luck arresting thousands of migrants . 
  do n't forget you will have to process ( accept or deport ) them too . 
  as i said we have enough unemployed people and those who would like to return back . 
  problem is job availability . 
  we do n't need extra burden on tax payers . 
  yes , 3rd generation muslims in france are integrated so well ... 
  bringing migrants wo n't create any jobs . 
  but it will cost a lot to support them . 
  we have enough unemployed people . 
  that was proposed as fine for not being able to take them . 
  for rejecting without reason it might be different . 
  poland imports are higher than exports . 
  eu probably earns money from poland . 
  [ almost ] ( http://www.unhcr.org/558acbbc6.html ), 
  nope , you have illegal migrant who claims he is syrian . 
  you decided he is not ( he does n't have any documents ) . 
  so you decide to deport him . 
  where are you going to send him ? 
  who accept him ? 
  you do n't know his nationality so you have to process ( detain ) him . 
  you ca n't send some somali to turkey just because they have camps . 
  i 'm not sure if sending actual syrian would be possible in case turkey would not accept him as he is not coming from war zone ( he is in europe ) . 
  why turkey should accept somebody not from turkey ? 
  maybe you can ship him to usa or canada as well ? 
  this would bring lot of elderly and weak people . 
  they wo n't be able to work . 
  there is $ 6k one time payment . 
  archbishop promised help with integration . 
  yeah , it is not that expensive then there is sponsors from eu . 
  but investment return is pretty awful i believe . 
  well , our serious crime rate dropped a lot in [ 2004 ] ( http://postimg.org/image/5vwznwnp5/ ) . 
  allowing to enter country and free movement correlates well . 
  so if sexual offenses are very common in some country and you allow people to come from that country , sexual crime rate will increase . 
  it will reduce or solve hungary problems . 
  nothing is wrong with that . 
  that is one time payment . 
  wars in middle east and africa wo n't end near future . 
  so 10 years would cost 65k + costs for housing . 
  so that sum is laughable . 
  it is $ 539,9 $ for each person and $ 576,1 for person with disability . 
  and this is in current infrastructure and to accept more new housing is needed . 
  yes 540 is average . 
  and median is way lower . 
  and that sum is not enough to pay for apartment rent , food , transportation and basic goods . 
  each asylum seeker already costs more than 540 per month in refugee center . 
  sorry $ 6k for refugee is laughable amount . 
  we can pay that to germans so they will keep them . 
  that sum is not covering a single year of expenses . 
  i really hope you are right . 
  i do n't think you can deport them once they are accepted . 
  even if they commit crime , you only can to put them in prison . 
  just like citizen . 
  ah , i did n't read article for total number . 
  it is 780 in the op post . 
  according article you have linked - we have over 4m inhabitants ? 
  270 $ after income tax and social security payments . 
  600 $ per refugee in current infrastructure . 
  it will be needed to buy or rent housing . 
  very inconsistent play . 
  and this continues since preparation games . 
  hopefully , team will solve everything during group stage . 
  [ eisva mudu abudu ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gebqxybwmqq ), 
  donated hardware or government procurement . 
  probably the second . 
  yet , real refugees are happy to be safe . 
  but they will get new neighbors soon . 
  lithuania agreed to take some refugees from camps in turkey , italy and greece . 
  these people accepts refugee status and conditions they get . 
  but all those migrating to germany should go there . 
  they want to go there . 
  they are invited by germans . 
  and germans should pick them up directly from turkey / lebanon or eu border and stop to amplify the mess in other countries . 
  but you can travel with local train closer to austrian border ? 
  and then move on foot to austria ? 
  estonians are slow and do n't speak indo-european language . 
  it is not a work for me either . 
  we love spending time in a woods . 
  well , scandinavians are hiring medics in baltic . 
  if education is acceptable language is not a barrier . 
  and they provide help with relocation , rent , learning language . 
  * currently , only 4000 to 4500 individuals are staying at reception centres , meaning that only one in twenty-for asylum seekers remain in the country for a shorter or longer period of time . 
  * they move from the country on their own . 
  hungary is not jail for them . 
  they are free to leave . 
  i do n't know what second link data means .

  if russia tries to occupy them and nato countries wo n't do anything , then the whole organisation will fall apart instantly . 
  probably that bit where russia is n't even considering occupying us . 
  none . 
  i do know quite a few lithuanian-speaking poles , though . 
  what 's your point ? 
   but they might start to think they 're being oppressed ca n't write a store sign in polish ? 
  yup , that 's about as bad as oppression can get . 
   in their home country they do n't call it their home country . 
  they also clearly do n't like it here . 
  you see , the law says that all public signs must be written in the official language . 
  official language is just one , lithuanian . 
  that is clearly written in the constitution . 
  changing it would require a national vote . 
  such voting can be initiated if a party collects 300 000 signatures of eligible voters . 
  they clearly wo n't get it , because we like our constitution the way it is . 
  if the polish people really feel oppressed here , then they can request a political asylum from poland . 
  i 'm sure they would have it granted , since not being able to write `` food '' in polish is a life-threatening situation . 
  you may ask , why would n't they get the 300 000 signatures , needed to start a voting ? 
  because they bitch and moan about lots of things , which in turn alienates them from us . 
  for example , their political representative insisted on making religion classes mandatory for all schools . 
  obviously not just religion in general , but catholic version of christianity . 
  that is not cool . 
  who are discriminated by it ? 
  all it asks is to write public stuff ( street names and such ) in the national language . 
  i really do n't see how is this discrimination of something . 
   that will somehow spell the demise of your language ? 
  will that spell of theirs ? 
  or maybe the other local polish people wo n't be able to find the grocery store , since the name is only in lithuanian ? 
  will they wander around aimlessly , starving and dying on the streets ? 
  all because there 's no polish sign for `` food '' ? 
  imagine if russians demanded to be able to write their names in passports in russian letters . 
  then the store signs , street names and so on . 
  it would be like 1864 all over again . 
  we already went through that , it sucked . 
  you 'd have to offer something really nice in return if you wanted us to do it all over again . 
  it 's not arbitrary discrimination , it 's the law . 
  do n't like the law ? 
  you can always propose a change . 
  they have a representative in the government . 
  the reality is fairly simple : we fought long and hard to save our language and our country . 
  lots of countries tried to occupy us and to erase the language . 
  it 's kind of natural that we do n't feel too happy about giving it all up just because someone wants to write `` sz '' instead of '' \u0161 '' . 
  some polish people are already claiming `` wilno nasze '' , which really does n't make us happy . 
   if you refuse to change them , and stick to `` do n't like it ? 
  gtfo '' seriously , i 'm yet to see a logical explanation as to why this is wrong . 
  eu is very open to all citizens . 
  you can move freely to whichever country you want . 
  there are no borders , no visas , no work permits . 
  if another country has something that you really want , then why should n't you move ? 
  dammit , there go my plans to make [ this thing ] ( http://i.imgur.com/iyjw8qi.jpg ) relevant again . 
  yea , well , that 's just how the lithuanian laws are . 
  the law is the same for everyone . 
  do n't like it ? 
  you 're free to emigrate , schengen . 
  we do n't hate them , we only dislike a few guys from their government . 
  what we do hate are polish people in lithuania , as described by that other guy below . 
  they keep crying about being opresed and all that , when in reality their conditions are actually pretty good . 
  they even have polish schools here , funded by the government . 
  so yea , while we might dislike certain aspects of poland , i think that we could become good friends if we had to fight against russia . 
  those minor disagreements are really quite insignificant in the big picture . 
  can we join ? 
  latvia might tag along too , if that 's okay with you guys . 
  i do n't think he 's in university yet , he was quite a bit younger than me . 
  he was 12 years old when i graduated . 
   well fuck , that makes you royalty . 
  it was a very normal secondary school , public and free . 
  anyone could enter as long as they lived in the area . 
  it is n't even the posh part of the city . 
  just one side of the area was kind of nice , lots of hills and pine trees , so some rich people live there . 
   i doubt you could afford the same collage or masters program the presidents son undertook . 
  we do n't have american style colleges here . 
  here we go to school for 12 years and then it 's either university or a job and family . 
  university education is free for good students , so all you really need are good grades . 
  unless you want to study abroad . 
  although even then you can get it all for free . 
  some countries offer free uni education to all eu students , others give interest-free loans . 
  they actually do n't even ask for their money back if you do n't get a well-paying job . 
  that 's because no job means that their education was shitty and not worth paying for . 
   how come charities keep asking for money . 
  founder 's mortgage wo n't pay itself . 
  as for status quo , eh . 
  it might apply to us and their whole `` 1 % '' population , but i do n't really see it in europe . 
  public education is usually good enough for most children . 
  absolute majority of our politicians went to public schools . 
  i went to the same school as one president 's son . 
  citizens get elected too . 
  getting some funding is n't that difficult if you seem to be worthy . 
   ordinary citizens rarely have the chance to become politicians . 
  they always have . 
  there 's nothing stopping you from becoming a politician and joining a political party . 
  you can be an independent candidate in the presidential elections too , at least over here . 
  i know , i know . 
  i just could n't hold myself . 
  subinslieks is tapeworm , not just some common ground worm . 
  do you think that potato jokes are funny ? 
  probably not . 
  i 've never heard of this reason , to be fair . 
  it 's probably because \u017dirga galva sounds funny in lithuanian . 
  same as e\u017eiukas ( hedgehog ) being called adata galva ( needle head ) in latvian . 
  banginis ( a whale ) is supposedly called okeana burbuls ( ocean bubble ) .

  sadly , turns out the rebels were worse than ghadaffi . 
  from what i understand modiji 's demonetization didnt work out because it was planned out poorly and seem to be a rash decision even if the intention was good . 
  not sure how it in any way relates to muslim vigilante gangs killing sikhs though . 
  dalis `` pietinio '' \u0160iauliuose / / basically location that doesnt really translate . 
  no , it just seems that i know more about us colledges than you do for some reason . 
  private donations do not extend to even half the costs of these stadiums , most of which lays back down on the school . 
  however despite that , many of those stadiums have contracts where majority of income from them go back to private companies instead of the school and as a result ends up being massive loss for the school . 
  i find that lack of engagement is mostly from voters side rather than from politician . 
  it doesnt help that there are many more things infinitely more `` fun '' to do than politics so many people dont bother . 
  as far as alienation and meaningful choice goes . 
  id say thats in high part the peoples fault themselves . 
  people complain that there is no good choice to elect but there usually is . 
  you just have to look deeper and find it in the primary round , because by the secondary one its too late as others already elected the bad choices . 
  the party rating system is also great if people used it . 
  but they dont . 
  so same few `` famous '' names get recycled over and over again . 
  yes , turkey colonized half of cyprus by force . 
  hence my comment that at least its not more turks . 
  but the topic is about people living off wellfare , not people with 1000 euro salaries . 
  also if i understand correctly in bacelona 1000 euros is considered low salary . 
  yes , you are absolutely correct on that one . 
  but i was commenting more about the media coverage of mosques you were talking about . 
  my experience is mostly with sweden and denmark so it may be different in netherlands . 
  personally i am of the belief that if you did not turn out to vote then you are fine with whatever gets elected and has thus proved your support for them . 
  an obviuos exception is when one is unable to show up such as people in hospital , ect . 
  if you asked me a few years ago i would have said yes , but i would say no now . 
  people are not knowledgable on most subjects nor do they have literal job to be knowledgable of what to vote on . 
  unless we could somehow magically make the entire population highly educated and knowledgable about every subject they vote on - it will only end in disaster . 
  switzerland is a good example actually . 
  they have partial direct democracy with two referendums per year . 
  as a result their political decisions have been arguably the most conservative in whole europe ( outside of the soviet bloc ) . 
  lithuanian here but pretty much same situation . 
  we had an area here who was known to be very dangerous after dark because of the locals . 
  after joining eu the area became one of the most peaceful ones in a few years . 
  why ? 
  all the dangerous locals went to uk , sweden and denmark . 
  ( source : i was friends with one of those locals ), 
  they dont have to be paid the same though . 
  most migrants work illegally and get paid bellow minimum wage . 
   is there an empirical reason for this yes . 
  i am from lithuania , one of the nations massively migrating to the west . 
  when people come back the biggest thing they brag about is `` how much they managed to steal '' . 
  also noticed a funny thing in uk - ads against driving done in lithuanian . 
  turns out despite being a very tiny migrant group compared to others , they are the biggest number of drunk drivers causing accidents , even bigger than local brits . 
  yes . 
  anyone from outside of the country is an immigrant . 
  we would much prefer european immigrants than the current majority migration of ukrainians though . 
  look on the bright side , at least they arent turks :p, 
  well , in india islamic extremists are killing hundreds of thousands of sikhs in attempt to become majority religion , so i dont see why they wouldnt at least try in germany . 
  no resident or otherwise sikhs can be muslims . 
  they are different religions . 
  i can sort of understand the mosque thing since most of mosques built in europe is financed by saudi arabia in attempt to convert the locals . 
  sikhs are by definition a religiuos group that has nothing to do with islam , so identifying them as muslims would be incorrect . 
  we have get any . 
  europeant subreddits are pretty biased towards eu though . 
  i mean i support eu and want higher federalization but / r/europe is pretty blatant in being one-sided . 
  if ireland left statisticians would rejoice actually . 
  the tax haven politics have really made eu cringe constantly thanks to ireland . 
  the problem is that the colledge sport money doesnt go to the school . 
  we had a professor like that . 
  one girl bought the book and i made a freely accessible copy for everyone ( i was the deisgnated digital copy guy because i had a scanner and wasnt afraid to use it ! ), 
  colledge stadiums have shown to bring money to only two people - the corrupt colledge leadership that allowed the building and the company that did the building . 
  everyone else looses . 
  because we dont have universities blow thier entire budget on a football stadium and them rob the students twice for the studies . 
  no , you got rich by being lucky in geographical location . 
  people in rural areas are on average less knowledgable about the world and less educated . 
  as a result they tend to utilize the fear the unknown factor . 
  furthermore , it is heavily compounded by the press only reporting on the bad stories and not the good ones . 
  and the immigrants themselves arent helping either . 
  one rural woman decided to express her dissatisfaction with a refugee here by kicking her . 
  as a result the refugees banded into a mob and assaulted the woman . 
  police interfered quickly enough to save her life , but otherwise she would have ended up dead . 
  do you think that womans relatives are going to be more friendly to the refugees or less ? 
  as far as enviromental friendlyness , people in cities tend to see the results of bad enviromental factors , smog , pollution , deforestation , while rural people tend to live in areas less affected by it and thus less aware . 
  i disagree . 
  i usually see politicians blaming eu for x or y but never seem them mention eu when they do something good . 
  i think we should mention the positive side more often . 
  currently eu comission possition is that they arent looking for new states . 
  i wish they would make an exception for serbia , but it seems unlikely . 
  drivers licenses expire every 10 or 25 ( depending on when issued ) years here so we will get new one eventually . 
  neither my id nor dirvers license look like that . 
  eu army is a very hard thing to do . 
  at least until countries retain thier sovereignity . 
  what if we have a war like , say , the lybia one and one country wants to send forces in while another refuses ? 
  last time we just had one country send troops another doesnt . 
  doesnt work with eu army . 
  or what about any possible uprisings within eu ? 
  imagine uk soldiers containing a revolution in france . 
  and thats not mentioning requiring to harmonize trainign techniques , equipment , ect . 
  while nato did a lot of equipment harmonization , its nowhere near to forming a single army . 
  also nato kinda makes eu army redundant anyway . 
  we went from green to red . 
  i liked green more but its not really something thats relevant . 
  now that citizen id cards , they made the color look like vomit :(, 
  our base state pension is less per month . 
  im not sure how much reisdence you need to show , but due to no borders there really is no way to track that you are not spending most of your time in ireland . 
  all toothpaste does . 
  its the primary mineral that is known to restore tooth emals . 
  in eastern europe we have whats called `` farmers market '' which is basically flea market for farmers and they sell such produce without problems . 
  you could just go pay some money for a stand and sell it , but inspectors may inspect you and find problems .

  they go full politics on russia second time in row which is insulting to our voters . 
  not to mention that it 's a lot more interesting to see what people vote for one by one rather than jury anyway . 
  i do n't think ww2 themed entry would bring germany better eurovision results .

  sweden , denmark , netherlands are n't the biggest fans probably not enjoying their bikes getting stolen after all !, 
  oddly enough all three baltic states get lowest scores from portugal + greece , no idea what 's up with that , do n't think they even ride bikes much . 
   baltic boys man , that totally needs to be a real boy band name . 
  in general our top 5 most favored : 1 . 
  sweden ( 79.46 ) 2 . 
  finland ( 78.43 ) 3 . 
  united states of america ( 76.24 ) 5 . 
  austria ( 75.75 ) romania least favored eu member ( 47.63 ) . 
  us most favored country between lithuanians in 18-24 age group , this group likes southerners more while for the most part liking everyone a bit less and italy makes it into top 3 . 
  either way , no country that likes us more than we like them . 
  i feel like good amount of liths tend to like russia 's entries too , add some minority voting and voila . 
  oh that totally stole my heart unexpectedly < 3, 
  this confirms it , we 're by far the most relevant nation to ourselves . 
  i 'll take it as a win . 
  https://youtu.be/up6cahy8cji?t=4m44s btw , i looked into it a bit closer : -1 for russia due to prussia . 
  and +5 to poland due to poles . 
  so 34 vs 33 . 
  polan wins silver . 
  lietuva , most relevant best catholic , taip .

  lidl is about to open up [ quite a few shops ] ( https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/viewer?mid=1ffjxsjpx3dnx3thsgih3r_7hgio ) so seems like they 're in to take a good chunk of market share . 
  liths also buy building materials from poland . 
  have read an interview with manager of some shop in suwalki branch , he kept wondering wtf are we building there that there 's so many orders . 
  just our way of investing into eastern poland . 
  meanwhile [ poland after lithuanians ] ( http://i.imgur.com/a7mjgdd.jpg ),

  nothing in particular , just generally positive feeling like seeing sunshine i suppose . 
  yeah , how the stores look varies quite a bit some look quite nice to me , some look horrendous . 
  but overall , let 's just say we 've had worse looking store chains . 
  regarding lithuanian wages - same here , the pay is low even by our standards , staff gets overworked etc. 
  working in maxima is sort of a swear word . 
  as in if a student wants to say his degree is useless he 'll say he 'll have to go to work in maxima after graduation .

  :'( 10 more maximas for you !, 
  same here more or less , \u010cigonai , rumunai . 
  pc term is of course romas ( singular ) for gypsy but that poses a bit of a problem since romas is decently common lithuanian male name .

  define `` nice '' i personally prefer a city life so i do n't really want a house and new flats are fairly affordable even to folks with a bit higher than average salary as long as they don ' t have kids before buying one .

   i can understand like ~ 90 % of written lithuanian opened up delfi.lv comments and i found them funny and not cancerous at all , which confirms that i ca n't understand squat in written latvian .

  and you reply explaining that it 's not meant to be you come off as someone who supports it being built big time while in reality may not care at all about it and just dislike random shit being spread . 
   look at the figures that 's not figures , that 's a picture . 
  i 've not seen much past explaining that it 's not meant for purposes that russian news claim it to be for . 
  like `` protecting against russian tanks '' or so `` lithuanians would n't flee to russia '' and it 's not a wall , but a simple fence ffs .

  of course not , my own town was devastated by northern wars which were started by poles . 
  i rather prefer to not be attached to either . 
   but more seriously , do you think lituanians would have better position in union with sweden then in plc , why ? 
  this is alt-history , everything is possible , but given actual history it was a shitty deal sticking with you . 
   it was signed as effect of lithuania being conquered by sweden , i know that russian threat was real but was it really worth it ? 
  the only reason we ever entered union with poland was due to moscovites growing power , it should be an no brainer we would side with next country that could help us against russia in future . 
  who said all their operations are covered by other peoples money ? 
  what if something happens to you and you need an operation , why should my tax money be wasted on you ? 
  that 's pretty self centric , i can say same , that my taxes should n't go to you , but to me and only to me instead . 
  medicine is improving as time goes on . 
  you 're actually half right , they should pay for this kind of operation on their own , but then again not only transgenders would have a need of possible transplants that would cost a lot of money . 
  most transgenders i know have money problem because of how much money every operation cost , especially when psychiatrists force them to stay 24/7 on several pills to keep their mental health in `` good shape '' , it 's money sucking experience . 
  does n't mean they stop paying taxes ... 
  or you know esperanto . 
  pretty much same opinion as yours . 
  you do know , that transgender is also paying taxes ? 
  nice .

  yes ? 
   a bunch of hipsters who considered the polish culture to be way too mainstream for them , ** invented another culture for themselves ** basing it on purposefuly making all possible aspects of it the opposite of the polish one , while borrowing vocabulary from minor peasant dialects of samogitia and auksztota . 
  much to the surprise of the better part of inhabitants of former grand duchy , that group started to call themselves `` lithuanians '' . 
  man you ca n't write more retarded sentences than that can you ? 
   you are more russified than you think you do n't even know what the term means . 
   for example poland and italy are two completely different countries . 
  people look different , act different ... 
  political environment is different . 
  architecture is different . 
  dating habits are different . 
  even entertainment culture is different . 
  poles try to get drunk as fast as possible and start rubbing each other in clubs while italians are slow eaters and drinkers . 
  that 's not how it works . 
  european countries are unique of course , but comparing them to let say turkey , japan , india , iran makes them more similar than different .

  nothing weird in it , two different worlds . 
  i 'm not against mutual cooperation in modern times . 
  just do n't expect people to see plc as golden age as you do . 
   do you find muscovy rise as good outcome for lithuania ? 
  it was poland fault ? 
  you made your bed deal with fallout . 
  why do you assume things that i do n't say ? 
  can you please stop . 
  of course it was not good . 
  stop being so defensive and insecure over not wanting to have anything to do with poland . 
   regarding sweden , nice idea . 
  why lithuania did n't gone that way ? 
  because it was easier to expand into devastated ruthenian lands , than destroying both livonian and teutonic orders , also [ you prevented us ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/union_of_k\u0117dainiai ) ? 
   i admire plc i neither show admiration nor hatred . 
   during union of lublin gd requested polish help agains muscovy invasion . 
  i 'm not denying historical fact that the only reason we went for union was because of losing wars against muscovy . 
  -  you were asking for help , had your dynasty on our throne and starting positions was similar for you and us . 
  which is the problem , polish nobility intentionally prevented lithuania from being independent from polish crown . 
  * there was an attempt by grand duke vytautas the great ( ruled 1392 -- 1430 ) to receive the royal crown . 
  as discussed at the [ congress of lutsk ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/congress_of_lutsk ) , he was proclaimed king , and lithuania a kingdom , by sigismund , holy roman emperor , in 1430 , but the royal crown , which was sent by sigismund to vytautas , was intercepted by polish noblemen . 
  soon afterwards vytautas died , without being crowned as king . 
  * -  could you describe what was optimum solution for you ? 
  [ already did . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6kmn9a/happy_448th_birthday_polishlithuanian_commonwealth/djnbgvf/ ), 
  i expect union with sweden to happen , it was their geopolitical goal after all to rule whole baltic sea . 
  besides muscovy would n't have risen if gdl did n't kick golden horde from ex-kievan rus ' lands . 
  poland was also still fragmented when lithuania started to consolidate , we had time and opportunity . 
   lithanians had jagiellons on polish throne , yet they complain about polonisation . 
  hardcore polonization actually happened [ after napoleonic wars ] ( https://i.imgur.com/jbse6ii.jpg ) , when russia started russification . 
   they had opportunity which they did n't seized . 
  lithuania consolidated and christianized far later than poland , it should be non-brainer we would have to adopt polish customs in order to look more western . 
  besides during that time we had a lot of [ civil wars ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lithuanian_civil_war ) . 
   from my pov russification is cancer but i 'm biased both polonization and russification was cancer for lithuanian nation . 
  i never said i preferred russian rule , i said i preferred if poland and russia kept their nose in their borders . 
  what 's your point ?

  it is located south of turkey , west of syria and lebanon , northwest of israel , north of egypt and east of greece . 
  well everything what is described in the wikipedia article is already used by the standard taxi companies in lithuania , except ridesharing , that 's why i do not understand what 's so different about them . 
  you are the youngest brother . 
  you have to take some teasing . 
  i 'll just leave [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ulay2fvued8 ) here . 
  standing . 
  can you explain what 's the main difference between them and other taxi companies ? 
  is it ridesharing ? 
  it 's very hard to tell what 's hoc exactly about . 
  it 's more about human nature than other things , tho it takes place in the scenery of politics , lobbyism and backstage deals . 
  if you are on / r/europe than i definitely recommend you to check it out   the politicians can always be bought . 
  i guess that 's what i object the most . 
  do you want to say there are no `` clean '' politicians out there , who are ideologically driven ? 
  be it interests of the party , of the state or ( in the case of russia/putin ) of the idea of imperialism . 
  in other words , no one can * buy * putin , since he already owns the damn country .

  have you watched house of cards ? 
   more often than not people are driven by the seek of power . 
  some think it comes from money , ergo becomes businessmen with money . 
  others think it lies in politics . 
  so money is n't necessarily a force that has the influence , contrary , oligarchs become hostage of their own money and the politicians who 's decision may influence the upcoming deals etc.

  lithuanians do not use that word as a curse word . 
  however russians do . 
  tho probably it has more to do [ this ] ( https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/\u041f\u043e\u0437\u0430_\u043d\u0430_\u043a\u043e\u043b\u0435\u043d\u044f\u0445 ) and not the illness itself . 
  while one could definitely think that 's the case , actually not even 24hrs has passed after the crash and sergey lavrov already was blaming ukraine for not controlling their airspace and threatening to invade it because of that and because , as russia say , ukrainian army is attacking russia 's border guard stations and nearby villages . 
  there will be some idiots standing even behinds this kind of nonsense , tho it 's not the main reason theories like this exist . 
  purpose of their creation is to plant a seed of doubt in the heads of general population , so they would confuse themselves and think like `` well , it might have been that , but this one claims it 's the other thing ... or maybe it 's that ... we ca n't know for sure '' .

  every eu flag should be at half-mast, 
  wtf are you talking about ? 
  what knife in a back ? 
  no fucking law was changed , this fucking title is a total fucking lie . 
  thanks for your kind comments . 
  you are acting truly like an ally . 
  alright thanks for the input !, 
  we 'll think about it . 
  ^ ^ ^ not, 
  you want this law abolished because poles of lithuania ( 6 % of the population ) do not follow it ? 
  what about if polish minority leaders show the example on how to follow it and raise the flags themselves ? 
  cause in every other part of lithuania this law is followed thoroughly and almost everyone flies the flags on national holidays proudly . 
  w00t ? 
  well it 's some kind of education . 
  the fine for breaking this law is like 3 euros and i have never heard of someone getting that fine . 
  on the contrary , police on days like this try to educate the public and instead of fining they are [ gifting ] ( http://tv.lrytas.lt/?id=14046494191402350375 ) the flags and educating about the holiday etc. 
  it seems it just had a snowball effect thanks to / u/ama _ deo cause he 's the one who created this reddit headline and repeated that lie few times itt, 
  we have laws we have . 
  it 's required to raise the lithuanian flag on 3 occasions the year . 
  if you do n't like the law you can try to change it ( it was never attempted by no on ) either leave the country . 
  not following the law is not the solution , would you agree ? 
  also , there 's no law against putting polish flag on poland 's holiday . 
  the thing is polish minority in lithuania is lithuania 's internal affair and when poland as a country trying to dictate what we have to do with our own citizens it seems just as imperialistic as policy of russia . 
  yes , it seems that 's exactly what happened . 
  now knowing that fact , do you still think your media did not lie ? 
  at least the headline here on reddit is just absurd . 
  additionally , as i said , polish minority party voted for that proposal in the end because they know they can easily add whatever they like later on while debating about the law in the committees etc. 
  can you please translate the article or at least this part of the article properly ? 
  cause google translate kinda sucks . 
  anyways , from what i searched myself there was proposal yesterday in seimas ** by the polish minority party ** . 
  there 's results on voting about it . 
  http://www3.lrs.lt/pls/inter/w5_sale.bals?p_bals_id=-18705&amp;p_var=2 `` u\u017e '' translates to `` for '' , and * llraf * is * frakcija akciji wyborzcy poliakow na litwe * ( i tried to write that part myself without any help  this vote was not however a vote on the law itself , it was first of many votings which means `` do we agree to accept this proposal and work on it in committees and stuff '' . 
  the proposal [ text ] ( http://www3.lrs.lt/pls/inter3/dokpaieska.showdoc_l?p_id=462919 ) says :  4 straipsnis . 
  this actually proposes to allow the bilingual signs and to use the polish language in municipalities . 
  so ... once again . 
  polish media sometimes uses the same methods as russian media does . 
  the thing is these acquisitions are just not true . 
  our parliament did not pass any law regarding this . 
  you should stop believing your media 's propaganda . 
  in some cases it is as blatant as the russian one . 
  can you properly translate this part ? 
  perception would change if polish minority leaders would n't be so pro-russian . 
  playing a bit friendlier to the lithuania as a country would help too . 
  polish minority top politicians do not raise a lithuanian flag as is required by law on national lithuanian holidays and then do raise the polish flag on poland 's national holiday . 
  dafaq are you talking about ? 
  they were illegal always . 
  he have a law saying that all the public writings should be in lithuanian only and this law was in force for over 20 years . 
  you can always visit netherlands embassy to lay flowers and candles . 
  they do . 
  most russians sadly are very poorly educated , do not know foreign languages , and it 's the only info source they get . 
  and russians know how to manipulate media . 
  they have done it for almost a century during soviet times and really mastered it . 
  the ones who are educated enough to hear the different opinions , more often than not are defending the regime because of national pride and patriotic feelings . 
   russia will not invade a single nato or eu country . 
  we do n't know that . 
  we can assume that because we think that article no 5 would do it 's job in case of aggression . 
  but first of all , we have to believe it 100 % . 
  do we tho ? 
  i do not trust most european countries seeing how their politicians are acting now to defend baltics . 
  and even if we believe article no 5 would work , we have to convince russia western countries would not leave baltics alone . 
  so far putin is testing boundaries . 
  every day . 
  he is sending planes to test the baltic air police mission ( sounds of jets over vilnius has become a norm these days ) , he is conducting military exercises in kaliningrad and belarus where they are pretending to cut off corridor poland-lithuania while attacking baltics from every possible direction , he is sending his navy to our exclusive economic zone and disregarding our border guards , he is checking waters amongst russian minority communities in the baltics trying to find out whether they agree on crimean scenario ( thankfully our state department says with no luck so far ) . 
  not to mention what he is doing in georgia/ukraine/moldava and going unpunished , he just sees weak europe , he sees a lot of politicians and popular opinion shifting against us ( while he has good relationship with radical right as well green/left parties in europe ) . 
  so , does he believe that he ca n't touch nato/eu ? 
  i doubt that very much . 
   there 's no plausible victory or anything to make it worth it . 
  i am sorry to racially profile , but as an american you just do n't understand the mentality of russian people . 
  they feel patriotic towards their country not because they love the house where they grew up , not because they love the smell of bread they make , not because of their ( amazing ) poets and writers , but because of the imperialistic idea that is planted in their head throughout the generations . 
  it 's one of the corner stones of the russian culture . 
  there are 100 direct confirmed links to the rebels and the shooting itself .

   what does n't exist ? 
  god, 
  well i 'm okay with these , but i find it stupid to believe in something that does n't exist and fallow his rules just because some dude thousand years ago started a list of rules . 
  you just take time on it . 
  one language can help learn other in future . 
   take us in eu already . 
   if only we could . 
   believing in god obliges you to obey certain rules . 
  like ? 
  as much as you can make excuses for it , we did pretty much what poland was doing . 
  better accept it and move on . 
  he 's talking about taking over vilnius/wilno from lithuanians and us taking over klaip\u0117da / memelland from league of nations which was taken from german empire . 
  do n't you see he 's butthurted polish over vilnius . 
  he wants to point out that it had polish majority and was in polish possestion . 
  well i would like to see them united , since that 's the point today is to get european countries to be as close as possible so we could stand in world stage . 
  well this is true , the first american soldier fallen in to battle while protecting the baltic states will make usa go load and clear on russia . 
  ^ ^ at ^ ^ least ^ ^ i ^ ^ hope ^ ^ they ^ ^ will . 
  ^ ^ ^ please ^ ^ ^ amerika-senpai , ^ ^ ^ do ^ ^ ^ not ^ ^ ^ forget ^ ^ ^ us !, 
  if only we could . 
  them some people are mean when it comes to poland and lithuania relations . 
   response to what they see as aggressive encroachment by nato into russia 's `` sphere of influence , '' can russia just fu * k off already . 
  we do n't belong to them and they have no right to command what to do . 
  if i remember currectly `` you '' said sorry after we gained our independence . 
  send the saxons and we shall fight the reds once again . 
  well do n't you remember that we caught russian spy which was in our military ranks ? 
  it 's obivious they will try to have them everywhere . 
  i wonder what fate of eastern europe would be if nazis did n't happen and whole europe united against evil in the east . 
  what 's wrong with it , may a\u0161 ask ? 
  needs to become kingdom and give throne to lithuanian noble . 
  he was n't wrong at writing it , but it sound so funny . 
  well yeah nazi period was probably darkest . 
  but nazis in lithuania specificly choose nationalists or other evil people who would deal with local jewish population in order to make thing - `` ordinary people wanted them gone '' . 
   feel the smell what ? 
  i do n't really see how you can be proud of your country . 
  you 're just a citizen of specific country in which you were born . 
  you can truly be only proud of your accomplishments not what other did in past . 
  but if i needed to answer question , yes , i 'm . 
  since lithuanians were never good at making evil . 
  be proud bro , if not memelland/klaip \u0117da region where all the books and book smugglers aka `` knygne\u0161iai '' came , our language would probably did n't survive against harsh russifaction policies that russian empire took on us . 
  not hitler but more nazi germany that fallowed hitler . 
  i can feel all that freedom above me . 
  i ca n't hear you over all these eu moneys we getting . 
  thank god we got nato . 
  usa army here is best day of our lives . 
  and if you think we 're puppets , when it 's better to be puppet of usa than poor and everyones forgotten russia . 
  you kidding me ? 
  nobody in lithuania is even mentioning about kalainigrad , it 's forgotten land full of russians and bigger russian minority like in latvia and estonia is is least what we want . 
  battle of saule and battle of grunwald , best day of my life !, 
  for fallen baltic brothers !, 
  except gudija . 
  partitions of poland . 
  i guess , when austria , prussia and russia started to take over polish-lithuanian commonwealth territory and annex it bit by bit because of mismanagement of inside . 
  second from right and dude behind him looks most badass . 
  hehehe, 
  what is this / u/ama _ deo being nice to lithuanians ? 
  what a heresy . 
  that was my first thought too . 
  from what ? 
  this is just few people , which are irrelevant . 
  true , but i do n't really see lithuania or for that matter baltic states saying `` fuck eu '' . 
  he uses both minorities to get himself elected . 
  at least we 're not known ... 
  i did n't downvote you ... only for that part of trolling , because i was n't trolling . 
  here you go mr. butthurt . 
  are you so stupid or what ? 
  they 're allowed now if they 're in both languages . 
  and it 's guys problem for not knowing law about street names . 
  if a thief said that he did n't know that stealing is illegal would that make him immune from law ? 
  we do not disrespect you , what is this ? 
  where you get this from ? 
  irrelevant things make us disrespect you ? 
  oh yeah like poland fallow eu rules * caught * eurozone * caught * . 
  look at the date of this report ( january 9 , 2014 ) ... 
  i do n't know why are you so butt-hurted . 
  your minority lives perfect lives as any other lithuanian . 
  we do allow double street names ... about names you use latters that are not in our alphabet , but i 'm not so sure why they 're not allowed . 
  you call that an insult ? 
  this was purely made for laughs , not to insult . 
  i ca n't really give source on v. tomaszewski about getting paid , i just heard about it . 
   massmedias and authorities completly ignores our minorities , emmigrants or the whole diaspora . 
  only once donald came to meet with polish lithuanians and as he always does , he made alot of promises and all of them were lies . 
  this is the only reason we keep positive relations and it 's your gov , with your president which are sh ... ing on that since they know that we 'll do nothing about it . 
  are you trolling or what ? 
  maybe drunk from all that vodka . 
   if you would n't mistreat the polish minority , forbid them to use their language , close schools and insult in your massmedias , then maybe tomaszewski would n't cooperate with russian minority . 
  we do n't do that to the lithuanians , they have all minority rights like in the other eu countrties even if they live just in few villages . 
  he indeed said alot of bs , but you actually talking a lot of bs yourself when it comes to todays polish minority in lithuania . 
  we do not miss treat our polish minority , that 's total lie . 
  we do not forbid their language . 
  we close not only polish schools , we do not insult them in our media ( where the fuck this even comes from lol ) , tomaszewski does n't cooperate with russian minority , he uses both of them to get himself elected , so he could sh * t on our relations ( kremlin provides him money for that ) . 
  besides i do n't understand why you think we miss treat them ... like what the hell . 
  is your media saying that ? 
  while you completly believing that ? 
  why would we want to fuck eu ? 
  but you got no potatoe !, 
  our minorities are n't allied with russia , they just vote for waldemar tomaszewski because he brings false promises and just tries to create as much problems as possible . 
  i never encountered any lithuanian that wanted to talk about commonwealth . 
  because people do n't really know that it even existed , since they 're not into history . 
  lithuanian language existed , but it had no written form so we adopted ruthenian which was spoken and had written form in none-baltic parts of gdl . 
  lithuanians are friendly to foreigners , including polish , nobody actually gives two sh * ts about our conlfict in past .

  there are around 60 people with my last name on facebook . 
  ours are hot and steamy . 
  i think theirs are less steamy but it 's essentially the same . 
  everyone should have a sauna . 
   but will still teach their kids all the other necessary subjects like math , science , language , etc. ? 
  how many parents actually know those subjects beyond fifth grade level ? 
  definitely . 
  lots of young people here live in small apartments in the city centre , so often there is n't even enough space for a large tv . 
  if there is , it 's used for gaming or movies , not tv . 
  i personally do n't watch television because of the ads and because of scheduled tv shows . 
  it 's a lot easier with internet because i can pick what and when i want to watch something . 
  i am . 
  those taps are still very common even though the reason behind them is long gone . 
  all those houses had on-demand boilers . 
  worse , it 's like a carpet floor . 
  something like [ this . 
  ] ( http://i.imgur.com/nt5fqwk.jpg ) basically a living room carpet which ca n't even be removed , so it just accumulates crap for years and years . 
  and i saw that in several fairly nice , old houses in upper-class neighbourhoods . 
  many houses in england have carpets in the bathroom . 
  that room where water and other fluids splash around more than ~ ~ anyone ~ ~ anywhere else . 
  that room which is often full of steam and condensation . 
  that 's the room where they put a soft , fluffy carpet . 
  also , dual taps ( for hot and cold water ) but fortunately those are slowly going away . 
  in one house there was a single tap , but with two tubes within it . 
  cold and hot water would start mixing only after it left the tip of the faucet , so you 'd end up with a single stream of water , half of it cold and half hot . 
  it does n't , but you can legally add a name to your house number if you want . 
  some rural `` in the middle of fucking nowhere '' houses do n't have numbers at all , only a name . 
   but they were n't really discriminating , they did it to all people of ussr that 's what makes them worse than nazis . 
  the worst part is that the people in power are mostly the same . 
  as a result , they 're trying to use the same tactics . 
  they rigged the referendum in crimea and then said that the locals are on their own . 
  power was cut , pensions were frozen , foreign companies closed down , it 's a shit show . 
  my neighbour is originally from ukraine , his family left the area and came here for a few months during that time because it was really not safe . 
  local thugs were doing whatever they wanted to do . 
  now they 've relocated to odessa , which is currently reasonably safe . 
   there was no conquering after that sure , that 's technically correct . 
  only another fifty years of mass killings , slaughterhouses , deportations to siberia , etc. 
  arguably , soviets were worse than nazis . 
   russia is always the villain that 's correct , yes . 
  recently they 've started calculating how much we should pay them back for all those years of occupation . 
  they did n't stop being evil . 
   and they both know that conquering countries was already old in 1940s , it 's more trouble than it 's worth and that 's why neither usa nor russia does that . 
  except all of eastern europe which was occupied by russia ? 
  or do you think that nothing happened there ? 
  all those countries just joined the soviet union voluntarily ? 
  oh , the difference is huge . 
  compare territories which were occupied by those two and you 'll see that their goals are completely different . 
  let 's say , south korea and crimea . 
  everyone is scared , more or less , because russia is an unpredictable psychopath . 
  do n't say that `` georgians do n't give a shit '' because they certainly do . 
  it 's just that they ca n't do anything about it . 
  same with ukraine , russia still has plenty of government officials there who support occupation , so the pro-european politicians ca n't do much . 
   if politicians push the signpost crisis long and loud enough then it would get moved back but they ca n't , because russia would just send more soldiers and then cut off the gas supply to georgia . 
  they 've done it to other countries in the past , it 's not a new thing . 
   and russia does n't really have to do anything for ukraine to be a mess they still sent a bunch of soldiers and hundreds of supply trucks to destabilise the whole eastern side . 
  just to be safe , you know . 
   they 're trying to push ukraine to eu even without ukraine fixing itself . 
  good , let them do it . 
  they ca n't join until they fix stuff . 
  of course , russia will do everything they can to ensure that ukraine is a mess , because they do n't want yet another nato country bordering russia . 
   this is a russian soldier moving that one border sign , nothing else , nothing spectacular . 
  no , this is you making stuff up . 
  are you russian or something ? 
  russian soldiers have been pushing the border further and further into georgian territory for years , and never moving it back where it belongs . 
  us ambassador talked about this but putin has more important stuff to talk about , such as trump . 
   do you have anything to support that they do other than they claimed they will back in 2014 ? 
  [ they want to join nato ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-40557477 ) and they 've said years ago that they want to join eu . 
  they 're working on it . 
  they obviously wo n't be allowed to do either if they do n't fix their corruption problem . 
   the officials are not even trying to rebuild it that 's quite a statement , do you have anything to support it ? 
  are you asking why ukraine did n't rebuild their whole political system in a couple years ? 
  because you ca n't just rebuild everything quickly after many decades of corrupt pro-russian assholes . 
  ... what ? 
  this is n't some kid moving a sign in a town , this is official russian army moving border posts . 
  it just shows once again that russia does n't really care about such silly things as international laws and agreements . 
  south ossetia is still full of their soldiers . 
  russia has just moved their border further into georgia , because why not . 
   because there was no threat to russian military installations on krym from him . 
  correct . 
  but the citizens did n't like having a dick sucker as a president , so they kicked him out . 
  ukrainians are not too fond of russia and russia sees that as a threat , so they do the only thing they can : occupy . 
   while it 's somehow presented as `` we want to conquer teh whole world starting with ukraine hurr durr ! '', 
  maybe it 's because they sent soldiers to donbas . 
  and northern regions of georgia a few years earlier . 
  and pretty much every neighbouring country two decades ago . 
   simply put yanukovich was corrupt but reasonable with russia yanukovich was sucking putin 's dick all day long , that 's why he was kicked out . 
  ukrainian people have access to the internet and they see that europe is living way better than russia . 
  naturally , they did n't like that their president was pushing the country towards the east , as they 'd much rather live in a developed country . 
  there 's a lot of noise going on here about our alcohol consumption . 
  government has just passed a few laws restricting alcohol . 
  now it will be sold only during the day , from 10 am to 8pm , law goes into effect next year . 
  they 've also raised the minimum legal drinking age to 20 years . 
  they tried to ban alcohol from temporary bars , which pop up in city centres during the summer , but that law was rejected . 
  people are outraged because this is stupid and it wo n't change anything . 
  the biggest drinkers are jobless older guys in rural areas , who buy cheapest strong beer or vodka . 
  these laws wo n't affect them in any way . 
  also , our health minister admitted that he was one of the officials who supplied the numbers to the world health organisation . 
  he admitted that quite a lot was simply made up , real numbers are closer to 13 litres of pure alcohol per year , not 18 . 
  friend has a cabin in a small rural village , he said that those older local guys have already started moving towards homemade strong drinks because taxes on alcohol have been increased too . 
  we still do n't understand how we 're consuming more alcohol than france or italy , where a glass of wine with dinner is the norm .

  what happens when you want to buy carved elephant tusk from the black market ? 
  adidas yeezy 's , kanye west 's white t-shirt , levi 's , an expensive car , huge tv , a plane , etc ? 
  it is so much easier to afford for the person making more money albeit in a more expensive country . 
  the key difference is disposable income and not expenses as a percentage of income, 
  `` puola '' in lithuanian is a verb and it means '' ( he/she/it ) is attacking '' or `` attacks '' in some cases . 
  for example : `` teutonai puola pil\u012f '' - `` teutons are attacking the castle '' . 
  here 's some reality . 
  lithuania is poor and irrelevant perifery between east and west . 
  it either falls under west or russia 's influence . 
  being a neutral middleman who profits from both sides is impossible for a country like ours . 
  would you like to be current lithuania under eu or belarus under russia ? 
  there 's nothing inbetween for countries like that . 
  joining nato and eu was a security guarantee for the most part . 
  idk about you but i prefer the current state instead of following misha backwards . 
  in this version he just found out about eu funds being cut because of uk leaving . 
  nazi coup d etat to eat the brains of russian speaking babies, 
  huh ? 
  i have a feeling that poles think about lithuanians more than we do about poles . 
  it 's the same as saying lithuanian identity is about not being german . 
  you 're giving yourself too much credit . 
  maybe it was true in 19-20th century though , but now it 's all about being part of the baltic club rather than being opposite of something . 
  wow there , zhirinovsky, 
  member nazis raising from their graves and taking over ukraine ? 
   trump is putins boy in washington . 
  usa 's president has many powers , but he 's not an almighty , the american political establishment is ruling the country , an unruly president can be impeached by the congress if needed . 
  check what obama promised and what actually was done during his presidency , also compare it with the previous bush 's presidency . 
   the only real point of contention between the usa and russia has been the russian expansionist tendencies towards europe . 
  usa 's and nato 's role in the balkan conflict in the 90s , power play in the middle east ( atm it 's syria ) , europe . 
   if the us was to cave in and turn a blind eye to those expansionist tendencies , and phase out it 's involvement in nato in exchange for closer ties with russia a global power would cave in for almost an italy sized economy regional power ( who bosses around poor ex-communist states btw ) , which also happens to be historically the enemy ? 
   it would reduce the us military expenditure currently allocated to the protection of countries which are , like it or not , competing economies , and are way past due to start `` carrying their own weight '' in regards to the nato budget . 
  europe , after all , is comprised of countries where live like kings . 
  us will always have an interest in europe . 
  it 's a huge market and regional instability there would mean bad business and hurt usa 's economy . 
  usa 's military -- industrial complex holds an immense amount of influence on usa 's public and foreign policy . 
  cutting us military expenditure leads to immediate loss of jobs to the federal employees that are currently in service to the federal government as well as the private employees that work along side them and military personnel . 
  usa 's military in europe is there to keep it 's influence , it 's not a charity . 
   it would legitimize trump , `` the peacemaker '' only trump would care about that . 
  for usa 's influential military -- industrial complex it 's not an interest . 
   it would legitimize putin that 's not an interest of usa . 
   it could allow the us economy to tap into the vast wealth of russian natural resources , via trade agreements . 
  if that was important usa could have done that back in the 90s . 
  russia is n't the only country with natural resources . 
  apparently saudi arabia is more important trade partner and russia has shown that it 's not a reliable trade partner anyway . 
  calling it : there will be a massive dick waving between trump and putin and tensions will escalate like never before . 
  `` fresh start '' or `` restart '' in u.s.-russia relations happened before and such talks will happen many times in the future . 
  holy brusselian empire ? 
  who will give the speech `` mr. trump , open this gate . 
  mr. trump , tear down this wall ! '', 
  this time ? 
  a standard procedure, 
  i would n't worry too much . 
  russia and putin himself always reminds everyone who it and he really is if somebody forgets and starts to have some delusional thoughts . 
  diverse and interesting ? 
  better inject polonium just in case, 
  rain for the rainland . 
   baltantis who would name a city as `` white-duck '' ? 
   until very recently estonia spent as much on defense as latvia and lithuania combined . 
  ] ( http://i.imgur.com/ew6jcz9.png ) source : [ defence expenditures of nato countries ( 2009-2016 ) ] ( http://www.nato.int/nato_static_fl2014/assets/pdf/pdf_2016_07/20160704_160704-pr2016-116.pdf ), 
  it would be , but baltic states are n't united as one would think , the countries compete among themselves a lot . 
  it would take at least a decade to agree on where the headquarters should be and the format . 
   nato should be dismantled and a new , more framework which includes russia should be made . 
  russia is not the ussr anymore . 
  thanks for the laugh, 
  `` estonians are slow '' did come from ussr and lithuanians do joke about estonians . 
  but most jokes about stereotypes are `` multi-national '' , they usually involve an estonian , an american , a russian and a jew . 
  estonian character being the punchline . 
  petty . 
  we call finland `` suomija '', 
  56 seats out of 141 . 
  it 's the largest single party mandate number gained since 1996 . 
  the runner-up party won 31 seat , but it 's not realistic for them to form a ruling coalition with other parties except with the party that won the elections . 
  people are tired of the same two party nomenclature . 
  every four years social democrats would lose to christian conservatives and the after the next election christian conservatives would lose to social democrats , such swings was the norm until now . 
  conservative party could n't have won the majority of mandates this time because of cutting pensions in the past and making pensioners live in poverty , they also have a weak leader now , who basically `` inherited '' the party control . 
  peasant greens essentially got the protest votes since they did n't promise a ~ 1 billion euros average wage ( / s ) like the other established parties , the party promised to revise the new controversial labor codex reform , try to tackle the alcoholism and unemployment problem in the countryside , implement progressive taxes , to deal with poverty and regional exclusion and etc. 
  there were also populist talks like `` we wo n't let lithuanian people be mocked anymore '' . 
  peasant greens also won the tv political debates . 
  if not for the scandal of the liberal party leader taking a bribe , the liberal party would have won this election . 
  voters did a gamble and now we need to see if it pays off or we 'll burn . 
  effective public relations . 
  i envy them . 
  it 's pretty dead, 
  there actually were latvian vikings - [ curonians ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/curonians ) . 
  raiding norsemen settlements and sometimes joining alliances with them . 
  no offense , but viking is just a fancy name for a `` pirate '' and pirating was n't limited to scandinavia . 
  [ documentary ] ( https://youtu.be/eqotph9gesq ) about curonians . 
  it might be a cultural thing if being a semi - [ banana republic ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/banana_republic ) is seen as the most optimal way . 
  i mean if they 're happy with the way things work over there then why should n't we be happy for them as long as they stay behind their walls ? 
   canada has as high and higher standards as any other western country so it 's barely edible food then . 
  you might want to do some research before opening your mouth about food quality .

   the judges approved a request by one of the plaintiffs in the case to call gorbachev to the court as a witness . 
  hey , neither do you, 
  weird airspace block names . 
  two central `` europes '' : europe central and central europe ; denmark and sweden is `` denmark-sweden '' , uk and ireland is `` uk-ireland '' , but poland and lithuania is `` baltic '' . 
  it is unfortunate that such media outlets are influential, 
  neither `` daily mail '' or `` the sun '' are credible media outlets . 
  it also reports fake stories . 
  because modern lithuania is an ethnic baltic state , no former gdl lands . 
  lithuania is bigger than denmark , but nobody calls it small ?

  do you spend all your money on food ? 
  yes actually . 
  everything but meat is similar enough . 
  and meat is lower because they have reduced vat on meat . 
  food price is literally the same across eu since it 's the same market , please stop comparing food prices it 's pointless . 
  meh , old news . 
  because they were 20 in the soviet union .

  that 's why mine are riveted in . 
  almost lost it in the carwash once and decided that would suck . 
  you should visit us more often , we should visit you more often . 
  we used to have a car that was flooded . 
  some stuff did rust , but not all at once , starter had to be replaced because it seized up . 
  you just have to make sure to clean the computer and maybe grease all the open connections there to stop the rust , if the connections are aluminium it takes a very long time even if you did n't . 
  nothing else is afraid of water in a car , just the electronics .

   do potatoes sink ?

  tbh vilnius floods more often than any other city in lithuania so the rain collection systems kinda suck either way .

  to protect people who are unaware .

  so your phone is broken therefore every phone is . 
  yes . 
  but in general it still works well enough . 
  if it just drops the top end below 100db it 's good enough .

  lithuania during that time was quite split between smetona - our president/authoritarian ruler and voldemaras - fascist that was working in nazi germany in later years of interwar lithuania . 
  jews were very supportive of first soviet occupation , most notable nachman dushanski . 
  balkans have ethnicity wars , we have history wars in former plc land . 
  [ come at us and find out . 
  winter war boosted national pride even more , praise the russians !, 
  actually contrary , pu is the reason why our enemy in the east got stronger . 
  [ personal union with poland ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/union_of_lublin ) and [ russia happened . 
   what makes you think that poles would priotize lithuanian nationalist-imperialist ambitions , over the right of self determination of local polish majority population ? 
  i 'm not talking about vilnius region , i 'm talking about whole of lithuania , you tried to do a coup that would enforce us to join poland . 
  poland was far more imperialistic than nay other neighbouring nation out side soviet russia . 
   ypical lithuanian argument , conveniently ignoring that poland already had a control of the city before \u017beligowski 's revolt pretty much since we regained independence in winter of 1918/1919 ( with interlude of bolshevik control between january and april 1919 ) , till the soviet takeover in june 1920 . 
  we already had control of vilnius since our proclamation of independence ( february 16 ) from vilnius itself , that was within kingdom/republic of lithuania . 
   i actually do n't really care that much about almost uninhabited swamps of polesie , or mostly ukrainian volhynia , as there were virtually worthless once it was apparent that mi\u0119dzymorze / federation wo n't come to fruition ( though it was only apparent after the disastrous riga peace treaty where our belarusian and ukrainian allies were betrayed , in my opinion we should have actually pushed further to help them create their own states , as pi\u0142sudski originally envisioned but alas dmowski 's nationalists were against it ad screwed it up ) . 
  the only moral ambivalence i feel about it is that it did save people living there from soviet totalitarianism - though in such case , the polish government definitely should have given a great deal of local autonomy to polesie , volhynia and stanis\u0142aw\u00f3 voivodships - another great mistake interwar poland did . 
  local autonomy , not creating ruthenian republic as buffer state . 
  you were as much occupational force to them as soviets were . 
   anyhow , the only thing i justify are polish control of the polish-majority area in the northeast of the country , and the polish control of the historically polish ( a part of kingdom of poland since 1340 ) , ethnically mixed in proportions ranging from 40-60 to 50-50 in the southeast of the country . 
  vilnius was not part of kingdom of poland , neither was eastern lithuania , yet you annexed it . 
   til that hard facts and statistics are `` ultranationalistic tendencies '' . 
  facts and statistics can interpreted , given different agenda , yours that poles were morally good , but never bad . 
  sometimes . 
   you were n't ? 
  you surely seemed like ones from the polish perspective , considering what the soviet-lithuanian treaty of summer 1920 entiled . 
  giving soviets military access when their offensive against poland continued ? 
  access through territory that poland/soviets occupied , not through already controlled lithuanian territory . 
  what makes you think that lithuanians will prioritize poland over lithuania 's independence ? 
   or most importantly , taking as a gift a portion of territory soviets just took from poland ? 
  it was not a gift , we already had control of the city before you occupied it , you forgetting \u017deligowski revolt ? 
  poles revolting against poles , does n't sound right , does it ? 
   it stems from the lithuanian obsession in trying to portray poles as evil that 's what your own imagination is thinking . 
   use to justify their blatant landgrab of ethnic polish teritory wile\u0144szczyzna was in the first half of the 20th century . 
  says pole , who tries to justify ukrainian , belarusian land grab . 
  quite sad , vilnius was never part of poland prior to aftermath of ww1 . 
   very infuriating for someone having enough historical knowledge to see through their bullshit . 
  yeah right , definitely not fuelled and blinded by ultra nationalistic tendencies . 
  constantinople never forget . 
  cyprus gave me a bit of stretch , due to turkish cyprus . 
  because the former two were most influential ? 
   well because your `` pan-european heaven '' did n't include them and you spoke about them like you did . 
  for the last three replies were about this so you are just backpedalling now . 
   having said that i found this still hilarious and annoying . 
  what do you think you have compared to us actually ? 
  if you think commonwealth is all yours first you are wrong , secondly still they pale in comparison ( especially in their length ) to the ottoman empire . 
  they were a good rival though . 
  travel to turkey , greece , italy , france , britain and germany . 
  it 'll do good to you . 
  i still do n't understand why are you involving germany , france , italy , we 're all european , i look at myself as european we 're one people , which you 're not part off . 
  it has nothing to do with lithuania or ottoman empire life span . 
   i think it is quite clear your grandfather was a collaborator from you and him hanging out with germans . 
  so do n't lie . 
  wait , wait , drinking beer , giving soap is now collaboration with nazis ? 
   your grandmother on the other hand probably did n't do anything . 
  sad to see someone punished for his husbands crimes . 
  are you really that fucking retarded ? 
   i wish your grandfather a suffering death because he was a collaborator . 
  yes , you actually are , that really , retarded . 
   you are disgusting but probably i can find lithuanian bodies too probably . 
  though you probably consider jews something foreign to you so it narrows down a little . 
  because jews were foreign , they supported first soviet invasion , one of the infamous jew - nachman dushanski , created hell on earth for lithuanians : according to the coroner 's examination after the exhumation , both the report and the testimonies of witnesses , concurred that the soviets cut off tongues , ears , genitals , scalps , put genitals into mouths , picked out eyes , pulled off fingernails , made belts of victims ' skins to tie their hands , burned them with torches and acid , crushed bones and skulls , all done while the prisoners were still alive. , the organizers of the massacre included pyotr raslan , boris mironov , nachman dushanski , political leader of 8th border army mikhail kompanyanec , nkvd kretinga county deputy director yermolayev , nkvd lieutenant zhdanov and others . 
   i do n't understand . 
  i never heard of a idiom like that . 
  did you try to translate it from yout language ? 
  that 's not an idiom and there does n't exist such thing in our language , because we neither commit crimes , nor do we need to hide . 
  you will have to earn it , gib throne . 
  why ? 
  but ... it 's very sexy ... 
   i like how the main two arguments criticizing the eastern borders of interwar poland are internally contradictory . 
  did you make up this `` meme '' ? 
  because we do n't say such things . 
   poland circa 1920 was fighting for its survival against soviet russia , so it should n't come as a surprise that later that year it did n't have a soft spot for soviet russia 's co-belligerents such as the republic of lithuania we were n't soviet co-belligerents what are you talking about ? 
  you do realize we were also fighting against soviets for our own survival . 
  besides what makes you think we will have soft relations with poland after failed 1919 polish coup d'\u00e9tat attempt in lithuania ? 
  - i do n't understand what is your obsession with lithuanians in trying to portray them evil and poland the holy good nation . 
   you still exist with nazi 's you would n't have existed . 
  latvia was a dying nation under ussr , ethnic latvian population shrank ~ 20 % while ethnic russian population tripled , ussr did same shit with their sovietization ( russification ) policy , just in a lot slower pace , so world would n't notice shit . 
   no without them your grandfather would have been killed in one way or another and your mother and your dad and their slavic dog too . 
  you do know lithuanians are not slavs , but balts ? 
  unlike slavs or jews we were n't considered `` sub-human '' by nazi germany . 
  my grandfather had aryan look , i have aryan look too ( green eyes , light hair ) , but i 'm not here to defend nazi ideology , but rather the fact that my grandfather had higher possibility to die from old age under nazi regime than being tortured , mutilated with acid in forest by nkvd squad for not `` obeying '' to soviet occupation . 
   ever heard of generalplan ost ? 
  yes , everyone knows that . 
   do n't they teach you history ? 
  they do , but apparently you 're low educated . 
  [ here ] ( http://www.lituanus.org/1956/56_3_02drunga.html ) , a little drop for you . 
  one day , ruthenian friend , one day . 
   * ex-soviet shitholes * was that really necessary ? 
  ( \u0361 \u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361 \u00b0 ) come here ~ ~ belarus ~ ~ gudija , we can be grand ' again . 
  those two go hand to hand . 
  it 's not something that can be fixed over few decades . 
  yes we would , soviets stop at their border , western allies sweep from west right up ussr 's borders , whole of europe is actually liberated and happy . 
  or rather when uneducated population is sent into blender by madman . 
  russia is is full of both . 
  without them my great grandfather would been alive for far longer . 
  no death camps ? 
  and , yes , nkvd had gas chambers . 
  we should finally go full japan/australia mode in mediterranean sea . 
   poland and hungary fucked everyone with their refusal to take fair share of refugees . 
  please , tell me how many isreal has taken syrian refugees , while living next door to them . 
   balts estonians are not balts . 
  besides if russia extradite war criminals that drove tanks over unarmed lithuanian civilians during january ' events we might talk about warmer relations .

  `` visiting pubs '' and `` safe '' are odd ways of saying that every ira bomb this century has blown up in west london . 
  i 'm sure the eu would be able to send in * impartial * `` peace keepers '' for once in that region . 
  everyone has seen the steps taken by the crown in terms of `` pacification '' ... 
  heck !, 
  even wales can drop in . 
  considering the history of the past few hundred years , the anglos are probably the biggest friends of russia in europe . 
  then again , the way russia treats `` friends '' , maybe it 's better for everyone to just step back and let russia `` sort itself out '' first over then next century . 
  it 's actually kind of a strange , dark comedy about how all roads lead to russian materiel being directly responsible for the shooting down of the plane , from actual on-the-ground intelligence , and the russian social media evidence , to the cat and mouse game of discovery by investigators and russian deletion of evidence always a day late . 
  get out and shut up is the reality , not option . 
  besides that , the faster that the uk `` gets out '' , the faster scotland can get in . 
  this is all about letting the uk preserve it 's `` sovereignty '' as much as letting the nations of the uk * assert * theirs by joining the eu and taking their own paths, 
  of course scotland will leave the uk and join the eu ... most likely that northern ireland will also . 
  i think the eu would be happy to admit them quicker , and then england and wales can join , too !, 
  they 've been wonderful , homestyle failings since 1066 , though , and everybody is used to them and loves them . 
  a lot of it is even `` by appointment of '' stuff . 
  at least the ones you see where all the tourists go and where they might pass through . 
  go too far east and ... well ... 
  do n't cry , baskets , you 're not that kind of clown . 
  hell , ya ... considering most of those `` kids '' here in euro-land live with their parents up to their early thirties ... all those `` disposable relationships '' until you find either the proper match in your caste or that richer dumber potential partner . 
  this means you 're still drunk , and you still believe that some people in the country you went to gave half a ghost-white turd about your project there . 
  here , let me google translate it for you ... https://translate.google.lt/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=ru&amp;u=http://www.rbc.ru/politics/21/05/2016/57402c9a9a7947f07014cb3c%3ffrom%3dnewsfeed&amp;prev=search my apologies , we seem to be out of watercress garnish ... 
  sell them back to moscow ... it 's a much more `` capitalist '' message . 
  of course , sold to the highest bidder for destruction is always a possibility , also . 
  no , beef prices go down because you get less quality cuts ... the better and best is being exported to the us and elsewhere with the assistance of subsidies from the eu . 
  all the premium lithuanian beer does come in plastic bottles for every brand over 500 ml or one pint . 
  my point is that under the law , lithuanian beer production was put on the same importance as medicine production when one of the larger breweries threatened a strike a few years ago . 
  and if you follow macaroni sales , lithuanian macaroni , the cheap yellow kind , does n't sell very well compared to the durum production form other countries , such as italy ... most people only buy domestic macaroni when it 's sold at deep discount . 
  rice ... they do n't make it here , it sells anyways . 
  by that reasoning , the shelves in rimi should always be full of that cheap pole-brewed beer that flies off the shelves there , and those cheap cans in maxima move more than kalnapilis . 
  `` beer is n't a necessity ... '' guffaw !, 
  you are n't lithuanian enough to remember the beer wagon everday at turgus and turgelis , as well as the lines of people with bottles , bokalus , and buckets . 
  if beef `` is n't a thing here '' , please explain why lithuania sought to pursue beef exports to the us , being only one of two eu countries allowed to export to the us ? 
  explain why supermarkets would `` boast '' that their beef is from lithuania , yet only sell the cheaper grades of beef , while the better cuts are exported . 
  beef and pork both have the same shelf life , ground or as cuts . 
  `` beef is n't a thing here . '', 
  ... i 'll be sure to tell mcds , hesburg , as well as the significant number of restaurants serving steaks ... 
  i think maybe you mean `` is n't a thing amongst those who lived under soviets ... '' since most of the people eating beef are 40s and under . 
  ... followed by another not-as-small one . 
  which will be shown to be followed by another few not so small ones , to today . 
  tag, 
  even if it functions wrong , in russia it still functions ... 
  and then they earned operation barbarossa by renegging on the molotov-ribbentrop and invading the baltics , particularly lithuania , which was to remain in the german sphere ... yep , they stepped in it deep then : the world burned . 
  the difference here is that is the allegations seem true , they can certainly be proven . 
  the wada keeps samples frozen for ten years under the presumption that a nice collection of samples acts as a reliable deterrent in doping cases ... 
  i 'd expect to hear about the `` proof '' in either a negative or positive statement within three weeks . 
  coincidentally , russians have seen a 90 pct drop in disposable income in the past two years . 
  so , even if you do consider that polish taxes on food are 5 % and 8 % , while lithuania 's are 21 % , then how does that figure into an across the board cost of living which is more than 18 % in lithuania ? 
  and if it 's all vat , why , in hungary with a vat on most food ( and so many other things , like public transport ) of 25 % , can lithuania 's cost of living be 10 % higher ? 
  the big grocers are definitely afraid of lidl coming in a blowing stuff up , rimi already started their `` choose stability '' campaign , which is code for `` stay with what you know ... even if we seem to be gouging you . '', 
  you did notice that for 2016 , there is food inflation on that bar chart ... 
  i hope . 
  if you 're going to talk about the price of bread in germany , then explain why , or how germans can send 500 ml cans of beer to the lithuanian market for 0.33 or 0.50 euros each , when lithuanian beer is never even that cheap ? 
  cauliflower is actually quite cheap in the uk right now ... a `` glut '' even . 
  in lithuania , up until last couple years , there was no property tax , unless your property was like large second home , or your home is worth more than 300,000 euro , or something ... lithuania has many more homeowners per capita than , say us ... property tax is n't going to fly so well ... besides , then they would have to provide some services , like plowing the roads in the winter . 
  here in lithuania , 2nd class produce is almost the rule , certainly not the exception , and the stuff i 've seen people bringing back from their shopping trips , particularly beef , is of a much higher standard than what is at the big stores in lithuania . 
  a friend brought back skirt steak , prime ( or standing ) rib , the prices were about the same for rump here in vilnius , only that you ca n't even find these kinds of cuts in vilnius . 
  it really does depend on how the brexit crumbles . 
  no one wants any celebration for any anniversary of anything that should have never happened , anyways . 
  ni and scotland would certainly be welcome in the eu ... it 's just too bad the whole `` britain '' thing had to come with them ... 
  not from what i 'm told ... 
  i live in a country between russia , and on the weekends , russian `` tourists '' often visit , loading up their cars with boxes of processed meats , cheese and other dairy products . 
  kazakhstan is not only partly in europe , but in terms of culture is much closer to europe , also . 
  what tech and cars come from poland ? 
  ` cuz we make the same cars here , but we also make shitloads of fast lasers ( for shark applications , of course ) . 
  it 's not based on ethnicity , as it did n't say german-americans , or german-austrians , it specified citizenship . 
  they make the cheese with palm oil now ... 
  i do n't even wan na know what 's in the bread and `` salami '' . 
  they ca n't tell lithuanian from latvian ... who knows what really was going on ... or how feasible ... 
  it 's funny how those with no future want to share that with everybody . 
  remember hw long it took until well into the 1980s before there was any reporting of russian casualties in afghanistan ... less than a few hundred up until 1986 or so ? ... 
  who needs sources when people are taking pictures of everything from the graves on the edges of the cemeteries to things like this : http://noorimages.com/feature/journey-of-the-dead-from-ukraine-to-russia/ many thousands unaccounted for , or claimed dead in syria , which is a nice cover for the ongoings in ukraine . 
  nope , no sources allowed ... you know as a russian that reporting on war casualties is against the law . 
  nobody wants a border , hard or otherwise . 
  sinn fein will be the majority next election , that 's certain . 
  reunification of ireland is inevitable , and not only the changing demographics of a more catholic northern ireland will bring it , but brexit will force it . 
  we 're all headed for an anniversary that nobody wants to celebrate , particularly with a new , hard border , and the unpleasantries that that whole thing brings with it . 
  it 's inevitable , and everyone on the island will be able to deal with it . 
  it will be the best agreement made concerning the peoples involved . 
  people are realizing that there 's a `` party '' coming up that nobody wants to attend . 
  you do n't find it a bit possible that after ni voted `` stay '' on june 23 , as compared to the majority of the uk , that perhaps a lot of people of the province were quite swayed over martin mcguinness ' declaration of a `` democratic imperative '' to have an island-wide vote ( although it would probably be restricted to ni ) on reunification concerning the artificial partition ... and perhaps that this is why sinn fein has ( and will continue to ) been gaining support ? 
  it 's pretty clear that there will be some kind of vote coming up . 
  unionists do n't want , and have rejected `` special status '' . 
  a land border would be an extreme violation , basically a broken treaty between the eu `` outsider '' of the uk , and ireland , an eu state ... the sides to be taken are obvious , as are the effects on any trade ( as well as other ) agreements between the eu and the uk . 
  nobody wants an `` anniversary '' of the years that 's coming up soon , least of all the people of northern ireland , as it 's pretty clear . 
  i 'd say sinn fein winning 50 % is about as far from `` massive support for staying in the uk '' as you can get , besides a majority of votes for sinn fein . 
  but hey , your call , i guess . 
  ... only the ones that imply `` exit '', 
  it 's not even funny how a country can have a hard time dealing with russia , even though they are basically on the `` other side of the world '' yet there are people in that country that ca n't fathom having the distinct displeasure of being not only neighbors , but serial victims of them . 
  also , members of the wto agree that that decisions reached by the dispute settlement must be adhered to . 
  in most countries ( perhaps not russia , though ) this would be considered an international treaty and law . 
  something like an `` unofficial niexit poll '' should be a first step . 
  i do n't know about a special exemption concerning a border , though ... perhaps a simple reunification is possible ... as a simple partition was less than 100 years ago . 
  it 's not too late to fix the fuck up , and avoid the unpleasantry that a century anniversary will surely bring . 
  most americans did n't vote for trump ... thus , the conclusion stands based on your attempted argument . 
  smell that deliciousness ? 
  that 's niexit starting to cook !, 
  wow ... niexit seems palpable now . 
  how about weed ? 
  is weed legal in finland ? 
  ` cuz it 's gon na take a boatload of weed before i even consider getting married to guy , even a finnish one , without smoking a lot of weed ... and he 's gon na have to possess a lot of weed , too .

  the qualification seem to be so low these days that virtually all politicians are populists . 
  it seems to be more like party/politician i do n't like = = populist . 
  they did n't specify that they caught someone through surveillance . 
  a lot of terrorist are caught when they 're ratted out by friends/family or police infiltrates their outer circle . 
  these days `` populist '' seem to be just a good boogeyman . 
  in most cases it require further definition how certain politician/party is populist . 
  why use a term that barely means anything ? 
  without death , there would be either over population or no births . 
  neither is good for evolution . 
  the thing is everybody defines `` respect '' differently . 
  what may seem good enough for one , may be not enough for somebody else . 
  as for catalonia , it looks like there 's no majority that wants to stay part of spain . 
  i 'm pulling the numbers out of my ass but i think they 're somewhat correct . 
  let 's say 30 % are pro-spain , 30 % are pro-independence and the rest do n't give a shit . 
  if there 's a referendum , in-the-middle people are much more likely to vote pro-independence . 
  just for the sake of change . 
  because it 's cool . 
  to piss off the establishment . 
  the pro-spain side do n't have this vibe . 
  all the pro-indepence side needs is few dumb laws to push in-the-middle people to independence side . 
  this is exactly the situation we had in late 80s in lithuania . 
  there was a vocal minority who were pro-independence . 
  there were some pro-ussr people . 
  the rest did n't give a shit for independence . 
  then economy hit the fan even worse , few dumb laws were enacted , pro-indepence people did a great marketing campaign , stars aligned in a specific order ... and 5 years later ~ 80 % of people were pro-indepence . 
  they did n't magically become hardcore nationalists . 
  but they preferred this side over ussr . 
  yes , there were many more reasons than catalan vs spain . 
  some people were pro-indepdence purely for market economy , democracy or no police state . 
  but what i 'm saying is , there 's no need to have majority who want something . 
  it 's enough to not have majority who do n't want something . 
  the people in the middle can be easily agitated for one reason or another , for better or worse . 
  i 'd even say it 's good that nothing is eternal . 
  if something stays up too long , it 's likely to do more harm than good . 
  like in biology , death is a requirement for evolution . 
  everything always changes for the better . 
  however , from one 's perspective the change may not look better . 
  but competing different approaches gives the best result in the end . 
  i would n't want to live in a world where everybody share the same views and always agree on best way to go . 
  but they do n't want to be part of their respective parent states . 
  eu is not some saint structure that can do no wrong and everybody will love it forever . 
  no matter how tightly you integrate stuff , someone will want out sooner or later . 
   edit : also , with `` russians live in the same world as i do '' i meant `` a world after ww2 '' . 
  west and east perception of ww2 and `` after ww2 '' is very different . 
  while west were pushing for peace and stuff , ussr/russia did n't give a shit about it . 
  and it seems it still does n't . 
  it would n't `` end the squabbling about exits once and for all '' . 
  some people would still want their own state . 
  just take a look at catalonia or scotland . 
  or ussr collapse . 
  all of these were supposed to be united forever . 
  another part of hard work is for young people to either revive existing parties or create new ones . 
  yes , it 's hard . 
  yes , i should shut the fuck up and join some party instead of posting nonsense there  i 've been in/near some youth organisations and the upcoming politicians generation seem to be better than current one . 
  although it 'll be many times better than the current crop . 
  looking backwards , it 's easy to see progress since 90s . 
  some shit that is called out nowadays would n't have made news 10 years ago . 
  fun fact , we recently elected farmers-greens party , running on family values , modesty , anti- ** e ** migration , anti-establishment and anti-corruption platform . 
  their leader just bought cadillac escalade for $ 150k and was caught grey-legally leasing another expensive suv for his apparent mistress through his company . 
  while his wife and children are in spain  massive political crisis is ongoing for the past week . 
  there 's even a slight chance of impeachment for mp and few related figures are already on the way to be fired . 
  10 years ago , this would be + / - normal . . 
  not much worse than in vilnius . 
  if you make average salary , no chance to live alone . 
  if both partners make average salary , rent + food is doable . 
  buying . . well . . on average salary , a small rundown apartment in soviet built shack is best you can aim for . 
  he probably meant `` hard work '' not only as in working daily job , but trying to fix the gov overall too . 
  only if young and educated people would vote for their companions we can fix it in the long run . 
  if young/educated/smart people leave , who is there to elect a better gov who will fix stuff ? 
  there 's not only monetary part . 
  it creates big demographic issues . 
  less customers = less businesses , further increasing emigration . 
  pretty much whole ee would agree . 
  actually , it looks like most of we would agree too . 
  higher we living standards and nominal wages still look good to us peasants though . 
  as you said yourself , the tradition in most of ee is to own housing . 
  thus there 's no developed rent market . 
  although rent is nowhere near crazy like in major we cities . 
  and if you 'd move to some small-town germany/france/etc to have cheap rent ... well , you probably wo n't have a good time there . 
  in most cases major ee city is better than that . 
  and small ee cities have housing for peanuts . 
  this may or may not be referring to new plant they 're building . 
  it 's built right next to lithuanian border and they 'll use neris river water for cooling . 
  neris river ( or river that it goes to ) passes all 3 major lithuanian cities . 
  as a bonus , it 's 30km from vilnius . 
  but + / - wasteland on belarus side . 
  lithuanian there . 
  i always turn off the water . 
  * potatoes hiding intensifies *, 
  i 'd say slightly authoritarian . 
  vocal political opponents are . . taken care of . 
  but aside from that it 's ok . 
  when i visited , it did n't seem like there 's any `` secret police '' or whatever . 
  + / - same level as belarus . . ? 
  not with that attitude , 
  lithuania is mostly emigrant since joining eu . 
  we had quite a different experience during ussr times though . 
  nowadays immigrations quite low , but it 's growing . 
  mostly ex-ussr and very few africans/asians . 
  we had quite a few jews too .

  kitchen staff are motivated to preform well because they get bigger wages if their managers think they are doing good service . 
  they are motivated to preform well in different ways , but the principle is the same . 
  good motivation - good service . 
  no motivation - lousy service . 
  i found links to those articles in the new american from a more credible source , so i did not bother checking what other stuff they publish . 
  well completely state owned healthcare would mean not having the ability to choose a private clinic . 
  our politicians are working on destroying any private owned health care institutions , and they are saying that they are following the nordic or british model which is quite absurd . 
  it 's a sensitive topic because the state owned healthcare institutions are utter rubbish in my country ( and in most other post soviet states ) . 
  tell me , can your visit to a private healthcare institution be financed by the state ( i 'm not sure like you have insurance money , that you can use in an institution of your choice - private or state owned ) ? 
  i 'm asking out of curiosity , because that would be the ideal model in my opinion . 
  i have heard that you have something similar in norway . 
  and about the statistics . 
  i 've lead a few sociological studies and so far and i can tell you that you can usually make the conclusions you like from any set of statistics . 
  comrade stalin once said that there are three types of lies in the world - small lies , big lies and statistics . 
  sometimes understanding motivation and incentives helps better that analyzing statistics . 
  if a waiter would get equal pay regardless how he serves his customers , he would most likely not be motivated to serve well . 
  same with any institution - if good performance is not connected with rewards , and misbehavior and corruption with punishments , quality of services should go down . 
  some more satisfying sources : http://www.bmj.com/content/347/bmj.f4779 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/liverpool_care_pathway_for_the_dying_patient http://www.theguardian.com/society/2013/jul/15/liverpool-care-pathway-independent-review http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-23698071 i 'm almost tempted to do the `` let me google that for you '' thing . 
  state - owned healthcare institutions have a tenancy to go wrong , because they can not be controlled by their patients by simply taking there business elsewhere . 
  if you can not choose the provider of services they have a tendency to fall in quality . 
  a bit about the liberal model in the nordics : http://www.economist.com/news/special-report/21570840-nordic-countries-are-reinventing-their-model-capitalism-says-adrian as always , downvoted for anything that goes against the `` momy state shall take care of me best '' consensus . 
  r/europe i am disappoint . 
   an honest days work for an honest days pay horse shit if this is the horse shit that people in modern eu countries are against , then i am disgusted by modernity . 
  the scandinavian model is far from socialism . 
  they have simple and effective tax systems , transparent government , and they even implement the voucher system in schools and ( i think ) healthcare . 
  even the taxes are not so sky high as most people tend to think . 
  meanwhile in usa they have a clusterfuck of lobbyists from big pharma , agro and military hardware companies in bed with the congress . 
  and the dominant mechanism of earning money has long been one of paying the congress to regulate your competition out of business . 
  the usa is kept afloat by small business and individual creativity , while the industrial sector is completely messed up by lobbying . 
  the scary thing is that eu and brussels is also becoming a huge breeding ground for lobbyists and sell out politicians . 
  the wild west , free capitalist states of america sadly exist only in westerns and fantasies of people who prefer stereotypes to reality . 
  completely state owned healthcare system is even more barbaric . 
  nhs is constantly rocked by scandals like : http://www.thenewamerican.com/world-news/europe/item/13968-uk-euthanasia-expands-from-elderly-to-infants http://www.thenewamerican.com/world-news/europe/item/11796-doctor-british-health-service-euthanizes-130000-patients-a-year for a completely socialist healthcare system you can just look at the good old ussr . 
  thank god i am to young to remember any of that crap : http://mises.org/daily/3650, 
  moscow orders . 
  similar things happened in latvia and estonia http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/january_1991_events_in_latvia http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tallinn_tv_tower#1991_defense_of_estonia and even azerbaijan http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/black_january oh and then omon started slaughtering officers in border posts . 
  yes it is , and yes we are :d, 
  true , but if you do not give a bit of breathing space even on fundamental issues , you can get a similar result as when you try to introduce democracy in afghanistan . 
  actually we do n't want to identify with any value system that we do not feel is our own . 
  we were not given the privilege of having an opinion and value system of our own at all , so we are are not in a hurry to embrace anything that is sent top-down , russian or european . 
  in time the more european values will win , but trying to force them to fast will just create a backlash . 
  a lot of the opposition from younger people comes because for example lbtg rights come not thru dialog in the society , but by eu decree . 
  i do n't get it . 
  protect from invasion by whom ? 
  well , due to the benevolent laws of the good old ussr , homosexual relations were a crime till 1993 . 
  remember that when europe was experiencing liberalization , sexual revolution and a general period of relaxation of social rules and mores , most of our parents lived in a society that was rigidly structured , tightly controlled , completely intolerant of all deviations . 
  having long hair could land you in jail for christ 's sake , people were sentenced to death for selling jeans . 
  sure this past is gone and the society is de jure liberal and tolerant , however the habits of control , conformity and intolerance to deviation still remain strong in the older generation . 
  the younger people are more relaxed and indifferent to this topic , so my speculation is that in some time it will just fix it self . 
  this is the first major step in that direction . 
   making a buffer zone between the countries and murdering every living thing inside it . 
  damn ... can we send our politicians to the zone ? 
  that would be lovely , thx . 
  this is bullcrap . 
  what about the free migration of species like wolfs , lynxes and european bison ? 
  their range always includes more than one country , and they often travel hundreds of kilometers to find a mate . 
  without additional genetic material that comes from animals that live in belarus the populations could become weak and sick . 
  not to mention that it would cut the belovezhskaya forest - one of the biggest ancient woodlands and wildlife preserves in europe - in half . 
  besides , nobody guaranties that the diseases wo n't spread the around the fences i. e. thru latvia , or ukraine . 
  http://www.delfi.lt/news/daily/crime/baltarusiska-mediena-prasta-sleptuve-milijonais-vertinamai-kontrabandai.d?id=61915145 a shipment that was caught today on the border with belarus . 
  total 200000 packs of cigarettes . 
  value aprox 0,5 mil . 
  euro . 
  this kind of things happen daily since the cost of cigarettes in belarus or russia is 1/4 of what it would be in lithuania and probablay 1/20 of what it would be in western europe . 
  realy ? 
  i was not aware of that ... 
  now they are banning the ability to smoke specific kinds of cigarettes . 
  it seems like a small deal . 
  but no freedom is lost in it 's entirety at once , they are lost step by step . 
  after this a ban on displaying brand logos will follow ( like in australia ) , then a ban on smoking in any public place ( for example in the streets ) , then a ban on smoking in your balcony ( like in latvia ) and so on and so on , until smoking is effectively banned everywhere , for everyone . 
  they can discourage all they like and as a non smoker i do n't mind that . 
  but it 's also a question of property rights and i care about that . 
  you , as the owner of a house or apartment , have the right to decide if guests can smoke in your house or not . 
  by the same principle restaurant owners should be the ones who decide is their establishment a smoking or a non smoking place . 
  restaurants and businesses in general are not public places , since it is lawful for the owner to deny access to clients that do not meet certain conditions ( for example people without a ticket can be expelled from a cinema ) . 
  preferences in general should not be made law , and should not infringe on other peoples rights . 
  for example i may not like flamboyantly homosexual people . 
  or as an avid bicyclist i may not like cars . 
  however i may not ban homosexual couples from kissing or cars driving ( their emissions are no less harmful than tobacco smoke ) in the street . 
  but i can ask a homosexual couple who are guests at my house to stop kissing if it makes me uncomfortable , and i can ask my friends to not park their cars in my yard . 
  i , as the owner of the place should be able to set the rules . 
  with smoking it 's the same - i should be able to decide what i do with my property - my body , especially if i do not harm anyone with it . 
  am i the only one that thinks that eu should not ban responsible adults from buying product that are not healthy if they know what they are getting ? 
  and especially if they are harming nobody else but themselves . 
  what if someone enjoys menthol or slim cigarettes , and is fully aware of the consequences of smoking and still chooses to do it . 
  is he a criminal ? 
  is he a child that does not know what he is doing and the benevolent politicians ( sic . ), 
  should show stop him from harming himself and him a better way ? 
  i 'm more afraid of the invasion of privacy and the limiting of freedom to do what you like as long as you do n't harm anyone that such bans entail , than profits made by tobacco companies . 
  while it is true that historically hopped brew would be called ale , and unhopped - beer , there is a much more significant difference . 
  ales are usually made with top fermentation process that takes place when the brew is warmer ( fermentation takes place around 16 c. as i remember ) . 
  lager is a brew that is made with the low fermentation process that that happens when the brew is kept at cellar temperatures - 6-8 degrees c. beer is a very general term and usually encompasses all types of brew . 
  even banana beer is called beer . 
  baltic countries can in to nordic , we call beer the same as they do . 
  my comment score was to high for my liking :3 i thought that if i vent my sincere opinion in an unglazed way in r/europe i can make it lower . 
  my point is that no one will bloody hire them if they cost the employer more than they make for him . 
  simple business principle - you do n't hire people to loose you money . 
  and it is harder to make money for a business now then ever before because of huge taxes ( direct and hidden ) , huge country budgets that are spent on absolutely useless programs . 
  not to mention the pervasive regulation , the license raj that eu and constituent countries have become . 
  and if you have been paying attention big companies screw people over mostly with their friends in the parliament , not with free ( er ) trade .

  russians are fascists !, 
  women would also cut their braids when they got married . 
  so it 's a double whammy . 
  get a haircut and then put a headscarf on . 
  signalling that they 're out of the dating market . 
  the stubborn lowlanders of course . 
  [ lithuanian hound ] ( http://www.dogwallpapers.net/wallpapers/cute-lithuanian-hound-dog-wallpaper.jpg ) + [ wiki ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lithuanian_hound ), 
  i find it really interesting how there are numerous '' special unit '' type of peoples throughout various nations . 
  what 's gallowglass supposed to be ? 
  well the women are from venus part is spot on if you consider the hell hath no fury like a woman scorned quote . 
  i do n't know where you got that idea . 
  why do you say that ? 
  my bad . 
  what 's up with not allowing words to end in consonants in japanese and korean anyway ? 
   the letter for r and l is the same technically not really . 
  i meant korean with my previous comment as well . 
  they have like 3 different l 's and 3 r 's and some of them sort of overlap . 
  they do seem to use latin letters r and l almost interchangeably though . 
  i see . 
  i never specified i was talking about chinese though . 
  i had korean more in mind when i wrote my comment .

  they still pronounce it as romania , i presume . 
  not a hard r but still ( they have like 3 different ways of pronouncing something that indo-europeans do n't differentiate ) . 
  that stereotype starts making a lot more sense when you look into it . 
  for example , no one is surprised that volkswagen is pronounced as folksvagen .

   when you protested , the russians stood by you and gave you what you wanted . 
  if there were russians protesting your government against using the military that does not make russia merciful . 
   they did n't had to , but they did . 
  and i 'm grateful to those russians for showing their support . 
   stalin and hitler comparisons make no sense , none of them would allow you independence . 
  i 'm sure a lot of things do n't make sense to you and soviets did n't `` allow '' shit , they had no other choice . 
  do n't play dumb . 
  mental gymnastics can not even begin to describe what you 're saying . 
  what you 're saying is bullshit and you know it . 
  great act of mercy my ass . 
  i guess stalin was merciful for not completely eradicating everyone in soviet russia as well ? 
  how about that merciful hitler for leaving some jews alive ?

  ftfy, 
  cheers !, 
  i have nothing to add to your first part . 
  i would n't come to the same conclusion , however . 
  but let 's not get into that . 
   what , no . 
  granted , i did n't use the best formulation : of course not 100 % of the lithuanian population was involved in the holocaust , in fact many of them did help jews escape i know you did n't mean it that way but this is what i 'm trying to say . 
  you made black and white generalizations and in the same breath advocated that the world is n't black and white . 
  that was the initial thing that caught my eye . 
   what i was saying is that , from the admitelly little i read on this topic , one the reason that the genocide of the lithuanian jews was so complete compare to other places ( including other baltic states ) is that this genocide was committed with the participation of a part of the population that was bigger than in other countries . 
  look , i 'm not saying just because there 's context and nuance to the matter that it somehow absolves what happened but you bringing up that a small population got killed faster than bigger ones like it 's something that denies the laws of physics is baffling to me . 
  i wo n't repeat the lithuanian jews vs polish jews point i made . 
   you 're making stuff up , by the way . 
  i never said that . 
  i never said you did .

  dunno about you but my family has brought meat from such farmers . 
  well , i never seen factory so it 's interesting difference from some farm where babushka keeps chickens , pigs and maybe a cow . 
  people then usually treat animals better , well unless owner is violent in general , and prone to outbursts . 
  whose is little cute snacksbar ? 
  yes you are .

  indeed , though i heard it 's a rule that is not fallowed so orthodoxly in some regions . 
  dammit !, 
  how i missed this detail !? 
  fuck , shit ... 
  bolsheviks could n't either . 
  sucks to be tornian . 
  it has to do with russian - lithuanian ( and other baltics and perhaps other neighbours ) relations and history . 
  about better neighbours . 
  btw , is there really no bars , you would think otherwise ... 
  my message was rather that he is not refugee but economic migrant , well , at least i hope that the case . 
  eastern/western europe are as much as political/historical/cultural thing ( which mean it can be moved around according to parameters ) and geographical ( which is problematic because europe has unclear natural borders , could be considered peninsula ) . 
  irony is best served hot . 
  interesting side note . 
  the poop children carry for inspection of parasites is called `` aukselis '' . 
  which is diminutive for gold .

  indeed , purely speculating , but i bet we someday have technologies to negate all of those effects , but it is easier to find new ways to drug ourselfs . 
  sure , i 'm just saying that in the future we could have technology that negates that `` bad '' , or fixes damage made to body . 
  guess where was industry from europe moved ? 
  that would be counter productive , and you probably will have tougher body , made out of tougher materials , or maybe regeneration ( gene therapy ) . 
  possibilities are endless . 
   that 's not possible , dummy not possible right now , dummy . 
  not going to happen , same thing with smoking . 
  best thing is to make meat and cigarettes that give same good effects and remove negative ones . 
  they would not even speak lithuanian , and unemployment is high enough . 
  not sure if their degrees would be of any use here too . 
  and there is also automation , though that 's more long term and uncertain . 
  i was hopeful , but i expected as much ... 
  now give me eastern .

  thanks for the link . 
  just a waste of time , money and paper , i mean it will not accomplish anything meaningful . 
  maybe author should just fuck off and let people choose if they wa n't to go or not . 
  i believe it 's even cheaper in lithuania , though i do n't buy much beer theses days . 
  reminds me one night when i drank a we bit too much of beer and cuba libre , that be said , i as gentleman , walked over to up stares bathroom , took a vomit , and then returned to party . 
  some people said that it is good for russia 's domestic production/economy , how true is that ? 
  it could affect sea currents , and climate in baltic region could less milder , more similar to that of european russia . 
  still , it would not be good for you , it 's similar how it was to commie regime here . 
  indeed , someone give them a bottle of wine , at least just this once ,

  well some of conquered tribes would turn their swords and stab germans in the back so there is that . 
  nope, 
  ok , now that is a troll right there . 
   who told us that we can decide what they should think ? 
  they can think what they want but acting out on their thoughts is a different matter , be it radicalism or political islam , or in fact islam in general is no good .

  basketball . 
  if it involves lithuania then it 's basketball .

  well , vilnius was and is beautiful specifically because it did n't experience the industrial boom . 
  i was talking more about nice as in every-day-life-nice . 
  and today 's germany is one of the best examples how to make up for past mistakes on all of those fronts . 
   especially against lithuanians , which were n't targeted by ak during ww2 lol . 
  we 've had this discussion before and i 'm not going to repost you same links again and again . 
  the major difference is germany said sorry . 
  poland did n't . 
  just say sorry for interwar and related bits and tell toma\u0161evski to suck putin 's dick and gtfo . 
  we 'll love you more than germany the next day . 
  did you even look at the link i posted ? 
  most of it happened way before spring of nations etc though . 
  1916 was the time of war . 
  1939 was just before the war . 
  the population has boomed in this period in literally any city in europe . 
  i 'm judging purely by old pictures . 
  krakow and warsaw look nice . 
  kaunas look good . 
  vilnius is kinda meh compared to all of them . 
  what some nazis ' plan have to do with today 's germany ? 
  germany is kinda sorry about its past while poland boasts about pilsudski or armija krajova . 
  germany did n't backstabbed us when we were super weak either - they were more or less open enemy most time . 
  ... but failed to put together ss battalion and did n't . 
  have any pogroms before nazis came . 
  lots of people worked to save the jews either . 
  i never saw statistics on `` rate '' of joining whatever you mean . 
  but situation was a bit different than in most other cases . 
  lithuania was already done as a republic and most people joined to run soviets out of the country rather than to help nazis . 
  commonwealth is more or less ok . 
  the history in school is ~ neutral at least in lithuania . 
  our version is that both lithuania and poland played big role . 
  not sure if poland school teaches it similarly . 
  the bad blood is around ww1 and vilnius case . 
  basically we feel backstabbed by poles who were our allies for ages . 
  there was a plan to take over whole lithuania republic by doing a coup , but it fell apart . 
  to add to insult , vilnius was a poor provincial city during interwar . 
  pretty sure it would be much more lively if it was ours . 
  a lot of stories about commonwealth and before that are just interpretations that followed the vilnius occupation rather than the cause . 
  most of polonisation happened well before ww1 though . 
  the militant polonisation during interwar was just finishing the job . 
  that and church pushing polish and saying that god does n't understand lithuanian . 
  and lots of small bits all around . 
  overall i 'd say it was 50:50 lithuanian nobles looking for fanciness and poles pushing their language . 
  so if i 'd make 500k , i 'd pay just 86k * 0.4 * 0.15 ? 
  how much is health/social/etc ? 
  asking for a friend !, 
  same here and i guess it 's same everywhere in the world . 
  ca n't think of any country or industry that 'd be an exception . 
  yeah ... 
  ask what they think about colleagues from certain cultures and their median code quality ... 
  they could list work schedules and where the key is hidden as well ... 
  so . . south-tyrol and bormio ? 
  ^ furiously ^ taking ^ notes, 
  yep , stereotypes about finns ( or other notherners ) vanish once you get into the inner circle . 
  although i met too many people who just write off locals as not friendly at first sight and do n't luck further . . imo the `` friendship curve '' is about the same at the end , but dynamics are totally different . 
  southerners seem to be friendly on the spot and do n't improve much , while northerners take time to warm up . 
  for me , the biggest difference was how finns treat personal space . 
  it looks like just coming close to counter is taken as intend to buy . 
  which was quite weird and i guess i let down quite a few sellers :( anyhow , glad you like it in finland !, 
  i got ta pay a visit to that introvert italy part . 
  italian food and landscape with slightly introverted italians . . 
  sounds perfect . 
  yeah ... over there in vilnius , i pay $ 350/mo for 50sqm apartment in new building , including reserved parking . 
  30min from downtown ( = far away over there ) . 
  but next to regional park and got good public transit options so sweet location anyway . 
  public transit pass is $ 30/mo or $ 300/year . 
  what would be considered `` enough '' salary over there ? 
  by the way , quite a random question ... 
  even being a stereotypical redditor from a northern-ish country , i had to adjust in finland . 
  the `` bus stop '' jokes turned out be quite a reality if you catch my drift . 
  and italy seemed to be totally chaotic and extrovert country even compared to my country . 
  italy -  finland must be huuuge cultural shock . 
  how did you deal with that ? 
  did you have to tie your hands or smth . . ? 
  ouch . 
  how much is rent/transport/etc in locations where $ 800 salaries are ? 
  over there , smaller cities are cheap to live in ( walkable , rent cost peanuts ) but there 're not that many jobs . 
  either specialised factories or hitech farms or government offices . 
  or $ 300 in retail or other crappy job ... 
  in major cities , $ 500 after taxes is rather easy to make ( call centers , offshore data crunching etc ) . 
  but $ 500 means either living in rundown apartment in bad location or flatsharing . 
  $ 1k after tax buys rather cushy living though . 
  but jumping from $ 500 to $ 1k ( - ish ) is rather hard . 
  needs skills/experience and in some fields is next-to-impossible . . 
  pre-tax or after tax ? 
  pre-tax this ai n't reasonable money even for eastern europe anymore ... 
  well , maybe letting them help you would make you friends after all . 
  or maybe they 'd die while helping you which would be win-win-win . 
  if nobody but outcasts help , the asshole firemen would think they 've full support and keep at it . 
  but if more people would start undercutting their policies , maybe they 'd realise society is not that much for eco houses after all . 
  outdated by what standard ? 
  i 'm not jumping to any conclusions . 
  just saying why * we * and * our * ai n't outdated and are as necessary as ever . 
  you 're kinda putting yourself in a deadlock . 
  let 's say your house was on fire . 
  some firemen decided your non-ecological house is shit and wo n't come to help you . 
  a neighbour would come to help with a bucket , but you do n't like his personality . 
  would you accept help or wait for firemen to change their mind ? 
  why should i ditch my native language and everything that comes with it for some other language ? 
  why should i buy into someone else 's ? 
  there 's no common global language and culture that takes into account anyone 's needs and experiences .

  that is not the purpose of the book , have you even read the article ? 
  ah yea , a hollywood movie is the best indicator of how people act in war . 
  well it kinda what it is , just re-purposed for educating general public . 
  out of all the things , this is where you see the waste ? 
  something never happens until it happens . 
  being prepared never hurt anyone , spending pennies on it will not bring our economy down . 
  we have been calling them a threat forever . 
  we are not the only ones . . 
  nice try mr. putin . 
  i think these are not refugees , these are migrants . 
  though i think that a lot of neighbor countries are taking quite a few refugees from ukraine which is oddly are not taken into account when eu is talking about quotas . 
  how many damn trump supporters might be hidden between all these us refugees ? 
  think about safety guys !, 
  again ? 
  i would guess all ukrainians went to poland ? 
  yeah , sometimes i feel like the only person in the country who does not like them . 
  the thing is , the distribution of consumption is very skewed towards top drinkers , so an average person will drink 50 times less than 5 % of the top ones or something strong like that ( numbers out of my ass , ca n't find the article which discussed this ) . 
  sometimes i am not sure how are those people even are alive . 
  they import 50 % more than they export . 
  what normal country would want to support army which is killing so many innocent people in syria and not even hiding it ? 
  the thing is , as time and technology moves forward putting huge numbers of troops into frontline is becoming more and more pointless . 
  especially when a lot of people dies , discipline drops and the force loses strength . 
  most of the acts still do n't try , it 's just us . 
  kim is just too good of a dancer . 
  unless you yourself are corrupt . 
  so does kim . 
  you should read up on those massive freight ships . 
  they produce stupendous amount of pollution ( though they are still pretty efficient when compared to other transport ) . 
  poland has that already covered . 
  ah yea , the stupid ideology of `` the party which i do not support won , it means everyone else who voted are sheeps '' . 
  funny thing is that we had increased turn up from people who did not vote in the last election . 
  these results might indicate better on what the population wants and it is a good thing . 
  time will show if they were correct or not , but they ca n't really do worse than what we had . 
  they are also plan on going against the illegal production very heavily . 
  again , if this is done slowly and with enough thought it can be done correctly . 
  only time will show though , i myself did not vote for them but i think they might be what we need . 
  huge problem with that . 
  our it sector is growing every year , we have plenty of highly educated people returning to the country an we have a lot of businesses moving here because of the fact that we are above the west when it comes to infrastructure . 
  same goes for biotechnology and physics related businesses . 
  those 33000 are mostly leaving for unskilled labor . 
  the more you talk the less i see any arguments from economical perspective . 
  you do not sound informed or educated enough for this discussion to lead to anything since you are repeating yourself over and over . 
  i do n't think they will go trough with all their alcohol policies . 
  they are quite pro technocracy so they will have plenty of time to analyze it better . 
  our taxes are one of the lowest . . 
  we have tons of people like this . 
  luckily they are more likely to just emigrate and stop bothering us . 
  a lot of corruption scandals in most of the other major parties and need for a change has led to this . 
  they are not radically leaning to either side so this might be good for the country in the long run . 
  the question is who will they form coalition with . 
  you really sound like someone who has no idea what he is talking about . 
  joining eu created a lot of jobs especially to those who are educated due to the fact that businesses which rely on such labor is very mobile . 
  you will fund ministry of health regardless if you have public or private hospitals . 
  no they do not have to be more expensive , they have better taxation and are more interconnected . 
  also keeping people healthy is way more profitable than them going to hospital too late for a cheap solution . 
  the drag bad healthcare has on economy is massive . 
  most of what brexit proves is that there is quite a few flaws in eu and we are still sluggish at improving due to bureaucracy . 
  hopefully brexit will help us to move forward . 
  ha , suck that estonia and latvia . 
  yeah , when irishmen stand on the scales , the scale says that it is not designed to weight livestock . 
  it definitely ca n't be because leftists are more likely to seek carrier and financial stability before forming families . 
  because it is too cheap for people to get help , duh . 
  helps to have all that russian state sponsorship / s. 
  they merged few years ago in order to try to win some more seats . 
  yeah , it takes a big chunk out of most peoples income . 
  especially hard for ones living on minimum wage . 
  greek prices are quite similar though . 
  the difference is no where close to justify 1000eur being the baseline for poverty . 
  maybe latin alphabet hurts his eyes . 
  so we are just more honest . 
  until another hack happens and it will drop in half . 
  it is for the better in the long term . 
  well it used to have cyan boarder and white text until i changed it . 
  so it can be worse . 
  well , that 's not very classy , but that channel is cancer . 
  bars are usually overcrowded and because of that very expensive . 
  we could use more anti-booze . 
  it is probably the peasant part of the party which was why people voted , so hard to tell how it will go . 
  hopefully it will not focus too much on rural development . 
  just because you do n't think we are important does not mean it is true . 
  eh conscription is not that bad of a thing , especially when it 's not hard to get out of it if you are very much against it . 
  rain during election day is tradition for us . 
  for a second i did not realize this was sarcasm . 
  quite a few parties are very fringe . 
  lithuanians , might explain the suicide rate . 
  the thing is , the political parties here are totally random and do not even conform to their core values . 
  lefts are voting for right wing policies and vice versa . 
  the more i live here the less i want to stay because of hopelessness . 
  nothing is safe against them , everyone just agrees that all the deaths are the necessary sacrifice to keep them at bay . 
  hmm , can we include a gasoline generator inside the trunk which heats water and transfers it trough pipes around the battery ? 
  but it totally makes sense , the unpredictability of situation is what is causing this . 
  hopefully a lithuanian will get one tomorrow . 
  listen to the french , they are experts in protests . 
  we have political party which fits all of this completely . 
  part of me ca n't believe that he is serious . 
  i mean , most of these are not too far from the truth , a bit went wild on sky and water things , but rest of them are close enough . 
  warm is a relative thing . 
  40 is swarm of bullets . 
  not being able to think is a bonus on reddit . 
  we need to build a wall .

  unlike someone who solely posts in / r/europe about it . 
  i 'm not in the business of wasting my time . 
  listening to russian foreign policy representatives is about a good a time as eating lead paint chips . 
  nk-ak , ctrl-f `` russia '' , entire page becomes yellow . 
  gee whiz , someone has a penchant for russian foreign policy . 
  what conclusion are you going to reach with a person who does one thing while saying another , blatantly might i add ? 
  implied it when you said the anti-putin crowd is immature . 
  unless you are calling yourself immature , you are not against him . 
  you know so much about me , please continue to tell me where i live and what i think . 
  you seem to be forgetting russia 's and especially putin 's history when it comes to politics and his actions . 
  russia as a rule of thumb will use even obvious lies to further its cause , which at the moment happens to be imperialism and geo-political ventures . 
  the fact that you only now have started paying attention does nothing for you . 
  you are the person who read the end of the book and claims to know everything that happened before . 
  there is nothing wrong with asking questions , but remember that russia usually gives a different kind of answer . 
  do n't forget their stance on ukraine , the plane they shot down , and surreptitious activity on its neighbors that includes financing pro russian political parties . 
  the destablization of europe is one of russia 's net goals , because it does not want to have a strong neighbor . 
  now think about this , what are the odds of the european union attacking russia unprovoked ? 
  none , zilch . 
  it 's not going to happen . 
  russia 's goals are impeded when europe is united and strong . 
  however , every time an eastern european or previous ssr joins nato or the eu , russia is up in arms about the threat of it . 
  nonsense . 
  if you knew russia 's history you would see why they need a leader like trump to withdraw support from europe and signal to russia to continue its imperialistic tendancies . 
  this is why russia has become a talking point in american elections , they have vested interest to make sure one candidate wins while the other loses , with significant proof they are getting involved . 
  you claim you are not under threat , but espionage is russia 's bread and butter . 
  propaganda and information control is what they do best . 
  i have no idea where you got this notion that the russian government means well for you or even trusts you . 
  i will leave it to him to answer . 
  that being said , he said the anti-putin crowd with no explanation . 
  what maturity is there in supporting a criminal ? 
  enlighten me . 
  that 's a ridiculous argument . 
  attempting to justify it by saying it 's the 21st century . 
  nevermind the extra resources that would be required to make this happen , it 's disrespectful . 
  what you are proposing is in no way for the polish who lived here for generations , i have no doubts they speak lithuanian . 
  it is for people coming in from outside of the country . 
  the sheer arrogance is mind boggling . 
  they have lived there for centuries and do n't speak lithuanian ? 
  are you serious ? 
  how is it nationalism for people to expect people in their country to use a certain language ? 
  we do n't shy away from using english in the international community because we recognize the importance of it . 
  the same way i do n't travel to china and expect them to have dutch signs along with the chinese ones . 
  only thing i would accept is the use in historical areas . 
  how does this encourage integration ? 
  what 's your issue ? 
  you must not be a developer . 
  the game is a work of art in terms of programming and development . 
  the technocrats , obviously . 
  i propose a new lithuanian / korean hybrid language . 
  or basque , ca n't go wrong with basque . 
  it 's open source !, 
  let 's be honest here , adidas wearing douchebaggery may have been exported to western europe too . 
  let 's not try to say that every ass kicking falls out of the sky . 
  i 'm sure there 's some back and forth happening . 
  and this is not to say there are n't asshole brits out there running around looking for foreigners , i 'm not saying that . 
  i just think this is n't as one sided as we might all think and it 's important to pay attention to that . 
  yeah first step would be to weaken european unity and nato presence . 
  or how about the clause where if the country attacks first nato does n't need to help ? 
  they do n't have to actually rebel or want a revolt , you 're missing the point . 
  putin can use them as an excuse as to what he perceives they want . 
  `` oh i liberated latvia because the russian minority was mistreated '' . 
  and you will always have a few proud nationalists you can point to , legitimate or not . 
  ask the russians living in latvia . 
  perhaps they would like to move their homes to russia without changing their geographical location . 
  before you know it everyone in latvia will be liberated . 
  because he 's pissed people are expecting his country to promote russian language and influence after the way russia treated his country historically . 
  the ultimate goal of the allies was stopping hitler , not replacing him with a russian speaking one . 
  but that 's the thing though , when confronted with another dictator the allied powers , weary from the war , chose not to turn on russia and take back the land they had seized . 
  the rest is history . 
  with the break in the dnc and a trump election likely , the protections may soon run out . 
  why europe chooses to count on the united states is beyond me . 
  it takes one shift in ruling party to jeopardize the freedom of so many people . 
  so going by your example , i could establish another state in another country as long as it 100 % adhered to the original states laws ? 
  which is why i 'm so concerned at germany 's lack of recognition of the russian threat . 
  they were split in half , we were all occupied and had to deal with russia 's bullshit propaganda for so many years , and now they would rather risk european unity for refugees in the face of a mobilizing russia . 
  it 's almost as if the european leaders have collective amnesia about what happened last time and forgot how to deal with despots . 
  exactly , it 's the question of eventuality, 
  formal recognition from world leaders . 
  i ca n't just name my own state in the middle of another country . 
  interesting way to phrase a representative democracy . 
  people voted for her , does n't mean that the same people who voted for her also approve of all of her policies and decisions . 
  even if most of the people agree with it , it does n't mean it 's right , unless you also want to vindicate a certain chancellor of his actions because of the general consensus at the time . 
  yes , the refugees were coming . 
  and the choices were to stem the flow and keep them in their own region through funding , or let the flood gates open before you were ready to accept them . 
  i think you 're making the wrong move . 
  edit : [ what do you think of this ? 
  ] ( http://www.dw.com/en/poll-germans-increasingly-skeptical-of-refugees/a-18982943 ), 
  first of all , the field hospital you linked is not any form of refugee accommodation , do n't try to make it appear as if israel is hosting refugees . 
  linking irrelevant articles does no good to further your cause . 
  and if you 're such a firm believer in letting people into your country without vetting them , kindly do not complain when you are on the receiving end of terror attacks . 
  you have made your arguments : you do n't care if people do n't have paperwork , you claim they will be set aside and then inspected . 
  kindly tell me , where you deport someone who has no paperwork . 
  you refuse to consider funding local camps and countries instead of bringing them straight to your doorstep . 
  then you go on making an emotional argument that it is all justified because you are helping people . 
  if you help a person kill somebody else , that 's hardly something to brag about is it ? 
  but you prefer to gloss over the effects on your country . 
  tell me , was this course of action that was taken really vindicated ? 
  having merkel extend an invitation to all the refugees that had human traffickers jumping for joy ? 
  the responsibility of the people risking life and neck falls on you yet again , because your leadership jumped the gun before the infrastructure to handle all these people was in place . 
  trying to play jihadi ?

  the sanctions are n't enough . 
  come all !, 
  thank you for clearing that up, 
  is n't the water only a partial moderator that takes off the heat from the reactor so it could turn to steam and power turbines ? 
  i thought different elements were used as moderators , to slow the rate at which neutrons split off other neutrons . 
  a reactor surrounded by air bubbles from bubbling water can go critical from an uncontrolled reaction , yeah ? 
  a lithuanian did invent the [ euthanasia coaster ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/euthanasia_coaster ) . 
  strange times we live in . 
  i think he 's referring to their lack of safety and maintenance . 
  i 'm not being very serious with that comment, 
  well what if they stole that truck ? 
  what i mean is the things he says are calculated for some end result that he wants . 
  he can say whatever he wants , it has nothing to do with what he will do next . 
  because putin is so reputable . 
  why ca n't we be concerned with both ? 
  very well . 
  i did not think you would end up being pedantic in this conversation but here we are . 
  i posit you desire an appropriate retort to your original post . 
  as much as your original post appears to be logical in its approach to characterizing what terrorists want , it 's inundated with elements of ethos that are simply unconvincing . 
  this attempt at building your credibility is established through your repetitive use of assumptions about what they want . 
  you present neither examples or sources for anything that might support your argument , instead opting for strong wording and vague references to dates that might impress or influence the average skim reader but leave the scrupulous reader wanting . 
  the terrorists have not been ambiguous in their actions as to what their goals are . 
  what you describe are more akin to side effects or in some cases , complete non-issues . 
  take for example , your meandering description of marginalization and its intended effects . 
  you refuse to mention what that ` marginalization ' might consist of , instead choosing to portray muslims as would be victims of what we might only guess are policies that decrease the probability of a successful terrorist attack . 
  now let me ask you this , if a western educated muslim can be radicalized from a country taking action to protect its citizens or even go so far as to recognize there is a problem with the status quo , what conclusion does it lead to about that muslim ? 
  if that muslim ends up facilitating or participating in an attack on their own country , what trust do we have for these people , as per your description of ` marginalization ' ? 
  your post has led me to conclude that you are propagating the notion that if they are as much as criticized , they would be more likely to kill their own countrymen . 
  if this is not the case , feel free to clarify your thoughts so that i may begin to understand what it is you 're really trying to say . 
  he 's got a reddit degree in political science , you should be careful belittling someone so decorated . 
  you ca n't reduce it to zero immediately , however you can start to stem the flow of people that identify with the ideology most closely related to that of the extremists . 
  then you can work on the cultural integration that is so lacking in western europe . 
   that 's why you have intelligence agencies . 
  intelligence agencies are n't some magicians that can conjure up solutions with a good soundtrack / montage . 
  it takes time and resources for these people to do their job . 
  to flood the continent with migrants in the numbers that they were coming in , it is incredibly difficult if not impossible to check every single person . 
  the flow must be stemmed for them to be effective . 
   difficult , but hardly impossible . 
  it simply takes time . 
  simple solution , wait out the murders . 
  how about proactively using policy to encourage integration into the local culture , and not the other way around ? 
  the enclaves that have been formed have been resistant to time so far , and in some cases have even been growing . 
   that 's why you crack down on extremist recruiters . 
  intelligence agencies and police forces are stretched thin as it is . 
  nevermind the fact that these extremist recruiters do n't even need to be on the same continent to spread their message , thanks to the internet . 
   correct . 
  you 're talking about tiny minorities of immigrants that are a potential problem ; and turning that around on the whole lot of them . 
  if a lithuanian immigrates to my country , does n't assimilate into my culture , and ends up killing someone ... it that a justification for us to bar the whole lot of you from our borders based on his actions ? 
  of course not . 
  statistically unlikely considering our cultures are similar , which has been one of my points . 
  our views tend to be similar in the way we view women , rights , and democracy . 
  you 're right , if one person did it , you should n't ban everyone . 
  however , if masses of them started to create their own neighborhoods and carry out attacks , you should work to limit immigration as well as increase screening . 
  my point with the current migrant situation was never to close off borders completely . 
  what my intent was to stem the flow enough that proper screening and evaluations could be carried out , complete with a database that could be referred to in case someone was to be tracked down . 
  the amount of people that europe has taken in , it is unrealistic to expect that the screening has been sufficient . 
  people will slip through the cracks , and they have . 
   what the hell does that matter ? 
  if shower accidents are more likely to kill you than a terrorist , then logic dictates you should be more concerned by it . 
  because accidents are different in two ways . 
  one , there is no malicious intent behind accidents , they occur due to carelessness or some sort of acceptable engineering failure rate . 
  two , we accept accidents as a part of our lives because it is the daily risk that is a part of our society due to the way we live . 
  we are constantly working to decrease these risks through technological innovation and awareness campaigns . 
  terrorism is different , it is a form of criminal element that is mixed with religious fanaticism . 
  meaning that the risk is not static like you would find in slipping in a shower . 
  it is dynamic based on location , time of year , religious celebrations , and most importantly the number of terrorist cells currently operating in a given location . 
  with something like a car crash , you are in charge of most of the variables that would lead to preventing or surviving one . 
  putting on your seatbelt , making sure you obey driving rules and observing other drivers . 
  terrorism is different in that regard , you do not control the variables . 
  the attacks are designed to inflict the most damage against the most people . 
  the police forces are studied and reacted against , if you deploy more police in one location , the attack will happen in another . 
  if the security is weaker in this location than someplace else , it will make more sense for the terrorist to attack there . 
  they may even wait or coordinate with other cells . 
  that is a dynamic response to your attempted risk mitigation . 
  it is not you vs inanimate object ( shower ) , it is you vs another human being who is studying your patterns in order to do the most harm to you and your way of life . 
  to treat it as an accident is not only doing a disservice to the people tasked with stopping terrorism , it is completely ignoring the reason why the victims of these attacks died . 
  i would tell you to say to a family member of a victim , that the death is like slipping in a shower , but i do n't want to see you get hurt . 
   by painting the whole middle-east with the same brush ? 
  you 're only going to make things worse . 
  yes , you may stop one or two terrorists from coming into your country now ; but it only breeds further resentment , and that resentment is going to come calling with a vengeance when climate change makes the entire middle-east uninhabitable . 
  resentment ? 
  if they feel resentment for being given the chance to live in a modern western country because you took actions to protect your citizens , they do n't belong here in the first place . 
  this is almost the same argument asking not to criticize islam because the reaction will be violence . 
  that is the cultural difference i 'm talking about right here . 
  if your first reaction is violence , there is something wrong there . 
  these are not the people we want in our society , and if you are afraid to say that , then they already control you more than terrorism ever could . 
  in the case of climate change , that 's why i encourage securing our borders and having a plan for a mass migration event , in the case of climate change that would lead to that scenario . 
  if there 's anything that we have learned from the recent migrations , it 's that we can not take on these numbers , nevermind larger ones , and expect to be able to coordinate effectively . 
  people are already being lost in the system , this is not acceptable . 
  if you ca n't see the fact that most terrorist attacks that have occurred recently are a byproduct of islamist interpretation combined with recruiting and indoctrination from people working in europe and abroad , i really ca n't discuss this with you . 
  [ the fact that not all muslims are conducting the attacks is irrelevant . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynof7y-kuhe ), 
  we have information that attackers could come with the migrants . 
  we have information that the culture of the migrants does not match our own , to the point they form communities that make cultural diffusion difficult . 
  we have information that terror attacks can come from suspects that were even born and grew up in europe that have been recruited by the cultural and religious influences from these outside countries . 
  that 's not enough to decide migration policy ? 
  leave the showers and the cars out of it , it 's an unjust comparison because terror attacks are not accidents . 
  the people who died did not slip in a shower . 
  they were murdered and we must recognize it as such . 
  there are preventative actions that could mitigate the effects of terrorism if we took the appropriate measures .

  what happens when eu is under influence of russia ? 
  no free trade , import taxes raised , or import banned , us control over internet ceased , even popular culture import is being stopped . 
  same with japan and asia . 
   you mean spending untold billion and losing thousands of lives with nothing to show for it is n't a bad thing ? 
  what ? 
  are you about wwii ? 
  i do n't get what you 're saying . 
   the us is either shown as doing `` nothing '' but showing up late . 
  as `` war criminals no different than the nazis '' or as `` weak minded simpletons who gave eastern europe to the soviets . '', 
  after all the us invested in germany following the war and during the cold war you could n't find a german who would piss on an american if he was on fire . 
  are you salty ? 
  is that what 's all about ? 
   keeping a promise to a small unimportant country like lithuania matters in the big picture  it 's resources that should be used at home diverted to a conflict from an era and world gone by . 
  the price us is paying for keeping a few soldiers on rotation in eastern europe is laughable . 
  especially compared what it means with keeping the world stable . 
  do you think europeans and japanese will keep buying overpriced iphones and us ' military equipment , will keep using google and facebook , if and when russia/china takes over the influence ? 
  you want someone over to take world-policeman role ? 
  you want someone else to become world economy 's powerhouse ? 
  why 's that ? 
  i do n't think you understand what power-projection is , and how keeping a promise to a small unimportant country like lithuania matters in the big picture , and how it influences balance of power and peace on india/pakistan border . 
  btw , do you think us ' involvement in wwii was a mistake ? 
  do you honestly think that burying your head in the sand will protect someone from potential conflicts ? 
  do you think it will be good for us ' economy , dollar value , and trade relationships ? 
  do you truly believe russia at first creating hotspots on its western borders , and then slowly moving further is good for us ' peoples ? 
  do you think china eventually annexing taiwan , increasing its influence over japan/korea is beneficial to us ? 
  do you think no tensions will rise in israel , india/pakistan border ? 
  do you truly see us as some kind of big bad wolf , and believe that when it 's gone the earth will live long happily ever after ? 
  do you not think that whenever a vacuum will be created for dominating power , or a world-policeman , someone else will try to step in ? 
  and you think pulling out from nato and letting russia/china taking influence over other countries is good for us because ... ? 
  good in what way ? 
  do you think us is playing world policeman just out of sheer generosity ? 
  is he wrong about it being staged tho ? 
  for me it did seem like it was all scripted . 
  third language to study in school ? 
  german/russian i would say equally popular , maybe russian a bit more . 
  ca n't see that happening . 
  national championships would lose any sense , and only a handful of clubs would truly benefit . 
  well the el just created a new format where only 16 teams compete ( down from 24 ) , and 11 of them havr 10 year contracts . 
  so it 's more likr nba rather than champions league . 
  olympics . 
  i 'm a bit confused . 
  was the employer on charges of an insult , or because he is accused of wrongful sacking ? 
  because if it 's the latter , then it 's perfectly reasonable to assume that there 's more to the story that what is being said in the article . 
  for example , the employee was lazy in his job ( at least to the opinion of the employer ) , and then he started asking for `` sick days '' , and then the employer decides to sack the employee , and calls him gay slur ( tho not to insult him personally , but while messaging someone else , and discussing the behaviour of the said employee ) . 
  so , was the sacking really an act of homophobia ? 
  again , we ca n't answer ( at least i ca n't ) just by reading this short translated article from a secondary source . 
  unless someone is willing to provide fully translated original document , where we can read into details and motives of the ruling , everything we talk here are just useless and quite frankly stupid reactions . 
  for example , if full situation is : the employee was lazy and skipping days and gets sacked while being called gay slur , it does n't mean he was let go because of his sexual orientation . 
  if , however , the employee was working as he is supposed to , or if asking for sick days is acceptable in that salon , but this particular employee was let go because the employer has homophobic views , and he does not let other employees who act the same go , then it 's homophobia . 
  as for wording in the ruling , again , it 's hard to say without the original text , but for example the meaning could be that `` pd '' has become such an often used term in the society , that on its own it does not indicate homophobia . 
  again , i 'm just guessing , maybe indeed everything in this ruling is ridiculous and absurd , i 'm just saying that just by reading an article of a few sentences you ca n't really make such bold statements as `` this has got to be the most senseless verdict i 've read this year . '', 
  well again , unless we read the original document , it 's all interpretations as to what really happened , and what the motives were . 
  i 'm not even really sure why even the issue of whether the sacked employee was or was not insulted is being discussed here . 
  is n't it about the motives of the sacking ? 
  let 's say the boss did insult him on purpose ( which the article says it did n't ) with a homophobic slur , but he let the employee go not because of homophobia , but because of other factors , why does that insult even matter ? 
  and to read op 's post `` this has got to be the most senseless verdict i 've read this year . '', 
  i mean , common , really ? 
  the thing is , that unless you read full verdict , you can be swayed either way by the interpretation of the news agency that is reporting about it . 
  so , did you read ? 
  i did not obviously , but between the lines i can see alternative headline - `` french tribunal rules , that even tho the boss used gay slur towards employee , his sacking was n't because of homophobia , because many other employees are gay '' . 
  and when you laugh at that kind of attitude if theirs they say `` you believe what tv says too much '' . 
   what he is n't is a refugee . 
  what do you mean ? 
  why would someone need embassy for that ? 
  just take him to woods , or to some basement by that logic . 
  however polish term ( just lithuanized ) \u017de\u010dpospolita is widely used as well . 
  i remember this documentary by an estonian film-maker . 
  https://youtu.be/j8aie7ewtsy?t=1m2s * pravda newspaper wrote : `` soldiers fulfilled the instructions about non-usage of weapons especially regarding women and teenagers . '', 
  a friend of mine read an article and said , `` did they really kill women and children there ? '' . 
  that 's exactly how it goes in lithuania . 
  even the prices are the same i would say . 
  oh right . 
  love this speech by laverne https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-matjs-jatem , probably it made me stop making fun of god-believing friends during my teen years .

  i downvoted him because his enter is broken it seems .

  reminded me of a tropico 5 review i read a week ago . 
   during the game 's modern era , a certain bear-riding russian leader , who is n't named , sent a large number of russian immigrants to my island , which i stupidly accepted . 
  then he proceeded to invade my island under the justification of ` liberating the oppressed russian minority in tropico ' . 
   10/10 for realism . 
  may i ask , does the chinese internet , tv or what have you , talk about the deals china is making with russia regarding the land ? 
  because the runet sometimes blows up how the russian government `` gifts '' the massive amounts of lands near the border to china in exchange for nothing . 
  actually the christian democrats took over the lead again by 150 votes . 
  i 'm sick of people . 
  how did italy do in semifinal against france ? 
   their whole membership is disadvantageous to us good one . 
   the european commission has proposed making the pay of the two categories the same . 
  but several central european countries such as hungary and poland oppose this , saying it would be disadvantageous to them and would threaten jobs . 
  i do n't know as a northerner how would i feel about seeing people ski in the middle of my summer .

  if russia hypothetically changed one day and became something like germany , democratic , liberal , `` western '' , not even the most so called `` rusophobic '' countries would veto russia 's ascension , at least not for forever . 
  but the country would n't be russia ... now would it ?

  i used to have a worldview which could be best described as `` euro-patriotism '' , but the attitude on reddit towards lithuanians by some folk shattered my illusions . 
  historically : mostly with poland and belarus ( something like ~ 500 years of common history i believe ) . 
  linguistically : with latvia . 
  politically : with latvia and estonia , and to some extent with the nordic countries . 
  also , lithuania stays on the good side of germany , usa and the eu . 
  culturally : with latvia and the central european countries , mostly with poland and germany . 
  socially ( based on personal experience ) : with latvians , estonians , czechs , slovenians and eastern germans . 
  i think poles are way more friendly than lithuanians . 
  genetically : with our baltic , slavic and finnic neighbors . 
  by temper : with poland , russia , ukraine and southern countries . 
  lithuania is hands down the most hot tempered of the three baltic states . 
  lithuanians sometimes suffer from siege mentality . 
  by amount of pure alcohol consumption : probably with latvia , poland , russia , finland and uk .

  it is . 
  it 's a huge downside , for me personally as well because all of my friends have left , but we 've also made dramatic economic progress . 
  eastern europeans are not your biggest problem , brother, 
  i have n't heard many complaints , we mainly kill and enslave each other :p, 
  tensions happen everywhere , but as a lithuanian i ca n't see a downside other than that half of our people have left . 
  you might say i 'm a dreamer ; _ ;, 
  i knew a turkish guy who looked so much like a lithuanian basketball player that me and my friends had to scream and take selfies with him . 
  also a bunch of dark-blonde girls with green eyes . 
  these were turks from turkey and they were very different from the people in kebab shops . 
  poland in eu is bad ? 
  i 'd love it if russia was in the eu . 
  if they had a different government it would be a possibility . 
  you can train your anus to respond on command . 
  it 's not related to soviet victories ... 
  this is a great tournament from underdogs . 
  everyone in / r/soccer is complaining about defensive games , but i 'm a simple woman and just love these heroic narratives . 
  lithuanian holocaust remembrance coming up in 3 , 2 , 1 ... 
  i sincerely hope that will be given at least as much attention as the deportations anniversary a few days ago , but i 'm not so sure . 
  there are naked swimming days , yes, 
  the only known case of lesbians transmitting hiv was two women fucking themselves bloody with the same dildo after stopping antiretroviral drugs, 
  england and russia are strange bedfellows, 
  lesbians do n't really get aids, 
  critical of the fact that a disproportionate amount of deaths happens on what 's supposed to be a traditional holiday , also july 6 . 
  i 'll still be celebrating ... if i can find any friends to go with ; - ;, 
  yeah , i 've been to a public celebration in a shit neighborhood that had the getting shitfaced but also burning a fire and letting a couple flower wreaths into the river , and my friends have celebrated very traditionally in kernav\u0117 , but the current overwhelming tradition is killing each other with cars . 
  wahhabism is a fairly recent movement, 
  i felt so bad for them :( did n't even commit fouls to get the ball or stop attacks , just kind of gave up on everything and it was depressing reading comments from russians . 
  really , such a big country with so many people playing football ... 
  mainz does a pretty big festival with ships and fireworks , the johannisnacht , but it 's also connected to celebrating gutenberg . 
  is this uncommon ? 
  uh , midsummer in lithuania consists of everyone getting shitfaced , drowning in lakes and crashing cars in record numbers . 
  the death toll only depends on the weather . 
  they started before the first game began, 
  according to my online experience , lithuanians hate gays way more than they hate muslims . 
  so yeah . 
  it 's illegal to drink in the streets, 
  i do n't know how to emotionally process this, 
  it 's an awesome city !, 
  hit me up for a list of pubs, 
  if that happens , i think gays wo n't be the factor that makes them unhappy , if you catch my drift, 
  in traditional lithuanian society , many people did n't marry because they did n't have their own household and depended on serving other people as farmhands or somesuch . 
  children were `` raised by a village '' because not every woman had children and there was a large extended family to take care of them . 
  very interestingly , there have been theories that a gay family simulates this village because western gay communities have usually lived closely in the past few decades and raised their children together ( for example , two men and two women arranging to make a child ) , whereas `` traditional '' male/female couples are often left alone and expected to raise children without help . 
  this is one of the explanations for why children of gay parents have better life outcomes . 
  coming back to the `` not everyone is married '' issue , `` davatka '' is originally a folk name for a class of unmarried women who had no wealth and depended on the church to survive . 
  and yet it 's so very christian !, 
  denmark is the happiest country in the world, 
  listen , if children were made by guys having sex with guys , do you think you not be disgusted by it ? 
  would you be able to fall in love with a guy ? 
  would you want your children growing up in a family where you do n't love your partner , and probably start cheating on them ? 
  i know a straight guy who actually tried to have sex with a dude just for the fuck of it . 
  literally could n't get it up for a blowjob in the dark . 
  i had a libertine friends circle where girls make out with girls and tbh it 's the only thing i 've ever regretted doing drunk because it just feels so disgusting after the fact . 
  i 'd never want to pressure someone who does n't like girls to have sex with them because that 's cruel , also to the girl who 's being deceived . 
  this is why homophobic figures are often revealed to be gay , because they think everyone is attracted to the same sex and is just holding on by willpower . 
  no , really , it does n't involve any willpower or morals . 
  straight people just do n't want to do it . 
  are you seriously one of those people who think people turn gay after seeing other gay people newsflash : not everyone is barely restraining their wild desire to dump their wife and suck dick, 
  we 're trying into nordic, 
  they have family parades for heterosexual families . 
  yeah ... it stings that my mom was able to find her friends in the parade and i was n't  : / forever alone, 
  i wanted more of the old guy playing accordion, 
  lots of people this time , very happy about this !, 
  i 've been shocked recently at the amount of horrible hatred on the internet so it 's really nice to see so much support . 
  i could have done with less annoying music from the party buses , but hey , it 's a free country :p anyone wan na go party at xi20 with me tonight ? 
  will there be an alternate route ? 
  yeah , the rest of us are fucked over , why should they enjoy peace and prosperity ? 
  i just want to watch the world burn . 
  i ca n't believe i used to read erotic gay fanfiction about this asshole ... jk still would, 
  sure , and now they do n't ban it , everyone is happy . 
  i guess it 's kind of a once-in-a-lifetime thing , yeah . 
  i do n't think i could be that dedicated to a few days of drinking and fucking people up . 
  no fucken way , i staunchly refuse to wear pants above 22 degrees, 
  apparently boys wearing skirts was banned in uk schools , hence the article . 
  why does n't the un just take care of them in greece ? 
  : / this is unbelievable . 
  it 's pretty far and expensive for someone with average eastern european income and if these ultras are upper-middle-class , i do n't know what is real anymore, 
  i wonder how many thousands of poor men live unaware of the awesomeness of wearing a skirt in summer . 
  i truly feel bad for them . 
  allowing it is the first step to making it general fashion . 
  ... obviously . 
  how do people like this afford to go to france ? 
  i almost feel bad rooting for germany at this point , but i 'm sure i 'll get over it .

  i read that as `` i bugger her on the pole sometimes '' and thought that made perfect sense . 
  lithuanians sell each other to factories in the west under false promises and coercion . 
  reportedly , plastic surgery advanced really quickly following wwi because of all the practice they had . 
  how dare you ? 
  they did it as a joke and rustled some serious jimmies , a +, 
  they 're the best !, 
  i love everything that is german .

what 's interesting is that the western european countries are usually the ones thinking twice about more sanctions , and the baltics and poland , for whom russia is usually the largest trade partner , have to encourage them . 
  visit the * beautiful * [ lithuanian legislature ] ( http://www.lrs.lt/upl_files/lietuvos_pirmininkavimas_es/vaizdai_2/06_17_seimo_r%c5%abmai.jpg ) while you 're at it as well !, 
  we also have hesburger in lithuania . 
  never had them drunk , but can confirm that sober it 's pretty gross . 
  a lot of it ? 
  probably .

  nope .

  actually , he 's saying `` su prezidente dalia grybauskaite , '' the \u0117 drops in the instrumental case and pronunciation changes . 
  do n't be angry just because we 're tied now . 
  lol , i did n't say i subscribed to those views , just saying people 's opinions i encounter . 
  not to mention that as a eu representative he wo n't really have time for that thing . 
  okay , i get it . 
  probably was focusing too much on the detail there . 
  sikorski is pretty great in the broader outlook , but his politics worry some people regionally . 
  polish-lithuanian relations . 
  totally . 
  because making rich people give money to the government is helping their corporate schemes . 
  you 're making it seem like you 're saying that whenever we can replace a computer/machine with a human , we should , because we relate with humans . 
  unfortunately your econ . 
  justification does n't really make sense . 
  oligarchs more or less unilaterally determined putin 's election , as they did with yeltsin 's . 
  but they underestimated him . 
  i would n't have too many hopes , if a billionaire steps up putin * will * bring him to his knees . 
  easy there , estonia . 
  the reason probably has to do with uncertainty . 
  but once you can see that prices do n't skyrocket and evil ecb bankers do n't try to take your last penny , everybody can relax . 
  that 's true . 
  still ca n't see where you 're going with it though , because there 's plenty of inelastic goods that are under control of private enterprise . 
  i 'm not even arguing that private companies should be the only ones with access to water supplies , i 'm just wondering why you or / u/galactic _ kitten or others think a state is more reliable . 
   a state that is n't taking its responsibilities seriously should be replaced one way or another . 
  you could argue this is the citizens ' moral responsibility , but it 's very unlikely to happen in practice . 
  this fact increases exponentially the larger the bureaucracy gets , and the more responsibilities the government takes on that it practically should n't . 
   a companys primary function is to make a profit . 
  so you believe the way they 'll make it is to deprive everyone of water and have them die ? 
   if raising the price or cutting down on the product quality means more profit they will do it and in certain instances they are even required to . 
  yes . 
  they will also lower the price if it means more profit , or make product quality higher ( as strange of a concept as that is ) . 
  this just means that companies will cater to different groups . 
  i do n't follow your argument . 
  why is the state more responsible than any other actor by default ? 
  except those two are not related . 
  any added moderation would make / r/europe even more sterile in terms of ideas , alienating the majority of europeans from this subreddit .

  in practically every major thread , the top-rated comment ( s ) is/are a variation of something similar to this : http://imgur.com/vjlghq0 please do n't pretend you 're a minority , do n't contribute even more to a circlejerk . 
  also , there are far less shills than there are people that genuinely think austerity is a better idea than the alternative .

  not so much on television or print . 
  downvoted to oblivion ? 
  when has / r/europe ever been anything other than blatantly , obviously leaning to the left ? 
  the persecution complex is getting ridiculous . 
  are we not even trying to hide bias anymore with articles and sites like these ? 
  i understand you 're going with the logic of polish territory  ( lithuanians invade )  lithuanian territory . 
  that 's wrong because it starts after ww2 . 
  it used to be lithuanian territory  ( polish invade * )  polish territory  ( lithuanians invade )  and so on , and so on . 
  * also , it was an invasion , not a mutiny . 
  it is known the ` mutineers ' were polish army units and that the census was also acknowledged to be tampered with . 
  this is the same as blaming poland for ww2 because of the [ ` incident ' in gleiwitz . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gleiwitz_incident ), 
  keep in mind employers often pay the minimum officially , and then give the rest secretly to avoid taxes . 
  the shadow economy is a big issue in lithuania . 
  tend to agree . 
  however , it seems like nobody understands any of this . 
  the labor party here said they would double the minimum wage and have close to 0 % unemployment within 4 years if you vote for them , and people believed it . 
  what 's shocking is that people who know how to use the internet believe it , aka / r/europe . 
  trickle-down is a totally separate thing . 
  it is fiscal policy and it is/was only implemented by certain people during certain time periods . 
   the market treats rich better than poor . 
  once again , you are totally misunderstanding what the market is . 
  there is no separate market for rich and poor . 
  if the economic situation is improving on a fundamental level , all ` castes ' benefit . 
   people are upset about the notion that the market is this magical thing that universally produces the best results by itself . 
  do you know what the market is ? 
  it is the sum of all human economic interactions . 
  the market is n't some external thing that produces good or bad effects , it is the entire system of people seeking what they want and need . 
  people who talk about the ` invisible hand of the market ' in a sarcastic tone as though it is only used by \u00fcber libertarians and has no place in reality obviously have never sat through a ( at least ) highschool economics course , it is established . 
  it is also established that people trying to control these interactions as they please leads to less freedom and less efficiency . 
  and of course , in / r/europe , the top 3 comments are about the name ... 
  personally i do n't think it 's a good idea . 
  such a step is n't necessary to ` minimize nationalisms ' and i can live freely under my current flag , if those are the 2 arguments .

  spain was bankrupted by the irresponsible public sector , not the private , through infamous [ white elephant ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/spain/9003214/spains-white-elephant-airport-spents-30-million-euros-on-advertising.html ) projects and crazy pensions , benefits ( applies to greece as well , naturally ) . 
  very unfortunately / u/bleahbloh is one of the few people making sense in this thread . 
  i wo n't go over your entire post , but i will address this :  `` making murder illegal is controlling citizens !, 
  we should teach ourselves not to kill and have no laws ! '', 
  murder affects another person , in fact , it ends their status as a person . 
  when you harm others , the government needs to legislate to address that . 
  drinking red bull does n't affect anyone but yourself . 
  of course i recognize that minors are n't always capable of making that decision , so if parents feel their kids should n't be drinking energy drinks , i can totally see their reasoning . 
  but the previous arguments like `` parents ca n't control the actions of their offspring 24/7 '' are somewhat silly . 
  you do n't need constant observation to maintain some sense of mutual respect and set some ground rules . 
  just incredibly pointless . 
  also , linking to studies that energy drinks are harmful to mental/physical development of children are not a reason for there to be a law . 
  they are a reason for parents to move their kids away from energy drinks . 
  something harmful does n't immediately need to be translated into law .

  yeah right , france , uk , germany economies are not going to minus for your information . 
  they 're not supporting rebels and boosting military power while sacrificing common people money . 
  good i would n't keep talking with brain washed putins monkey . 
  he 's european . 
  europe can claim anyone that belongs to europeans . 
  agree . 
   stratfor this tells me it 's obviously retarded . 
  neo-commonwealth could though . 
   that 's incorrect lol . 
  russia has actively prevented countries from entering nato through the funding and aiding of separatists . 
  they still have the eurasian economic union , and csto . 
  belarus , kazakhstan , armenia , belarus and kyrgyzstan are all members of . 
   russians ca n't even hold on it 's `` yard '' ca n't you read ? 
  they literally initiate war and destroy peoples lives just because they ca n't hold on their `` yard '' . 
  while nato countries are happily living nice lives with growing economy . 
  good for russia being corrupt shit hole . 
  it is next to nothing when compared to eu and i doubt you would want to have russia as leader of such union . 
  csto , yeah again , nato wannabe . 
   neither does china , yet they are a very powerful country . 
  alliances only mean so much . 
  difference is that china 's economy is growing , it sells cheapest stuff to the world , including economic partnership with usa while russia 's economy sinks down toilet . 
   nope . 
  a massive and powerful army can be well maintained with a good budget - something which does n't change near regardless of economic position . 
  army clearly means something , otherwise the syrian army would n't have been advancing for months , taking most of latakia province and recently palmyra . 
  see ukraine , moldova and georgia for other examples . 
  you can maintain military with good enough budget , but when your country goes bankrupt all states will go ape shit on who controls what , aka civil war . 
   russia is as likely as the uk to go bankrupt . 
  russia is nowhere close to uk . 
  you should compare yourself to italy who 's still richer than russia . 
  what bias , when it 's already well known fact . 
  russians ca n't even hold on it 's `` yard '' and you talk about influence on geopolitics like syria , the only reason why russia is in syria is because of assad dictatorship who wants to hold grip on power against rebels and isis . 
  russia has no real ally who is at least relevant somehow these days . 
  anyway army means nothing , when your economy is going down the toilet , sooner or later russia will bankrupt itself if it keeps invading countries such as ukraine , moldova and georgia . 
  here is your `` kurwa '' sir , do not forget to use it . 
  it was inefficient part because nobility would be brided ( which they were ) by neighboring monarchs to elect their puppets as king and grand duke of commonwealth . 
  commonwealth had biggest nobility number in all of europe . 
  at that time nobility was 10 % of the population , and burghers were 15 % . 
  so it was democratic for it 's time . 
  insulting times of commonwealth : accepting that times of when union of k\u0117dainiai might happen were best .

  italy , greece , austria shit countries ? 
  you 're now talking non-sense . 
   which exactly ? 
  most of them do n't want to come here , why force them ? 
  stuff happening in w. europe is more than enough to know that bringing great chunks of those economic migrants will bring only problems ( living under rock lately ? ) . 
  we do n't care about their religion , lipka tatars lived in lithuania , poland and belarus since xiii c. when grand duke of lithuania invited them to fight in our army and gave them land for it . 
  you know every european union member pays to eu budget ? 
  though we happen to gain more from it . 
  european union is a project to make stable and rich europe so it 's in w. european mind to make sure e. europe is also rich . 
  if you think `` refugee '' crisis will destroy europe , you 're quite stupid , no point to even bring it to table . 
   why do people use `` economic migrant '' as such a pejorative ? 
  you ca n't call them refugees if :  they do n't want to come to poorer states  they bypass many safe countries it just screams that he 's economic migrant disguised as `` refugee '' . 
   any real qualifications beyond a high school education people like that do n't have money to migrate at all . 
  most migrants that from e. europe have skills in one or another field and they bring a lot in countries they migrate to . 
  i 'm surprised how can australian defend economic migrants when your government is the one who blocks them and from which we should learn how to deal with it . 
  why would we ? 
  they do n't want to come here , they bypass many safe countries , most of them do not escape war , but are economic migrants . 
  we speak traditional english ( uk ) , not simplified english ( usa ) :p,

  well it is our [ signature ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/coat_of_arms_of_lithuania ) to show our medieval past , glory that us and our fellow allies ( ruthenians , lipka tatars ) manage to bring to our land . 
  [ pretty much ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=et7uvowt_1c ) ;d, 
  i think kremlin would consider that as an act of war and would wave with their nukes and threat of invasion even more . 
  lithuanian elites were bilingual very least , they spoke both lithuanian and ruthenian , after union of lublin it was fully replaced with polish in some parts ( most notable vilnius region ) . 
  plus in samogitia , many nobles never ceased to speak lithuanian natively . 
  i think the biggest argument we could have give is that city was always in possession of lithuania and always was used as multi-cultural place without any fears of oppression . 
  i think dispute over city was one of my and your nations mistake that was the only rotten place that poisoned in our relationship .

  [ traitor !, 
  ] ( http://lolworthy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/traitor-stormtrooper-gif.gif ), 
  yeah , today it 's a hot-on-air topic at the moment , about stopping to act as victim in ww2 and name nazi collaborators that are guilty of their crime , so do n't worry about that , my polish friend . 
  anyway do n't let this `` stuff happening in all of europe '' to forget our past glories and what we could have achieved if only we showed trust in each other . 
  well for our national identity is in golden age at the moment . . 
  nobody said they 're not poles ... wth :d, 
   please expand . 
  this is interesting . 
  polonised is actually [ legit ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polish-lithuanian_identity ) argument . 
  you probably know j. pi\u0142sudski , polish hero that saved second polish republic from ussr claws . 
  and others like jogaila . 
   the family was polonized lithuanian nobility that over time became part of the polish nobility ( szlachta ) ; it has been called either a polish noble family or a polonized lithuanian noble family . 
  its most famous member was j\u00f3zef pi\u0142sudski , described variously as a pole or as polonized-lithuanian noble . 
   the pi\u0142sudskis date back to pagan times in lithuania and are recorded from the 13th century, 
  just give us the wheel , we always done better when we had the wheel !, 
  no , because my third language was french . 
  well actually most of them were polonised lithuanians , but they were poles no less . 
  before union of lublin , lithuanians were [ majority ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/27/lithuanian_language_in_the_16th_century.png/800px-lithuanian_language_in_the_16th_century.png ) in those areas . 
  i think they came from so called `` troll factory '' . 
  oh trust me we would n't be hostile to that , because you know , russia . 
  but we would probably be skeptical about it but still it 's unlikely as we have a bit of cooperation going on . 
  i 'm pretty sure the longer time goes the more close we would feel to each other so eventually we would submit to as you said `` intermarium 2.0 '' . 
  yeah i guessed as much . 
  do n't worry , it 's only minority that does show hate towards poland , they are just much more vocal since they do n't know when to shut up . 
  i give up . 
  it sounds like english written in cyrillic and it 's painful to read . 
  never , ever read delfi.lt comments , it 's like yt , if you want aids you go there . 
  ;d sadly lithuanians do n't really have interest in commonwealth times , out side contested regions in interwar period people literally do n't even know we once had shared state . 
   a reasonably big fuck you goes to lithuania for talking shit about the commonwealth . 
  there were some misunderstandings and some mistakes were made , but we have paid for them no smaller price than you . 
  we have learned the lesson . 
  no reason to act all butthurt now . 
  in spite of everything , we still had a beautiful thing going there , man . 
  hello there !, 
  my bro , listen , nobody are even talking about commonwealth as it 's not promoted that much , our golden age was when vytautas the great reign over gdl because after his death g.d. of moscow grew stronger and stronger , it was n't just weak enemy anymore , it become a full rival . 
  on bright side we 're more than happy that you accept your mistake and we 're ready to forgive you < 3, 
  i hold grudge on poland for being [ mean and bossy in interwar period ] ( http://i.imgur.com/refhodn.jpg ) , if not that we could been bff like we were before year of 1795 . 
  now [ it breaks my heart ] ( http://i.imgur.com/usepsqn.png ) to see hungary and poland being bff while we 're forgotten like some kind man you used to have . 
  that 's why we consume a lot of alcohol now . 
  even google ' translate ca n't translate that . 
  potatoes first rage , how cute !, 
  since we do n't have any contested regions between each other anymore , i 'm pretty sure we could re-create commonwealth which is what you dreamed in interwar period ( nationalism from both sides ruined this idea ) . 
  we 're not so different in any sphere , out side language of course . 
  either way european nations will have to federalize to keep relevant status in the world stage , so this could only help to start it . 
  do you hate us ? 
  but latvia can not into blood !, 
  genocide and suppress of non-serbian population in kosovo was legal and approved by the un ? 
  last time i remember when we had wheel we defeated teutonic order and stuff , become great power and stuff and then you took wheel we got partitioned !, 
  so lithuania-poland-lithuania ? 
  only if this time it 's lithuania-poland , 
  true but nato , eu and also rest of nordics are one of the biggest reasons we 're less , and less liability . 
  new headline : russia forces withdraw from baltics as they 're getting slain by nato forces . 
  lenkija , please , not again . 
  eesti vikings are scary !,

  the average wage in turkey is what , around 500 euros ? 
  it 's more than 2000 in the netherlands . 
  since we 're talking about georgia , does anyone know if eu id card is enough when going there ? 
  or do i need a passport ? 
  edit : i just checked with the embassy , id card is enough for all eu citizens . 
  visa is needed only if you plan on staying for more than one year . 
  it 's large but poor . 
  hah , i 'm eating pizza with a pineapple right now . 
  good thing i 'm not in iceland . 
  by the way , [ you can make it too ] ( http://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2013/01/foolproof-pan-pizza-recipe.html ) , it 's a very simple recipe , no weird ingredients and the pizza is delicious . 
  they were . 
  i 'm from the weird part of europe and even we had movies , comic books , etc. 
  nutella even did a promotion , where their jars were actually drinking glasses with characters from the show . 
  i had many but most of them broke over the years , only [ the village bard ] ( http://i.imgur.com/luoeun1.jpg ) remains . 
  lithuania here , we took in ukrainian refugees too . 
  we are all fairly similar culturally , shared history and all that . 
  i really would prefer ukrainian refugees to somalian ones . 
  we 've built a lot of stuff since 2004 . 
  we 'll survive . 
   they could introduce progressive taxes the government in lithuania talked about that very recently . 
  the idea is that if people earn more , then they pay more . 
  and then somehow everyone collectively forgot that it already works like that . 
  we pay a percentage of our income as tax . 
  we do n't pay a fixed amount . 
  if i earn 1000 euros , then i automatically pay twice as much as someone who earns 500 euros . 
  leaving the eu would be definite , total , complete suicide for us . 
  eu is the best thing that happened to us since the fall of the soviet union . 
  it allowed us to grow very fast . 
  lots of new markets opened . 
  eu funding for infrastructure has resulted in an insane amount of modernization across the whole country . 
  great roads , tidy towns , lots of businesses and farms , lots of work places , etc. 
  without eu we 'd be like belarus now . 
  we 're actually doing quite good . 
  we have sanctions too . 
  they hurt us at first , but now new markets are being discovered by manufacturers so it 's no longer an issue . 
  also , russia sucks anyway , so having fewer things to do with them is good . 
  the plan was to hire something like 6000 permanent workers . 
  also , lots of people in the area will benefit because factory will need supplies and the workers will need places where they can spend their money . 
  that 's now the lithuanian coat of arms . 
  lithuanian flag history is very long and complicated . 
  [ the rider ] ( http://i.imgur.com/mwlcf5b.png ) was rejected because of the background colour 's connections to the revolution , the soviets and all that . 
  the current yellow-green-red flag was chosen in 1918 , which is when lithuania declared independence from the russian empire . 
  it 's called the national flag . 
  initial idea contained just green and red , as those are the dominating colours in lithuanian folklore clothing . 
  yellow was added to make the flag brighter , more positive . 
  the russians banned it in 1940 so any talks about its design were n't allowed . 
  it stayed hidden in people 's homes as a symbol of resistance . 
  it returned in 1988 as an important historical artifact , symbol of independence and all that . 
  changing it would be kind of not cool . 
  the rider is called `` the historical flag '' and it 's still used in some places , like the president 's flag . 
  wandering around in weird locations is my favorite sport !, 
   even if it was obvious that i was walking towards a dead end somewhere , i still walked there because often there was something really cool at the end of that path . 
  i once went for a walk around the island ( northern , eastern , southern corners ) without a map . 
  found some really cozy and nice places without any tourists . 
  clothes drying on a line , some store selling kitchen appliances , an old warehouse full of some chairs or something . 
  found three football fields , which is a bit crazy considering how expensive land is in venice . 
  found lots of abandoned places too , walked on the outside of [ the wall ] ( https://www.google.com/maps/@45.4381944,12.3538056,3a,75y,193.79h,91.8t/data=!3m8!1e1!3m6!1s-g7aadihxeta%2fuzfbgalsmii%2faaaaaaaajd4%2fx6crf2r40xoyllzwxqcnjyun-g6v0q7iqcjkc!2e4!3e11!6s%2f%2flh4.googleusercontent.com%2f-g7aadihxeta%2fuzfbgalsmii%2faaaaaaaajd4%2fx6crf2r40xoyllzwxqcnjyun-g6v0q7iqcjkc%2fw203-h100-k-no-pi0-ya284.9421-ro-0-fo100%2f!7i3584!8i1792 ) which houses the garbage and which is actually the outer wall of a military port . 
  overall it 's quite an interesting city . 
  i even saw an ambulance speed through the canal once . 
  it 's not the post alone , i 'm guessing that he was an advocate of separation from russia too , and `` inciting violence against mother russia '' is very illegal . 
  sorry , i forgot the / s. 
  we do n't know yet . 
  he was from pakistan but that could mean anything , obviously . 
  2 % of pakistanis are hindus , so we can roll with that for now . 
  the building is a shared property , it belongs to all the apartment owners . 
  we do n't have janitors , we do all the cleaning ourselves . 
  one guy from the us stayed at my place in lithuania with couchsurfing . 
  i live in an apartment , built at the end of ussr . 
  we met up with some other people , other couchsurfers and hosts who all live in older apartments too . 
  this american guy was really surprised that the buildings look horrible on the outside and common areas ( staircases ) look bad too , yet all the apartments are nice , spacious and modern . 
  the reason is that most people will gladly get a loan and fix up their personal space , but why would anyone want to waste money on the stairs , which will be used by other people too ? 
   it ends with equality between the third world and the first the problem here is that people from both sides do n't want equality . 
  our culture and religion is n't all that different from most of europe , i think . 
  you guys might be different , i do n't know . 
  one of those migs crashed recently too , on the same ship . 
   it 's called negotiation . 
  yes , it is . 
  in this case the main negotiation points are freedom of movement and access to the market . 
  want access ? 
  main condition for that is freedom of movement . 
  otherwise you 're on your own , have fun trying to negotiate from zero with every single country . 
  have fun trying to negotiate with france and germany after you tell them to fuck off . 
  keeping access to the single market is not an option without freedom of movement . 
  leavers want to restrict movement . 
  that 's fine , really . 
  eu will simply restrict uk 's access to the single market . 
   finnish and estonian language are related uralic languages , another one in the group is hungarian . 
  does n't make sense geographically . 
  what do you mean ? 
  but what about the country ? 
  then what are you ? 
  two baltic languages , three [ baltic states . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/baltic_states ), 
  yes . 
  estonia always wanted to be one of the scandinavian countries , their language is n't similar to lithuanian/latvian , their lifestyle is different , etc. 
  so it 's a running joke everywhere . 
  also , in polandball non-english countries ca n't speak english very well . 
  you 're baltic too , get back down here . 
  [ some countries ] ( http://i.imgur.com/vwyr0v4.png ) missing from your list . 
  it 's not as different within london but try going further up north ( [ like liverpool ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=csq6_vbhu4q ) ) and it 's like a whole different language .

  did you just suggest koskenkorva as a better alternative to finlandia ? 
   let 's chat about something other than russia, 
  we have the highest suicide rate in the world . 
  it is anger-causing sad . 
  situation is especially horrible in rural areas . 
  at least the rates are slowly decreasing , but some years back , if you are male and live in rural area , you had chance of 106/100 ,000 of killing yourself . 
  that is 0.1 % to kill yourself at given year . 
  in 10 years time , you would have 1 % chance to kill yourself ( ~ 1,000 rural males out of 100,000 kill themselves in 10 years time ) . 
  i mean it 's just plainly horrific statistics . 
  at least our news completely stopped covering any kind of suicides , there are various support lines and i simply hope that eventually we 'll get away from this . 
  do n't take this too seriously , as it was a suggestion for fun combined with something i believe in , not a serious one of launching pro-eu propaganda machine in ukraine , as you probably imagined . 
  regarding your statement , i have never witnessed a poster making reasonable representation over any complex matter and i do n't think that is the purpose to begin with . 
  what is in your opinion reasonable representation , then ? 
  this is good approach to life in general . 
  good reasoning , i may use your work as an inspiration for something similar if you do n't mind  . 
  i for one know that many eastern europeans look like this : http://imgur.com/rxfrujs . 
  not really difficult in telling that apart . 
  that is adorable !, 
  i was actually positively surprised how friendly the irish speak of 2004 crowd that came there  . 
  ** becherovka ** . 
  the czechs have made a drink that tastes like unicorn tears , a magnificient dance of taste , spectacle of scents , a drink that makes you warm in coldest moments of one 's life , a drink that makes you feel proud of being human , as one has achieved enough to be able to taste this . 
  i seriously love it . 
  beautiful , my friend , beautiful . 
  i wish we could find someone in ukraine , for them to get printed and glued here and there . 
  then take photo of that  would be good moment for / r/europe . 
  do you have a high-res version / . psd ? 
  so that is why almond sauce is served in proper places instead . 
  have to say it tastes really good . 
  agree on this one too , 
  no music , but got me to loud laugh as well  . 
  but what 's so unlikely about ketchup and fries combo ? 
  seems perfectly normal . 
  exactly . 
  this research found only 0,4 % difference between finland and poland . 
  i have spent quite a lot of time in both countries and can only call this as complete nonsense :( . 
   ... three numbers makes as much sense as forcing republika srpska to be part of bosnia . 
  you know you are in r/europe when you see this, 
  charts like this make me worried for bulgaria . 
  not because it would be anyhow wrong to not want euro due to economic reasons , but because i am afraid that reasons may not be economic at all in case of bulgaria . 
  we 're sorry , my friend . 
  every time flying to/from cph i can only hide myself from shame when i see people from my country acting rudely , disrespectfully , and just plainly obnoxiously . 
  we can not stand dumb faces of those loud , stupid , stealing moron criminals either , no one wants them . 
  funny thing is , situation with stealing really improved back here , as many of these people have left . 
  imagine this happening in us . 
  haha , every time someone from any other country visits , i give this thing with no english name ( we call them s\u016brelis , like a lil ` cheese to be literal ) , and every single person so far has asked why the hell they do n't have it in their country . 
  i honestly think this is awesome business opportunity , would just need some effort to get people to try it  . 
  a bit late into a party , but it 's finland . 
  spent one of the best years of my life there . 
  extremely friendly and kind people , vast and beautiful nature , livable cities , modern universities and lots of good design . 
  i would often find myself better understood there rather than in my home country , i guess that is why i live with a finn now  . 
  depends how you look at it  . 
  assuming you include baltics into the definition , their numbers are only 1 % off countries like portugal and greece , who are older ( recent history-wise ) and more developed countries . 
  in 10 years , this chart will be way more even !, 
  i think of all the countries i 've been travelling to , slovenia was the friendliest and the kindest . 
  truly a small , but special place  . 
  i do agree that this law solves no problems , but with all due respect , can not see street signs being such a large problem that it would deteriorate our relations as two cooperating countries with shared history . 
  edit : i see what you have written earlier . 
  i will just add that street signs in polish is not a display of discrimination against polish speaking lithuanians . 
  we are one nation , and we live together . 
  street signs are not put because of our country is 20 year old state with history of oppression ( just like yours ) , with experience how quickly times change , and thus with fears of external forces taking advantage of that . 
  most of people here do not oppose those street signs in polish , no one could really see any real problem with that per se . 
  but we do n't ever want to see russian language signs , anywhere , ever . 
  because we and up between hammer and a hard place , thus the situation . 
  the law from original link has nothing to do with street signs , if you read it , by the way . 
  can you please say [ serious ] how this legislation is somehow discriminatory ? 
  did you even read it ? 
  that is why i do n't think our nations should be feeling any offence to each other . 
  it makes me sad to read when fellow redditor writes this :  i 'm for that . 
  unfortunately lithuania does n't offer anything to native polish minority there . 
  that 's very very sad . 
  at least they would acknowledge that here you can be born to polish speaking parents , play with polish speaking children , go to polish-speaking kindergarten ( by the way , just in front of my windows where i live ) , then go through all 12 years in polish speaking school , then enter polish speaking university and complete it . 
  i have many awesome friends from the minority and they are free to express their identity . 
  it is sad to hear words like `` oppression '' and similar . 
  and in light of that , street labels look like insignificant issue , and while i would love to put those street labels in polish , i also understand arguments ( what i wrote above ) of those who oppose it . 
  and emotions , as unfortunately , leader of polish minority in lithuania is pro-russian populist clown that purposefully tries to destroy ties and worsen relations between our countries to gain power . 
  i think this is vastly different situation , as you have 0.03 % of swedes , like few hundred people , of which majority live in tallinn . 
  i am certain estonia 's approach would be different if you had equal percentage of two actual minorities . 
  it is nice , though , to have bilingual signs were ethnologically appropriate . 
  the thing is , we have almost equal amount of russian ( 5,8 % ) peoples as polish-speaking peoples ( 6.6 % ) , and while it is true they are scattered , there are areas where they make majority . 
  i know about punsk , but i was saying that i , personally , would like seeing polish language street signs in vilnius area , where polish-speaking lithuanians live  . 
  edit : history of these two minorities is different , but it could hardly be used as an argument against russians . 
  i personally think that polish speaking peoples are lithuanians who simply speak polish since forever , rather than being separate slavic peoples . 
  i think forming headlines like this is a bit destructive . 
  to begin with , bilingual street names were never legal . 
  the whole situation is way more complex and certainly not black and white in any possible way . 
  allowing bilingual street signs would require to define areas in which they are allowed . 
  now , as many of you will know , in lithuania we have two minorities of almost equal size : those of polish language and russians . 
  if we allow predominantly polish speaking areas to have those signs , we will have no reason to deny russians to have it as well . 
  and when russians have it , it makes a new internal border of predominantly russian area , marked with russian street names . 
  do you hear how dangerous it is , knowing current events ? 
  these areas are conveniently bordering belarus , and i think it would be crazy move to allow that to happen . 
  dear polish friends , i think it would be nice to have some polish language street signs in areas where polish-speaking lithuanians live , but we do n't want our russian colleagues to make new internal borders . 
  does he want to restore the commonwealth ? 
  vityok is saying that russia has started a war in order to justify their existence . 
  franbatista123 is pretending to not understand the point and by that is making one of two possible statements : a ) russia did not start a war b ) russia started a war , but not with purpose of justifying its existence because these two statements are conflicting and your comment does not make it clear what you meant , you deserve a downvote . 
  here you have it . 
  ever since i left finland i am reading those news and basically every week there are some massive layoffs from one of the larger companies . 
  makes me worried , hope the growth is to return soon . 
  thank you - this was very interesting read and gives some insight on the current affairs in balkans  . 
  that is why i have signed myself and convinced many people to do so as well , who in turn convinced some others .

[ eastern european men school ] ( http://m.youtube.com/watch?v=5uzu58n-sso ), 
  lithuanian language and lithuania itself probably survived because of church and it 's only that we were the last pagans . 
  estonian language is the very different one . 
  lithuanian and latvian are a bit similiar , both are from the baltic language tree - latvian , lithuanian , prussian . 
  prussian language is dead , so there 's two of them . 
  estonian is more finnish than latvian/lithuanian . 
  why estonia was the one which did n't get touched in this picture ? 
  it 's not the majority . 
  i wonder how latvian is the # 3 language in latvia ... 
  by the way i always wondered . 
  if you usually have imperial system in maths , problems are in imperial , but if they just ask numbers ? 
  numbers are the same as in metric , and when americans count in imperial then they have a problem without sizes , just numbers , is it awkward ? 
  like 4 foot + 4 foot u get something bigger , but in just numbers you get 8 . 
  i wonder is it annoying . 
  one citation added, 
  i 'm on phone so finding citations is hard , but i 'll try, 
  of course it 's bad , the guy who said it said it in a manner like `` expect the worse . '', 
  anyways , it had nothing to do with it , i just replied to the part `` what this sub has become ? '', 
  i do n't know about post war emigration , but regarding pre-war emigration , lithuanians went to us and actually worked and did shit . 
  lithuanians and poles do the same thing in uk now . 
  most of the people who go to uk from these two countries are chavs , but most still work and help do shit . 
  they do the dirty work . 
  uk should deport every immigrant person who does n't work and not allow him milk money for free . 
  i do n't want my own countrymen to be useless burdens and a half . 
  muslims , on the other half , are exactly that . 
  80 % of somalis in the netherlands are unemployed , 50 % are claiming benefits . 
  they came from countries where they acquired 0 skills . 
  they are just bugs eating the system . 
  i would n't have anything against them if they would actually contribute to society . 
  i have nothing about legit immigrants who came here to actually do something , not only sit in ghettos and be delusional assholes thinking we owe them money . 
  why should i have anything against obama , who is an immigrant , but has all the skills to be the most powerful man in the western world and actually became one ? 
  why should i have anything against a black youtuber who is making millions of people laugh everyday ? 
  tell me how illegal immigrants help countries like spain in any way , to countries who sit on 30 % unemployment , have to pay welfare to most of them and then also pay huge money to these immigrants , who are just getting money to not wreck shit and be happy ? 
  they are just a ticking bomb , who requires a lot of resources to slow down . 
  once the resources will come to an end , expect something worse than a few shot boats .

  wonders of multiculturalism !, 
  when leaving one culture to join another is punishable by death , you ca n't have these two cultures together in one place . 
  lithuanian here . 
  i saw other things posted here , but more info why finland was attacked : on 1940 , soviet russia offered a treaty to lithuania , latvia , estonia and finland . 
  it was really an ultimatum , a demand though . 
  stalin always tried to make everything look legal as possible , so he offered lithuania to give vilnius back and get it back from the poles while lithuania would let the red army to enter and build bases in lithuania 's teritory . 
  soviet russia gave 24/48 hours for countries to decide . 
  lithuania , latvia , estonia accepted the ultimatum . 
  finland declined . 
  because of that , russia invaded finland . 
  oh and also , russia , prussia and austria divided and claimed polish-lithuanian commonwealth . 
  after that , russia banned lithuanian language , lithuanian press and letters ban ( people imported books from germany at that times , the struggle was real ) . 
  they also tried to distance lithuania from poland , that 's why the only lithuanian school in lithuanian lands was near poland - it was a school where all the intelligents grew up in and continued to push lithuania towards independence . 
  thing is , i 'm not from the states , but i am from lithuania and lithuania is really pushing the anti-russia propaganda well . 
  shit , front page of our news sites are always `` analysis '' of shit putin does . 
  however , who are you to talk ? 
  you just insulted americans , just as i said russians always do , blamed them for being propaganda targets and then you also said that it 's wrong to call others brainwashed . 
  you just confirmed my past comment and then kicked yourself in the balls as well . 
  you are still brainwashed . 
  let me tell you , most of the people in the us give zero fucks about putin or russia . 
  you just keep talking about the us even though the more far away from russia a person is , the less he cares about it . 
  want to see some anti-russian propaganda in action ? 
  look at ex warsaw pact and ussr states ( which is justified , because neither conservatives , nor liberals want to do anything with russia here ) . 
  you constantly blaming and crying wolf about america just proves how brainwashed you are . 
  really ? 
  yet strange how all russians on reddit talk about is how they are the targets of propaganda all the time and also find a way to blame us in their comments . 
  wake up , you 're just being brainwashed . 
  stop crying . 
  not really . 
  lithuania broke out on march 11 1990 . 
  cats n dogs innit, 
  i have finnish friends on the internet . 
  when we get onto skype , they talk finnish in a funny way , like they 're joking , accenting very hard . 
  not sure if that 's the jokey accent koreans are notorious of or do they really always talk like that . 
  if they do , their language is very funny . 
  i also like how they sometimes scream , but they still pause at their double t or sometimes talk in such delicacy like their tongue is very fragile . 
  examples : viiiit ... tuuuuuuu vitti ( almost sounds like latin vici ), 
  i do n't know if that 's what you are looking for , but we have a word that means `` we have n't gathered enough rabbit cabbages ourselves yet '' in lithuanian . 
  i mean , finland and denmark ended up way better out of warsaw pact and look at how ahead they are in terms of ... pretty much everything compared to poland or baltic states . 
  saying they helped with rebuilding after ww2 is stupid . 
  russians are good at doing work . 
  they even used to make hammers and shovels out of expensive metals . 
  russians would always do the hard work right . 
  well , calling everyone a sjw is bad , but shit / u/benthetraveler is still retarded . 
  if they would do such changes to subreddits everyone likes then you 'd be pissed . 
  you dislike ct and that 's why you do n't care about it . 
  lol exactly . 
  too bad libertarian party suddenly became popular in my country , while their reason of success were new bright and well designed posters everywhere . 
  never have i understood this reddit dogmas like `` let 16 year olds vote ! '' . 
  all it would do is bring more votes to the libertarian party , which ideas are already cancerous . 
  liberalism is too popular between young people ( redditors ) for / r/libertarian to be banned . 
  wait , / r/mensrights should be banned , but / r/feminism not ? 
  why ? 
  so you disagree with me and you start calling me a neckbeard ? 
  no wonder you want to ban everything you dislike , fucking hypocrite . 
  well , i do n't know the story behind wpd ban , but if it was only for germany , govt probably demanded it turned off . 
  of course providing access to reddit for 80 mllion people is more important than a few thousand who frequent that sub . 
  also , if reddit would n't have blocked it , local isps were to block it . 
  tho i do n't know why and how it got banned so i might be completely wrong . 
  of course . 
  just because you want coontown banned does n't mean it has to be banned .

  in reality almost no one even went to vote , and those who did voted against russia . 
  unofficial data says something like 18 % attendance . 
  i have friends and relatives there , but they have since left crimea . 
  those poll results were too obvious to question whether russia was running the whole show or not . 
  as for nazis , you said [ here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2hm3f2/crimea_six_months_after_it_was_annexed_by_russia/cku5l7q ) that they 're fighting for ukraine in the east . 
   what has happened before was that people of some worth disappeared , not some random protester . 
  this statement of yours shows that you know absolutely nothing about the russian way , what kgb did and all that . 
  you could 've been arrested for making a joke about the shittyness of the government * in your own home * . 
  that good friend of yours was actually a kgb agent and he gave you in , because he felt that you were complaining about the government too much . 
  participating in actual protests would have resulted in your whole family just disappearing . 
   didnt even mention anything russia has claimed ( that hasnt been claimed in western media as well ) in this entire thread . 
  no , i 'm pretty sure that you did . 
  kremlin 's main official excuse for the actions in ukraine is that kiev is controlled by nazis who are torturing their own people . 
  that 's what they keep repeating on state-run news channels and in all mass media . 
  did you not read my comment ? 
  she has every right to believe that this was exactly what happened because it * happened before * . 
  also , it seems like you really dislike `` propaganda from kiev '' but are ok with propaganda from moscow . 
  why is that ? 
  ok , so it all started when you said that the disappearing of two friends of that woman is just hysterical paranoia or something . 
  but the trick is that it 's not . 
  we 've seen it happen many many times in the soviet union and in russia after that . 
  it 's the government 's way of dealing with people who try to cause unrest , revolution or something similar . 
  believing what that woman said is not `` brainwashed sheep '' stuff , it 's actually very probable . 
  why ? 
  because we know for a fact that the russian government is ok with it . 
  it was one of the main tasks for the kgb , find and remove those who are actively against the government 's ideologies . 
   if a claim of russia annexing crimea is true does that mean that claim of russia invading mexico is true ? 
  see the difference ? 
  ... what ? 
  do you know what evidence is ? 
  a claim is not baseless if it 's backed up by tons of evidence . 
   who gives a fuck who reports it . 
  everyone who wants to see actual facts and not propaganda ? 
  so that 's not you , i guess . 
   nazis fight in volunteer battalions on east . 
  do they ? 
  i do n't remember seeing a single svastika among all those videos . 
  not a single concentration camp either . 
  could you enlighten me ? 
  it 's not a claim , it 's a fact . 
  plenty of evidence for it . 
   just because ukraine uses nazis to fight that 's what russian media repeats all the time . 
  so yea , i probably would n't believe you . 
  i live in ex-soviet country , we have plenty of experience with russian propaganda machine . 
  it 's really easy to tell facts from propaganda when you live with it for a few decades . 
  the facts are quite clear , russia has occupied and annexed crimea , now is doing the same in eastern ukraine , sending soldiers there constantly . 
  that 's an objective fact . 
   anti russian circlejerk because russia is the only actual victim in this whole thing ? 
   and posting time limit you either have n't verified your email , or you are a bad person who does n't add anything to the discussion . 
  time limit will appear if you get downvoted a lot , i.e. 
  to slow down your trolling . 
  yes yes , and they are all literally hitlers . 
  that could be said to you too ... 
  being a little over the line is all you need to be snatched up by an angry russian !, 
  so finish your meal and go to bed . 
  it would be nice for a change , but it probably wo n't happen . 
  this is n't the first time when thousands are in the streets . 
  the police and special forces will arrest as many as they can , beat the others and that will be all . 
  police are now regrouping , soon there will be hundreds arrested . 
  multiple helicopters can be heard on live feed . 
  yes , the official term is public service announcement or something . 
  russia wo n't take over the whole world overnight . 
  not gon na happen , this would be a suicide for russia . 
  doing this would n't result in a few measly sanctions and a few bans to travel to us . 
  it would be a complete , total embargo of absolutely everything , either way . 
  without anyone to buy their gas and oil , russia would go bankrupt very quickly . 
  what we call eastern europe is really south-eastern europe , i.e. 
  everything from bulgaria to belarus . 
  lithuania politically and culturally is eastern europe , geographically it 's central europe ( guinness book of world records recognizes our center of europe as the one true center ) and visually it 's northern , because we 're at the same latitude as the southern end of sweden . 
  i personally think that the baltics are north-eastern . 
  of course not . 
  it 's just that they do n't really have a choice . 
  of course , every country has their problems , but actually france is quite high on the list of good countries . 
  especially when we 're comparing it to somalia or eritrea . 
  because france has a functioning government . 
  that makes sense . 
  on the other hand , does russia really see finland as a threat ? 
  is putin afraid that finns ( or estonians or anyone else ) will just invade them and try to occupy moscow or something ? 
  who does n't see russia as a threat , besides maybe china ? 
  ours is about to be opened , gas will be imported from norway . 
  a big-ass ship was built specifically for this task , it 's currently on the way here from korea . 
  lithuania has just sent a few tons of supplies for the soldiers . 
  not guns , just food , clothes , sleeping bags and such . 
  if putin attacks the baltics and nato does n't do anything , then the whole organisation falls apart . 
  putin will take romania after that , maybe bulgaria or moldova , since they are not any more important than the baltics , step by step he could take over the whole europe . 
  when would nato start actually doing something ? 
  when weird green guys showed up in the outskirts of berlin ? 
  none . 
  they actually only agreed to start thinking about holding another meeting in which they may or may not talk about ending the war . 
  they probably shot those rockets towards the ukrainian military bases and then just pretended to be shooting them towards poland . 
  with money comes power . 
  if you have billions then you can hire more troops , train soldiers , occupy countries . 
  norway . 
   the only high-profile politician in europe who is n't afraid of telling it like it is . 
  is he really the only one ? 
  this is just asking for some russian freedom givers . 
  it has n't been called wilno since 1939 . 
  that one is n't cheap , 
  that food is n't just sitting there , waiting for anyone to take it . 
  it still costs money .

  trying to trigger a lot of serbians , do n't you ? 
  oh please , totally lithuania 's fault for being occupied for half a century by a superpower who was oppressive dictatorship with idiotic ideology which was also forced onto us . 
  we totally wanted to be a burden for rest of europe , we totally do n't want to invest money we 're getting from eu , we totally want to remain shit-hole ... for god 's sake , we 're small country , who 's economy and own population was getting raped by foreign powers , more than 80 % of our gdp was stolen by soviet government . 
  we 're trying our best to climb to western european standards of living . 
  so , please , give us a break , will you ? 
  vytis ' casus belli been activated . 
  time for spirit of the `` grand duchy '' to force the `` united baltic duchy '' into existence . 
  making genocide is futile , the nato will stop you , submit or prepare for bombings . 
  it was created to counter ussr , now it 's here to counter russia , why else would ex-warsaw pact countries would leave it and join nato instead ? 
  nobody wants to be an ally with russia for historical and modern time reasons . 
  what next ? 
  we should let them do warfare practice on our soil ? 
  not a biggie , nothing bad will happen , right ? 
  and no they would n't do a return fire , if they enter our territory and start firing they 're literally declaring war on us and nato , since it 's nato planes that protect our air-space and our soil . 
  turkey is strategic point for usa , no way they would let it go . 
   ~ ~ turkey ~ ~ russia is ruled by minihitler ~ ~ erdogan ~ ~ putin who dreams of another ~ ~ osman ~ ~ russian empire authoritarian president in nutshell . 
  i think you meant from russian empire . 
  nato is [ helping us to protect ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/baltic_air_policing ) our air-space so i doubt we would do that in first place . 
  this is nothing new . 
  the only time it will stop doing that if we shoot down their air-craft as turkey did . 
  adolfas was popular name in lithuania before ww2 . 
   on the banner were the faces of these `` heroes '' : adolfas ramanauskas-vanagas if he 's not a hero i do n't know what he is then . 
  le napoleon crossed vilnius when campaign against russian empire started , and then started to run back to france after tasting russian cold through lithuania yet again . 
  i remember one sentence from school that was in history books - `` when soldiers were running to church they saw a dog , they quickly chased it and ate it alive '' . 
  well in medieval times we imported some kebabs and gave them free land in favor of fighting in our army , they were called [ lipka tatars ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lipka_tatars ) , they were brought somewhere at beginning of xiv c . they also helped us to secure our independence from greatest nemesis at that time - [ teutonic order ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_grunwald ) .

  we become a minority in our very own country ... : ^ (, 
  they stole our [ baltic brothers land ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/old_prussians ) and name . 
  never forget , never forgive !, 
  i 'm talking about moment when `` poland '' starts to be highlighted which i assume shows start of commonwealth while gif showed it far earlier than year 1569, 
  so that aggressor would feel brit pain . 
  food looks so yammy . 
  why do you keep brining people in this , they were aiming at military targets . 
  well [ it is not wrong ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polish\u2013lithuanian_union ) , but it 's wrong with polish-lithuanian commonwealth formation . 
  same about union of lublin . 
  if americans and russians are already firing nuclear weapons it pretty much says we 're all fucked , sitting down wo n't change a thing and only will show that you 're next to nothing on commitments you made . 
  i think we should n't look at past now , future is the most important part in which we must focus . 
  it did touch my heart , if i ever need to stand together with you in front lines , i will do it without a second thought . 
  nobody is going to attack my broliukas !, 
  nuclear strike on london is definitely an act of war , together with article v invoking it means invasion of russia to capture mad-mans that are responsible for death of innocent brits . 
  if possible to restore order and maybe at last friendly government towards west that such scenario would become only history . 
  true that we should create a very close military alliance than nato is but we should n't exclude other states just because . 
  joint trainings for future operations would only come in handy . 
  you literally want to give up territories that hold historical value which never had russians before terror of soviet union occupation came . 
  besides there is [ no 100 % russian territories ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/df/russians_in_baltic_states_%282011%29.svg/800px-russians_in_baltic_states_%282011%29.svg.png ) in the baltics . 
  in the movie their - british nuclear weapons would be fired on military targets , not civilians , so it makes no sense to not fire them if your capital gets nuked . 
  this is an auto-article v invoking . 
  would suggest to ignore them , they serve no purpose , only being a whiny as you said . 
  what i have seen from this movie was risk that kremlin brings to the rest of the world , an absolute nuclear armageddon . 
  those `` rebel '' russians for me were seen as a tools , as a puppets that are pulled by strings and few of them dying for no reason and vise versa , because some mad-man wants to gain `` influence '' and `` prestige '' . 
  this movie sparked a bigger patriotism in me , it showed that one day i will have to stand with my allies , my blood brothers - latvians against a historical aggressor that will never leave us alone . 
  this movie was definitely not aimed against russians or russian state itself , but against those who sit in kremlin , those mad-mans that would want such scenario to happen . 
  so please , do n't be one of those who always say that doing something that kremlin does n't want somehow interfere with russians . 
  latvia because balts stronk !, 
  and estonia ofc for their warm heart and together making a stand-off against soviets and russians . 
  maybe poland also ... ^ ^ ^ vilnius ^ ^ ^ never ^ ^ ^ forget, 
   marxism-leninism this ended with lenins death , when stalin started to reign it become a rogue state , a totalitarian dictatorship caring nothing but about expansion . 
  it was not directly made for russians but it was used as such , being `` sovietized '' was again only change of name from word `` russified '' . 
  nobody are blaming russia for ussr crimes but it acts as it was her empire or something , russian minorities are in love with ussr times since they had privileges in non-russian republics . 
  defend russia as much as you want , you ca n't change facts . 
  [ islandija best nordic !,

  * russian language enforced onto non-russian speakers - check * spread of russian population through non-russian republics - check * suppressing national or any other form of freedom movement , with military actions - check * capital city/base of ussr being moscow -  kremlin - check ussr basically was russian empire 2.0 just with different name , whether you like it or not . 
  but you have higher chance of stand off an invasion till nato allies come , we ( baltics ) on other hand can be cut off entirely through suwalki gap . 
  trust me if war happens we will be the ones fucked , not you . 
  so estonia is now guilty ? 
  that 's ignorant cold war mentality that is still stuck in their head , i guess it will take some time before getting erased . 
  that we will [ support ukraine ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lithuanian\u2013polish\u2013ukrainian_brigade ) no matter what .

  which you could end asap with removing presence from ukrainian territory . 
  sounds like a paradise !, 
  well , aivaras abromavi\u010dius ( ukrainian born in lithuania ) , minister of economic development and trade of ukraine , not long ago said about his resignation because of huge corruption , while western ambassadors are sad to see him being out , because he was one of few who actually cared about ukraine .

  we do n't use `` respublika '' to refer to polish-lithuanian commonwealth . 
  lithuanian term '' \u017de\u010dpospolita '' specifically refers to that state . 
  mine 's too , you 're correct, 
  it 's sob story post about `` hate circlejerk '' . 
   `` vitriolic hate towards us achieves is the same thing coming back at them in return '' hate against who then if not kremlin , vatniks and putin supporters ? 
  russian people ? 
  who hates russian people here anyway ? 
  any examples ? 
  nope . 
  but do the opposite , tell a latvian , he 's basically lithuanian . 
  enjoy ;-), 
  how many did you meet ? 
  a lithuanian who never came into contact with pole might have an unwarranted impression that a pole will be hostile to him in some way . 
  i once met a foreign student who did n't want to tell us where his from for some reason , later we found out that he was from poland . 
  me and my friends were baffled about it , made me pretty sad . 
   but why should they ? 
  they are the successors of soviet union . 
  it 's their moral responsibility , just like germany being the better country took the responsibility to acknowledged it 's crimes and was forgiven by europe . 
   it 's not the same political entity , it 's not the same people ------------------------------  why giving innocent people the burden of what their ancestors did ? 
  -------------  also no one would have known what could have happened without russian protection/occupation .

  we 're not talking about events that happened 200 years ago ... do n't portray it like it happened a century ago ... `` ancestors '' ... are you that uneducated on the mater ? 
  you must be a troll . 
  i wonder how would history of the region be thought in poland if that was the case . 
  `` here in wilno region , the formation of lithuanian state was started , mindaugas united all the lithuanian/baltic tribes/clans , there were 3 capitals ( voruta , kernav\u0117 , trakai ) in this region before wilno city was built by gediminas , the city of wilno has been the capital of lithuania for centuries and all lithuanian rulers resided here , now the city and the region belongs to poland , and that 's why lithuanians do n't talk with us anymore ... '' :d, 
  it could have been a different situation if russia aknowleged illegal occupation of baltic states and the political , cultural and economical damage done to these states during the period . 
   you 're basically polish meh , start saying `` ja pierdol\u0119 '' , `` kurwa '' , `` jeba\u0107 '' , `` pizda '' , `` ni chuja '' in a exaggerated funny manner and then say `` no '' with a stone face . 
   where is lithuania ? 
  idk why would people get mad over this . 
  not everyone cares enough to remember every country/or where a country is in the world . 
  just show them grand duchy of lithuania or \u017de\u010dpospolita on a map , might intrigue them to read more about lithuania . 
   you 're basically russian it should be legal to stab someone who says that, 
  when will russia start to build one with lithuania ? 
  or do you mean one to the crimean peninsula ?

  you 're comparing 3 continents . 
  eurovision is an european song contest + australia and israel . 
   global world means that everyone has access to everything , not that everyone is culturally the same or similar . 
  that 's why everyone watches american tv shows/movies and music pop charts are dominated by artists singing in english . 
   eastern europe is however very similar culturally still . 
  sharing food does n't influence voting in eurovision . 
   russia got points from every nation in the televote , but among the juries they were given 0 points from 20 nations . 
  idk how this is relevant . 
  you said eastern europe votes for eastern european countries because they have similar music taste . 
  yet western europe voted for russia and eastern european countries voted for western countries ? 
  czech republic got no television votes from either . 
  countries just give points to their neighbours , no matter what song + people vote for their favorite song . 
  there is n't such thing as western/eastern/southern / northern european music taste in a global world . 
  latvia gave 12 points to sweden btw . 
  eurovision is a competition , not a concert . 
  we need a different event for everyone to sing in their language .

  and these two are divided into subdialects : samogitian is divided into west , north and south ; auk\u0161taitian into west ( suvalkie\u010diai ) , south ( dz\u016bkai ) and east . 
  each subdialect is divided into smaller units -- speeches . 
  standard lithuanian is derived mostly from western auk\u0161taitian dialects . 
  samogitian differs from standard lithuanian quite significantly , it could very well be considered a different language . 
  as someone who 's family is from auk\u0161taitija , i find samogitian dialect extremely interesting . 
  it even sounds completely different from standard lithuanian . 
  just a few lithuanian folks writing in english between each other for no reason .

  and yet some people in w. europe want to have normal relations with kremlin , awesome . 
  swedish made , city buses are sexiest ones . 
  i see , thanks for the info . 
  great excuse , not buying any of it . 
  are n't they ? 
  even though they settled on baltic lands of old prussia ? 
  prussia was most pro nazi region , failure of integrating balts and other easter lands pushed for military means . 
  teutonic order , german prussia , german empire , third reich all wanted to have control of the baltics . 
  usa will never pull out of nato , no one out side russia would want that . 
   funny how you so much time bashing americans yet demanding they die for your country . 
  keep it up please , it helps me to no end . 
  you know nothing as i can see , we 're probably most grateful people for usa helping us to defend our peace , do n't be jealous . 
   us out of all these treaties . 
  especially nato push your worthless agenda as much as you want nobody will think the same as your little head . 
  not directly , but they 're supporting with ammunition , military hardware etc separatists in e. ukraine . 
   creation of ukraine what accords ? 
  true , but even without usa they would n't need military , they 're surrounded by peaceful nations that are in both eu and nato out side switzerland , which is still connected one way or another with eu like schengen area . 
  he triggered it and is still putting fuel on that fire . 
   however this also shows they are easy can be taken advantage of easily . 
  only by their internal politicians , most notably merkel . 
  well they 're passive in a good way , unlike russians who do n't give a damn if they 're getting robbed by their own government . 
  trump is a clown , the other two are criminals . 
  so yeah . 
  when it counters your way of making invasions , sure you will hate it . 
  not really , serbia is leaning towards eu and nato , and i , one would welcome them with warm hands . 
  it 's russian backed separatists that destroyed everything that ukraine had , russia or more specifically putin and his kremlin lapdogs are the core of the problem . 
  ukrainians wanted a better life , expecting to make closer ties with eu as they clearly can see how much life is better in poland than it ever was in ukraine even though they started from same dot . 
  germany is still biggest economic powerhouse in europe , which could easily boost it 's military from laughable to threatening . 
  it 's that germans are and were always been actually smart people . 
  baltic germans were the reason of all military past . 
   answer from geography : the shorter the border and the harsher the climate around it , the easier it is to defend it .

  expansionism ... 
   messing with the balance of powers where they 're not welcome . 
  you do understand that russia is not welcome anywhere out side belarus ? 
  since end of world war 2 our partisans dreamed about americans and other western allies to come to our aid , not soviets , not russians , but western world . 
  nobody wants to see kremlin influence here no one , out side russians who live in russia , those who live in estonia and latvia know exactly how their lives are better compared to that in russia . 
   by the current regional power . 
  yeah right , a lot of nukes , no balls , doing hybrid warfare because of fear of total economic blockade . 
  your economy already going to sh * t because of oil prices . 
  russians are special kind of people ...

  look georgia , moldova and ukraine , not nato , we have the results .

  after the split from kievan rus ' ( most of it was obsorbed by grand duchy of lithuania ) , russian state was born as [ grand principality of moscow ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/grand_duchy_of_moscow ) who later become tsardom of russia and then russian empire . 
  turks were n't in the territory at that time when roman empire held modern turkish territories . 
  i actually never knew about it , til , thank you . 
  seems pretty similar to our wars of independence : fighting off bolsheviks ( reds ) , bermontians ( ex-imperial forces ) and poland for control of our land in all fronts .

  you would be amazed how little greeks and turks are different , well at least w. turkey . 
  i wonder if he counts modern period as lithuania being independent ? 
  since we only lost it in 1795 before that we were independent as grand duchy of lithuania and later polish-lithuanian commonwealth . 
  vytis still best flag . 
  some things need context . 
  actually they could have been more like norway , they could easily power up their economy since they have resources which japan can only dream off .

  thank god we are not united with poland any more !, 
  it 's quite sad when you see comments where russians praise ussr for some irrational reason . 
  back in 1991 between january 11 and 13 when what is known as `` january events '' took place in lithuania , when soviet used armed forces to crush peaceful lithuanian civilians , muscovites gone to streets , around 1 million of them were protesting soviet aggression towards baltic republics . 
  and now they - kremlin cry for us removing everything that resembles about soviet occupation ... 
  you get what you elect . 
  russian empire was also bad . 
  considering that most russians starting to not consider themselves as europeans but rather `` special people of east '' ... 
  mongols are your cousins now . 
  are n't protestants dirty heathens as they do not fallow pope ? 
   how are they supposed to poke fun at ` muricans if they are fat as well . 
  we shall start poking fun at russians for being bone thin . 
  i doubt kremlin would have spared money to pay for those now . 
  yeah , but allies would come eventually and that would be far better than soviets , considering that soviets killed more of lithuanian 's than nazis did . 
  have you covered laws that are made by eu and also [ european economic area ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_economic_area ) ? 
  just put them in themed park , that 's where we put , rarely anyone goes there , so it rots there for good . 
   and if soviet union would stop at the border , then germans would probably wipe out all poles as per plan ost no , americans and other western allies would have come instead of soviets , that 's even better a-history . 
  no ugly ass soviet monuments or oppression . 
  oh the dream .

  where are you pulling this shit from ?? 
  the comment section ? 
   practicing huge war games you also forgot to mention that these include simulated nuclear strikes on countries around baltics ( scandinavian countries and poland ), 
  lithuanians do n't actually talk shit about commonwealth , it 's an outdated notion coming from zeligowski 's mutiny when lithuanian nationalist 's in backlash of what happened actually were talking shit about commonwealth , so yeah this info is ~ 90 years old  i guess some of us are still butt hurt about zeligowski and pilsudski , tho generally in history classes it 's viewed as a mix of misguided attempt at some sort of resurrection of commonwealth and polish politicians just going along with whole vilnius thing out of convenience . 
  personally i hate current ignorance of quite a bit polish politicians ( people are a different case altogether ) regarding whole minority issues thing . 
  feels like they are either completely ignorant about issue or are intentionally trying to start shit up by supporting those `` characters '' . 
  an that 's exactly why you did n't take any stance on that analogy ...  to continue on that analogy , you 're that kid that then runs to his friends and asks them to hit him .

  there was also a tragic case of one of truck drivers [ killing himself in his truck while waiting for a ferry ] ( http://www.delfi.lt/news/daily/crime/milziniskoje-eileje-istriges-vilkiko-vairuotojas-pasirinko-mirti.d?id=70357964 ) . 
  situation on their end seem desperate , tho truckers seem to blame poland for whole situation . 
  watch out , next we 'll figure out they like to drink tea too !, 
  oh imagine how world will change !, 
  they are going via ferries from klaip\u0117da to denmark , tho [ lines there are huge ( source in lithuanian ) ] ( http://lietuvosdiena.lrytas.lt/aktualijos/rusijos-vezeju-paguoda-talpesnis-keltas-ir-troskinys.htm ) since denmark does not alter amount of ferries they send to klaip\u0117da to match this situation ( well they did start sending larger ferries now it seems ) . 
  i used to watch it several years ago , back then it was obvious biased but they tried to report some real thing and when spinning they would use somewhat reasonable ways of reporting , like when talking about `` fall of usa '' they would point out actual problems with lets say education and then wildly extrapolate from that , crazy but initial fact about education issues would would be mostly true . 
  with time it got worse and worse ( now that i think about it , it started with return of putin and aggregation of all russian media under single umbrella ) , less logic less actual fact , more doom-saying , more over the top patriotism , anti-western rhetoric was cranked to 11 . 
  i broke and stopped watching it altogether somewhere in the middle of peter lavelle 's crosstalk episode regarding whole ukraine shabang when he , being heavily biased towards russian position , had 2 guests with same outlook . 
  only one providing alternative view on the issue was some guy who cound n't let go of single unconfirmed rumour about the situation . 
  ca n't recall what it was but basically it 's was something compromising `` rebels '' and even west considered that to be a fake . 
  obviously he got destroyed by the other 3 while trying to defend that nonsense . 
  so yeah it was so cringey i just could n't keep watching rt afterwards . 
  edit : didnt read sputnik before but i poke around it once in a while when something big hits to see how they are spinning the story , rt site same thing , you could see russian politician position shift before they would happen , for example narrative about whole novorosyja thing suddenly morphing into proposal for federalisation of ukraine . 
  good job , [ it 's about time ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_j6-3l3hcm0 ) . 
  well russia did shut down oil pipeline druzba because lithuania did n't sell oil refinery to them ( to companies they control that is ) , they said it 's for `` repairs '' and yes it was never reopened . 
  already working on it . 
  we laid out a cable between sweden and lithuania , we told russians it 's power cable , but actually we 're planing on making a massive human chain disguising it as commemoration of baltic way and then pull on that cable thus pulling entire scandinavia closer . 
  it 's the perfect plan !,

   eastern europe has been wanting to provoke russia for a while now . 
  yeah , by selling them milk ... outrageous ... 
  so in this case kadyrov is alarak ? 
  you 're not incorrect , but that 's not how it 's viewed by quite large parts of russian population . 
  due to letting ussr disintegrate he as perceived as weak , and russians generally like/respect `` strong '' leaders . 
  also some blame him for starting what yeltsin is usually blamed for : corrupt privatisation and robbing russia . 
  indeed :d, 
  yeah , were still not too good with it . . no worries we 'll get better ^ or ^ so ^ i ^ hope, 
  [ calculations intensify ] ( https://media2.giphy.com/media/c7pckqloqz8ws/200_s.gif ), 
  i tried to make a long and winding post about how this looks like some totalitarian shit that ussr used to do during occupation of baltic states , but realised that i 'm writing very obvious things that sane people should understand without anyone spelling it out for them ... yet we have these news here ... what am i supposed to say in this case ? 
  are you fucking people batshit insane !, 
  while duty to the emperor is obviously the purest motivation a man can have , appealing to his ` baser ' motives , such as love of home and family , can yield surprising results . 
  working on a [ prototype ] ( http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-ymt7s39tyrg/usrd5-p2sqi/aaaaaaaadtu/yr34zycopi8/s400/img_3187.jpg ) already !, 
  yeah , also afaik poland turned down reactionaries who tried to flip vilnius to poland during independence movement . 
  damn braliukai , looks like you 're on a ball with this one . 
  i guess we need to shape up . 
  crimea wanting to secede is ukraine 's internal issue , `` international community '' should keep on the side as long as there 's no urgent need to do otherwise . 
  i imagine if siberia decided to go independent and `` international community '' started dictating rf what they can or ca n't do everyone in rf govt would go apeshit about `` international community '' butting in where it does not belong . 
  ukraine did n't really get to say anything about the issue since referendum was not agreed to with govt and immediately after it rf took unilateral action of annexing crimea . 
  so given the situation ukraine did n't even have time to `` not give two shits '' , because one part of `` international community '' decided they know better what to do . 
  people have that right , governments , however , do not get to unilaterally decide what still belongs to other nations and what does not . 
  ignoring question about legitimacy of referendum we can say that crimeans have a right to self determination and can make a vote on joining rf . 
  russian federation however has to respect sovereignty of ukraine and ca n't unilaterally accept crimea into russian federation without getting ok from ukraine . 
  so no right to self-determination does not play a role here , rf can not unilaterally tear off a part of other nation * even * if population agrees to it . 
  yes yes i 'm well aware that rf tends to wipe its arse with things like sovereignty or recognition of national borders , trust me i am well aware of it . 
  you can stop making excuses now . 
  i know rf is not interested in what their neighbours think about their imperial ambition fuelled land grabs . 
  yes , sure , i heard , it 's actually spiritual capital of russia , very convincing . 
  crimea ( obviously ) , for example . 
  yes i know . 
  that was the point . 
  instead he is `` repatriating '' russians together with land of other nations . 
  well if he is worried about those 25 mil people he can always arrange generous repatriation program and those people who really want to be part of the russia will most definitely return . 
  tho he seems to have a different idea on how to go about this ... 
  yeah , lithuania would probally work better [ the invisible front ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2073679/plotsummary?ref_=tt_ov_pl ) for this, 
  maybe it 's because slavic and baltic languages have very similar grammar . 
  tho i 'm not sure if just that can make it `` sound slavic '' . 
  yes but it makes it harder for nato to make a move or , if you want to rephrase : it gives some western powers an excuse not to scramble to situation , hence making use of proposed measured much harder . 
  overall high speed , high precision strike force is great idea , tho even low yield bombs will give a green light to less rational people in power to try something ( tho ultimately i doubt any of the generals in charge of rf nuclear arsenal is insane enough to push the button on behest of such actors ) . 
  tho public opinion outcry in the west might be too much to dead with for western politicians , use of any type of nukes is very hard to justify , people are still bashing us over japan . 
  another big issue is hybrid war since that ca n't be solved with a precision strike . 
  [ this basically ] ( https://media0.giphy.com/media/ifxlk48cnyddi/200_s.gif ) . 
  got ta appeal to the crowd in some way i guess ... edit : i much more prefer simple and clear gestures like three crosses and tricolor today . 
  you do n't need to be trendy , just be clear and straightforward . 
  oh no ^ pls ^ do n't :d, 
  as far as churchill himself , yes there 's plenty of bad , worse and horrible . 
  given something to deal with he would indeed opt for some of most ruthless solutions . 
  but scale and amount of premeditation of these acts are not really comparable . 
  i do n't think comparing stalin with churchill is in any way fair . 
  i get your point on shit he 's done , but his record is far more mixed : where churchill would on the spot go for really poor choice , stalin would plan out these things on mass scale ensuring whatever he plans hits as much people as possible with as little way of escape as possible . 
  like with starvation of kazakhs : take animals for collective farms , delay all implementation of those farms delaying leaders and such , offer no help with that , move all grain reserves from the area and there , 10 mil + kazakhs are starving all the while soviet union is selling bread en masse for cheap to europe . 
  and yeah churchill did make excuses for gulag camps in africa and he did brag about `` shooting 3 primitives by himself '' and he also refused to send food supplies to starving regions in india . 
  how does that compare to personally ordering construction of entire gulag network and organising mass deportations , being personally responsible for 34-49 mil deaths and intentionally creating famines in ukraine , chechnya , kazakhstan and several other places ? 
  tldr ; churchill has done fucked up shit but comparing him to stalin i think is a bit too far , scale and ambition of their actions are on completely different levels , churchill was trying to carve out `` sanctuaries '' for white people in africa and india with slaughter and gulags , brutally quelling uprisings and such , stalin was trying to eradicate entire ethnicities on top of pretty much entire list of same shit churchill was doing . 
   we 're specifically talking about leaders who are rated favorably no were not .

  also :  nothing new really , afaik russian people are quite consistent on who the best leaders they ever had are , no surprises here you quote mined me here , that 's not what i said , you took it out of context by posting only a part of my sentence , the full sentence was :  nothing new really , afaik russian people are quite consistent on who the best leaders they ever had are , no surprises here ** - the tougher and more bloodthirsty leader is - the higher they rate him . 
  ** you even quoted this full sentence when responding to me originally . 
   stalin gaining popularity in putin 's russia that 's the context my post was made in . 
  you do know how context works right ? 
   you could replace `` russia '' with pretty much any western nation ok , i put germany in here with hitler , same time frame - check , western europe - check , hitler was leader of germany at the same time stalin was leader of ussr - check , you following me up till now ? 
   stalin gaining popularity in putin 's russia so stalin is gaining popularity now in russia , you with me ? 
  now ... is hitler gaining popularity in germany now ? 
   so neither of them apply to your own post or my reply . 
  why refer to an argument i did n't make ? 
  as show above , they do - you 're flat out lying here , i took same time frame on when leaders were active , i took western nation and i compared adoration of said leader in said county now same as is the case in op 's topic . 
   there 's not much difference between the atrocities committed stalin and churchill .

   you 're a fascist because you believe it 's more important to enforce your ideals on people than it is to promote the foundation of a modern democracy . 
  did i say , * implement order european federation , today disregard the riots or opinions of people * , no . 
  i 'm not against democracy and i 'm more supporter of multi-speed europe , since countries like uk hold integration back . 
  if you do n't want to be part of ef , then you 're free to live as irrelevant country , it 's your choice , not mine . 
  just because you look at ef as something `` evil '' , does n't mean everyone looks at it that way . 
   the eu and the in were founded on he right to self determination , the fact that you 're too ignorant to know this simple fact goes to show you ca n't see the bigger picture because you do n't even know what it is .

  eu is probably the best thing that happened on this continent and you want it to be disbanded ... you 're crazy , that 's all i got to say .

  those are estonian russians that go to russia . 
   english really seems to influence us more than other , for some reason . 
  i have no strong idea why . 
  here is your [ answer ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr8ljrgcjnm ) . 
   we have nothing in common with people who would ally with america , the eternal enemy of rus . 
  til usa was a thing back in medieval ages . 
  you mean , it 's lithuanian puppet state , under disguise of being russian ally . 
  technically speaking , yes , being part of g.d. of lithuania was far better than being part of g.p. 
  of muscovy . 
   conquer local tribes and lay them under the tribute . 
  they literally assimilated to local culture , just like normans ( vikings ) assimilated to french culture . 
  i guess belarus is not independent rus ' state .

  1 . well british is no longer majority in london , so london does not belong for britain anymore ? 
  2 . these polish and jews with which country they identified themselves more before poland 's invasion and regions ** polanization ** : poland or lithuania ? 
  according to your logic : whole poland for couple years belonged to germany and you did n't give it back after you decided not to have puppet communist government anymore, 
  i agree that she can write her name how ever she wants but still she should stick to lithuanian alphabet, 
  that guy is smoking some real shit, 
  i believe boilerbuttslutt was being sarcastic, 
  sure , why not if turks want that . 
  but they should want not only because of economic reasons . 
  both of them were from polanized noble lithuanian families . 
  nobles were speaking polish but identified themselves with lithuania . 
  many judge nationality according to mother language but it can be misleading . 
  also , it is interesting that some of them identified themselves as `` polish '' among other lithuanians but `` lithuanians '' for all others . 
  i think it worked with armenia only because armenia has issues with nagorno-karabakh . 
  armenia just does n't have other options . 
  master ? 
  i would call it amateur, 
  as further as more i think russians are not strategically using bat and carrot policy but they are just stupid . 
  they just mess up their relationships with more and more countries . 
  they kind of push `` their buffer zone '' countries into `` westerners '' hands , instead of achieving cooperation with them . 
  or if i 'm wrong could someone explain me this , please . 
  i think it is a bit more different , unfortunately i had to use google translate :(, 
  upvote just because you finished the sentence not with potatoes, 
  bulgarian guy bellow mentions that the monument specifically states that it is for `` liberating soviet army '' , not for `` dead soldiers '' how sometimes happens . 
  so at this particular case , would you agree that `` red army '' is an institution of the oppressing state and you can not demand respect ?

  mexicans vs polish - that 's awesome , it is like staged . 
  america 's bad ass vs europe 's . 
  this is like boxing vs karate in 1960 's, 
   these soldiers have nothing to do with what the soviet union did after the war though fyi many things were done during the war and red army was involved , e.g. 
  [ katyn massacre ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/katyn_massacre ) , [ sending people from occupied territories to gulags ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gulag#during_world_war_ii ) edit : [ nkvd prisoner massacres ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nkvd_massacres_of_prisoners ), 
  well , if you ask old people , e.g. 
  in baltics , many of them would say that germans were better than russians . 
  so i understand the comparison between the two countries . 
  at the same time , i think that dead solder does not have a nationality and should be treated with respect . 
  but also , it is not clear whether it is a monument for victory or dead soldiers ( there is a difference and the later belongs in a cemetery ), 
  as a slow lithuanian ... hmmm ... maybe i should move to estonia, 
  i do n't know any estonian personally , but on a country level , they are doing everything faster than the other two baltic countries . 
  so probably no . 
  wwii estonia is occupied by soviets . 
  germans fight soviets out and occupy estonia . 
  soviets fight germans out and take back estonia . 
  estonian government announces warning about possible movement near the boarder . 
  we make jokes about estonians being slow , reacting slow or that time is kind of stopped in estonia . 
  so : a croupier in an estonian casino near a roulette : dear ladies and gentlemen , please place your bets for the tomorrow . 
  nobody jokes in soviet russia, 
  if they have lived there half a century and could n't learn it , then yeah , fuck them ( there can be a few exceptions of course ) . 
  they do n't pass the test because they do n't know the language . 
  they do n't know it because either they do n't want to learn it or they try to learn but are too stupid . 
  edit : they are disrespectful because they do n't want to learn the language . 
  if they try , than excuse me for thinking bad about mentally challenged people, 
  well , you probably have heard that there are quite a few russians without citizenship in latvia and estonia . 
  so they do n't have citizenship because they have to pass language and history test ( which maybe not nice from latvia 's and estonia 's side , but understandable ) . 
  it is easily googlable . 
  other example , could be riots in estonia when estonians moved bronze soldier to the cemetery, 
  example : if someone lives all their lives in a country and ca n't learn their language , so they are either stupid or disrespectful . 
  i agree when you ca n't get experts and bring them , but it was not intention of ussr . 
  they were trying to bring plenty unskilled labor , even potato growers , just to construct some soviet loyal population . 
  luckily due to resistance , our country did n't look very attractive for some russians . 
  what about latvia and estonia , it is strange that you 're not familiar , as you look informed quite well . 
  as russians feel that they are sizable minorities and think that because of this they can disrespect country were they live , its history and language, 
  well , it could be that you do not want , but you should understand the distrust on russians too . 
  also , the aggressive tone of some russians does n't help with it ( i 'm speaking from lithuanian point of view ), 
  the problem is that your current leader looks very sympathetic to this non-existing country and that some of his actions may give an idea for your neighbors that he wants that country back . 
  many big industrial projects were also combined with ideas to bring russian `` settlers '' . 
  they were not forced , but definitely encouraged . 
  there were no bigger conflicts , because russians constitute small part of lithuania 's population , so they are not in the position to do something . 
  on the other hand , look at latvia or estonia . 
  also , of course there are disadvantages about joining eu ( as everywhere ) , but advantages are much bigger and i 'm very happy that lithuania is in eu . 
  finally , i have nothing against russians , mostly they are nice people ( if you do not talk bout politics ) , but i hate the `` imperialistic '' tone of russia . 
  to sum up : population x culture of alcohol consumption edit : and money, 
  more probably like ussr policy was like this : `` i do n't care about your nationality as long as you are a russian '' edit : there was a huge discrimination according to nationalities , i think firstly because russians did n't trust other ( not that they were not right here ) and huge russification in all levels , education , media , working language , settling people from russia in areas were other nationalities lives, 
  i was referring to lithuanian polish . 
  but outside of lithuania everyone who caries lithuanian passport is lithuanian . 
  and you are right it is not common that media would mention ethnicity . 
  well , i do not consider that we have a lot of them . 
  there almost never were any problems here as in latvia or estonia, 
  i had the same idea , but why poland is n't somewhere near top then ? 
  you are not right . 
  we do have some russians , but much less than in latvia or estonia . 
  i never heard much in media about polish criminals . 
  however lithuanian poles and russian are kind of mixed between them in term of mentality and often poles use russian language , thus it is sometimes hard to distinguish between the two . 
  these bad excommie habits to throw people into jail ... 
  well , russians as always prove that they can be reliable partners . 
  gas pipeline `` maintenance works '' should follow . 
  there is a huge potential for growth in my country i see . 
  hehehe, 
  well reasoned points , thank you . 
  i agree with the argument that it is kind of a recognition of increasing lithuanian market size . 
  i even agree that to some extent ( very tiny ) it will make us more `` europeans '' , while better word probably would be globalized . 
  but i think it is exaggerated ( credits for pr campaign ) and thus why i 'm a bit annoyed , even if it is in my country . 
  i 'm not even talking about some poor guy from portugal or girl from croatia , 
  you got me wrong . 
  i was talking about consequences of the shop . 
  it will hurt manufacturers who target lithuanian market , i do not argue were in general lithuanians sell more .

  you would probably have to sue the church or something . 
  not true , you only get on the list after you are christened . 
  no , the problem is clashing cultures , not nationalism . 
  in lithuania we have polish and russian and ukrainian and belarussian minorities , which you ca n't tell that exist because their culture is very similar to ours and no one gives a crap about each other . 
  muslim culture is medieval and scary to most people , when they come and start to settle down into neighborhoods taking them over people start freaking out .

  i think she got quite unlucky waldemar tomaszewski started his campaign against lithuania during her career so our relationship with poland took a slight hit , not her fault though . 
  also there is n't a better candidate so i would say she is a successful president , no wonder she got reelected . 
  but we do n't really pay attention to halloween and do n't have thanksgiving so it makes sense that we jump right to pagan holiday numba one .

  it does matter when the numbers are speaking for themselves , i rather not see russian aligned estonia and latvia , like ukraine was and belarus still is . 
  awesome response . 
  i 'm hostile to russia because some `` estonian '' dude says so . 
  you know one thing ? 
  he can obtain citizenship . 
  all he has to do is learn latvian or estonian language on basic level , that 's about it . 
  twenty seven years have passed , more than enough time i 'd say to learn official language on basic level , would n't you agree ? 
  because we did n't have large minority that could influence our future politics . 
  german guy and austrian girl look so hot . 
   would take both . 
  france is austria in mid party . 
  of course not , that 's why russians that were brought to baltics are illegal migrants . 
  so presidents opinion is also my opinion , please ... 
  yeah ? 
  poland and lithuania were at war during interwar , did it stop us from joining nato and eu ? 
  poland was actually pushing for nato and eu , also promoting lithuanians accession to it , because both of our countries left the past behind . 
  woosh ... 
  nato is not some kind of cool kids club , it 's a body that ensure peace in the region , which serbs sure like to violate . 
  do you consider nazi and soviet split of second polish republic legal ? 
  that 's before existence of international law ( league of nations/united nations ) . 
  he 's tagged as [ pro-commie ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6a3ot8/happy_victory_day_on_this_day_72_years_ago_soviet/dhbivlr/ ) , from the comment that is now deleted . 
   then perhaps actual locals should n't remain a part of nato yes , they 're free to flee back to russia . 
   hide behind its protection while denying human rights to a minority nobody denies their accession to citizenship , they themselves intentionally refuse to learn latvian and estonian language to obtain citizenship . 
   contributing little to the alliance nato is not a cool kids club . 
   to call someone illegal immigrant who lived there much of his life and moved there legally at the time , is strange . 
  nobody stops them from becoming legal citizens , you know ? 
  quit dodging the question . 
   unfriendly ; antagonistic . 
  how exactly are we unfriendly with russia ? 
  you still have n't provided facts for your `` hostile '' claim . 
  when why are you surprised when we show different opinion , that align with our government and country . 
  if they 're `` oppressed '' is n't it polish governments job to take them back to poland and give them `` all the rights they deserve '' ? 
  still at least 20x better than communism . 
  i 'm not done discussing the topic , you say that we 're `` hostile '' towards russia , how exactly are we hostile towards it ? 
   all of those countries are indeed hostile towards russia to some degree . 
  not always , only after russia occupied them . 
   especially polish ( but may i ask you to provide me some examples of me being ultra nationalist , as you asked me ? ) . 
  making polish language as regional language in latvia , even though they 're insanely small minority . 
   i care about huge population of stateless people in one of the eu states , that happens to be latvia and estonia . 
  you do realize they 're stateless because they ** choose ** to be like that . 
   saying that someone is doing in my opinion that 's opinion , you can express it , but do n't expect people to agree with you . 
   saying that someone is doing something wrong . 
  which is about these minorities that choose not to obtain citizenship , but rather live with alien passport . 
  so we 're unfriendly because exactly why ? 
  every single state in europe slaughtered each other , maybe it 's time to leave the past and think rationally ? 
  you know . 
  neutral argument ? 
  you 're clearly attacking latvian state , for not lowering their heads to illegal minorities , which can but choose not to obtain citizenship . 
  and since you 're well known polish ultra nationalist it is not surprise why i said , found your agenda , since it included polish minority in latvia , you did n't really care about russians . 
  welcome to the club , buddy !, 
  you 're exaggerating . 
  the only mad dog is you . 
  pretty sure those poles were n't lazy to obtain citizenship , given that ~ 90 % of them have mixed ethnicity . 
  one day , my friend , one day . 
   making sure that minorities do not integrate within latvian state . 
  you did n't provide any examples on how i have anti-polish sentiment . 
  religion is a joke . 
   crusading just is n't as fun without your friends , though . 
  such friend that started to raid and rip your lands apart . 
   similarly to how we 're going to get back wilno when russia is invading you . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/giedroyc_doctrine ) besides , if we fall , you fall too , remember that . 
   because you are a rellay bad interlocutor , you do n't use any arguments , you are just throwing accusations clearly you 're talking about yourself . 
   also your anti-polish sentiment is unbearable examples ? 
  you 're actually the one that shows anti-latvian sentiment , making sure that minorities do not integrate within latvian state . 
   stateless person in any eu country , because this status automatically implied that you are stripped of basic human and political rights the only right they do n't have is that of voting . 
  they simply can fix it by acquiring citizenship , they 're are free to do it , but they do n't , you know why ? 
  because they refuse to learn official language on basic level . 
  these people are the ones that prevent themselves from acquiring citizenship , not state . 
  i 'm asking your own definition of being hostile , not it actually means . 
  since when protecting yourself from possible russian invasion is hostility ? 
  should n't it suppose to reverse , us preparing to invade russia to count as hostility . 
  hostile towards their ability to invade ? 
  because [ polish minority 's leader ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/valdemar_toma\u0161evski ) is kremlin 's useful idiot . 
  what is your definition of being hostile ? 
  you really think lithuania wants russia to crumble ? 
  battle of saule is as much known battle as battle of grunwald . 
  i mean , you had to call for crusades because pagan prussians were kicking your ass . 
  nothing to back up ? 
  pretty weak , friend . 
  you clearly do n't know what fascism is . 
  those stateless people choose to be stateless . 
  nobody is preventing them from obtaining citizenship , with simple requirement - learning official language of country on basic level . 
  because they do n't want to learn it . 
  i fully understand that . 
  polish version of kremlin 's tactics , making sure minority is least integrated as possible . 
  even then , most poles in latvia are fully mixed with balts . 
   this silent , crawling ** fascism in baltic states ** baffles mmm ? 
  what is this then, 
  the only reason we have n't done what estonia and latvia done is because we did n't had huge russian minority , if kaliningrad oblast was connected to lssr , we for sure would have done same what estonia and latvia did , it would have slowed down our process to european union and nato , which post-commie polish government sought to speed it up as fast as possible . 
  pretty much a miracle that we ended up with low russian minority . 
  * unlimited `` wrinkles '' power .

  you have no idea what si units are . . 
  so double the fun , you destroy those pesky bugs in rainforests and get to eat nutella !, 
  because high progressive income taxes is not something what people need to worry in entrepreneurship . 
  mate , its just because they are part of ldk . 
  what ? 
  your argument had nothing to do with discussion . . 
  usually the researches measure atheism by beliefs not by what group you assign yourself to . 
  usually you rank lower in atheism rankings than romania . 
  well at least we manage to swallow them . 
  what do you mean , you are definitely a religious country compared to others . 
  sorry , sold my arms to get rich . 
  eu can into baltics !, 
  i thought we had more trees : /, 
  sorry , your salary is not enough to cover how much we lithuanians drink . 
  damn latvians are the rich braliukas it seems . 
  barely earning is a bit more useful than not earning if you are registered as unemployed, 
  photographer was holding his pint while taking this . 
  are you talking about our national stadium ? 
  i think with that funding it will be a mountain eventually . 
  25 % still would not be enough , and it is like always , alcohol consumption follows log scale . 
  it is a serious problem out here . 
  nah i am just talking from pure statistical point of view . 
  and then we celebrate the truce with a drink !, 
  because majority of gun deaths happen because people have guns . 
  you ca n't outrun a bullet . 
  yea but we are # 1 at drinking so our people are too drunk to run . 
  we would also need more than 0 mountains we have . 
  for whatever reason i have not noticed it in vokie\u010di\u0173 street , i guess i was not really looking for it . 
  now i wonder , i have n't seen one but we must have one . 
  but people on / r/worldnews told us we were baddies !, 
  we have a lot of stray cats though !, 
  in other countries it would be with sssr symbolism , in some way i understand that it would have negative effect on some people having all the horrors reminded , but it is still very silly . 
  kinda , for a lot of people it is easier to go abroad than take the minimum wage here . 
  for those who get average/above average it 's kinda decent but still not that great since we import most of the things . 
  seems about right . 
  half of people who can speak english moves away . 
  weird that there is no data for us . 
  and how would that help ? 
  the us company has majority of gmo patents under us law , you ca n't really make eu law which would ignore it . 
  there is no other solution except banning it to maintain the control over the supply . 
  now lets say we abolish the patents under eu laws , then the major companies which are already established will eat up the production/supply and get the control over price/quantity making others incapable of competing , this would be solved by giving the governmental organizations control over the production to drive price to marginal costs , which again has a lot of issues . 
  situation is not so simple . 
  the patent system is nowhere near being perfect , but it is also one of the devices to put some control over oligopolic market . 
  maybe eu just does n't want to rely on us patents on seeds . 
  maybe after we establish our own pool this will be laxed . 
  70 % of revenue goes to me . 
  playing cs : go drunk helps you to channel your inner russian, 
  but that 's when they start playing stuff like jazz !, 
  you would run out of alcohol though . 
  oh you just added another reason to why not to let that many of them in . 
  if only they would allow us to see the catalog before we subscribe ( sure there is trial , but after that we are blind ) . 
  it is kinda weird for them to hide , and we all know that most of the good stuff is outside of our reach . 
  well kinda close , but i think it would be better to look at something adjusted by something like ppp ? 
  gdp is not that great for comparison of pensions . 
  well that is just to blend in better . 
  and the attractive women is to hide our true intention , we are honey potting you . 
  you better not mess with us lithuanians , or else we will call our ~ ~ invaders ~ ~ emigrants back and you will have no workforce !, 
  one way or another , we will come to steal your jabs . 
  original link opened ok , but this one has the korean guys , wth ? 
  ah but we do n't pay massive pensions . 
  so maybe not as happy as in greece ? 
  i am sure that it is hard to comprehend , but when we usually have snow for 2-3 or more months every year ( though we might get less this time ) , we are prepared for it . . 
  we reached the new heights , getting ready for the jump . 
  okey , how is what they do even legal . 
  how are they still governing . 
  are there no safety mechanisms to avoid people abusing their power ? 
  we search for bmw because every week we have news about a bmw crashing into a bus stop . 
  it is an epidemic . 
  pft mate , i live in that city , so as everyone who lives somewhere they do n't go to see the local attractions , because they can go and see them anytime ( well ok , this time it will not be anytime ) . 
  since pis started stirring up chaos . 
  what the hell is going on with these comments . . 
  you can actually go inside it . 
  i think poland is just pranking us . 
  i do n't know man , i do n't see any pollution , in fact in ca n't see anything !, 
  what a fucking dumb logic is that ? 
  there is international law and other things preventing that . 
  if some random guy had a gun and will take your car it will be illegal , same analogy here . 
  it would be done in way more complex way , with all the compensations and asset transfers taken into account , too many people think that any western region would be able to just separate without doing this . 
  but it was ukrainian land and ukraine invested money into it and all those assets are still on crimeria instead of being returned to ukraine or being compensated for . 
  if people want to be part of russia they have the right , but what right do they have to rip part of old country away ? 
  well it would be weirder if we got snow and our northern brothers did not . 
  i would love to try this but i am too lazy , someone should make a game where you have to tell what country is shown on a globe ( bonus points for capital ) . 
  i kinda would not mind that here in lithuania , too much hassle to get clothes for different seasons . 
  that 's what happens when you use company to push geopolitical agendas and abuse monopolistic market . 
  i guess , they did nazi that coming ? 
  especially since pis got elected ( god what a perfect name for that madhouse ) . 
  i guess every time we fart we will have to pay you . 
  what 's the difference ? 
  both made in china . 
  will get stolen pretty fast . 
  it would be ok if it was just an accident , but it is more likely to be just another russian attempt to push their agenda and be an annoying prick at nato/eu side . 
  it is 2am , how can i got to sleep while rofl . 
  meh , from time to time you meet couple of them . 
  damn , you pretty much described sweden . 
  are swedes the true opposite of italians ? 
  i do econometrics so it is basically the same just a lot more fire and reversed crosses , and weird symbols . 
  i bet it was also full moon and the sun was going over libra . 
  shhh , that is a secret , we are totally not in control of the galaxy . 
  yes but it is irrelevant since for russia he does not have that symbolic value . 
  because sheen is most recent example .

no , i am sorry , i misunderstood you because my brain is tired . 
  you wrote it correctly the first time . 
   which would require at least 7 in the coalition parties . 
  7 coalition parties ? 
  how many parties do you have there ? 
  is everyone in iceland a member of one or another party ? 
  well , / u/ghost _ goggles was talking about killing cossacks and priests , referring to the october revolution , and then you brought up russian peasantry rising against the crown , even though that 's a different revolution - namely the february one . 
  so i thought i would just remind everyone about the fact that those two revolutions were , in fact , two revolutions , not one long revolution . 
  but ... do n't they want to win the next election ? 
  fun fact : october and february revolutions are two different revolutions . 
  all that is true , i was just wondering about the original surname his grandparents had before the war . 
  and also felt that maybe mpvprb would like to know it , because quite a few descendants of the lithuanian refugees wish to know more about their lithuanian heritage . 
  my point was not to offend . 
  could it have been mykolaitis ? 
  pronounced ` meek-o-lite-is ' ( pronounce each bit as an english word with a stress on ` lite ' ) . 
  sorry , but that surname you wrote does not sound like a lithuanian one ... 
  it 's fun to agree on reddit :d oh , you deleted it :(, 
  and how about this : http://www.druskininkai.lt/drusk/m/m_images/wfiles/i2s6p96304.jpg ? 
  and they did n't so now we have these camps for them where we take away their valuables . 
    incredibly unjust . 
   but is n't it the same rule that applies to danish citizens themselves ? 
  how is it unjust . 
    incredibly unjust . 
  my only argument is that the refugees will need to start their lives in a new country from scratch , whereas danes probably ( ! ), 
  have a network of family and friends they could rely on . 
  i also do n't think the refugees have a lot of jewels with them . 
  well , only the fanciest houses in sssr were brutalist . 
  the block houses , however , were just ugly and not quite finished . 
  i 'm starting to think you are a troll . 
  yes , brazauskas did apologize , and yet our genocide museum is about genocide against lithuanians for some reason ( oh , and i ca n't legally even say that lithuanians did not experience genocide as they were murdered and banished to die for social , not ethnic reasons ) and none of the criminals were ever punished , even though they were still alive and un handed over a nice crisp case to lithuania . 
  also , do n't put words in my mouth . 
  i am not saying any of those things about other countries . 
  um , are you getting at that we , individual living lithuanians , should not beat ourselves with a leash in order to atone for our sins ? 
  because if so , that is not what i am saying either . 
  also , you are right that not all germans were nazis and i think that nowadays germans should not feel guilty about what some of their ancestors did ( voluntarily or forced ) . 
  however , it does n't mean that hitler 's germany was not responsible for the holocaust . 
  and germany really recognized that and apologized , and tried to cultivate a culture that would ensure that this does not happen again . 
  on the other hand , until very recently lithuania was just saying what you are saying about poor farmers and few degenerates , except that lithuania did it as a state to the faces of survivors and israeli officials . 
  ok , so poland also had similar problems and outcomes and they also should have handled it better . 
  still , i am not a pole , i am a lithuanian and imo that was the worst thing lithuania did . 
  i 'm not saying that every single lithuanian killed the jews or actively participated in that . 
  i am saying , however , that the majority of the population , except the several hundred who actively tried to save jews , turned a blind eye to the genocide even if only a few thousand degenerates were actively involved . 
  i am also saying that this is the worst thing lithuania is responsible for . 
  90 \u2105 jews were killed . 
  that is the largest percentage of all occupied countries . 
  you ca n't kill that many people without support from the society . 
  genocide of the jews during nazi occupation . 
  after the war only 10 % of lithuanian jews population were left ... :\\, 
  abba is awesome !, 
  good to hear it worked out , 
  i remember olekas saying that there will be a committee for such cases and they , upon receiving your application , may cancel your conscription . 
  have you gone that route and if so , how did it go ? 
  cepelinai and fast internet ftw !, 
  my personal lithuanian opinion : every eu citizen has a right to choose where to live and work . 
  i feel sad not because they are leaving ( i am happy if they are ) , but because of the reasons they left . 
  those reasons are not only economical but for some people it may also be homophobia , corruption ( it 's frustrating even if it is sort of getting better ) , worse universities , government ineffectiveness and general feeling of injustice . 
  are russian speakers of latvia separatist now ? 
  edit : and there are no separatists in northern ireland now ? 
  that 's how i understand it . 
  from [ wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/independence_of_moldova ) :  on june 23 , 1990 , the parliament adopted the declaration of sovereignty of the soviet socialist republic moldova , which , among other things , stipulated the supremacy of moldovan laws over those of the soviet union . 
  after the failure of the 1991 soviet coup d'\u00e9tat attempt , on august 27 , 1991 , moldova declared its independence . 
  anyway , it was great that moldova supported our independence too , 
  they eat rotten ( `` fermented '' ) shark meat sometimes , their nature is beautiful , game of thrones wall scenes are filmed there , people use very bright colours to dye their houses , they went bankrupt in 2009 ( but not really , they just told everyone they were bankrupt , but they continued to live well , kindda ) , they teach danish at schools as a second foreign language , because ( despite ? ), 
  they used to be a part of denmark until mid xx century , they have a real glacier , bjork is from iceland . 
  yay !, 
  so terrorism is the new satanism ? 
  you know , goth teenagers sitting in a cemetery around some candles placed to form a pentagram , chanting nonsense . 
  usually it 's all in good fun , nobody really believes in satan , but then sometimes , very , extremely , rarely , they actually do a `` sacrifice '' or just murder to prove how evil they are and the society is then all horrified and saying `` i can not believe it happened ! '' . 
  not trying to say that terrorism is as funny as satanism , just that she might have had a similar thought process as such teenagers . 
   but the whole waifuculture is more a kind of joke speak for yourself . 
  i personally consider [ daryun ] ( http://static.zerochan.net/daryun.%28arslan.senki%29.full.1996278.jpg ) from arslan senki my husbando . 
  the map is definitely a joke . 
  pray , what is this ` comfort zone ' thou speakest of ? 
  and how may i enter it ? 
  lithuanian kids are notorious for disregarding their parents . 
  maybe we just do n't want our children to have relationships in general :d, 
  dragon eggs !, 
  i hope the food inspection does not decide to incinerate them . 
  thanks for releasing me from my conspiracy prison :d, 
  so , why is there so much attention to eggs ? 
  is this a lobby campaign for free-range chickens ? 
  i do n't like having conspiracy theories : /, 
  nah , partial membership would be convenient to use as a `` see , westerners just think they 're better than us . '', 
  by russia-supported politicians . 
  what 's up with all these eggs ? 
  in the national media i 've seen 3 articles about eggs in the past two days . 
  then i go to reddit - and apparently whole europe is talking about it . 
  seems like a campaign of some sort . 
  just so . 
  so that 's pretty much all deposits then . 
  what is the point of this ? 
  if a bank falls and you do n't withdraw before that , your account with all that 100k gets frozen and you ca n't access it . 
  sure , the state later returns the money to you , but your suppliers may not wait , especially if you 're already late . 
  especially if the suppliers were also customers of the same bank and now need cash for their own needs . 
  yeah , but if i have a small business and i need to pay my suppliers - other small businesses - then i ca n't wait 3 months for the insurance to be paid out . 
  this is bullshit . 
  a bank - snoras - collapsed in lithuania during the crisis and even with the insurance quite a few small businesses went bankrupt , because they rarely have a surplus of money necessary to wait for the insurance system to work . 
  i mean , if that 's the case , i would rather keep my money in a mattress . 
  it 's my money , after all . 
  but you have arjen lucassen , who invites all those metal musicians for his albums !,

  bears , moose and boars can attack humans . 
  moose , boars . 
  because they are big and they can attack you and if you hit one with a car you get rekt . 
  also ticks . 
  china stronk, 
  well it 's just a russian teacher . 
  teachers do n't get paid much , so basically if you speak russian somewhat you can be a teacher . 
  i had a retarded russian teacher too , that 's why i ca n't speak any russian . 
   [ the winter is coming ] ( http://www.adweek.com/prnewser/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2015/04/sean-bean.jpg ), 
   anarcho-communism is a thing . 
  is it ? 
  or is it just a dream someone had ? 
  i am talking about what actually has happened or still is happening . 
  if we talk about dreams then maybe i could have united earth like in star trek ? 
  sorry , but it reminds me of old russian cartoons . 
  move to lithuania and live for years to become a citizen * . 
  but yes amazing plan . 
  ( it 's easier to just change the name ), 
  well it is . 
  we spell names in lithuanian every day and we add the endings every day . 
  even for russian , english , chinese , arabic , basically any name , polish names are not an exception . 
  it 's a tradition that causes no actual problems to anyone . 
  you can make arguments all day how polish people are oppressed by lithuanians not spelling their names `` right '' , it 's still a lithuanian passport . 
  like i said , ** i hope we get to the point where we have both original and lithuanian spelling on passports ** , however now it 's not likely to happen for a while because of the conflict , lithuanians feel opposed and i doubt they would agree to that . 
   because lithuanians are apparently unable to recognize foreign names as foreign . 
  of course we recognize foreign names as foreign , however sometimes spelling names with unknown spelling rules can sound incredibly bad , hearing english people read lithuanian names is cringe every time . 
   you guys just really seem to be stuck two centuries ago on this particular issue , that 's all . 
  this particular issue does n't cause any problems in reality though . 
  people with foreign names are allowed to write their foreign names no one cares . 
  the only time this issue is an issue is in legal documents . 
  and like i said , if you want to become a lithuanian citizen you should n't have a problem people spelling your name in lithuanian since you will hear it every day spelled like that . 
  you do n't get it do you . 
  no goverment will ever give up control fully , there is a reason dictators still exist . 
  communism never existed and it 's not likely it ever can . 
   for me , the whole concept just seems so exotic , alien and out of place in a supposedly modern , normal european country . 
  sick insults we actually have rules for spelling names , you know why ? 
  because perfectly normal names like jon carter would be read in lithuanian and sound like yon tsarter . 
  so we make it lithuanian and it becomes d\u017eonas karteris and then atleast the pronounciation is similar , adding endings is an oldie and it 's considered tradition aswell . 
  also just so you know there were proposals to get rid of this name translation , but it stuck because lithuanian is considered an old language with it 's own quirks and people want it to stay old . 
  uhm , okay . 
  except it never happened that way and it does n't look like that will ever happen . 
  the fact that poland allows it has nothing to do with what lithuanian passport allows . 
  we preserve our alphabet and spelling by having names actually spelled in lithuanian in lithuanian passport . 
  i would agree that we could have main name in lithuanian and a remark somewhere with the * actual * name , but that is n't what polish minority demanded . 
  the only thing we are not doing is having polish names in a lithuanian passport . 
  and there is a reason lithuanians do n't want to grant any more rights than necessary . 
  they still remember polinization of lithuania . 
  estonia is on the fast track though . 
  lithuania is n't far behind in growth , but estonia still seems more ahead . 
  i do n't think we have . 
  we had awful relations with polish minority , that 's for sure . 
  expected . 
  estonia is doing better than we are at the moment . 
  they got so deep into the propaganda it became a reality . 
  as far as i know there is no communism that is implemented successfully . 
  in china which there still atleast is communism everything is goverment controlled ... sure they relaxed the control , but it still is incredibly strict . 
  it is n't and it never was . 
  i do n't see anything funny with that . 
  whatever you heard in russian propaganda is not quite true . 
  lithuania really does have around 2.5 million lithuanians and did have them at that time . 
  population was higher by russians that came , but not much . 
   incompatible with the white christian european values we have in the eu that is quite possibly the most racist comment that you can make against racism . 
  also religion has nothing to do with it . 
   germany 's eastern states played host to almost half of the country 's racist acts of violence last year , ** as well as a large proportion of right-wing extremist crimes ** are you going to claim that non-religious are also mostly right-wing too ? 
  lithuanian was not always along side russian , it was banned even books were banned , that 's when we had a famous book smuggling action . 
  there is a good free movie on this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxc3ntkawo4 lithuanian was allowed only in the latest invasion when apparently we `` joined '' ussr . 
  in communism that was ever implemented you had no way to oppose the system , if you have an opinion you are an enemy , you will be locked up , killed or deported to uninhabited regions , if lucky . 
  because of this many people were killed and locked up and deported . 
  we have [ these ] ( http://www.baldunamai.lt/18880-5199-large/lankytoju-kede-iso-eko-oda.jpg ) pretty much everywhere so atleast it 's the same every time . 
  no it was n't . 
  for professional drivers it has . 
  it used to be 0.4 normally 0.2 for professionals and new drivers . 
  now it 's 0.00 for professionals . 
  exactly , if it shows 0.01-0 .02 it still counts as 0 because of device innacuracy . 
  because they are the same arguments , the problem is that baltics did n't have the recognition you have from spain now . 
  we were not an autonomous region and our culture was actually banned . 
  you could n't leave ussr if you wanted to , you had to be allowed , we were not free like you are , we were slaves . 
   this constitution recognized the existence of multiple national communities within the spanish state , which proposed the division of the country into autonomous communities . 
  the first general elections in 1977 restored a provisional generalitat , headed by josep tarradellas and including representatives of the various leading forces of the time . 
  in 1979 , the statute of autonomy was finally approved delegating more automomy in matters of education and culture than the 1932 statute , but less in terms of the systems of justice and public order . 
  in it , catalonia is defined as a `` nationality '' , catalan is recognized as catalonia 's own language , and became co-official with spanish . 
  you are an official minority with your language preserved . 
  spain completely recognizes and accepts you . 
  you are rioting trying to break away from a nation that accepts your culture and supports you . 
  lithuania , latvia and estonia did n't have that . 
  our culture was banned throughout history with russian invasions and we could n't leave ussr legally , it was not allowed . 
  slightly different ? 
  you do know a thousand years ago samogitians and lithuanians pretty much did n't understand each other , right ? 
  now they have an accent , then they had a language . 
  catalan and spanish is pretty much exactly like samogitian and lithuanian in sense of language , just did n't merge together as smoothly . 
  well then that 's good , that 's what i would expect to see . 
  catalans and spanish should be best buds though , that would make them stronger than ever . 
  of course it is n't correct , i just explained how i see it . 
  they have no reason to seperate whatsoever . 
  yeah , it really sounds incredibly funny to read catalan posts ... 
  it would be like samogitians trying to become independant from lithuania . 
  no one ever occupied catalonia and no one ever forced catalonia to do anything , they have zero arguments for trying to separate at the moment and yet for some reason they feel victims , of nothing . 
  i completely understand scotland trying to leave uk , which even they did n't . 
  but catalonia does n't have anything to leave for . 
  their main current argument is that spanish people hate them , but reality of it is , spanish people only hate catalans now , because they want to separate , implying that spanish people are inferior ...

  the intentions are clear . 
  strange that somehow kali ming r a day got left behind after russia tried it 's hardest not to annex anything , or when they sent tanks to enforce russian rule on countries that were trying to leave . 
  i 'm not sure what to tell you . 
  the buffer is a part of it , but russia was aiming for control first and foremost . 
  you 're kidding right ? 
  you 're talking as if russia was n't trying to annex half of europe . 
  because the first aggressors were russia ? 
  the us did n't do anything against russia until it decided to split europe with nazi germany . 
  it 's an irrational fear now ? 
  pray tell why i should ignore the propaganda that is targeted at the west and the political subterfuge and corruption that aims to destabilize our governments and discredit democracy ? 
  as was intended, 
  i 'm just arguing about all the important things , like visits to the protests from foreign countries , as opposed to why they happened in the first place . 
  if all it takes to delegitimize a protest is the visitation of a foreign official then there 's not much arguing with you . 
  i really did have my fun though . 
  www.google.ru `` deez + nuts '' study it all and report back, 
  of course not !, 
  now please find a source . 
  off you go . 
  who 's ridiculing who ? 
  sounds like you do n't have an argument so you 're attempting to make fun of them instead and undermine their legitimacy . 
  well done , proud of my countrymen . 
  now that i can agree with . 
  although i 'm wary of environmental predictions regarding climate change . 
  there are a ton of variables known and unknown that are interacting to give us this wonky weather . 
  long term predictions i would mark as unreliable , although this is not to say that climate change is n't happening . 
  your historical revisionism should at least be sprinkled with some facts , like how much of eastern europe campaigned to join nato to protect themselves from future russian aggression . 
  america had nothing to do with the growing nato influence there . 
  had russia not continuously targeted eastern europe with political infiltration , propaganda campaigns , and threat of attack , then they perhaps would have had no reason to join nato . 
  the countries that russia considers one with them have no real boundaries . 
  it comes to the people living there to make that distinction . 
  russia participated in ruling ukraine about the time yanukovych came to power , so it 's only fair . 
  by the way , source for that info ? 
  the entire maidan was live streamed and documented , you know you ca n't get away spreading this bullshit right ? 
  why bother ? 
  not really , he was in russia 's pocket . 
  tell me how he played russia for benefits with an annexed crimea and a proxy war out east , after he fled to russia for asylum ? 
  he 's a traitor and a political prostitute . 
  because ukrainian patriots would n't turn their guns on their families . 
  you need an outside force , like putin 's military . 
  confirms how deep yanukovych was , and that the maidan is completely justified . 
  yeah , greenhouse gases increase earthquakes . 
  there are legitimate talking points regarding climate change , and then there 's yours . 
  you okay there ? 
  you seem to like children a lot , maybe too much . 
  because implying that russia wo n't do anything because nato is more powerful is disingenuous . 
  putin has been undermining nato for a long time just so he wo n't have to go to war with them . 
  hence the proxy war in the donbass , annexation of crimea through a bogus casus belli , and non stop propaganda to make people think that nato is obsolete . 
  we have relative peace , it means nato is doing it 's job . 
  are you implying putin is n't trying to break nato up ? 
  now watch as he does n't respond to your comment , or deflects about something irrelevant . 
  `` but americans comment all the time , why are you so upset when i do it ? 
  double standard !, 
  interesting , 4000 people , armored vehicles , carrier groups , permission to enter other countries , and a plan of distribution / logistics all in the span of one week . 
  wow , that 's absolutely amazing from the states , doing all of that so quickly . 
  or maybe this was all approved from the ukraine crises , and not a knee-jerk reaction like you claim ? 
  you are so full of bs it 's not even entertaining . 
  very good . 
  this is an important step to curbing russian aggression and reminding them where their border ends , because recently it seems they have forgotten . 
  you do realize trumplets like russia right ? 
  he had help from 3 other brain cells . 
  yeah , my score going down to 0 right after i comment is actually some redditor that keeps refreshing the page on this particular part of the comments section . 
  you see ivan , it really was the ukrainians !, 
  buk came into ukraine , changed citizenship to neo nazi super fascist , shot down the poor plane , then repatriated into glorious russian empire , absolving itself of its horrible ukrainian past !, 
  and ukraine always blame russia !, 
  not everything , and usually with evidence . 
  on a topic such as this one , it is speculation . 
  it 's a well known fact you 're an hour old troll account . 
  nice , did you just deny the russian presence in ukraine ? 
  you must be getting mad at me , down voting everything i post . 
  yeah , it could n't be any russian subversive elements in western ukraine . 
  are you really trying to insinuate that for this to occur the kremlin would send armed russians through the war zone ? 
  you must think we are all stupid . 
  it 's an easy assumption to make considering that russia is n't exactly a unifying force for europe . 
  constantly prodding political parties and people , whilst maintaining a propaganda campaign to make europeans turn on each other . 
  nevermind the fact that historically russia has done worse for propaganda purposes . 
  oh right . 
  i forgot about the force field preventing russians from going to western ukraine . 
  if only they invested in similar technologies in the east . 
  haha , the old `` you must be a chef to criticize food '' argument . 
  you 're an idiot . 
  they might be potholes , but i 've grown up with these potholes and have grown far too attached to them . 
  also , my teeth are gone by the time i reach my dentist anyway . 
  they should start this `` decolonization '' process by moving back to their respective countries . 
  they can preach their ignorance there . 
  i did n't say russia was third world , i said your views are , that shelling civilians and rocketing hospitals is somehow an appropriate response . 
  well russia holds the same views , so i guess in turn it really is third world in its military approach . 
  that 's great , now take your third world thinking and shove it . 
  if they stopped isis i would n't mind . 
  since they bomb hospitals and use cluster munitions that pose a threat to civilians , they are n't exactly helping . 
  does n't have to be responsible to fan the flames . 
  taking advantage of a situation is not below the kremlin . 
  russian propaganda is aimed at other countries , sure . 
  however , the first victims are it 's own citizens , like the lovely chap you just talked to . 
  no logic or common sense required . 
  potatoes you say ? 
  i might have to give danish a try . 
  can i roll for an extra pick ? 
  the one that the russians pay for the most duh . 
  create conflict in me , flood europe with migrants , bribe parties . 
  for an example see france and marine .

  although i never studied it very closely so i may be wrong . 
  i deal with japanese people/companies daily and lived in tokyo for a while . 
  a lot of their r&d / designs/etc is either offshore or hires from the west . 
  or at least who studied abroad . 
  in general , whole far east seem to have cultural issues in that department . 
  they sure do have great minds . 
  far easterners are good at tinkering and evolving existing ideas . 
  but westerners are much better at revolutionary things . 
  far east sure have great minds . 
  but they just seem to work differently than westerners . 
  of course , there 're always exceptions . 
  early chinese civilisation seem to have been great at inventions though . 
  too bad they got stuck later . 
   especially protestantism . 
  in fact by your logic it 's actually protestantism that won the day , clearly time for more sectarian crap to thrown about how great protestant thought is compared to the papist yoke . 
  purely anecdotal , but i 'd totally agree with you . 
  i 'm from catholic country . 
  our neighbours , who had very similar history , are protestants . 
  whenever i deal with them , it looks like our differences are caused mainly by catholics/protestants split . 
  i find their ways better . 
  gdp and living standards agree with that :(, 
  japanese manufacturing was built on technologies imported from the west . 
  the whole japanese boom was based on making cheap copies of western stuff . 
  sure , they did invent stuff here and there . 
  but it 's hardly monumental . 
  balkans were part of greece and roman empire for centuries . 
  south america was just europe 's backyard until recently . 
  better example for your point would be eritrea and other black christians . 
  the european version of christianity went much further than other strains . 
  i 'd rather say that communities define private property as they develop . 
  romans were probably one of the first societies to reach this step . 
  germanic/celtic had n't at the time . 
  ca n't say for sure about poland , but in lithuania it 's based on a mix of soviet times and farmers ' mentality . 
  do n't trust anybody unless you know them . 
  a criminal who you know on first name bases is more trustworthy than someone who looks reputable , but you do n't know . 
  personal relations over looks or public societal status . 
  getting away from pesky plebs plays big role too . 
  everybody wants something to call their own . 
  there 's a saying that if smth is public , then it 's nobody 's . 
  people want to have as much their own as possible ( = gated ) , because they do n't trust others with public property . 
  if it 's not fenced or otherwise mine , then someone will sure come and ruin it . 
  which is not an unfounded fear :(, 
  enemy as in holding a very different view . 
  politicians , holding very different positions , can still respect each other . 
  this guy does n't seem to do that , thus does n't get it in return either . 
  maybe you find him non-arrogant wanker , because you follow the same ideology ? 
  good politicians pay at least some respect to their enemies and gets respect from them in return . 
  verhofstadt seems to have `` whoever is not with me is dumb '' attitude . 
  it 's neither respectful , nor worth any respect . 
  why so ? 
  less women do physical work , sports or exercise . 
  leaner man and fatter female is common sight among all age groups . 
  according to what i saw in finland - i agree with him . 
  your aging infograph is quite true . 
  sadly older generation is doing too much tv and spending not enough time actively . 
  facts ai n't necessarily a cold hard truth . 
  history , speech and freedom are much harder than that . 
  and once you add personal opinions on top of that . . !, 
  both your and my countries were annexed by ussr , were n't they ? 
  but it 's damn easy to find a fact that both latvia and lithuania joined ussr voluntarily . 
  we feel this fact is not what it looks . 
  but plenty of people think otherwise . 
  and they think we twist the history by ignoring the cold hard fact . 
  you and i say the same about holocaust deniers . 
  that they twist the history by ignoring cold hard facts ... 
  probably a romanian student/visitor/whatever showing his support . 
  that just shows how used you 're to good cycling infrastructure , 
  that 's the thing . 
  from what i hear you have a good infrastructure for all that distance . 
  as in , designated cycling paths or , at worst , rural ( but paved ) roads with minor traffic are available . 
  in most countries cycling from city to city includes taking more or less crowded roads that are used by trucks/buses/cars going to the same direction . 
  add that he speaks lithuanian and you get unicorn with 2 corns . 
  while jobs are not strictly finite , 1k people usually do n't mean 1k jobs . 
  especially if we do n't count gov-paid jobs based on integrating/teaching/comforting migrants . 
  ahh . 
  i thought `` afford '' as in `` have money to buy '' . 
  i 'd call this `` have access to '' , but my english may be failing me . 
  i wonder how they put this on the actual survey forms . 
  i agree that the relative-to-culture surveys is definitely much better than raw gdp . 
  but sometimes the surveys seem to be favouriting some cultures/regions . 
  even if surveys were fair enough , some cultures tend to put them in worse light or vice versa . 
  some people looove to bash their surroundings and paint it in worse light than it is , while others try to show off . 
  of course , that may be taken into account when doing local surveys tuned to exact region . 
  anyhow , my point was that most of those poverty charts are very subjective and do n't mean shit in daily lives . 
  the more i travel , more i see that relative poverty gap is not as big as people sometimes want it to be . 
  however , differences are huge if one focuses on specific bits , taken out of context . 
   fulfills their nutritional needs  they could afford x amount of fresh fruit/vegetables some cultures historically have bad eating habits . 
  some people still follow them . 
  even though they might be well off . 
  sure , we could just look at their incomes and see if they might afford healthy food if they wished to . 
  but in some countries sagnificant amount of people still grow their own fruits/vegetables or get them by barter . 
  so they may eat healthy even if their monetary incomes are too low  exercise/play safely this is highly cultural too . 
  i 'm sure many things i did in my childhood would n't pass in other countries . 
  i 'm sure kinds in other countries do stuff that is perfectly normal to them , but would seem scary as fuck to me . 
  income cut-off does n't work in areas with high amount of ` grey ' money or barter . 
  especially when comparing them to societies where every coin is accounted for . 
  defining `` proper '' food is not very straightforward either . 
  or should we use median of that specific country as `` proper '' food in that country ? 
  and now add the barter bit to that . 
  sport clubs is quite a cultural thing too .

  lithuania has pegged litas to euro on 2002 and since that time one of our main political goals was to adopt euro . 
  we tried this unsuccessfully on 2007 , then we delayed our goal for few years . 
  then global crisis struck so everything was postponed till 2014 , and then 2015 . all the main political parties ( left , center , right ) alongside vast majority of economy experts in lithuania do agree that euro is good for the country . 
  final decision to submit request in 2014 was reached 2013 midsummer i believe , so it has absolutely nothing to do with russian/ukrainian events . 
  probably because of very strict and conservative view towards anything related to sex during communist regimes . 
  nope . 
  edited . 
  yet another european confuses slovenia with slovakia . 
  i am ashamed of myself :(, 
  and it 's all because not enough people came to referendum to vote for same-sex marriage being legal , though majority slovak people support that . 
  edit : very sorry , mistaken for slovenian referendum https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/slovenian_family_code_referendum,_2012, 
   well , that does n't fit what i am reading from economists , including the former chief of the danish national bank you mean danish euro-sceptic media ? 
  i am not economist and neither are you i believe , so we can only cite pro and anti euro articles . 
  i only know two things - where the political will exists - any potential problem is solvable , and let 's not forget that solving problems together is easier than on your own . 
  which is basically whole idea for united europe . 
  secondly , lithuania in current situation only benefits of joining eurozone . 
  sadly , it is the last country to do so with no new members joining in a foreseeable future . 
  of course we could let imagination run wild , however historically national side design on every lithuanian coin was coat of arms . 
  oh estonia , our little \u00f5de, 
  euro on its own has nothing to do with spain 's problems . 
  yes , it eliminates possibility of devaluation , though it creates other possibilities of solving problems as well as increased stability . 
  euro was n't and is not perfect currency since it was created to soon without thorough examination of potential scenarios especially in crisis situations . 
  however , it was and still is political decision with a lot of commitment and it has a lot of positive effects economically as well as politically . 
  you are citing sources that are 2-3 years old , when some economists were predicting downfall of euro and even abolishment altogether . 
  as we see euro is alive and well as latest data shows and prognosis are being optimistic . 
  i guess only time will tell what will happen to this political experiment since so many top-class economists have or had very different hypothesis . 
  as for today - euro is n't going nowhere . 
  crisis would have happened with or without euro as a single european currency . 
  the only difference is that countries might have reacted differently . 
  greece might have devalued drachma drastically and even underwent bankruptcy . 
  now it was saved by germany and france . 
  problem was that southern countries rigged their fiscal data and spent more than they could . 
  lessons were learned however . 
  euro is stronger , security system is in place , ecb controlling banks more thoroughly . 
  http://www.cnbc.com/id/101146899 while some countries like poland , hungary and czech might have their doubts towards euro , small countries like lithuania , latvia , slovenia is definitely better of with single currency and they do not have to have level of economy as high as germany . 
  lithuania is a member of eu and nato , so adopting euro as a currency does n't change that much in terms of security . 
  since litas was pegged to euro for 12 years already it does n't change almost nothing either in terms of trade with russian businesses as litas/rubble exchange rate was always influenced almost identically as euro/rubble exchange rate . 
  well technically every country is able to delay the adoption of euro indefinitely . 
  referendum was held . 
  it was in 2003 when we said yes for joining eu and accepting every term that came with it , including adopting euro as the currency as soon as possible . 
  in times like these , i can not be more glad about these news . 
  euro in all baltic countries , nato troops on the ground . 
  when compared to situation in ukraine , i feel that we ( baltic people ) are so freakin ' lucky now despite our tragic and very complicated history . 
  oh what a surprise , the one crying about all the news about russia and stuff , is not `` convinced '' russia is involved in the conflict . 
  in all honesty though , what exactly is your concern here ? 
  if users do n't want to see/read/discuss some submissions , they downvote and move on . 
  or they filter it out , as kind mods provided this tool for us . 
  who are you to tell if `` there 's too much '' of something ? 
  if there would be too much of it , it would n't be upvoted and make it all the tops , do n't you agree ? 
  the greatest thing about reddit and its subreddits is they are user-driven , user-contributed , user-moderated . 
  if you do n't like the submission - you downvote . 
  if more users feel this way , it wo n't show up in top25 . 
  also , do you know another european country that wages war against other european country at the moment , and is killing its opposition politicians right in the capital center ? 
  btw , there 's a link on the sidebar to filter out russia/ukraine related news . 
  duly noted . 
  thanks for shopping . 
  nah , he will actually work . 
  by cia i reckon . 
  no , many of them are genuine russian nationalists-imperialists . 
  yeah , imagine you interviewing your father live on national tv . 
  he even said something along the lines `` i do n't know if you remember , you were 10 at that time , but we saw her together ( thatcher ) '' . 
  hence the cute giggle and quick glance away . 
  actually she 's all professional and all that . 
  summoning / u/dngrs to answer this . 
  6 comments today , 5 comments in one thread yesterday , quite a few more spotted at least by me in other threads . 
  it adds up . 
  also , it 's only / r/europe , i do not regularly read / r/worldnews or other politics oriented subreddits , but i guess they are more popular target for those shills . 
  why would i ? 
  same thing yesterday . 
  for example [ this ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2xg8pt/a_happy_man_the_life_of_boris_nemtsov/ ) thread , at least 5 recently created accounts blaming west and cia for nemtsov murder , all with european flags . 
  afterwards they were deleted , however one user made the [ screenshots ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2xg8pt/a_happy_man_the_life_of_boris_nemtsov/cozvs50 ) . 
  plenty . 
  washington alley , lviv , riga , tallinn , navahrudak , oslo , jerusalem , krakow , latvian , jewish , russian , german , tatar , taras shevchenko , immanuel kant streets . 
  have you heard of nordics ? 
  where did i say that ? 
  in that interview they talk exclusively about margaret thatcher , and says nothing about the current state of politics in russia . 
  boris was an interviewee because he was one of the organizers of thatcher visit to russia some 20 years ago . 
  channel is known for some objectivity ( to a degree ) , because they sometimes invite guests that speak out against putin 's economic policies ( though they are encouraged by the hosts even on air to not to speak against putin in particular , rather to criticize other financial institutions of the country ) . 
  that 's exactly how vast majority of russians think . 
  even significant part of those who do n't like the path the country is taking now , will still get behind everything what was said on that video . 
  but he did n't and that 's what i pointed out ... 
  it does n't really matter what the residents of this particular territory can do , what matters is that eu laws do n't apply to it , therefore it 's not a part of the eu . 
  examples of out of europe eu-proper are reunion and french guiana . 
  mayotte is not new caledonia ... or is it some joke i do n't get ? 
  yeah , i 'm familiar with the meme , but the link you provided actually supports my statement . 
  is this some joke i do n't get ? 
  remain ? 
  they 're not in eu even now . 
  did he drop some pravyi sektor business cards at the crime scene too ? 
  you scored first ? 
  that 's nice . 
  amazon prime for a couple of bucks . 
  no , he was n't . 
  it was said from the beginning that he was internal security , he was `` just working on the border to catch cigarette smugglers '' or whatever - that may have been the cover story . 
  you mean special agent ? 
  'cause federal agent can be called a building inspector working for federal building inspection or whatever . 
   did you just us russia today as source for something that happened ? 
  come on man . 
  ftfy . 
  well , they kinda did that already .

  not really confirmed to be non-fictional ( for lack of a better word ) . 
  it ** is ** called the double u. 
  in armenia . 
  makes you wonder how the polish-lithuanian commonwealth could have happened with this setup . 
  :d edit : separated from braliukas :'(, 
  it 's very subtle and i ca n't really put my finger on it but there have been times when i thought `` hmm ... he 's talking weird '' and then it turns out he 's from kaunas and it all makes sense . 
  i still have no idea what it is though . 
  troll reference i assume . 
  edit : ok , for the moron that downvoted me . 
  troll - as in the mythical creature from norse mythology . 
  the creature that kidnaps and eats children ffs .

  well then most answers should be hitler , stalin , genghis khan etc.

  thanks !, 
  but i [ stole ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/38nbs1/the_rise_of_lithuania_as_a_force_in_it_why_google/crwp5ud ) it :p, 
  oh , right . 
  my bad . 
   erdapfel that 's earth apples . 
  poland and lithuania can into nordic ? 
  should n't bosni\u00eb and herzegovina be half green half other ? 
  thank you , georgia . 
  it 's appreciated , 
  wow , have n't heard this joke in years . 
  though in the version i remember the hero of the story literally drove ( on ? ), 
  a sea of shit like jesus walking on water . 
  so does that make it a successor of hre and thus the roman empire ? 
  liechtenstein the third rome ? 
  is n't it liechtenstein though ? 
  seems to me that you should be asking the canadian this question . 
  haha , this one made me chuckle . 
  yes , that 's true as well . 
  people have rationalized worse things in history . 
  and how many times have you read how cia are responsible for this and that and how europe is a puppet of usa ? 
  as far as russia 's narrative is concerned nato = usa . 
  also , i never said he was dumb . 
  i 'm saying that he thinks that he is smarter than he really is and that people do n't see what he 's doing . 
  just because the pandering gets eaten up domestically does n't mean that the obvious bullshit is n't obvious internationally and especially in the former soviet countries . 
  just look at how often poland calls on russia 's shit or how russian foreign minister got laughed at when giving a speech with the usual bs bulletpoints at some international event . 
  personal anecdote : i had a clone of putin as a class mate . 
  highly intelligent person but a social sociopath and when putin goes off script you can see his `` i 'm better than everyone on earth '' attitude shine through . 
  i bet you know these types of people as well . 
  oh , i see how you could have understood it that way . 
  no , i was definitely not saying that . 
   i was mainly saying that when someone has certain ideas or `` plots '' they start thinking that everyone is thinking the same things that they are . 
  like all the unfounded accusations from russia on other countries . 
  i agree with most of your points . 
  actually , all of them . 
  just some opinion based stuff i would like to add : 1 ) spot on and this is the crowd that just eats up whataboutisms from russia especially since ww2 gets brought up all the time for no reason at all to remind everyone that `` russia saved the world ! '' . 
  it adds to the whole russia is obviously great but the west is bullying us by not acknowledging us . 
  if not for the aggressive nato oppressing everyone then they would totally openly love us . 
  cry-bullying at its finest and this sentiment has been expressed by even our regular russian redditors . 
  there was some thread about what people were surprised to find out other countries thought about their country and most russians i saw said a variation of `` that everyone hates us '' or `` that everyone does n't love us '' . 
  or at least that was the most voted up one by a russian redditor iirc . 
  2 ) i would say that most western europeans are so baffled by the statements made by russia that a lot of them start thinking that `` something that crazy just has to be true because no respectable head of state would make it up '' . 
  i got the impression that western european countries are completely not used to horribly blatant and offensive statements and that 's why it works . 
   it does n't make sense if you look at it from the point of view that he actually believes what he 's saying . 
  i think that he 's fully aware of the bullshit he 's pushing but that does n't mean that he does n't project nor that he does n't somehow rationalize that bullshit in his head . 
  take that interview that a lot of people were posting where putin is talking about how russia has no plans to annex crimea or somehow jeopardize the sovereign integrity of ukraine ( or any other country i think but i 'm not sure about the latter part ) . 
  as far as i remember the question was a complete soft ball and it was putin that went out of his way to push the issue that `` noooo russia would never do something like thaaat * wink wink * '' . 
  that 's why i say he 's projecting and that 's why i think he thinks that he 's smarter than he is . 
  it 's because of his arrogance that he always includes these little jabs in most of his interviews followed by that shit eating smirk of his . 
  he 's taunting the west with `` i 'm better than you-uuu na na na na-a ~ '' . 
  works great on the domestic audience . 
  he just ** needs ** to get one over the west . 
  how many years has it been for him to have this superstar manly-man status in russia ? 
  that obviously went to his head . 
  he 's not censoring himself enough because he still thinks that russia is a superpower and can get away with lies of imperialistic levels and you know how threads about russia 's superpower status go around here . 
  that and him being surrounded by yes men probably adds to his delusions . 
  compare even the jokes he makes with the jokes obama reads that writers have written for him . 
  obama 's jokes are safe , kinda obvious , goofy and non threatening - basically dad jokes . 
  putin 's jokes are equivalents of yo mamma 's jokes . 
  it 's all about degrading something to appear better in comparison with putin . 
  i think it 's pretty obvious that putin likes to go off script fairly often . 
  the whole funneling funds things is exactly what the russian empire did to undermine the polish-lithuanian commonwealth . 
  everything russia is doing is either projecting or has been done by the soviets or the czars . 
  putin is n't stupid enough to believe his own bullshit outright but his mentality is that what he 's doing is n't outdated thinking and i would say that he rationalizes a great deal of his own nonsense . 
  to sum it up , i would say that all what you have said and projecting due to high levels of narcissism are not mutually exclusive . 
  russia 's intelligence agencies and putin 's personal advisers know what they 're doing but when putin goes off script is when he shows his true colours imo . 
  you do n't have to be stupid to project and while i would n't call him an idiot as well , i would say that he definitely is n't as smart as he thinks he is ( judging from his snarky and arrogant behaviour from various interviews ) or as smart as some people try to make him out to be . 
  if not blatant projection what should it be called though ? 
  other than hypocrisy that is . 
  russia 's foreign policy is everything that russia keeps accusing others of doing . 
  even before they do it sometimes . 
  they accuse a country of * trying * to do something to undermine russia and then the following month you hear of russia doing the same thing they were crying about before . 
  does n't have to be usa or even a nato member . 
  if that 's not projecting then i do n't know what is . 
  unless it 's some kind of preemptive action to have an excuse later because `` they did it too '' . 
  because everyone knows that whataboutisms are totally legit arguements that should be taken seriously , right ? 
  which still is projecting imo . 
  that 's putin projecting . 
  since that is how russia handles things he thinks that that 's how america and thus nato ( because it 's the same thing right ? ), 
  does it as well . 
  not the cheeeese !, 
  anything but the cheese !, 
  it 's the only town in lithuania that still practices a certain part of ( the day before ) ash wednesday celebration aka u\u017egav\u0117n\u0117s ( the time before lent ) .

  in france or uk those immigrants are from ex-colonies , so they feel like they have a right to live in the country and to demand for change in laws . 
  hm , i 'm looking at their terms & conditions page , but it 's very unclear whether they charge that or not , considering that up until now it was # 2 for 20mb when abroad ... 
  that 's still a terrible price . 
  # 3 per day plus # 0.70 per mb and it adds up to quite a pile of money . 
  they just go under different names , but it 's still vodafone . 
  [ almost the same ] ( http://i.imgur.com/g6tlt.png ) , but a bit wider . 
  maybe because i strongly disagree with punishing criminals harder ? 
  poland is not exactly famous for being developed . 
  what else do you expect ? 
  muslim families tend to have many children , so naturally their population is rising quickly . 
  google translate strikes again !, 
  they bid half of what the government was expecting to spend , but only 25 % less than the next bidder . 
  still a lot cheaper , so no wonder that they fucked up . 
  well , either this or the highway would have fallen apart after one year . 
  they ca n't have `` cheap , quick and reliable '' all at the same time , they have to pick two . 
  keep us updated on how this works out . 
  it 's an interesting situation . 
  that 's right , this will teach you to be handicapped !, 
  you 're just jealous because you 're not in the list , 
  good , europe is levelling out . 
  maybe some 5-10 years later we will be able to introduce euro in all the remaining countries and it wo n't cause a shitstorm . 
  no lithuanian flag either , it seems . 
  only the colours from it . 
  there 's a [ similar bull ] ( http://i.imgur.com/zfzta.jpg ) in birmingham , uk , but it does n't look as good . 
  [ here ] ( http://i.imgur.com/3g3a9.png ) is the flag itself . 
  lithuania is very colourful , 
  true , i do n't have any more info about this particular situation . 
  i 'm judging based on lots of previous ( very similar ) cases . 
  law is often ignored when it comes to false claims . 
  to be honest , it 's ignored most of the time . 
  the worst that could happen is she would get to do some public services or something , as opposed to those two guys going to jail for 10 years and then not being able to find a job ever again . 
  so she got drunk , had sex , now regrets it . 
  claiming that she was raped is a win-win situation for her , because she either wins a shitload of money from the footballers or she simply does n't get anything and just walks away , because false rape claims are not punishable . 
  nope , ca n't be . 
  ah , reminds me of [ eurotrip ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0356150/ ) .

  if you have seen it , here 's the bit which was cut out , [ michelle trachtenberg 's boobs ] ( http://4chanarchive.org/images/gif/3945654/1291195337140.gif ) . 
  they make venice look bad too . 
  i was expecting the city to be much nicer and cleaner , yet there were tags on almost every wall . 
  sad that people do n't value such a unique place . 
  those pirates better thank their god that it was n't a russian tanker . 
  just a random observation : i was in venice doing some research recently and i noticed that there is a lot of politically-inspired graffiti . 
  the ones from anarchist and neo-nazi groups were the most common , although there also seemed to be a lot of stuff from immigrants from the middle east . 
  they were cursing us and obama , praising the `` islamic spring '' in tunisia and egypt and all that . 
  if actually switching to another network upon arrival will be implemented , then it will be awesome . 
  now some networks charge insane amounts of money for data connection . 
  i would use google maps every time in every city , but it 's just too damn expensive . 
  you know it 's not going to end well when people are forced to show respect ... 
  `` kill those who say that islam is violent '' is another common one , although probably fake . 
  milder muslims say that they are against all this protesting and violence , but i do n't really see them doing anything to show that they actually mean that . 
  are they implying that illegal migration is a myth ? 
  oh god , jewce will be taking over jupiter !, 
  he sort of was , spent some time in jail and i believe he 's now under 22-hour curfew , however he 's still a terrorist . 
  if he goes to jail , then we will be feeding someone who was planning on committing a suicide attack in our own country . 
  we 're not sending him back to jordan because they also think that he 's a terrorist and will probably torture him , which is not allowed by the echr . 
  i agree . 
  what 's `` hot '' is usually what retarded kids like . 
  shit like drum 'n' bass , then techno , jumpstyle ( or whatever it 's called ) , now dubstep . 
  it 's all the same crap . 
  [ jurga \u0160eduikyt\u0117 ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2hvnxzxxyy ) is one of the last few artists in lithuania who does n't suck . 
  edit : [ this ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdtszqjn6g0&amp;feature=related ) is our eurovision song for this year , it 's also in the tops currently . 
  i 'm 94 % sure that we will get one of the last three places , because it sucks . 
  it 's boring and unimaginative . 
  torrenting is how the stuff would be distributed if we did n't have record labels . 
  record companies are scared because they are becoming obsolete , as proven by the pirate bay and their advertising campaign , promoting new artists . 
  they 're trying to sue the fuck out of all there pro-piracy people because if they do n't , less and less musicians will sign a deal with them , because having an independent website and giving torrents ( and asking for donations in return ) would bring in more money . 
  entertainment industry tried to ban vhs and magnetic cassettes , recordable cds and all other shareable media , because it threatened their monopoly . 
  now the internet came along and it 's the first real , big enemy of their monopoly , that 's why they 're freaking out and pushing various new legislations all over the world and trying to arrest file sharers and website owners . 
  as you probably know , the musician only gets a very very small cut from all the profits , majority of it goes to the record label and also to production and sales of cds . 
  imagine if we removed the big guy and all the cd printing/shipping costs . 
  an album costs what , $ 20 now ? 
  imagine if the price dropped down to $ 2 , for an instant download . 
  everyone could easily afford that and piracy rates naturally would drop . 
  also , the musician would get most of the profits to himself , earning much more than before . 
  because entertainment industry does n't care if it 's right or not , they only care if it brings money . 
  some american twat , with a degree in theology . 
  they are , this guy does a week 's job in four hours . 
  you ca n't be more efficient than that . 
  they do n't have to be free . 
  they only have to be so cheap that it would n't be worth pirating any more . 
  also , delivery should be done online , i.e. 
  downloadable everything . 
  it 's 21st century , why would anyone wait three days for their physical disc to arrive ? 
  example for such `` too cheap to pirate '' product would be louis ck standup . 
  he earned much more by asking $ 5 per download , than if he would 've given it to some label which would 've sold dvds for $ 20 or so . 
  also , imagine if netflix became available in all households and offered all the tv shows , movies and everything else as soon as it comes out , for a fixed fee of $ 15/month , or so . 
  who would n't buy that ? 
  since everyone with a tv would have that , makers would get massive profits and the piracy would slowly die out , as $ 15 is not that much . 
  prices are heavily influenced by engine size , though . 
  idea behind this is that a big-engined car will go fast and it will be heavy , so the young driver ( dumb and without experience , obviously ) will run through a traffic jam and completely destroy 10 + other vehicles . 
  for the shelby i did a price comparison , ~ # 10,000 / year was one of the cheapest options . 
  third in the list was running upwards of # 22,000 . 
  billions . 
  for a brand new driver it 's somewhere around # 4000 per year for a small-ish car . 
  out of curiosity i once checked how much would it cost to insure a brand new shelby gt v8 and ... well let 's just say that it would be cheaper to buy a used car for # 1000 every month . 
  i really do n't know what the hell are they thinking . 
  based on those numbers , i must crash the car within two years . 
  well to be fair , most people are rarely exposed to the same poverty , as gypsies tend to stay in that same part of the city , which ( as i already mentioned ) is more of an industrial area . 
  therefore , our kids do n't really see the bad stuff and do n't get to hang out with gypsy kids . 
  it 's not a very nice thing to say , but i 'm kind of ok with them staying in their ghetto and not moving out to random places around the city .

  france literally got later fully occupied , while it took gb to beat germany only after 4 years . 
  nazi germany was the wall that stopped allies from helping baltics , finland which was invaded by ussr could n't get support from allies too you know , that 's why they turned for nazi germany . 
   exactly , their choice , you do n't provoke a sleeping animal , especially if the animal is sleeping on a nuclear arsenal capable of destroying earth 100 times over . 
  remind me last time our jets got intercepted or even shot in russian air space , `` our spies '' getting caught in russia , last time we said destruction of gdl/plc was a major geopolitical disaster , praising nazi regime etc. 
  oh yes it 's tiny lithuania state that is poking russia for not kneeling and opening it 's mouth fully . 
  what a joke . 
   nato would , but im saying nato would n't . 
  they would hardly risk war over a territory they can afford to lose . 
  when whole nato would crumble and would be non-existent any more which is dream of russian and serbians like you which explains why you 're trying to prove me why nato would n't go to war over our countries after russian invasion . 
   neither did ukraine , look where that got them . 
  ukraine had chance , took it , but russia with it 's claws put into the flesh would n't let her go . 
   or neither did the us in syria syria is still in middle of civil war , ruled by extremist group . 
   and russians turned the war around for some reason it still have n't ended , did n't turn around shit . 
   see , funny how those stereotypes get thrown around and then you get caught off guard . 
  what stereotypes , go see statistics , russia is by far the biggest country with high percentage of hiv . 
   well , since you wished ill on my family , friends and nation , i can only say you never expirience what i expirienced . 
  i did n't wish anything bad for your nation , family or friends , but that 's what you get when you 're supporting oppressive regime . 
   just like it was behind your back in 1940s ? 
  eu and nato did n't exist yet back then , you should know better . 
  if europe was n't exhausted by war against nazi germany , ussr would been done instantly . 
   exactly , you really think eu/us would risk nuclear war over the baltics ? 
  who says nuclear war ? 
  nato conventional forces and eu 's economy alone would destroy russia . 
  and if russia wants whole world to burn , it 's their choice . 
   i like how you stated you were n't afraid , then two comments later you said yes . 
  there is a thing , i 'm not afraid of russian forces , because nato would repel it like nothing , i 'm worried about potential innocent people who would die because of russian stupidity . 
  it 's fear of unnecessary death . 
  what you tried to say to me that i 'm scared shitless of russia , which i 'm not . 
  i do n't care about that hiv and krokodil infected vodkalandia , i care about my family , friends and my nation that could get raped by russia 's never ending idiocy on geopolitics . 
   so terorism is justified ? 
  are these european values ? 
  lithuanian partisan war happened because ussr was oppressing lithuania , killing from little children to old people in most brutal fashion . 
  uk was oppressing ireland and got what they asked for - ira . 
  it has nothing to do with european values , but nature of oppressive regimes and resistance against it . 
  if you spill blood of your enemy , be prepared to see same answer on you . 
   it didnt , in a period after 1999 , serbian numbers halved in kosovo . 
  albanian numbers stayed more or less the same/grew a bit . 
  not to mention the 2004 pogrom which saw even more serbs harassed . 
  all of this could have been prevented , but somebody had to put a spark on this , hint serbia . 
   thats the problem . 
  what problem ? 
  both serbia and kosovars killed people , neither is good . 
  yes , but eu and nato is behind our back , i fear that russia 's idiocracy will ignite a wider war . 
   the war started after a 3 year terrorist insurgency by the kla that terrorist organization came into existence because kosovo was under oppressive regime . 
  i know that they were n't angels , but serbia called all of this for themselves . 
  that 's why nato had to put stop onto this slaughterhouse . 
  i neither see kosovars good , nor serbians , only nato that prevented this ethnic cleansing . 
  belarus is just a country that tries to balance things between two worlds , even though they realized being close tied with russia might be pain in the ass , as russian actions in ukraine show . 
  besides i 'm not afraid of russia , but i 'm worried about their next idiotic political/militaristic step . 
  belarus is close to russia but far from being one . 
  well , here is explanation on [ men ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjpadtqujmg ) and [ women ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grvmmtllhd8 ) . 
   not really , i think that 's ukraine . 
  ukraine is far from mini russia , but sadly , ukrainian nation is getting raped by russia . 
   but why would you think that ? 
  anti-usa , anti-nato , anti-eu and anti-western overall , thinking that everyone is their enemy for some reason . 
  poland and lithuania spilled blood between each other for ethnic reasons too , but guess what , we grew out of xx c. thinking . 
  if you really think whole europe or usa wants to see serbai burn , you 're delusional . 
  l\u016bl, 
  serbia is truly a mini russia . 
  agree . 
  yeah , i know , but meat awesome . 
  i like transg ... hmm . 
   i find it completely unnecessary to eat animal products because your body needs it . 
  kid will not grow well if he will only eat grass . 
  i 'm not supporter of these kind of slaughterhouses , but meat is essential for human body due to evolution and biology . 
  nobody is forcing you . 
  since when being gay was spec . 
  european cultural thing ? 
  you always this stupid or this is special occasion ? 
  oh yeah , my parent memories of ussr were so great , lol , fuck ussr . 
  so russia is free to do what it wants because of typical russian whataboutism ? 
  only if russia attacks nato country , then whole hell gon na come to russia . 
   nato has all means necessary to strike russia your level of idiocy gone through the sky . 
  hey , lenkija , up for some adventure ? 
  [ pretty much . 
  ] ( https://youtu.be/6khxame407i?t=81 ), 
  lithuanians are just nordic poles . 
  everyone knows that poles are just german russians . 
   i 'm new to this region this region has very interesting history . 
  worth reading about . 
  are you sure about it ? 
  congratz , you succesfully triggered me . 
  where are the latvia , estonia , lithuania ? 
  i 'd say every language is important to learn in europe . 
  i think it counts . 
  eurogayness is a choice , we have choices in eu you know . 
  :p and well [ billions ] ( https://youtu.be/jtmxhvgzisy?t=33 ) of euros . 
  unless ruskies cross the border , [ then shit gets real ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pn-fifcnwbm ) in finland . 
   polish language and culture because it was much more attractive to them and much richer than lithuanian , also because they want to exstiguishe themselves from the ruthenian nobility - ruthenian culture had a strong impact on lithuanians before the krewo union you just answered yourself . 
  poland prevented crown 's arrival which would put lithuania into kingdom status , which means we would n't need polish influnce to make our nobility have more privilagies . 
  oh trust me , there is no hidden hate on poland . 
  the only thing we hate about poland is due to vilnius dispute in interwar period , though it 's becoming a lesser thing with every generation . 
  same thing , delusional people . 
   so it 's same thing like with grand duchy of lithuania , which was a belarusian state with a lithuanian name you must be really smart on trying to appoint modern terms for nationality on mediaval realms . 
  just a joke . 
  russians view eu as `` homogay '' alliance . 
   hm , exactly how much euromonies ? 
  a lot . 
  same here . 
  got ass cancer .

  because there was not much else to do and social system was highly geared towards having kids . 
  also , at least in ussr , contraceptives were not so easy to get and no sexed . 
  would you ban things linked to subcultures too ? 
  or only certain religions you do n't like , but leave all subcultures-borderline-cults-borderline-religions alone ? 
  but there must be enough negativity to push people to protest . 
  most people have a lot of other stuff to do and protesting is far from their favourite hobby . 
  shit really needs to hit the fun to get them out to streets . 
  of course , there 's the counter force of fear which is commonly together with the very serious negativity . 
  but once there 's enough negativity , people will protest no matter what . 
  personally , i know and believe things can get better . 
  thus i 'm not out there protesting . 
  although there 're quite a few things i 'd like to tell my politicians . 
  if things would get really dark , then i 'd start thinking about protesting and stuff . 
  to bring back hope that things can get better . 
  from that point , i 'll resort back to my job and leave politics for politicians . 
  what you described is logic of hobby protesters . 
  those people love to protest if they seem there 's something to protest and possibly bring some change or even publicity . 
  but the vast masses do n't give a shit about that . 
  easy and common mistake . 
  because people being negative about the future is what causes the protests ? 
  why would people being positive about the future protest ? 
  sure , there 're some people who 'll protest anything all the time . 
  but for mass protests you need the very negative overall attitude . 
  otherwise most people just do n't care enough . 
  our president is ex eu commissioner so there 's that ... 
  imo religion is the perfect tool to build a stable society . 
  irreligious societies seem to split into a lot of subcultures which invent their own pseudo religions . 
  in the long run , such society does n't have much glue holding it all together . 
  aside maintaining status quo and letting each other do their own thing . 
  but it looks like sooner or later someone wants to enforce is way of living on others and the whole thing starts shaking . 
  it 'd be interesting to profile when and how exactly those people got radicalised . 
  as you mentioned , quite a few radicals seem to have tech degrees . 
  i wonder if being exposed to a lot of atheists around them played a role . 
  maybe feeling pressure caused them to cave in . 
  humans are very good at trying to keep a whole understanding of the world around them . 
  contradiction is one of the worst thing a human can experience . 
  i 'm too lazy to google for source , but there 're quite a few studies on that . 
  thus the only difference in religious and atheist are their starting points . 
  after that , both of them seek to reinforce their world views . 
  using any means available to them . 
  both groups seek approval from peers , listen to superiors and bash their opponents . 
  sorry about your fingers . 
  hopefully upboat is good enough compensation for missing / s !, 
  eh , i 'd say you finns have . . reserved opinion rather than hate sweden . 
  i 've heard smth along the lines of `` he 's swede , but a good guy '' few times . 
  so neighbour relations as usual  i noticed some anti-norway sentiment only up in the north . 
  the usual `` rich sleazy neighbours '' stuff . 
  to be fair , they probably dislike helsinki as much as norway . . 
  over there in vilnius huge portion of downtown was left as-is after ww2 . 
  dangerous buildings demolished , good buildings fixed up and everything in between was partially used or left to rot . 
  most of it was cleaned up in late 90s-early 00s . 
  but there 're still some leftovers in not-so-expensive areas . 
  that seems to be the list of top-hated countries rather . 
  finns seem to be err ... not so fond of sweden . 
  do n't ask them about russia . 
  and norway is even worse than that for this dude . 
  i wonder why estonia ended up in that comparison :|, 
  yea , my telescreen already scheduled me for retraining . 
  when did ministry of truth published list of legit phobias ? 
  ^ this guy rides lobster gloves mater race !!, 
  that 's the difference between russia and the rest of ex-commies ... 
  how would you choose which polish death camp to send to ? 
  you 've soooo many !, 
  swiss chocolate is better though ... 
  what about eastern czechia ? 
  are you saying you 'd send such person to a death camp ? 
  it 's a joke along the same lines as westerns saying they kinda liked ussr/stalin/lenin / etc. 
  in the east , hitler is not the ultimate evil as in the west . 
  it 's at the same step as stalin at best . 
  even during ussr times it was common joke that `` i wish hitler won , we 'd have better beer/sausages/roads / etc at least '' . 
  generally people do not admire hitler/nazis , but think commies/stalin was worse option of the two . 
  maybe because we got to experience it for so much longer . 
  in addition to that , commies , who were despised , said hitler/nazis were bad . 
  enemy-of-the-enemy kicks in and you got what you got . 
  they do . 
  going as far as claiming that lithuanian grand duchy successor is belarus . 
  which is the true lithuania while modern lithuania are imposters . 
  ... and then those polonised people would start talking in russia and saying how good putin is , 
  just fyi , there quite a few polonised people in central lithuania . 
  mostly in k\u0117dainiai and jonava and their surroundings . 
  at the turn of 20th century , kaunas city had almost identical population as vilnius city . 
  few lithuanians , mostly jews , russians and poles . 
  vilnius region had quite a few lithuanians too . 
  it was n't that much different from the rest of the country as some people make it look . 
  for example , polonised names were popular throughout the country . 
  it was popular to lithuanise names and even surnames in 20s . 
   95 % polish city huh ? 
  more like mostly jewish . 
  and many russians . 
  poles were n't even majority . 
  btw , lithuania was kinda friendly to poland up to the point when poland took vilnius ... 
  it 's a bit more complicated than that . 
  there 's a. . let 's say freedom troika . 
  january 13th ( just `` remembrance '' day , some modest celebration , growing year-over-year ) , february 16th ( day off , a wee more celebration ) and finally march 11th ( day off , several celebrations ) . 
  in addition to that , there 's july 6th . 
  the crowning day of mindaugas , our first and only pope-approved king . 
  which is day-off and usually good weather . 
  thus unofficial national bbq/camping/open air festivals day . 
  the day # 1 is either feb 16th or march 11th , varies from person to person . 
  imo feb 16th is a bit more important .

   i do n't remember if my class ever did . 
  it 's a lot fun then we in primary school were in competition who made scariest pumpkin face . 
  british english is european english . 
  prepare for bombings 2.0, 
  but we used to carve pumpkins in primary school ; ( long time ago, 
  why do you say that like it 's a bad thing . 
  you can fix that by making lithuanian-latvian commonwealth . 
  as stupid and harsh it sounds without it we would been balkans 2.0, 
  seeing two lithuanians trying to fight over who post faster a good picture looks cute . 
  well this sounds bad , now i see reason behind your nickname . 
   you actually said all of mainland europe . 
   which does n't include scandinavia , britain or the us ... as englishman you ca n't write jack shit in english . 
   while connected , scandinavia is n't referred to as mainland europe . 
  that still does n't change my point and fact . 
   scandinavia is connected to mainland . 
   or the us us is in europe ... til ... 
  never have i ever seen anyone being racist here where i live , not even in other cities i have been to in lithuania . 
  also gta vc with them sniper rifle making moon bigger . 
  what 's wrong with you honestly ? 
  i just stated why i thought he was russian and it 's still not enough for you . 
  why are you trying to create useless conversation out of useless topic . 
  dmitri is very common russian name and that 's all . 
   so in your mind lithuanians are somehow morally superior to russians . 
  go drink your pills . 
  you do n't know what word `` racism '' stands for , and my comment is n't hating on whole ethnicity , it 's generalise because of his name `` dmitri '' . 
  i expected him to be smart enough to use google before writing his sentence out of his ass . 
  excuse me ? 
  moldovans and romanians are same ethnic group with same spoken language , while lithuania and latvia are balts who speak baltic language , not slavic like poland or russia . 
  your statement is ignorant and without any logic . 
  guess who fund them . 
  well moldavian 's are pretty much ceded romanians . 
   russia is part of europe , we can not just wish them away ; this is the reality of the situation . 
  perhaps being an american on the other side of the ocean your vision is clouded and you are able to be as zealous and uncompromising as you seem to be advocating the eu to be . 
  but i live in europe , a continent that includes russia whether i like it or not . 
  problem is russia sees herself less european everyday , not other way around . 
   demonising them and ** militarising the eu 's / natos borders ** will not help anyone , i want a balance between keeping eastern european union countries safe and showing ** russia ** that they can ** work with us through diplomacy ** . 
  it will help us to become more safe . 
  russia and diplomacy do n't work together if you ever took a look onto russia 's history . 
   is n't that veto pretty much a reciprocal move ? 
  are poles recognized as minorities with appropriate language laws in germany and lithuania ? 
  i do n't know much about it . 
  i heard we 're fixing it . 
   from what i hear , in lithuania poles ca n't even keep their original names and they have to change them to more lithuanian versions . 
  yes , it 's true . 
  but even if you made it more lithuanian it would still retain traces of your surname in polish since some letters are meaningless like w ( polish ) instead of v ( lithuanian ) . 
  no , not at all . 
  he 's probably speaking about non-eu/nato post-soviet countries , especially those in central asia . 
  lithuanians and our media does n't target polish or even russian minority , but they target exactly tomaszewski , he 's reason why polsih minority `` has problems '' here . 
  i do n't think he 's here to make friends . 
  welcome to lithuania , where pro-kremlin c * nt do anything in his hands to maintain some kind of influence even if it means using both minorities for his own gain . 
  ah , our great and glorious slang . 
   my dad describes architecture he does n't like as polish and gets really livid about it . 
  hearing about it he 's all for lithuanian superiority and enslaving the poles , but really ... he just really does n't like ** polish architecture ** there is no such a thing ... 
  thank you for your respond , was really interesting !, 
  name sounds almost like if he was lithuanian ... 
   anyway - do you agree with my statement , or not ? 
  your statement would been fine if you noted that it was in plc , in gdl , ruthenian was only widely used because of all that ruthenian land we incorporated into gdl . 
   what language was used in gdl at that time ? 
  at beginning lithuanian , after expansion ruthenian and lithuanian ( also german , latin etc ) . 
   ruthenian became the main language of ** documentation and writings ** , especially in ** eastern and southern parts of the duchy ** . 
  is bavaria like austria 2.0 ? 
  i heard it speaks same dialect ( ? ), 
  is n't it ? 
  because lithuanian language did n't had it 's written form , which is why we adopted ruthenian . 
  why not lithuania , specifically klaip\u0117da / memel city , it has same architecture like old prussia , you would feel like home . 
  i would n't say he 's communist , but rather populist who wants money from both sides by doing nothing . 
  he 's pro-kremlin puppet , who tries to create problems as much as he can so he could be elected by polish and russian minority while promising something but never delivering . 
  again i have no idea how he still stands in politics . 
  that 's all , all these problems you hear about street names and polish minority last names on passports are created by him . 
  we do , but that does n't change the fact that they have more in common with you than us . 
  but we only had wars between each other . 
  you share far more history and culture with them . 
  if poland was n't a dick after ww1 i 'm pretty sure we would say ourselves poland is our best buddy . 
  you forgot german prussians themselves stole clay from old prussians ( baltic ) . 
  even when it 's written in lithuanian it 's hard to read - '' \u017de\u010dpospolita '' . 
  your language seems too hard for a daily life . 
  always victim ... 
  waldemar tomaszewski is main reasons why your minority has `` issues '' . 
  he brings up quite irrelevant topics that would n't change anything of daily lives , he 's there to create anger or fear between each other , our media long ago talks what are these guys tasks , it 's been revealed that he uses money for his own gain and i do n't understand how in the hell he happens to hold still in politics . 
  trust me on this , your minority is not in danger or any discrimination , this all but a bubble who was created by media to gain views . 
  everyone knows it 's latvia . 
  well austria and prussia ( later german empire ) were n't friendliest of neighbours , at least that was my first thought when we talk about two . 
  latvia never did anything wrong to us and is ally , and fellow balt . 
  well this sounds bad ... 
  but i wonder why we 're [ one of the most tallest ] ( https://drive.google.com/file/d/0b9o3eytdm8lqyjdnt3dcu21bvku/edit ) people in europe when we 're pretty much tied our long ass history with poland and rest of ee ... 
  while you and estonia were ruled for centuries by germans , and got colonized by them a bit before ww2 end . 
  oh , never knew about it . 
  thank you for sharing . 
  come to baltics and become baltic-german as your strongest ancestors were !, 
  enjoy nice women , we have good beer also and fast internet !, 
  what you are waiting for , just hop on first plane . 
  ^ ^ ^ heheheheh, 
  maybe ( \u0361 \u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361 \u00b0 ), 
  you have never met russians then who are from russia . 
  that 's nr . 
  1 rule of war , to make your population hate your enemy , nothing special , russia is prime example through centuries . 
  together , we shall name it kingdom of baltia . 
  i wrote my sentence like true retard , i 'm sorry . 
  yeah i knew this one . 
  good old times , stabmeld\u017eiai rules !,

  a big apartment/house to fit 2 or 3 kids is fuckin expensive . 
  that 's one of the reasons why people who do have kids settle for a single kid . 
  better child care access would be nice too . 
  especially for on-demand off-hours child care . 
  it 's true that people 's lifestyles have changed a lot . 
  childcare could adapt to suite that too . 
  that 'd greatly benefit the middle class too . 
  so no diversity in human rights ? 
  what is separating what is true diversity and what is not ? 
  or is it another no true scotsman kind of thing . . 
  that and there 's no consensus wether abortions do n't cause long term psychological issues . 
  i 've bumped into quite a few different opinions . 
  that 's the diversity of the world . 
  my point was that original christianity was not `` our '' culture . 
  we took some bits and applied to our pre-christian cultures . 
  sure we are not bad wanting that whoever comes should follow our rules . 
  but in my book , that 's not diversity either . 
  more diversity would be letting everybody follow their cultures in their homecountries . 
   christians arent supposed to eat pork either , but who cares since when ? 
  christians are new testament people . 
  old testament does n't apply much to christians as far as i know . 
  in most of europe , christianity-based culture is local culture with christianity blended in . 
  i know for a fact that in my country , many of the local `` christian '' celebrations were carried over from pre-christian times . 
  there 're certain location-specific believes too . 
  for example , many people consider marry to be more important than the holy-trio . 
  from what i heard , that would n't fly in other countries . 
  the main explanation is that when christianity came , woman-based sun was more important ( or at least equal to ) man-based god . 
  thus the church adopted and marry was made more important than in the original version . 
  totally agree that the beauty of the world is the diversity of cultures and humanity . 
  imo , nation states and highly diverse regions of the world is the ultimate diversity . 
  i doubt it can get more diverse than that . 
  sure , if somebody wants to come to a certain country and live by it 's laws and customs , that 's cool . 
  but when importing some culture , diluting it ( and possibly local culture too ) and praising it as some kind of diversity . . that does n't fly by me . 
  that 's exact opposite of improving diversity . 
  let 's say everybody sticks to their old cultures and stay at home . 
  would n't that be more diversity than putting everybody together and remodelling their cultures to follow the modern western culture ? 
  so you 're saying that diversity is good . 
  but only some kind of diversity . 
  skin color diversity is good . 
  but culture diversity ( burkas is part of a culture ) ai n't good . 
  and diversity is good as long as the people drop `` certain aspects '' of their cultures . 
  that 's effectively limiting diversity too . 
  would n't it be easier to say that you do n't want diversity , aside from a kebab and more colors out on the streets ? 
  aborts sure have no bad side effects . 
  they could allow 4th trimester aborts as well . 
  now that 'd be great for freedom of women . 
  do n't like how your kid turned out ? 
  we got a solution , 
  one more reason why portugal is in eastern europe ... 
  yep , russia was n't exactly happy . 
  i thought you mean locals as in locals of the given bloc :  in the meantime each side carries the propaganda war to convince the locals that the other side 's claims are worse option, 
  over there in lithuania , nato did n't have to do much convincing . 
  there was massive public support from early 90ies . 
  eu had more work to do actually . 
  i do n't have a recent poll on hand , but i remember nato support was even higher than eu 's . 
  even most of eurosceptics are nato supporters . 
  i 'm pretty sure that 's the case throughout north/east europe . 
  might be different in countries that did n't experience russia first-hand though . 
   whatever they feel , that is their problem . 
  getting angry at others because of your own feelings is powerfully retarded . 
  and , obviously , not an excuse . 
  people are responsible for their choices . 
  just curious , does the same apply to greece ? 
  should greeks be responsible for voting for people who brought them to current shitty situation ? 
  do i smell pexit ? 
  all kinds from university age to well over 40 . 
  whoever you can meet in pubs , concerts , out in the woods and wherever . 
  i love to just sit in a public square and observe random strangers too . 
  of course , i read a book or smth to look less creepy  your experience reminds me students exchange stuff . 
  only people with certain mindset would show up . 
  i did that back in high school . 
  by the way , my only outbound exchange trip was to netherlands  did n't notice much differences in between group discussions and night sessions . 
  several years later , i went solo traveling as well as living abroad for several months at a time . 
  holy fuck is n't europe diverse , let alone asia . 
  or we may be talking about different ways of diversity . 
  as i said above , everybody wants to have fun and better life . 
  but under the hood , the definition of these things seem to vary quite a bit . 
  as well as approach to them . 
  and just general day-to-day stuff . 
  food , language , emotions , common pastimes , family roles ... 
  each country has quite a specific character , how they live day-to-day , interact with other people . 
  even their common hobbies and how they spend time with their families . 
  all of them may want iphones and need more $ $ $ . 
  but the rest is quite a bit different . 
  from what i saw , there 's definitely a `` nation character '' in most countries . 
  sure , there 're always outliers . 
  but average briton is definitely very different from average fin who is very different from average italian . 
  european countries wrote those international treaties themselves . 
  it can be easily changed what is legal and what is not . 
  even wwi was n't caused by nationalism . 
  pre-wwi was very similar to what we have now . 
  big government and big corporations . 
  a lot of wwi `` warm up '' wars were caused by business interests and power struggle , rather than nationalism itself . 
  nationalism was definitely the cover issue to rally the public support . 
  but under the hood ... just like democracy/freedom / * - rights is the perfect cover these days . 
  why would any it people from ee go to greece ? 
  it super hot in ee already . 
  wages are soaring and , given cheap prices , quality of life is higher at home than abroad . 
  well , unless living in greece will get even cheaper than poland or romania . 
  i work in it in lithuania .

oh stop being such an oversensitive special snowflake . 
  surely you can handle a joke like that if you can handle a bearded lady . 
  baltic circle jerk my ass . 
  lithuania received exactly 0 points from latvia and estonia . 
  oh it was common once alright . 
  then . 
  yesterday my team won , sieg heil !, 
  and ~ 500 kebab kiosks ? 
  when was the last time christians were stoning and decapitating people `` in the name of jesus '' ? 
  you hate kaunas so much you mentioned it twice !, 
  i 'm baffled by the `` refugees  local poor '' priority . . 
  `` was n't custom to do this '' and '' being specifically instructed not to do this '' is very different imo . 
  too bad he looks like a certain character of the so-hated western culture . 
  humpty dumpty . 
  just pulling your prejudiced leg , buddy . 
  that 's racist . 
  seriously , you 've just accused some people of plotting murder without any proof and based solely on your prejudice . 
  far right extremists of uk at least do n't behead people . 
  far right extremists of isis on the other hand . . 
  and that 's the difference between us two . 
  could say the same words to the relatives of charlie hebdo victims ? 
  poleland - makes sense, 
  my imagination be damned ... 
  happy hunting !, 
  scientologists * are * cultists . 
  and you act with a * fervor * of a cultist , i never directly said you are one . 
  you are escalating this yourself , see ? 
  and yes , i am making this about you . 
  i find your actions creepy and with a personal agenda too , which makes you a hypocrite . 
  and i am calling you out on this . 
  now , as for posts about migration - this is a real problem nowadays , do n't try to censor or whitewash it . 
  bigotry ? 
  maybe . 
  but there 's no smoke without a fire . 
  as you said yourself :  still , when people see someone vandalizing their neighbourhood , they stop the destruction if they can or at least try to involve others to do so . 
  i 'm of course not the only user here who cares about this . 
  really , i 've only seen scientologists trying this hard to shoot down their critics in the internet . 
  do you do this ~ ~ witch ~ ~ sockpuppet hunt only on / r/europe or on other subs too ? 
  if you do this only on / r/europe and only patrolling the posts concerning asylum seekers , then you have your personal agenda too , it seems . 
  yeah , creating alts to push an agenda is creepy . 
  however , hunting such alts , as if it was your job , is equally creepy in my eyes . 
  it seems it gives you some kind of fulfillment . 
  i 've only seen cultists having such fervor . 
  just curious , because you take this stuff so serious . . to the point of rummaging in histories of your fellow redditors in order to scavenge any bit of information/comment that will serve you to put down a fellow redditor . 
  i find it creepy to be honest . 
  and harassing . 
   looking for sockpuppets is this your job or what ? 
  oh , do i smell dedovshchina ? 
  made them yesterday . . yummy . 
  will be having some in a couple of hours for lunch . 
  leftover cepelinai fried on a pan are just as good . 
  thanks , braliukas ... 
  pretty well ? 
  you call that a `` pretty well '' ?? 
  i 'd say that was the * best * way anyone could have handled . 
  seriously . 
  frau merkel shows that she is not weak to screw all of germany because of one persons tears , but in the same time , she shows that she is not an emotionless drone . 
  how would have other officials handled it ? 
  most would just sit in their chairs shrugging their shoulders `` meh , it 's not our fault you were born in that turbulent country '' . 
  and these are not the ones who are unhappy about the removal of those statues . 
  i hope . 
  what about consenting siblings ? 
  our whole nation has been asking themselves the same question for quite some time now ... 
  in the end , we just accepted it and incorporated into our daily usage of lithuanian language . 
  [ ` nuff said ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaxqrxrmxc4 ), 
  strength through unity !, 
  well , now i got ta see it !, 
  thanks !, 
  edit : yup , you were right ... 
  shut it !, 
  agreecement sounds better , imo, 
  and now i see tendencies of people realizing that kubilius did a pretty good job at handling the crisis , however unpopular the decisions were back then . 
  i see him returning to pm position during next election of seimas . 
  and what percent of your parents annual income is that ? 
  do greeks even know what a heating bill is ? 
  it alone can be anywhere between 50 to 400 eu a month ( min wage 285 eu ) . 
  and we got 6-8 months of that `` joy '' . 
  not only that . 
  the worst insult used to be '' \u043f\u0438\u0434\u043e\u0440 '' and it 's derivatives . 
  i used to be pretty homophobic myself . 
  then i grew up . 
  you will too , hopefully  please do not tarnish lithuania 's reputation any further , thank you . 
  enough internet for you today , mr. gra\u017eulis . 
  yup , guilty of being illegal , sorry . 
  totally unlike crimean republic or donetsk people 's republic , which are 100 % legit . 
  should n't have posted that , should n't have posted that ... 
  well , yes . 
  the number of western people killed by isis is insignificant compared to the number of other muslims they kill . 
  `` my religion allows to shoot ~ ~ people ~ ~ infidels that sleep on sunbeds '' more like, 
  motives ? 
  what do these refugees do during the day ? 
  ca n't imagine them doing any public work , so they have all their time to try to integrate . 
  so getting beaten instead of a greeting in return is possible just because of a simple miscalculation of the space between fingers ? 
  a wise person should not take offense if it is done by a clearly foreign person . 
  a noob question - how do you salute `` hi '' or wave `` bye '' then ? 
  actually , sometimes we drink coffee at night . 
  for example , at a birthday party , the birthday cake is often served around midnight and everyone is offered tea or coffee . 
  he might run for presidents ... * shudder *, 
   it 's what the person saying them means matters . 
  also , how the receiver of the words interprets them .

  4k , 120fps , 3d ( so two images for both eyes ) , and 360 degrees . 
  and as i said , just because we do n't really need it now it does n't mean we would n't find a way to use and create new products based on these speeds . 
  ill repost what i said to another dude . 
  now it 's not needed , but later it will be . 
  there 's no services that use this amount of data because no one reaches these speeds , but when it becomes common , there will be uses for that . 
  i bet 10 years ago people thought it would be crazy to go for speeds we have now , but new speed provides new services ( like 1080p ) . 
  just recently 60fps streaming become more common , there are 4k videos , 3d videos will be more common and common , 360 videos . 
  all of these require way more data than simple 30fps 1080p video . 
  now it 's not , but later it will be needed .

  maxima belongs to lithuanians . 
  we bad at sharks . 
  we good at lasers https://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/en/news/lithuania-leading-light-laser-technology, 
  housing is cheaper than in most of europe but everything else is actually very similar or even more expensive . 
  the difference is that we have extremely low quality food that is made for people with these small wages . 
  stuff like this doesnt even exist elsewhere . 
  if you get minimum you are pretty much fucked , if you get a bit more you can get by . 
  previous generation have houses left from soviet unioin ( they used to give houses for free ) , so they are somewhat ok , but young family that needs to rent apartment has a hard time . 
  lithuania numbah one !, 
  we no scandinavian , we balts , best suicide !, 
  this creates precedent of taking over baltic countries . 
  because there are places in these countries that have a lot of russians . 
  and russians try to change history books and argue that lithuania is not a real country and should have never existed . 
  if west suddenly accepts crimea argument , there 's nothing stopping them to use the same argument in baltics . 
  if majority of stockholm suddenly has more muslims than swedes , does it mean that stockholm can separate from sweden ? 
   and no , i do n't think people from smaller countries generally `` wonder what it 's like elsewhere '' , since we , too , have daily news broadcasts  but we are forced to use foreign entertainment , we learn about foreign culture and if you have any niche hobby english becomes essential to find sizeable community . 
  you did n't deserved potato jokes anyway . 
  lithuanians eat just potatoes prepared in different ways , but somehow you get all the potato jokes . 
  i 'm jelly . 
  writing this made me want some potatoes . 
  damn , not a goat pls . 
  thanks for info !, 
  this entire topic is super complicated , and propaganda ( from both sides ) does n't make it any easier . 
   which to eastern europe or american standards is pretty lax i guess buuut its what we do and you should treat them like other human beeings agreed . 
  if it 's the same as for anyone else , then no one has right to complain . 
  i definitely remember something about officials trying to hide rape cases committed by syrians though , and reddit circlejerking about it . 
  now that i think about it , i understood it as them being not accountable for rape and just being protected , while i guess they were punished by local law , and they just did n't wanted to make these cases public because they knew it will be blown over proportion . 
  yes ? 
  yeah , i 'm perfectly aware that you ca n't really know stuff just by headlines . 
  i try to not have strong opinions about things i do n't really know about , and if i do , i try to specify that it 's an uneducated opinion ( i said that i know it just from a headline , so my lack of knowledge on this is already implied ) . 
  except i was under impression that syrians were not held accountable for their crime , and no one wanted to make it public . 
  it 's not really about who makes more crimes . 
  again , most likely this is wrong , but that 's the impression i got from headlines and reddit comments . 
  i see . 
  i guess i was expecting a different reason , this pretend to be righteous stuff does n't look good . 
  thanks . 
  but that 's not believing in human rights , it 's just pretending to be . 
  also ignoring rapists in asylum is n't believing in human rights either ( i base this on headlines i saw ) . 
  is n't there a real reason ? 
  or that 's literally it ? 
   because europe believes in human rights . 
  [ ... ] you either watch them drown and betray everything europe stands for , or you rescue them . 
  but turkey does n't . 
  seeking help and relying on a country , which according to this article ( + a bunch of other well know issues ) , does n't believe in the very same human rights you based most of your argument on , seems weird . 
  thanks for answering though , i 'm definitely not educated enough on this so i try to keep myself from having strong opinions , and my questions might seem stupid . 
  can someone explain me why it is hard to have strong borders ourselves ? 
  since we have no borders between each other , it saves all of us ton of money , it would make sense if eu would fund the strengthening of borders in countries that border with non eu countries . 
  why is it a problem ? 
  if we can hope that turkey can have strong enough borders , why ca n't we have it ourselves ? 
  or it 's not as simple as throwing money into it to fix an issue ? 
  i do n't know english words to describe that disgusting taste . 
  story time : one of my friends have relatives in poland . 
  they come to visit him and as a gift they give him coffee . 
  and it was so gross , we actually thought they are some super cheap people . 
  but then when i visited poland you actually drink coffee like that everywhere , they were n't cheap , our tastes are just different . 
  crazy . 
  is there grudge though ? 
  i know there 's some tension between poles living in lt and lithuanians . 
  mostly about using polish letters in passports and occasional screaming `` our vilnius '' , but besides that everything is great . 
  poland is nice , i like it . 
  except for your disgusting coffee . 
  the fact that it took 5 years is already stupid . 
  4.1 million though ? 
  looks like something from 10 years ago . 
  zero mobile support . 
  terrible search . 
  no way to actually see who voted for what . 
  most of the new things are actually something that already existed in other official websites or are done poorly and do n't really improve anything . 
  there 's how old one looks : http://www3.lrs.lt/pls/inter/w2008_home.home?p_kalb_id=1 edit : i think i found why it 's so expensive http://tour.lrs.lt/ . 
  next level . 
  edit2 : [ i was made aware that 4.1 million is not just for website ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3tqm9f/updated_lithuanian_government_website_costs_41/cx8egbi ) , that money was used for network hardware . 
  somehow article i read did n't bother to mention it . 
  is it weird that they need to buy so much even though network must have already existed since we actually have other pretty good and big government systems ? 
  yes . 
  is it weird that they create functionality ( like writing petitions ) that already existed in other projects and were previously funded by other public funds ? 
  yes . 
  is it weird that these old , already created projects are actually better than newly created ? 
  yes . 
  is it weird that new website looks and functions like something very very old ? 
  yes . 
  but at least they done more than i was aware of . 
  so that 's something . 
  daaamn . 
  that looks scary, 
  i say `` oh my god '' when i have hard time pushing out a turd out of my ass . 
  im not religious though . 
  edit : and i 'm downvoted .

  karaliau\u010dius is k\u00f6nigsberg in our language . 
  dummy :d, 
  sadly they got break-away region for long time now . 
  just annex them already and all this bs would be over !!, 
   it was a ** noble republic ** actually . 
  how hard it 's to actually read ? 
  moldova is moldova , it was part of romania which ussr annexed , moldavian speak same language as romanians and i hope they both would unite again but there is too much problems economically on each other to make it happen and etc. 
  i do n't think either side would mind not being same country . 
   we allow the country georgia to exist usa - georgia - it was established in 1732 . 
  kingdom of georgia was a medieval monarchy established in 975 . 
  tell me more about it ... ? 
  well polish commonwealth was only used in later part of commonwealths existence because of how heavily our nobles got self-polonized . 
  so calling commonwealth more polish was n't wrong because it was dominating culture and language wise . 
  though today 's lithuania 's are who actually were called lithuania 's thousand years ago unlike macedonian 's who inherited land from hellenic 's . 
  for me not , it has a bit of tongue twist . 
  language wise , maybe , we have same ancestors , by dna/genes , we 're far closer to scandinavia and finno-ugrics than slavs . 
  that makes a bit of sense , but soviet would be more common since we got occupied and forced into them as lithuanian soviet republic . 
  your statement is actually stupid too . 
  well as much as greeks are butt hurt they 're not wrong . 
  erm ... what ? 
  i would assume former soviet republic of lithuania , but not polish lol, 
  at least we can into euromonies , debtish kebab !, 
   pohui rly ... why do i know this word very well, 
  just say `` gib wilno '' and you will see massive out-rage . 
  * checks flair * wait a minute . 
  because you 're a girl . 
   did n't mean anything wrong pls do n't judge me :(, 
  stop mocking our flag !, 
  ^ ^ ^ vytis ^ ^ ^ pls ^ ^ ^ come ^ ^ ^ back, 
  good luck with that . 
  shhhh , it 's all about usa . 
  usa is all that matters . 
  there is a thing called usa . 
  one person thoughts do n't show everyone 's opinion on this matter . 
  best of luck to you , catalans !, 
  do n't bother to respond to him , he 's well known obvious troll over fe sub-reddits . 
  last baltic prussian language existence ended in somewhere xviii century . 
  dont bother to respond , his acc is clearly created for trolling . 
  get out , you 're clearly trolling right now . 
  but we 're getting euromonies o.o, 
  duchy * we 're not weeddudes . 
  plus fuck commonwealth , union of k\u0117dainiai would been best day of my life !, 
  jk love you < 3, 
  i 'd like to join it if i can . 
  not surprised , but it 's a shame such things are happening . 
  you should learn more deep on why estonians do n't want any foreigners living in their country . 
   but the language associates you with eastern europe erm ... no . 
  the only thing e. europe brought to our language is their nice curse-words . 
  do n't ask , just enjoy . 
  this is nothing but waldemar tomaszewski plan to make polish and lithuanian relations as spicy as it can , i do n't see it as news as he always wants to bring up the most irrelevant thing between us to make us hate each other again for no bloody reason . 
  well our culture is definitely central european . 
  we 're similar to northern european too . 
  sadly we 're more seen as e. europeans because of su and commie block past . 
  you came from europe , never forget . 
  did you got butt hurted ? 
  or just salty a little bit ? 
  then so are you . 
  let 's all be soviet now . 
  not like they were wrong tho . 
  you 're so negative . 
  you can guess what you want , while we hope for the best . 
  you got ta be joking . 
  not only we 're ally for usa , they got troops here . 
  imagine shit-storm back home . 
  plus it would mean end to nato and usa hegemony . 
  well history tells us that w. europe becomes pretty irrelevant in moments of help . 
  they 're too weak compare to usa . 
  all i can say we have far more positive stuff about them than negative . 
   all russia, 
  rf denies many things .

  [ nokia 3220 ] ( http://www.mobile-review.com/review/image/nokia/3220/allcolor.jpg ) was part of my younger childhood , really brings up some memories of some mobile games . 
  got it around 2007 . 
  about phone - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nokia_3220, 
  do n't lie , i know that you burning all your food at the moment , especially those that came from amerikan-satellite-facist-neo-nazi-baltic-states . 
  your dumb ass politicians are with our gold , while you starve in street as every common russian . 
  who gives a shit about your tzar , here he 's nothing more than maggot who tried his best to russify non-russian parts and heavily failed at it . 
  as long as they keep our soil safe from russian invasion i 'm happy seeing them here . 
  i do n't have any other opinion on this matter . 
  that was a joke , relax . 
   local alliances are possible if you cared about sovereignty that 's why i thank god for nato . 
   and war is n't fought with numbers anymore . 
  because russia would lose it instantly so of course it wo n't play by old rules of war . 
   there is no threat to the baltics because we 're in eu and nato , it deterrents all that threat . 
  ukraine was n't in eu and nato , look how much of good came out of it . 
   the only threat posed is towards the russian minority because of all this fear mongering . 
  nobody is fucking fear warmongering russian minority here , they live happy lives as any other citizen of our country , hell i have russian neighbours and they live perfectly good . 
   just like you could n't care less about your country . 
  i do care about my country , plus at least we have president who cares , not putin who sent innocent russians to fight for his money  no wonder you need someone else to defend it . 
  3 mil vs 100 ~ mil , ofc we need help . 
  i thought you were n't so retarded when it came to math . 
  yeah given and ultimatum to let su have bases in our countries or invaded and annihilated from european ground , so faking welcomed you here that we greeted nazis with flowers after first year of su occupation . 
  what 's wrong with those ? 
  i could n't care less about it . 
  you do know soviets actually tried to deny rest of occupied territories national identity and create their own soviet identity with russian language being primary ? 
   but then so should the kaliningrad oblast probably be . 
  well kaliningrad is not aligned with eu/nato or west in general and does n't have observer status in nordic council or history with rest of northern europe . 
  and for us you will be mini-america :\\ ^ ), 
  still something . 
  stop feeding that terrible troll , brother .

  engines are renault . 
  interiors are pretty much older renault . 
  ( http://images.parkers.bauercdn.com/pagefiles/199202/main-interior/renault-clio-231009 - ( 40 ) . jpg https://i.ytimg.com/vi/cehejmjpe7i/maxresdefault.jpg ) parts that are hidden actually have renault badges on them . 
  they are assembled by dacia . 
  and then dacias are even called renault in some markets . 
   as it increases the risk of developing cancer , and young children are the most vulnerable . 
  which one is it  as of 2016 it is still not clear whether acrylamide consumption affects people 's risk of developing cancer . 
  estonia , hahaha . 
  it 's not so bad on a diet either . 
  the 400g ones have like 600 kcal , nothing insane . 
  ca n't blame the guy for writting his titles like that , it works . 
  his old videos have normal titles and obviously not nearly as many views . 
  like he said , native ads also users that visit share content , even if they themselves do n't see ads . 
  you still have to make it . 
  so like i said you want lidl to sell a prepackaged you in the store ? 
  also i doubt you can make food for 4 days for 3-4 euros . 
  did n't know italy was that cheap . 
  it 's fucking premade food . 
  you want lidl to sell a vacuum sealed italian and ingriedients for people who want to buy cheap lunch ? 
  it 's lasagne , it 's premade lasagne , but it 's still lasagne . 
  so it 's lasagne for everyone else in the world except italians . 
  i 'm fine with that . 
  if the grapes are fermented and safe to drink then it 's wine . 
  what ? 
  it 's pasta sandwiched by a meat sauce and topped with cheese . 
  i 'm not saying it 's good , but it does fit the definition of lasagne . 
  how is it not lasagne ? 
  poor is not poverty . 
  poverty is when you lack basic needs . 
   no they 're not strange , going to poland saves people money , that 's logical . 
  i does n't . 
  unless they have free transport and their time is also free . 
   lithuania is not ahead , open your eyes . 
  not ahead in terms of what ? 
   acceptable level is when working people can take care of their children pay for housing and have enough to eat . 
  if simply put - no reason to emigrate . 
  so it 's acceptable now . 
   estonia ? 
  lithuania ca n't beat estonia , they 're too far away already . 
  far away from what . 
  according to imf we are ahead and going to get further ahead . 
   while poland has higher salaries lithuanians go there for shopping . 
  it only shows how bad situation in lithuania is . 
  yes . 
  lithuanians are strange , they would rather spend more money and give it to poles too . 
   reach at least an acceptable level . 
  what is that ? 
  economics is the only thing that can change without a new generation growing up . 
  or two . 
  people were leaving from 1991 to today and it has n't changed . 
  and it 's never going to . 
  not in at least 20 years . 
   what countries with similar economies ? 
  romania , latvia ... and that 's all i think . 
  poland , portugal , hungary , estonia , slovenia , slovakia , greece . 
  romania is way behind still , with croatia . 
  helpful graph , was just posted on this sub http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/file:volume_indices_of_gdp_and_aic_per_capita,_2015_ ( eu-28 % 3d100 ) _ december.png also you ca n't beat poland in raw numbers , not sure how you would do percentages on emigration . 
  there is no actual `` problem '' . 
  lithuania is doing better than ever and it 's still improving every day . 
  poverty problems are n't worse than in similar economies , neither is emigration . 
  people will always leave in hopes for better life . 
  that 's not going to change by whining . 
  yeah , but it 's not 2x . 
  and for groceries it does n't really matter since all of eu has similar prices . 
  what you 're describing just does n't exist . 
  but then you think all of lithuania lives in poverty . 
  well i was talking about poverty because some guy explained that everyone in lithuania is starving and wearing clothes that were passed down for generations . 
  i do n't know why you even started with doctors . 
   sweeping floors in other countries buys them houses/apartments and cars so it 's a clever decision going there . 
  dreamworld . 
  so you 're suggesting they actually do lie about how much they make and hide it from the world . 
  so you 're suggesting poland and estonia are both lying about their wages and pay way more than they say they do . 
  estonians make 30-40 % more than we do . 
  and they pay more than we do . 
   then why there are jobs which pay minimum wage in major cities ? 
  for students or people who have no skills while they are getting them . 
  if employers could n't get people for minimal wage they would increase the wages . 
   besides there are only major cities left . 
  living in a small city you 're doomed to work for minimum wage and have no hope to improve . 
  so again no logic . 
  have you been outside of vilnius , ever ? 
   but do n't worry , people have a solution - evacuation . 
  sure . 
  to rural cities or sweeping the same floors in other countries . 
  why are you comparing sweden to lithuania all of a sudden ? 
  sweden is rich . 
  actually rich . 
  compared to the world rich . 
  it 's not like lithuanian economy is going to fucking grow 400 % overnight . 
   there are louds of people with university degrees yeah , i said skills or qualifications . 
  shitty degree does n't bring in money . 
  we have a lot of `` managers '' . 
  correct . 
  doctors and teachers are getting a little fucked . 
  but they are n't in poverty . 
  doctor wages are going up quite fast though and steady . 
  http://www.santa.lt/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=868&amp;itemid=439 teachers not so much . 
  that 's not how poverty works . 
  you eat , you have a roof , probably a car and you 're healthy . 
  that 's not poverty .

   `` we wo n't be signing [ on this visit ] , '' said mao zefeng , spokesman for petrochina . 
  `` at the moment the import price and the domestic price are inverted . 
  we are already losing money on imported gas , and we ca n't lose more . ''  earlier this week , anatoly yanovsky , russia 's deputy energy minister , was quoted by russian state-controlled media as saying the deal was `` 98 per cent ready '' . 
   in the wake of russia 's aggressive actions in ukraine , european countries have been rethinking their dependence on russian gas . 
   if the deal had gone ahead , it would have been a powerful sign of russia 's ability to reduce its reliance on europe , the largest importer of russian energy . 
   even without the deal , mr putin 's visit has been filled with symbolic appearances intended to show the growing strength of the relationship , which both sides have described as the best in their history . 
  `` we wo n't be signing . 
  at the moment the import price and the domestic price are inverted . 
  we are already losing money on imported gas , and we ca n't lose more ''  - mao zefeng , petrochina  discussions over the gas deal have gone on for more than 10 years , with negotiations snagging over price , the pipeline route and chinese stakes in russian projects . 
   the chinese side would have driven a harder bargain in light of gazprom 's weaker position , industry sources in beijing said . 
   china formally signed previously agreed lng supply deals as well as a massive coal co-operation project , so the russian leader will not leave empty-handed . 
   since negotiations began with gazprom a decade ago , china has diversified its sources for imported natural gas . 
  it buys piped gas from central asia and is constructing a number of lng terminals to import from projects around the world . 
   mr putin 's decision in 2013 to end gazprom 's monopoly on gas exports has also benefited chinese oil companies , which have signed deals to invest in and import gas from novatek 's yamal lng project . 
  that means russia can still profit from gas sales to china , while removing some of the political drivers for gazprom 's long-delayed deal with cnpc . 
  on this day i am proud of my countrymen . 
  innovative , forward looking people . 
  therefore it is important that there are american troops on the ground . 
  in case of conflict , when ( not if , because that would be inevitable in a conflict like that ) a single american soldier would be killed , imagine the pr storm that would face an inactive president , or congress . 
  just imagine the public 's reaction to a headline like `` russians are killing our boys in the baltics !, 
  president does nothing . '', 
  and yet people still feel nostalgia for this period , and want it imposed not only on themselves , but on other countries too . 
  i would pay good money for both . 
  i will riiiiiiiiise like penis !!, 
   when you see georgian/russian/armenian priests rallying to attack lgbt marchers , you criticise just those priests , even though they operate in a country where their word becomes the civil law , and they are pandered to by politicians . 
  catholic and protestant priests do that as well , and in some countries they are pandered to ( abortion bans in in malta , ireland and poland ) , hell even the anti-lgbt nutjobs in lithuania . 
  i am not saying that is good , or that it should be tolerated . 
  but humans are mostly tribal . 
  most things happen on a us/them basis . 
  and muslims form most people still probably represent `` them '' . 
  and christians , even though radical and nutty are still `` us '' . 
  frankly i would n't mind turkey entering eu . 
  for a small country , which is not a target for most immigrants it could only mean a bigger market . 
  and that is always good . 
  politics in most part are based on hypocrisy and force , therefore i tend to stay as far away from it as possible . 
  nobody criticizes orthodox christians because of their beliefs . 
  nobody criticizes greeks , bulgarians , ukrainians , moldavian , cypriots for being orthodox . 
  even with the russians problems only arise when they are getting imperialistic ambitions up . 
  now if we would be seeing decapitation videos where some orthodox guy would be saying that the patriarch approves killing all infidels , thing might change . 
  anyways g8 b8 m8 , i r8 8/8 and w8 for deb8 . 
  do n't want to sound bigoted or something , but i think main the issue here is that turkey is muslim , georgia - christian . 
  and the population of turkey is 76 million , while georgia - only 5 mil . 
  if accepted , turkey would become the second most populous country in eu . 
  i think fears about culture and immigration play a more significant part here than geography or even economy . 
  basically georgia 's entering the eu would not have significant consequences , while the consequences of turkey joining would be huge . 
  i was only referring to the slightly lower unemployment rate in estonia . 
  but obviously , estonia is one of the fastest growing economies in eu at the moment , with a strong culture of startups and innovation so it has a lot of potential . 
  estonia better than nordics !, 
  now they will want in to estonia . 
  and not just for viin . 
  three kinds of junkfood are popular in lithuania : 1 . 
  the ever popular kebab . 
  the regional variety usualy comes wraped in lavash bread and drenched in garlic sauce . 
  the word doner is almost never used , so i 'm not sure what would be it 's proper place in the kebab family tree . 
  pork is often used so it would probably just be a local mongrel variety . 
  kibinai . 
  a traditional pastry usualy made by karaite people , which were imported by our grand duke vytautas somewhere in the 14 th century . 
  some time ago you could only get good kibinai in trakai , where real karaites used to live , but now they are everywhere . 
  also traditional kibinai should be made with mutton , but of course the most popular variety is filled with pork . 
  although many experimental varietys have been showing up lately ( including nuttela , spinach , cottage cheese and dried tomato filled ones ) . 
  a hangover of the soviet times , it is a big deep fried pastry that is filled with pork and onions . 
  very greasy , and usualy overloads sensitive people 's stomachs and arteries , so they are becomming less common . 
  tl ; dr pork in bread . 
  jap , my parents said that they have encountered the `` govori pa \u010delove\u010desskom jazikom '' people in their youth . 
  i would punch anyone in the face if they said that to me . 
  no matter how old or frail they could be . 
  a funny thing though : one of my professors from said that when he moved in to vilnius , in the 40-ties the owner of the apartment , the owner of it , an old polish dame , said a different version of this : `` m\u00f3wi j\u0119zykiem arystokratycznem '' . 
  speak the aristocrat 's language - polish . 
  cheap booze mostly . 
  you just cant hate a place where you get good service and cheep booze . 
  it 's like beer goggles of country improvement . 
  sometimes after a good bottle of red wine i can imagine that the meadow outside my window turns in to the green alpine pastures of french switzerland , or after a good beer that the dank bar/cellar in vilnius is somewhere in germany or belgium . 
  on a more serious note latvija and eesti always felt more nordic to me than lithuania . 
  i think that the defining characteristic is that both of the countries have a strong influence from german/scandinavian cultures . 
  for example klaip\u0117da , the third largest city in lithuania , was a part of prussia up to 1923 , and the city feels much more scandinavian and even western then the rest of the country . 
  the `` spirit '' of the city is much more similar to both riga and tallinn . 
  also while latvia and estonia are protestant just like the nordics , lithuania is staunchly catholic and it 's very clearly pronounced in the architecture . 
  therefore to me krakow , lublin or even prague feels closer to home than riga or tallin . 
  sorry for the downvotes , they are unnecessary . 
  it just seems that there is a stupid dick measuring contest between europe and usa . 
  usa is probably still considered to be the standard to which most countries aspire to ( at least the developing ones ) . 
  on a side note , a relevant post from today shows that at least this year people mostly talked about russia not usa . 
  lemmie guess , it will never be used to prosecute `` terrorists '' and will be used to harass people for ip violations ? 
  and all of that to get foreign currency , so the dear leader could get his fix of hennessy . 
  i was not talking about this particular case . 
  i just wanted to agree that the list of rules and exceptions gets thicker and thicker every day . 
  sometimes it happens for good reasons , sometimes for bad reasons . 
  and it really does not matter if that is done on an eu wide level , or in state level . 
  the sphere where you can just do what you want , as long as you are not harming anybody is decreasing , and i find that very sad . 
  every sphere of your life is becoming subject to somebody 's else decisions . 
  it is becoming impossible to just be left alone . 
  do n't you just find that frightening ? 
  oh yeah it figures you have been in vilnius if you 've been in lithuania before  you can also check out organized beer tours if you are interested . 
  http://www.alutis.lt/f5ees7.php?fxxf=english i 've heard that they are really good , but they are a bit pricey for us locals . 
  bend over backwards and take it . 
  and afterwards thank the politicians for their wisdom in protecting us from ourselves . 
  or get a government job and become part of the problem ( govt jobs are the most sought after by young people in most eu countries ) . 
  as an ancap living in eu i sometimes feel that the only way i could live more or less free is to get a farm in some far corner of my country and become a hermit . 
  or cut it with the legal system and go all gray market ( due to overregulation and overtaxation about 35 % of lithuania 's gdp is in the shadow economy ) . 
  oh about that farm ...

  umm ... why are you saying that ? 
  phoenicians who got arabized . 
  also somewhat secular then some neighbours . 
  well indeed , i 'm not ruling out teachers work . 
  i 've heard of the channel but did not looked into it , i think it focuses on word war i , yes ? 
  i 'm more of a medievalist . 
  well , indeed , i 'm hoping to turn it into career , that be said i will need to see how good i 'm + possibly study a bit more , get higher degree . 
  not fully sure , i mean i could always become teacher but ehh ... rather would work in museum ... 
  i mean studying history is not a career path . 
  history . 
  sexy, 
  ahh , they will be fine , kids are interested in their ( or other peoples ) bodies . 
  but north never forgibs, 
  your history . 
  police , i 'm not surprised , army is more interesting though . 
  awesome . 
  south shall rise again ? 
  you look into our history just from 15th -16 th century , and onwards , when we were in close relation with poland ... then of course lithuanian language was in decline . 
  but to understand it you have to understand situation . 
  we were late with whole christianity thing , with meant that lithuanian language was only oral language , until first writings showed up in 16-17 centuries . 
  so indeed for long administrative texts were written at first in old church slavonic , then polish , latin , maybe some german . 
  that be said , our pagan and some of the later christian monarchs and nobles did talk in lithuanian , among other languages , it was 17 century when nobility became very polonized . 
  and no , lithuanian was not spoken in just zemaitija , you can look it up in wikipedia , old lithuanian written language did not have standard and was different in parts of lithuania , you had on in sammogitia , aukstaitija ( were i 'm from ) and suvalkija ( which was the one dialect that is closest to modern lithuanian language , why ? 
  because serfdom was abolished first there , which meant that our intelligentsia , linguists authors rose from that part of lithuania ) . 
  also , small note on nobility . 
  for example , a lot of english nobility , some kings , spoke french , i believe king richard the lion heart even lived more in france then in england . 
  so would you say he is not important for history of england ( does not mean he is not important to france either ) ? 
  you have to realize that for nobles , and for people in general at the time , nationality was not necessary most important thing . 
  people often care more about their social status ( nobles tended to nobles , merchants craftsmen joined guilds ( corporations of the time ) , and religion or your liege ( feudal relationship ) was even more important , but of course it maybe hard for modern man to understand this . 
  well , it 's not like there are butt load of jews in germany anyway . 
   tories will be in power well that maybe good for lithuania on political stand point of view , but what about uk internal politics ? 
  you just pissed off one of our mods ... ahh , that 's fine . 
  indeed , i always see transhumanist , progressive ( in a science sense ) , and similar parties but they do n't get much votes . 
  well i suppose green parties sometimes offer good things , but in lithuania they are more focused on rural areas , farmers , not sure how it is with them in uk . 
  reading a bit of his political views ... ehhh ... why are socialists obsessed with feminism ? 
  if they support such things instead of supporting true progress ( medicine , technology , space exploration , environment protection ) they will never get my vote . 
  ahh then maybe . 
  i 'm not too familiar on british politics . 
  i just tend to look form lithuanias political point of view , as in `` which of the wankers would be most helpful if eastern neighbour starts barging in '' . 
  no no no pls . 
  he wants out of nato and so on , just pls no . 
  well it 's not like i treat them like this ( me personally ) hell i might be persuaded for bilingual signs , or passports , thing is though lithuanians have that fear of letting minorities or just other nationalities get upper hand ( we do n't want repeat of when historical capital is dominated by foreigners ) , also some people fear the russians would ask more rights , give pretext for russia , though personally i do n't think so . 
  and in general we have thing backwards , people could get those signs and passports , but at the same time they should be encouraged to learn lithuanian , and should not get preferential treatment during exams ( pet pew of a student , i know ) . 
  indeed , fuck the wanker . 
  key word there is `` was '' . 
  i mean if you think that enemies carry over trough history , or that i hate poles then you are mistaken . 
  i mean poland and lithuania fought before , become allies , fought again , and now we are allies . 
  and it 's for the best it would stay that way , because i 'm against changes of borders or wars in europe . 
  though russia is making short work of it . 
  heh , if you think that non communist will say something good about him then you are mistaken . 
  we just wash our hands off , i mean while soviets had us by the balls , smetona still agreed to take vilnius in 1940 , make best of the worst situation , while surrounded by two aggressive enemies . 
  well , poland was kind of our enemy too at the time , in a sense that our goals differed . 
  i mean it 's politics , we should not sweat over historical politics . 
  it 's not like we were alone . 
  indeed , that 's why arms had to do speaking instead of diplomats . 
   well , bolsheviks wanted to make relations between poland and lithuania as worse as possible so of course they did it . 
  they have lost their war with us though , so any deal they could possibly offer you was groundless . 
  not exactly , it was groundless in a sense that poland could not give a shit what bolsheviks but we could also not give a shit what poland thought either , since we wrote peace treaty with them earlier . 
   end exactly this kind of thinking is why we ca n't have nice things . 
  you considered areas where you were a minority ( and a really small one , i 'd add ) an `` ethnic part '' of your country , and threw a big tantrum when other countries called on this bullshit . 
  irony on it 's best poland . 
  also what other countries objected besides poland , your allies french aaaaand ? 
  and it 's not like those places were polonized long ago , and it 's not like there were good chunk of lithuanians there , and it 's not like it was historical/ethnic border ... 
   you ca n't eat your cake and have it too . 
  i think we did . 
  30 per cent of poles in malaty ( mol\u0117tai ) ? 
  : ddddddd riiiight . 
  it 's like 3 tops these days . 
  nah i do n't trust this map , at least for portions of it ( area around vilnius is right to some extant but it also took number of polonized lithuanians so , and besides they lithuania would not have accepted the deal because simply bolshevik piece deal offered bigger tracts of land ( like grodno ) that were considered ethnic part of lithuania , even if poles or belarusians made up majority . 
  they congregate in bbc world news ( that 's the only bbc thing i can watch ) ? 
  when you watch bbc , a dick you see . 
  bb = bybys + dick , c = see . 
  ok enough if immature jokes . 
  you fell for her or something , 
  that 's from short time tactical view point , but was n't the whole intermarrium thing an idea for recreation of commonwealth ? 
  i thought it was one of main point where poles and lithuanians disagreed . 
  i mean poland wanted lithuania ( sure vilnius was polish at the time but good chunk of lithuania was not ) while lithuanias wanted country based on ethnic borders and not in union or federation or whatever , i mean if we did we could have joined up with belarus ( if they were not integrated into soviet union so fast ) , and restored gdl ( essentially ) btw i 'm interested in whole intermarium thing . 
  i can sympathize with poles over it , in fact . 
  if you have her ? 
  probably not . 
  because we suck ... really , never take too much of immigrants in , take just enough , just the amount you need . 
  good looking ?? 
  what about her ? 
  more like successful reclamation ( also some of them were polonized lithuanians , so not only we reclaimed our region , but we also send genetic mix of balts and poles to western poland ) ;p i 'm sure zeligowski felt good taking back lands of `` poland '' ;p :d, 
  true enough , but that just shows that people did notice differences in culture , regions history , so they did call themselves appropriately , even if they spoke polish , and most peasants certainly did not . 
   republic of lithuania speak lithuanian . 
  you know where gdl originates form - baltic lands ( where mindaugas was crowned and so on ) , you know what language they spoke - lithuanian , ( those who could write did so in old slavic chruch language ) , you know what was majority of population when gediminas ruled - lithuanian , and vytautas - split between russian and lithuanian . 
  so yeah , lithuanian language was language of gdl, 
   you should definitely consider there are people for and against that . 
  i feel it 's subjective really . 
  that be said , i 'm ok with that , but genetically speaking they are fairly baltic . 
  maybe , maybe not , but i 'm not the one making shot , and there is not such thing as universal `` deserve '' anyways , but that is different topic . 
  maybe if i was dictator of lithuania i could give them right , so polish peeps , put me in power . 
   by that line of thinking , lithuanian declaration of independence was also illegal . 
  for soviet union , it was . 
  i mean some countries have laws regarding territorial integrity , federation and so on . 
  he called himself lithuanian sometimes . 
  that is fact , and not unique to him . 
  and ponas tadas is translation , so i do n't see your problem . 
  i mean should i call myself tadeusz too , since i 'm tadas :d , or maybe original hebrew version :d ;p,

  literally . 
  gdp did n't fall that much because of sanctions , oil crashed . 
  russia gdp 2014 - 2030 , 2016 - 1326 belarus 2014 - 76 , 2016 - 54 ukraine 2014 - 131 , 2016 - 90 latvia gdp 2014 - 31 , 2016 - 27 dunno about that german brain drain , but i think you 're still better off . 
  yes actually , they are amazing improvements when you look at ukraine , belarus or russia in comparison . 
  everyone is agnostic when it comes to religion , the ones who claim not to be are delusional . 
  that 's why agnostic alone does n't tell us anything . 
  why is there porn on russian facebook ? 
  but that 's also banned i think . 
  literally shitting in their own yard . 
  okay atleast the road quality is 5 , that 's adequate . 
  `` alcohol is bad for you '' that would n't even be that much of a lie . 
  you do n't have that either . 
  probably not seen as a terrible career choice in the society . 
  lithuanian prince became a king of poland and had to change his name and speak polish , embrace polish culture and encourage others to do the same . 
  yep , that 's multi-cultural right there . 
   the lithuanian grand duke jogaila was offered the polish crown and became w\u0142adys\u0142aw ii jagie\u0142\u0142o ( reigned 1386 -- 1434 ) . 
  this marked the beginning of the gradual , voluntary polonization of the lithuanian nobility . 
  jagie\u0142\u0142o built many churches in pagan lithuanian land and provided them generously with estates , gave out the lands and positions to the catholics , settled the cities and villages and granted the biggest cities and towns magdeburg rights . 
  the ruthenian nobility was also freed from many payment obligations and their rights were equalized with those of the polish nobility . 
  [ again , same paragraph you did n't read . 
  ] ( http://image.prntscr.com/image/f6015247b3b54fee871851f9f62fd9a1.png ) this is being brought up as an issue not as a great thing . 
  being a pole you 're also very educated on current stance of poland when it comes to multi-culturalism , very supportive . 
  i never said people were being treated badly . 
  not once . 
  i said you were a peasant , because only peasants spoke lithuanian . 
  i do n't know how peasants were treated . 
  also that 's not a successful multi-cultural society if one group is severely disadvantaged and excluded . 
  and denmark . 
  lies ? 
  your argument was that commonwealth was multicultural , i showed you that it was n't . 
  it was either polish or excluded from culture . 
  and then you ran away . 
  yeah , nobility all spoke polish , peasants spoke lithuanian , surely it 's just because of convenience . 
  how obnoxious can you get . 
  but hey , this is the internet , you do n't have to act like a normal human being . 
  have a shitty day . 
  this is not science , this is reddit . 
  [ but there you go . 
  wiki is not the source , it 's just a simplified summary from other sources , which are at the bottom of the wiki . 
  i 'm not up for debates with people who deny history , especially as your flair says polish , should already know these things . 
  i can read , you can read , but you have no comprehension , the shunning was implied . 
   such a view is widely considered applicable to the times of the polish-lithuanian commonwealth ( 1569 -- 1795 ) when the ruthenian and lithuanian upper classes were drawn towards the more westernized polish culture and ** the political and financial benefits of such a transition , as well as , sometimes , by the administrative pressure exerted on their own cultural institutions , primarily the orthodox church . 
  ** but then again you would rather ignore the evidence to support your argument with none . 
  very strong position . 
  never said it is n't . 
  i just said it has n't worked yet . 
  me personally i do n't really like the idea of trying to make it work since that does n't seem to do any good either . 
  top quality denial . 
   polonization can be seen as an example of cultural assimilation . 
  such a view is widely considered applicable to the times of the polish-lithuanian commonwealth ( 1569 -- 1795 ) when the ruthenian and lithuanian upper classes were drawn towards the more westernized polish culture and the political and financial benefits of such a transition , as well as , sometimes , by the administrative pressure exerted on their own cultural institutions , primarily the orthodox church . 
  the conversion to the roman catholic ( and to a lesser extent , protestant ) faith was often the single most important part of the process . 
  for ruthenians of that time , being polish culturally and roman catholic by religion was almost the same . 
  this aspect of polonization that led to the diminishing of the orthodox church was the part that was most resented by the belarusian and ukrainian masses . 
  in contrast the lithuanians , who were mostly catholic , were in danger of losing their cultural identity as a nation , but that did not become evident for the wide masses of lithuanians until the lithuanian national renaissance in the middle of the 19th century . 
  persecution ? 
  who said that was the case . 
  i said you spoke polish or you were seen as a peasant , which is exactly what is described there . 
  no one jailed you for being peasant . 
  however nobility does n't fancy being seen as peasants so they assimilated , which is the opposite of multi-cultural . 
  yeah , so , nothing . 
  great job . 
  you did it , changed the world . 
  yeah there was no multiculturalism in commonwealth , you were either going full pole or full peasant . 
  speaking lithuanian was seen as low . 
  actually history has all the answers , multi-culturalism has n't worked yet . 
  if it starts it will make the news . 
  western porn propaganda wo n't penetrate russian walls now . 
  well there is another factor , fossil fuel is going to run out eventually . 
  farming fuel is closer to carbon neutral than digging up old stuff and burning it . 
  but yes , i understand your point . 
  we can do hybrids with ethanol and as batteries/engines improve the litres per km will be tiny . 
  might be possible to farm the fuel instead of burning oil . 
   is there any law that protects you by not getting fired by using you paid vacation days ? 
  you have to use the days . 
  not using them is risky for the employer . 
  of course you rarely get to choose when to use paid vacation , you can take unpaid vacation with little reasoning though . 
   do you have to have a certain amount of seniority on your job ? 
  only really matters in some fields . 
  for example , my dad is a driver for a milk production company so since cows produce way more milk during summer there is almost no way he gets vacation during summer , no problem getting vacation days in the fall or winter though . 
   ( i do n't know if part-time exist in europe ) whats the deal if you have a part-time job ? 
  do you get half of paid vacation leave ? 
  part time job does not reduce the days of vacation at least in lithuania . 
  no i only had them like twice . 
  oh , did n't know you could buy peanut butter cups in europe , probably the only good usa sweet . 
  guess no one asked him . 
  but then it 's most likely meaning seven since all other 6 days are just numbers and he wrote them as such as well . 
  would be strange if one day is somehow different . 
  it 's because they do n't plan , they just do it . 
  who even does that . 
  if you say it many times over it sounds like sek again anyway . 
  yes . 
  it 's because sepmadienis makes no sense . 
  the word sekmadienis was actually made by jonas jablonskis when lithuanian language was being standardized . 
  yeah , but it would n't make any sense if that was broadband or fiber . 
  is that mobile data ? 
  4 harbor boats , 4 patrol , 4 mine countermeasures . 
  it 's not percentages , netherlands are small . 
  of course we have ships . 
  12 to be exact . 
  cool .

dude . 
  you failed to mention that all comments in lithuanian mass media are worse than youtube + / pol / . 
  anyone who reads those and expects a reasonable discussion is just delusional . 
  it seems like they consist solely of low iq individuals , latvi\u0173 street employees and / or bored trolls . 
  why not both ? 
  how unfortunate for him / s, 
  atleast rutracker will probably stay forever . 
  well , maybe you 're right . 
  in lithuania we use our version ( karaliau\u010dius ) all the time too . 
  because it would be the same as calling kionigsberg twankste a hundred years ago . 
  it 's just not the same place . 
  maybe they were from central asia ( kazakhstan , etc. 
  very resolution , such a glorious flag placement, 
  have you ever been to poland ? 
  why not both ? 
  are they undercover pagan balts ? 
  just seen another account suspended . 
  this time it was / rusembassynot  edit : damn , / sovietsergey ( lavrov ) was also suspended recently . 
  what a shame, 
  yeah ? 
  no , dude , the whole of us does not live in iraq . 
  the u.k. really does stand out, 
  this submission seems to be rapidly downvoted into oblivion . 
  edit : or at least it fluctuates between 2 to 5 upvotes every five seconds . 
  i was away from reddit for about a year but i do n't think this is very common . 
  because ethnic cleansing . 
  the first one is not a village . 
  at the time of construction that was really the suburb of vilnius - \u017dv\u0117rynas . 
  '' \u017dv\u0117rynas ( literally the menagerie ) '' as told by wikipedia was hunting grounds for radvila/radziwi \u0142\u0142 family . 
  edit : [ here it is ] ( https://www.google.lt/maps/@54.6936336,25.244671,3a,75y,95.35h,79.83t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1s0rds6v8plzcbc3frf_b9lq!2e0!7i13312!8i6656 ), 
  so why do n't use german names in konigsberg ? 
  apparently gervyaty is a lithuanian town . 
  well more like it was not so long ago , but not really anymore as in 1996 only 1/3 were lithuanian and the number in the whole region is decreasing rapidly . 
  i am happy and sad at the same time as that church is really awesome . 
  sorry for being late to the thread . 
  highly improbable . 
  russian is still quite a common language ( more common than german ) and there is really no negative association with the language itself . 
  it 's all dead now . 
  but what you said just reinforces my point : it diverged recently enough , if even classic ( 19th-18th century ? ), 
  slavic literature helps with mutual intelligibility . 
  it means the language was even closer 1000 years ago . 
   i can easily understand like 80-90 % of written polish damn . 
  i can understand only about 50-40 % of written latvian and about 5-0 % when spoken ... 
  it kinda amazes me , how relatively young are slavic languages . 
  this castle is not in poland or kaliningrad . 
  it 's really in france . 
  their gdp was n't that much stronger even without the sanctions . 
  thank you . 
  could somebody tell what car is in 11 picture ? 
  you must be really fun at parties . 
  you know , it makes you sound like a retard too when you assume that i read , or take seriously delfi articles on russia . 
  when you attack me and imply i 'm * `` i 'm mad at russia therefore everyone has to be mad at them '' * over a sarcastic joke based on land and nation gobbling country that makes you sound like a very insecure retard . 
  and finally , the tv , radio channels and schools ( and even official languages ) does n't mean that russia is friendly or accommodating to minorities . 
  it only means that russia is living in the 21st century . 
  but at the end of the day , these nations are forbidden from going their own way . 
  oh , i must confess i do not have any solid arguments at hand and am too lazy to look them up . 
  although if it looks like a duck , swims like a duck , and quacks like a duck , then it probably is a duck . 
  i remember seeing something about russian majority elected governor suppressing the culture of chuvash or bashkirs , but again , i care too little and am too lazy to look it up . 
  sorry if i inflamed your enthusiasm for discussion . 
  that was n't my intention . 
  i 'm not particularly mad at russia , i just wanted to make a point that russian state is not very accommodating to it 's minorities ( of any kind ) . 
  a big friendly brotherhood and a real human bean . 
  190 is n't enough so they 'll adopt more and spread the great message of multiculti . 
  excludes : [ 160,000 , or about 7 % of the total population . 
  at the beginning of the war , some 12,000 jewish refugees fled into lithuania from poland ; by 1941 the jewish population of lithuania had swelled to approximately 250,000 , or 10 % of the total population . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lithuanian_jews#lithuanian_jews_in_the_second_world_war ) * * because of vilnius, 
  maybe he meant writing systems . 
  it 's some kind of a moderately light bulb . 
  hmm , interesting . 
  i am now curious about the common origins of post soviet store planning . 
  as i 've written before , in general i agree that saying `` lithuania has nothing in common with russia '' is untrue . 
  however i believe that saying `` both lithuania and russia have more in common with soviet union than with each other '' would be closer to the truth . 
  of course , the modern russian state is the legal heir of su which russia dominated , but our nations chose very different paths ~ ~ in modern times ~ ~ everytime the choice came up ( unless it was forced ) . 
  we have very different identity ( despite * some * russophilic tendencies ) and we like to highlight that . 
   slavic and baltic languages are often unified into the same group i believe that 's untrue . 
  more closely unified in * origins * than other indo-european languages , but not unified into the same group . 
  baltic is simply different : conservative and very stable geographically for a long time versus relatively young and very expansive slavic . 
  it is hypothesized they were separate for at least a millennia before they again came in contact when slavic speaking people expanded into what nowadays is belarus and russia . 
  tl ; dr - in general , i agree . 
  while i completely disagree with a / u/pm _ me_your_ladyboys view , i can not agree with you too . 
   share russian kaliningrad and belarus well the one thing that i 'm quite sure about most lithuanians , is that we do not think of kaliningrad as really `` russian '' . 
  sure , it 's great past now lays in ruins and commieblocks grow like a forest in a swamp of bad roads , but it 's still * feels * like pr\u016bsija . 
  both baltic and germanic past of karaliau\u010dius ( like we still officially call it ) is very closely intertwined with the modern day lithuania . 
  it was the lighthouse of lithuanian culture for centuries . 
  it is called ** little lithuania ** to this day belarus is really similar to russia * on the east * , but * on the west * it is very similar to lithuania , the old , peasant lithuania in contrast with kalliningrad . 
  granted the similarities are dying a slow and painful death under pseudo-sovietic regime of lukashenka as well as because the border . 
   `` domofonas '' never heard in my entire life . 
  it even sounds vulgarly slavic . 
  but probably some city has this slang in their vocabulary . 
  everyone i know just used `` telefonas '' or if needed to differentiate `` nam\u0173 telefonas '' . 
   lithuanian shops are arranged the same way as russian ones never been to a russian one , could n't tell . 
  but i have a suspicion , you are talking about the small , village shops  russian pop music is relatively popular in lithuania in * some circles * , yes . 
  to elitists from the capital like me it feels very un-intellectual , vulgar and self degrading . 
  but hey , there are idiots and chavs ( or marozai ) in every country . 
   there is plenty of young people who look like marozai aka gopniks most of them are uneducated , ignorant and poor . 
  and yes , they are very russophillic indeed . 
  lithuania in general was and i guess still is the most rusophillic of baltics , you still can find that in all social groups . 
  my dad , for example , enjoys russian comedy and films very much , although when talking about russia the country he is borderline racist . 
   balto-slavic baltic languages may be significantly closer to slavic than germanic , but i 'm not sure why that 's supposedly makes us more russian and not polish for example  estonians as i said , lithuanians are quite russophillic because there was n't any colonisation like in latvia and estonia . 
  plus estonians in the soviet times had access to finnish ( free and western ) culture .

  ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/33/northern_europe_november_1939.png ) green - neutral nations black - germany and occupied nations red - soviet union and occupied nations . 
  orange - neutral nations with soviet military bases - also it was co-belligerent only during continuation war , not during winter war ( when ussr invaded finland ) , not nazi-sympathizer , given the fact they protected their jewish minority and refused to extradict them to nazi germany . 
  do n't speak about specific history if you do n't know any of it , . 
  i just gave you sources of soviets wanting to make finland commie state and you say no ... okay . 
  it 's not hard to google you know .

   defeat and victory does not mean unconditional surrender . 
  not being part of commie bloc counts a victory to me . 
   defeat and victory does not mean unconditional surrender . 
  given that they already occupied half of poland , parts of romania , all of lithuania , estonia and latvia , yes . 
  awesome , you can see people being dead inside just by looking at them dancing and having fun . 
  finland was not defeated , since there was [ peace treaty ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/moscow_peace_treaty ) . 
   hidden goal , that 's so convenient . 
  you can make up whatever goal you want , say they failed at it , and then present it like a defeat . 
  you really think commies were n't aiming for adding finland into ussr ? 
  pyrrhic victory while failing main but hidden goal - occupation all of finland which counts as victory for finland . 
  does n't look misery to me . 
  [ no wonder soviets lost against you .

   wow , the baltics are impressively flat . 
  yeah , it sucks . 
   the vatnik is not wrong . 
  what are you implying with him not being wrong ? 
  and supporting instability is not petty ? 
   rogozin tweeted friday . 
  `` look forward to a reply , you snakes . '' he used the russian word `` gady , '' which has no direct translation but can be variously interpreted as reptile , snake , vermin or skunk . 
  pretty much just trying to insult . . 
  and that would be ? 
  having several relationships is also insecurity ? 
  yeah , but i do n't see any other reason for brits to live in lithuania other than being diplomats or maybe businessmen . 
  only half , mostly northern germany is protestant . 
  northern europe is safe ... right ? 
  good bot, 
   i am saying that i find it stupid and of low humor value . 
  sorry if that hurt your feelings lol . 
  clearly your feelings got hurt by this picture . 
  lol  well it kinda is , instead of elaborating why it should be found funny , you replied like an 8 year old kid . 
  no offense . 
  but anyway , this has become extremely long so this is my last comment in this thread . 
  well i 'm talking to a kid after all . 
  also in some countries uk citizens might been lithuanians who lived in uk due to soviet occupation of lithuania . 
   in the early 20th century , many latvian and lithuanian refugees began to settle in glasgow and at its height in the 1950s , there were around 10,000 in the glasgow area . 
   to say the humor has low value ? 
  to give an opinion ? 
  what now , are you gon na tell i should not even talk about it ? 
  again , what is wrong with you ? 
  and i gave my own opinion , i do n't care what kind of humour value it has , if it makes me laugh , i 'm happy , i do n't write how unhappy i 'm because it did n't make me laugh . 
   comment is written not to get appreciation from the others - at least i do n't - also there was another person who found it stupid , so . 
  it 's quite obvious you will get down voted when you cry about such minor stuff . 
   one is an accidental photo the other is a photo given with a consent . 
  so we breached erdogan 's insecurity yet again ? 
   yeah i did learn that there were people who find such low level humor funny , and did you learn about the other side of the coin by now ? 
  i did understand you did not like it , but shoving your opinion down people 's throat is n't the way to do . 
   just like you friend . 
  if you consider that an attack then i have sad news for you ... 
  i pointed out how are you wasting time . 
   and i do n't care if you find my comment useless , you are the one who lost his shit after i said the humor here is cheap . 
  as if you did not ? 
   ah you have totally deviated from the discussion by now . 
  how did i ? 
  one stupid picture with another stupid picture , both are funny , what 's hard to understand ? 
   so you now learnt to deal with it , or ? 
  have n't you ? 
   i do n't know , i am pretty new on reddit , but judging the first 9-10 pages , the sub does not promise much in this regard as the other guy said . 
  well you 're free to leave , you know . 
   pretty much this is what you have been doing for the past comments in this chain :d oh yeah , where ? 
  if it 's not your type and worthless why even bother to type comment and waste your time on it ? 
  seems quite counter productive . 
  nobody cares that you do n't like , it 's that simple . 
   so what is this point of your comment ? 
  -   you : some people really have nothing else to do in life , i guess . 
    me : just like you friend . 
  you did exactly same thing . 
  some post `` funny '' pictures , some post `` useless '' comments . 
   haha damn no , as i said , it could have been kim jong or david cameroon , i would have given the same reaction . 
  it 's stupid , i mean , i do n't find any humor value in this at all . 
  i guess me finding this stupid though makes you feel offended , or ? 
  was albert einstein stupid because of [ this ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/8/86/einstein_tongue.jpg ) ? 
   there are those who find it funny , and there are those who find this level of humor quite stupid . 
  deal with it . 
  i did , as i said you 're the one that started this chain . 
   they are , given this `` accidental '' picture which we were expected to find funny . 
  are there more of them here ? 
  i really doubt . 
   yeah my initial comment stated that already , then you commented under by attacking me , since you were triggered as fuck . 
  so i am asking to you , what is wrong with you ? 
  who the hell did i attacked you ? 
  :d are n't you a special snowflake , * i 'm attacked by triggerman * . 
  perhaps . 
   who is even talking about permissions or whatnot ? 
  that was rhetorical question . 
   you do not need permission to poop in the middle of your house , but if you do , you will be taken as an idiot . 
  this and this are mutually exclusive , i do n't know how they 're comparable . 
   it will only show the level of your humor , which some may find quite low , and you should not wonder why . 
  so you do agree that whoever do not share your level of humour are immature ? 
  so you 're kind a small bigot ? 
  so everyone who do not share humour with you are immature ? 
  do i need to get permission from you to laugh ? 
   if merely saying this picture has no humor value at all is `` getting triggered '' then you also do n't know what getting triggered means . 
  in that case , i attribute this to your english .

  no they did n't ask for more hours , they complained that lithuanian exam was too hard , so education minister decided that they need more hours so it 's easier . 
  which was actually hilarious and well done . 
  there are native russians in lithuania and latvia , you think russian language would ever get recognised ? 
  the history makes it so that it will probably never happen . 
  no there is n't . 
  polish schools teach polish to poles . 
  english is taught from kindergarten and russian is almost dead when it comes to third language , german/french is catching up . 
  what problem is it ? 
  cuz it 's cold and wet . 
  i do n't think the development will ever die unless it 's a complete flop . 
  but then our simulations are so advanced at this point i do n't see why it would be a complete flop . 
  of course it 's been delayed , it 's a huge project involving many countries . 
  a push to 100 % renewables would also be delayed . 
  who would pay for that ? 
  if they dream of 2050 let 's do 2080 in real time . 
   operation from 2044 , electricity generation demonstration 2048 for demo , so we might , indeed , have fusion by 2050 . 
  of course you need to do 2048 + real life so let 's say we might have fusion by 2060 . 
  it 's a dream at this point . 
  even fossil fuel is n't 100 % reliable , with renewables you increase the chance of something failing even more , industry is reliant on constant power at this point . 
  maybe . 
  we might even have fusion by then . 
   ca n't wait for the day we get 100 % of our energy from renewables . 
  what method are you proposing ? 
  makes sense . 
  well , that 's how pr articles work . 
  all of them . 
  polish, 
  was n't as much stealing , at the time poles wanted to give us the whole language we just did n't take it . 
  it 's what you are proposing . 
  so every night the industry crashes to a hault and every morning it 's maintenance until the night . 
  very efficient , never going to run out of jobs that way . 
  and then the sun goes down and what do we do ? 
  of course . 
  that works too , sort of . 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mr-mcmtisfa sounds nothing like \u0117 \u00e4 sounds like we say e , it only gets that sound in words and then it 's more confusing . 
  but we do n't add as to everything and you use it as well . 
  hard to get that joke . 
  yes and that 's dumb . 
  \u0116 sounds like e just harder . 
  nothing like a at all and they write it as a with two dots . 
  our language is fucked up enough already why do you want to fuck it up more . 
  people still think mobile phones give you cancer , but smoking does n't . 
  uh , what, 
  just saying , copying a less baltic country seems strange . 
  a is not e, 
  just 40 light-years . 
  well , at the moment coal is killing far more people and making more co2 . 
  why would you try to be latvian , they are the least baltic out of all two baltics . 
  they are functional , multiple letters are not functional . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lithuanian_declension it 's an awful system to learn , but if you know how it works it 's quite efficient , you can tell a whole lot with just one word . 
   i am going to eat = a\u0161 valgysiu , he is going to eat = jis valgys, 
  that would be adding another letter for y , why would you do that . 
  now that you said that , yeah . 
  according to wikipedia there was a difference back then . 
  so we need to delete one . 
  how surprising , is n't it ? 
  since lithuanian writting is quite a new thing they had to make up some new letters to tidy up the writting . 
  \u0105 is basically aaa , \u0119 is eee , \u0117 is hard e , \u012f is iii , \u0173 is uuu , \u016b is hard u , \u010d is ch , \u0161 is sh , \u017e is zh . 
  we do it so our writting does n't look estonian . 
  everything on that map . 
  trace means it 's a non issue . 
  pubs are not popular because going out is not popular in small cities , the salaries are too small . 
  small cities might have what people call `` spit-houses '' , shitty pubs where they sell cheap shitty alcohol for alcoholics . 
  then it would be a village and not a town . 
  it adds up to page loading too . 
  if every page is 50ms slower to load 20 pages and it 's a second . 
  what is 20 pages when browsing reddit ? 
  it 's nice in the summer . 
  not much of that summer , but it 's nice . 
  yes . 
  they occur because a kid either wants something or does n't want something . 
  you can bargain or just make your position clear and wait . 
  all the time in the world when it comes to parenting . 
  the kids bargain too if they feel like they ca n't win anymore . 
  nothing i just gave up on trying to explain anything to you , if that 's what you think is a decent thing to do . 
  the parent is filming the kid . 
  that 's your ideal parent i guess . 
  yes . 
  i was a kid myself . 
  i did that . 
  my parents just walked away . 
  and then what do i do ? 
  i got nothing . 
  like i said . 
  your kids are not normal . 
  probably too much physical abuse . 
  tantrum mode is give me attention mode . 
  you just have to not throw a tantrum yourself . 
  your kids are somehow far more advanced than most other kids . 
  `` no , they do n't '' it 's the instinct of young animals to follow their parent . 
  they do that from when they start walking . 
  if the kid is so developed that it can figure out that staying behind will force their parent to do something then using the magic words will work wonders . 
  and if you are n't capable of doing that there are professionals that can help you . 
  yes . 
  so what ? 
  since they ca n't understand talking they will somehow understand violence against them ? 
  what are you even talking about . 
  what kind of a kid would stay alone in a store ? 
  especially a small one . 
  kids follow their parents .

  and i hate them for that . 
  and i do n't want them in europe , because we can already see what happens when they get here . 
  by the way , islam is not a race . 
  hating a group of people for being of certain race is racism . 
  hating a group of people for their violence and stupidity is not racism . 
  hating muslims is not islamophobia , because islamophobia by definition is an irrational fear of something . 
  after all this shit that 's been going on during the last few years , hatred of islam is very rational . 
  to be fair , i 'm fine with immigrants coming to lithuania , no matter how much will come . 
  they will stay here just as long as they get enough money for a ticket to germany , sweden or the uk . 
  also , many muslims really are backwards and violent , you ca n't deny that . 
  also , do n't blame europe for their backwardness , they 're not here for a new life . 
  they bring all their mentality and traditions with them and then claim `` islamophobes ! '', 
  if someone tells them to shut up and become more european . 
  wait , i think i figured it out . 
  mantasm typed `` kiek lietuvoje kainuoja '' , but i typed `` kiek kainuoja '' , so the results were different . 
  entering the same text as he did gives the same results as he got . 
  we do n't really know where they 're coming from , as many of them do n't have any passports or anything . 
  others will claim that they 're running away from war , even if there was no war in the area where they lived . 
  most are coming here because europe will give them free accommodation , food and maybe even some free money . 
  they will send the money back home , where their relatives will live like kings . 
  huh , i get passport , weddings , building a house , driver 's licence . 
  yes , they were russian guys on holidays . 
  nothing unusual . 
   you ca n't save greece even if you want anyway i know . 
  it 's because greek government is a bunch of idiots . 
  i do n't know why you voted for them . 
  we do n't want to save greece . 
  the president and minister of finance both said that . 
  we 're doing this only because most of large eu members want this . 
  we 're not big enough to change their minds . 
  11 years ago ( when we joined eu ) we were in a very bad position financially , lithuania was a really poor country . 
  now it 's growing faster than anyone else in the continent . 
  meanwhile greece is going in the opposite direction , national debt is larger than anyone else 's and it probably will never be repaid . 
   it was irresponsible why ? 
  did lithuania take out billions of euros in loans and then waste them all ? 
   and voted yes great , thanks . 
  should i give you money for that ? 
  i do n't understand why you 're angry at me . 
  it 's your government that 's irresponsible , your government wastes money . 
  my government is actually quite good , that 's why lithuania is growing so quickly , even though it 's such a tiny and young country . 
  how did greece help lithuania get into eu ? 
  your government has wasted billions of euros and is now asking for more . 
  how is that related to lithuania being in eu ? 
  after the meeting in berlin she said `` we came to an agreement . 
  it will be very painful for greece and it will cost us all a lot . 
  this is all because of very irresponsible actions of the greek government . '', 
  where did he say it ? 
  there 's nothing in the news . 
  both our minister of finance and the president said that giving any money to greece under current circumstances would not be a smart move . 
  mostly because greece has no intentions of giving that money back , ever . 
  we `` do n't want '' grexit the same way as we do n't want our friend to go to jail . 
  however , this friend just keeps stealing millions and asking for more , so we do n't really have other options . 
  the baltics do want a grexit , though . 
  europeanized version looks better , i think . 
  i grew up with similar sights , so it feels familiar and friendly , all those narrow streets and little cafes . 
  those glass and steel skyscrapers just feel so boring , even if they 're very big . 
  you need to sort out your spelling , i have no idea what you said here . 
  you 're a racist for saying that an entire race of people ( eastern europe ) are all racists . 
  i know , right ? 
  this whole `` think of the children '' immigrant thing is great !, 
  on a more serious note , eu should implement the same policy as australia : send them back immediately , do n't let anyone in . 
  refugees can ask for help at embassies in foreign countries . 
  at the moment large numbers of those `` refugees '' are simply unemployed young people with no education , who are not running away from war , they 're simply looking for jobs . 
  we have quite a lot of these people from vietnam , they 're more than willing to work for half a minimum wage , overtime , illegally , no documents or anything . 
  they do n't bring any benefit to the country . 
  which is why i do n't see any issues with lithuania accepting a bunch of immigrants . 
  they wo n't stay here long . 
  on the upside , eu will pay something like 6000 euros for each immigrant , so we might build some social housing or something . 
  the immigrants will run away to sweden and the housing will be left for us . 
  nah , you 're kind of a dick , really . 
  also a racist . 
  [ here ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jun/15/unsustainable-futures-greece-pensions-dilemma-explained-financial-crisis-default-eurozone ) is a nice article from last month explaining the issues with their pensions , and pointing out that their pensions are among the highest if compared to their national gdp . 
  these guys will leave as soon as they get enough money for a ticket to norway or the uk . 
  you are not actually cool , though . 
  they go to a safe country , but do n't stop there . 
  they continue moving towards a rich country with good social benefits and unemployment programs , which makes them economic migrants , not refugees . 
  low taxes , high military spending , high social payouts ( pensions and stuff ) , corruption , tax evasion to switzerland and elsewhere . 
  then they ran out of money and asked for more . 
  several times . 
  now everyone knows that they wo n't be able to pay back those loans , ever , but for some reason germany thinks that another credit should still be given . 
  i 'm not talking about a random greek office worker , i 'm talking about the country , which is run by officials who were elected by this office worker . 
  i 'm not saying that we will leave the eurozone because greece will get yet another credit . 
  i 'm saying that we will look angry and not talk to them if they get another credit . 
  we built our country almost from scratch in just 25 years , it was difficult for everyone but we somehow made it . 
  we took lots of credits from the eu , and they resulted in economic growth going through the roof . 
  that 's why at the moment our national debt ( per capita ) is like $ 5000 while that of greece is closer to $ 50,000 . 
  and then they 're rolling in foreign money and demanding even more , because their lavish lifestyle is all they know . 
  as i 've said , their pensions are higher than pretty much anywhere else in europe . 
  it 's safe to say that they could cut those a little bit . 
  same with military spending , they did n't really need hundreds of used us battle tanks . 
   we should strive for a decent pension for people who worked a full career even if it means that the rest of the country will go bankrupt ? 
  reportedly , they have [ highest pensions in eu . 
  ] ( http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/06/16/eurozone-greece-pensions-idusl5n0z12ps20150616 ) looks like more than `` decent pension '' , considering that even significantly richer , more expensive countries do n't have such enormous pensions . 
  eh , we will do all that we can , because giving them more money will result in the same stupid spending which leads to bankruptcy . 
  just the other day there was a post about pensions , the average in greece is over a thousand euros . 
  not the maximum . 
  that 's a lot for a country that 's literally about to go bankrupt . 
   i think a basic form of decency is whether pensions are at least above the relative poverty line of a country . 
  now , i ca n't find statistics on how many pensioners are living below the poverty line in lithuania , but i 've read numbers of up to 40 % for greek pensioners . 
  looking at the cia world factbook statistics , i see 20 % of the greeks ( country 103 in the list ) are below the poverty line , and 4 % of the lithuanians ( country 159 in list ) .

  greek to be exact . 
  - teka ending stands for place . 
  diskoteka , biblioteka , vynoteka is a brand name made in that style , comes from vinotheque in french i would guess . 
  military encirclement . 
  when can i start laughing ? 
  unfinished vinegar you mean . 
  vynoteka does n't have any . 
  few armenian ones though . 
  but russians like putin . 
  if montenegro joined the eu average gdp per capita in the eu would go down from 33,998 usd to 33,965 . 
  montenegro is n't that far from romania . 
  in a decade it is definitely doable . 
  total gdp does n't matter , per capita is more important . 
  flag annotations did n't work for some reason so i thought it was a serbian flag . 
  anyway , if you 're croatian you do n't have much to change , kuna has been pegged to euro for a long time so it 's just a name change . 
  also they got really slick with the change . 
  we just switched and it was smooth as anything . 
  except now everyone complains about rising prices , forgetting the fact that the economy is recovering after 2008 as well . 
  it 's now suddenly the fault of euro , even though litas was pegged for years . 
  my bad . 
  it 's small . 
  are you trying to make fun of something i said or make fun of lithuania ? 
  i lost you long time ago . 
  i do n't see a pineapple . 
  ethopian flag does n't have a pineapple either ? 
  what ? 
  that would be the same as pegging currency to euro . 
  just a name change , not much effect . 
  i do n't think you would have the choice to keep your currency if you joined these days . 
  of course joining will take a while . 
  to be honest comparing pretty much every eu country to albania would make them rich . 
  being many times richer and living a comfortable life is probably depressing to albanians . 
  well you vote for the one you like a little bit more . 
  it 's not like if you do n't vote they will go away . 
  i know there is no duty , but it seems strange that so many people who voted in round 1 would just decide not to on the second round . 
  so 40 % of fillion voters will just not vote ? 
  which it sort of is . 
  it 's stereotypes and stereotypes exist for a reason . 
  yeah , this map covers it quite well . 
  afaik vikings did n't really raid the baltics . 
  they had a few settlements which were mostly for trade purposes . 
   ** you ** cut canabis with tobacco , so ** your ** claim is pretty much ... well weird . 
  when you smoke canabis , ** you ** actually smoke both . 
  brainfried, 
  i am not bragging about anything . 
  you just assumed that if you smoke weed you have to smoke tobacco , which is not the case . 
  and it 's not the same . 
  marijuana smoke is less damaging as shown in many studies and it 's not addictive . 
  not to mention tobacco addicts often smoke all day every day . 
  a pack a day is not that rare . 
  no one would smoke that much weed every day . 
  well that is your choice . 
  i like my drugs less shitty . 
  you only do that if you 're saving cannabis since it 's illegal and you only get tiny bits of it and the prices are high . 
  normal people who can buy it legally do n't do that . 
  i actually do n't do that either since tobacco smoke is nasty . 
  it 's not grown in the nicest conditions since it 's a little bit illegal everywhere . 
  and they do n't use the most organic ways of growing it as you might imagine . 
  tainted marijuana does happen . 
  pesticides mostly . 
  and that shit can kill you since you are smoking it . 
  also the conditions for growing marijuana are n't exactly `` everywhere in whatever conditions '', 
  we are apes . 
  great apes to be exact . 
  it 's actually worse than that . 
  https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/oct/18/us-presidential-election-rigged-donald-trump-wisconsin-video i ca n't believe how a candidate running in the elections can even say this without any evidence . 
  murica . 
  actually the whole `` hillary is crooked '' angle was just absurd to me . 
  i would classify that as an attack on a person , but i guess everything goes in us elections . 
  taxed and * regulated * . 
  quality controlled weed is way better than illegal weed from afghanistan grown in who knows what conditions . 
  it 's waaaay different than ciragettes . 
  there is no psysical effect of withdrawal so you ca n't actually get psycically addicted to it and it does n't ruin nearly as much of your body compared to alchohol and cigattes . 
  not to mention you do n't constantly smoke it because it hits way harder than cigarettes . 
  i would support a ban on strong alcohol that is made for the sake of cheap strong alcohol . 
   well , anyway , i 've made this aerial video for these guys  just wanted to share it over cuz its fun . 
  should have started from that . 
  it 's a video on a youtube channel of a company that is advertised in the video and the description has 3 links to buy stuff that is advertised . 
  it 's an advertisement . 
  it 's not even a good video , it 's shaky , it 's full of text and the quality is poor . 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3xthe09hpq much better . 
  autopilot was not necessary to use and people knew the risks . 
  same, 
  no one is demolishing brick houses anytime soon . 
  they will be renovated . 
  the only houses that might get demolished in a couple decades are the concrete panel ones because they develop structural problems with age . 
  you think ? 
  so wait , they add stuff and that is not required to be labeled ?

  ( the yogurt you 're eating might be shitty ), 
  that would mean they would have to write those additives on the package . 
  it 's the same mechanical process , just not with a spoon . 
  what 's not natural about skimmed milk ? 
  you can skim milk with a spoon . 
  it separates , naturally . 
  the milk that does not separate is homogenized . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/homogenization_ ( chemistry ), 
  he bought the `` ghost '' building in the middle of kaunas and is tearing it down himself . 
  this guy is committed . 
  of course there still are haters since he is quite a strange person and he likes making trendy videos .

  whether you like it or not , putin is de facto dictator that has massive politican and military clout behind him . 
  he certainly is powerful , whether you agree with him or not . 
  he did outmaneuvered obama . 
  the attempt to increase the relationship by obama backfired and obama lost in the political sphere . 
  even obama himself has admitted it . 
  as far as pope goes , 1.2 billion people listen to what he says . 
  id say thats quite an influence . 
  of course lists like these were always nonsense for the most part . 
  but that does not mean that those people are not powerful . 
  i think you overestimate just how religiuos most christians would be if pope suddenly told us to wage war . 
  for all the non-syrian economic immigrants - it is . 
  its [ fanta sea ] ( http://www.humoar.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/fantasea.jpg ), 
  there is a reason the term is `` nigerian scammer '' and not , say , `` egyptian scammer '' . 
  when a clear trend is observed patterns form . 
  i know women for whom this turned out true as well as women for whom those turned out to be false . 
  none of my male friends `` married into east '' though so not sure how it is for them . 
  but yeah , `` its true sometimes '' is probably the best your going to get . 
  if they were officially married then legally he is a father . 
  not really . 
  gnp is actually a terrible measure of living as it could easily be influenced by profiteering companies that are owned by foreign individuals . 
  gdi would be a better measure . 
   and living in blocks so shitty you can hear your neighbor flushing the toilet . 
  ech , now this ancient tradition was exported to the west with the quick assembly houses that have no sound isolation . 
  as somone that actually lived in ee under su , this can not be further from the truth . 
  its the guardian . 
  everything is about gays or women for them . 
  unlikely . 
  putin seems to be holding a very steady hand on everyone 's strings . 
  liberal religion choose one . 
  social wellfare system is supposed to be eu universal . 
  which means that if you are `` secured '' in your country or origin the country you migrated to has to provide you the service ( and later write the cheque to the origin country ) . 
  in practice however this does not work as often the origin country refuses to pay and the destination country refuses to provide services . 
  create a military enforced peace zone in teritory of syria where they can come . 
  support them with aid within their own country borders . 
  no economic tourists that way , only actual refugees . 
  here , let me piss all over your room . 
  what , some people in africa dont even have a room , be glad you have one even if it smells of piss !, 
  feels  reals, 
   ok so you think if the borders were closed less refugees would come ? 
  naturally , unless they learned the art of teleportation . 
   what the hell do you think they are fleeing from ? 
  depends on which refugees you are talking about . 
  syrians are mostly fleeying from the war , the rest are mostly fleeting from poverty . 
   the war in syria continues if the european borders are closed or not . 
  yes , but instead of helping them we decided to cut their developement funding . 
   and people flee from bombs ... im pretty sure by the time bombs go off , fleeing is too late . 
  its easy to believe something when you already hold that position before reading anything . 
  even the daily mail becomes the best source when it says what you want to hear . 
  its the reason guardian hasnt been abandoned yet . 
  do you have a photo of yourself ? 
  he still got elected , so not to everyone . 
  yes but ops question included the past . 
  lithuanian emigration increased more than tenfold since lithuania joined the eu and we could migrate to uk without previously existing legal barriers . 
  usa , canada and australia still has those barriers , and as a result there are very little migration to those countries in comparison . 
  the major force of immigration in usa isactually ** illegal ** immigration from the south . 
  meanwhile australians `` sending them away and sinking the boat '' policy is also quite well known . 
  im not that knowledgable about canadian policy , but id be surprised if it has huge immigration outside of inter-north america travel . 
  so chances of policies brought on by the political institution is not a benefit of that political institution . 
  ok then . 
  a well educated , skilled labour force that is eager to work and results in higher gdp , that has a much higher work-to-welfare ration than local population is very beneficial to the country . 
  of course , not everyone is model citizen , but then , neither are the locals . 
  i never said it was , i was trying to explain why some people blame eu for the crisis . 
  touche !, 
  the island of xir, 
   this is hardly a uk phenomenon its not only uk , but its majority uk here . 
  like , over half of our emmigration happens to uk , mostly because english is taught in schools to everyone so they dont need to learn a new language . 
  in fact the specialists mograting to uk where they get paid more ( even for manual labour ) than they do at home has reached such a point here that hospitals actually start failing because we dont have enough doctors to do the work . 
  all specialists who were good at their job emigrated westerwards because they get paid 10 times more for same job there . 
  you forgot gra\u017eulis, 
  while not politicians , opinions of some people that blame eu for the crysis claim that the reason eu is responsible is because eu openly invited the refugees to come and live in eu instead of tightening border control from illegla immigration . 
  its called authoritarian left . 
  lithuanian [ elected politician ] ( https://lt.wikipedia.org/wiki/petras_gra%c5%beulis#pozicija ) did this too . 
  depends on what counts as a politician . 
  we had a politician here who blamed the existence of gay people on eu . 
  he was dragged off by police after trying to stop gay pride parade . 
  but in general , very little actually . 
  of course it helps that my country is the number one in subsidies successfully taken from eu and most people with a brain on their shoulders sees the massive improvements that eu paid for . 
  ech , thats just the surface . 
  the infrastructure is failing and is almost universaly rated as `` needs immediate repairs or collapse is imminent '' . 
  the medical system is fucked up and is getting even more fucked up . 
  the corporatization of law enforcement drastically raised jail population and jail time to the point where some judges were found to be taking bribes from private jails for longer sentences . 
  us needs drastic changes if it doesnt want to implode on itself . 
   what revolution in the us , they kicked out the english , that was about it i think you are forgetting the civil war . 
  ah yes , the organization that chose iran as a leader for empowerment of women is so reputable !, 
  i looked at what the ai are saying and its like they forgot what war is ... 
  what you want is not possible due to current state of eu not being sustainable . 
  even if you veto everything to a halt it would collapse with or without you . 
  there are only either going forward or backwards . 
  standing still will not work . 
  i quote myself :  not directly linked to the draft in the law, 
  as someone that does it house calls - for majority of population it does . 
  do you know of any examples in the last 15 years where people were `` smart enough '' ? 
  i think us already has a surplus of corrupt politicians . 
  the right to vote was not directly linked to the draft in the law , but in practice it was dirrectly tied , especially in cases where voting was considered a priviledge . 
  wws are exceptional circumstances due to massive amount of manpower lost during them . 
  eu as it currently is is a transitional temporary system . 
  what you want is not possible . 
  the only country complaining about human rights violantions by the ypg is turkey , who themselves have been just `` great '' in that department , havent they ? 
  well , at least he has a realistic assessment of his followers . 
  ah , the event that brought on the worst period in french history , thats even referred to as `` the terror '' .

  they might get angry again , 
  that 's the point . 
  do n't forget cornish . 
  kind of should be careful with reparations when talking with germans ... 
  i said it before i will say it again : i will write my congressmen . 
  oh and `` thanks putin ! '', 
  air of the city makes you free ... 
   liberators yeah german nationalism ( not to be confused with nazis and chauvinism ) was fucked up after the war real good it would seem ... 
  not in lithuania :d, 
  this as a student i very much do n't like . 
  education should educate , give you basic knowledge , you know , and skills for critical thinking , and questioning of authority ;p though of course that 's not going to happen . 
  that 's kind of bad . 
  mainly for pr ( even if he is not neo nazi ) , and does ukraine lack able officers from normal armed forces ? 
  it was a joke ... 
   vancouver the place i know because of mass effect ... 
  i know it 's embracing ... 
   sinicization wtf is that ? 
  looks it 's the ukip guy !, 
  stone the apostate !, 
  you are not even form same continent !, 
  ^ thought ^ sometimes ^ you ^ sure ^ as ^ hell ^ feel ^ like ^ europeans ... 
  i guess space is more important to us even in situation that we have today . 
  but i 'm ok and a bit surprised with this . 
  oh i know that . 
  but he likes to kill what he wants to . 
  i mean for mercenary it 's just a job . 
  anyway ... man of war does what men of war do . 
  sure, 
  now that you mention that is kind of true . 
  i wonder why ... 
  just heard about this in the news . 
  came here to see what turks think :d, 
  hmm i wonder what he would say if he was about to be executed . 
  either he is socio-path and lacks empathy therefore he might actually not be afraid or he will turn into snivelling , crying slob of meat . 
  i know . 
  but i did not tell that russia = bad , west = good . 
  well russia is kind of bad right now , from my point of view i mean it 's subjective . 
   red army arrived in the east as liberators yeah we got liberated the shit out of us . 
  soviet union fuck yeah !, 
  not you , you idiot . 
  you are nato kebab . 
  today is easter so ... 
  that 's ok . russia sends it 's regards and tanks to prague . 
  it was fun the last time , no ? 
  with my family . 
  took a stroll by the river too . 
  was she polish ? 
  lithuanian ? 
  or maybe a mix ? 
  batka is at it again ? 
  first of all baltic 's hearth of fascism ? 
  what ? 
  we we newer were fully socialist or fascists . 
  also for those marches well ca n't talk about latvia or estonia but in lithuania neo nazis can march if they want but most people do n't care , nazi symbols are illegal and we celebrate independence day . 
  know your enemy well ... 
  i mean it makes sense . 
  they can choose when they have ability to do so . 
  then again would that intervention be free ? 
  more like opportunistic ally . 
  us fights isis that is ( not openly ) supported by saudi 's . 
   east asians because they are fairly secular and adapt well . 
   i 'm just saying that in order to live peacefully with each other we have to change our rhetoric , forget the past and move on to the stars . 
  every country does this and russia is not exception either . 
  yes russification was done by russian empire while soviets done sovietization . 
  do n't have enough money for meaningful air force sadly . 
  india and china ;d, 
  stay . 
  need someone to balance things out + keep europe united . 
  tap water cleaner in poland ? 
  lol ... 
  i think they know that russia sucks in general but it is also their ally in some matters or something . 
  or might there be no racism huh, 
  they are probobly used of this ;d, 
  well they will have to adapt one way or another . 
  welp i still fail to see racism . 
   greeks turning against the orthodox oh god , mythology still plays heavy part in your politics ? 
  we have seen it all ... 
  yeah wtf is going on ... 
  wait found info . 
  he fell in with a car . 
   people put almost zero effort into actually understanding why one might find such a phenomenon offens because they do n't fucking care because it 's tradition . 
  same way i would n't care if somone said that lighting bonfires in spring is racist or something . 
  my point still stands and that text reinforces my opinion more . 
  it 's just a color to me and i personally do n't see making fun of it racist . 
  same way that i do n't get mad when black people make jokes about whites . 
  i do n't think painting your face black means your are racist . 
  it does not mean that i see blacks inferior race too . 
  period . 
  and i 'm not from colonial european nation so i 'm less sensetive about this . 
  not sure if i fallow . 
  well true i have ideology . 
  it 's my own and it 's lump of many ideas and diffferent stances on them . 
  i think that makes me individualist though thats also lumping people into gruop . 
  so painting onself inplies slavery ? 
  and what if black person paints himself white ? 
  after all white people were enslaved too . 
  for the fun . 
  yes . 
  who disagrees lift up the hands ... 
   good on russia for having freedom of speech ...

  you 're whole thing is that no one calls balkans balkans or people from the british isles brits . 
  that does n't sound honest to me . 
   i have yet to see reasonable examples though . 
  if that 's the criteria then i can say the same about your reasoning . 
  two can play at that game . 
  that 's where the intellectual dishonesty comes in . 
  you make excuses for comparable examples but you have an issue with the term `` baltic '' . 
  i just ask for consistency . 
   well this may be true - i am a very nitpicky person in every aspect  i can tell :d  because being nitpicky = being incorrect ? 
  no , but being nitpicky about flimsy terms is . 
   not every argument is valuable just because someone presents it . 
   true that . 
  what do you really want to ask ? 
  because i do n't understand what you 're getting at with that question . 
   in fact almost all the counterarguments smell of intellectual dishonesty to me . 
  i do n't think we 'll find common ground on this one . 
   like where ? 
  like the baltic-finns point . 
  you dismissed a completely legitimate scientific categorization just because it 's not mainstream or used colloquially . 
  like the british isles examples . 
  like the balkan examples . 
  you 're finding excuses for completely reasonable examples and frankly some of them are stretching it . 
  i think you know full well that these sort of generalizations of nations , countries , states , ethnicity , etc. 
  are pretty fluid and not in some rigid frames . 
  this stuff is messy and being so , most arguements in this thread are technically correct . 
  while your vehement position on the matter in this thread and others just comes of as nitpicky . 
  that 's why i say that i smell intellectual dishonesty . 
  because i see the points you 're making and i understand them but if you really do n't get the counter arguements then i do n't know what else to say other than that you 'll always be baltic in my heart . 
  i can totally see latvians perceiving your position more negatively due to livonia/terra mariana and whatnot . 
  let me know what being a fan of stalin is a sign of , doctor . 
  i had a longer post ready but i stepped away for a while and came back to the thread . 
  i 'm not gon na repeat what others have already said . 
  what you 're saying in this thread smells of intellectual dishonesty to me . 
  being technically correct and being nitpicky are different things imo . 
  and you 're really not being technically correct all the time here . 
  i think you 're being slightly hypocritical dismissing legitimate points being brought up throughout the thread ( the baltic-finns point and balkans as examples ) . 
  that being said , i 'll try to call you baltic every opportunity i get from now on to smother you into submission with love , eesti ;p, 
   the scandinavian countries have their language similarity and also balkans hold your horses , buddy . 
  the only language similarities in the balkan region is between the slavs and even that is subcategorized between south slavic and eastern south slavic . 
  you forget hellenic , turkic , albanian and the romanian romance language . 
  scandinavian countries all speak north germanic languages . 
  i think he meant latvians and lithuanians as `` they '' . 
   there is no evidence for this . 
  whoo boy . 
  got triggered for a millisecond there before i started to read the next sentence . 
  you 're on a mailing list now . 
  expect an anonymous gift of an unspecified variety of tea on your doorstep in the near future . 
  i expect you to keep up your schtick when balkans are brought up then . 
  there 's also the categorization of baltic-finns vs volga-finns . 
  so it does n't come completely out of ignorance . 
  i 'm actually glad when that happens . 
  i 'll take being lumped in with bros instead of russia or the ol' `` ex-soviet block '' moniker any day . 
  you should really give it a rest . 
  you do n't see people getting into `` well actually ... '' mode when the balkans are concerned . 
  most people know you 're not indo-european . 
  at least in this sub anyway .

  it 's in lithuania . 
  it 's even in the title . 
  that sentence irked me as well , but i figured that it does n't detract too much from the photos which i found very interesting . 
  i knew someone would correct me .

   to be fair , linguistically the iranian and the italic languages are grouped together in the indo-european group and share a common ancestor ( proto-indo-european ) . 
  i agree that it is n't accurate to call you hellenic but for the sake of the joke i 'd just let it go .

  they do n't give a shit about solidarity and they are all for far left wing policies on immigration unless it affects them . 
  mass immigration from muslim countries shall not be questioned but eastern europeans are literally the devil ... two can play at that game . 
  how about austria get less money for releasing war criminals ( that they had in custody ) wanted in lithuania ? 
   latin is such an ugly language though .

  i for sure as hell do n't care at all and do n't see a reason for other to care . 
  that 's the last reason he 's doing it for . 
  we 've been having awful relations with poland , that 's why . 
  and everything we hear about here is how he `` skipped '' lithuania and chose estonia instead .

  well , i never liked nazi history or anything to do with it in the first place , but from what little i know in my limited knowledge on the matter , there were people at the time who sided with the nazis , those who sided with stalin and those who tried or pretended to remain neutral , as is with every choice . 
  thus i would n't say it is n't true - there are neo-nazis and other scum in lithuania ( a small number but they exist ) , there are people who still view this complex part of our history in their own way , choosing their own sides , but i do n't think that generalizing that selective group of people as `` the country '' is a very pleasing and accurate description .

  ok , thanks in advance . 
  by the way , are you from one of the balkan countries or just interested and studied about that topic ? 
  yes please , that would be interesting to read . 
  i imagine some women survived those events ( srebrenica i mean ) . 
  of course , all of them suffered as well . 
  but did word spread fast about everything that happened there or was it uncovered later ? 
  as far as i know , the people responsible are n't all sentenced , right ? 
  why was this done ? 
  who commanded to do this thing ? 
  i 've heard about serbians doing genocide , but i do n't know almost anything about this event . 
  could anyone who knows much about this tell me more about it ? 
  are n't bears like really great at climbing stuff ? 
  especially trees . 
  i do n't think it would be hard for him to climb to the air conditioner , especially with those window sills everywhere . 
  the real question here would be why did he do it ? 
  i think major difference is that self propelled artillery can shot rounds 30-60 km away , while a tank can hit like 5 km max ? 
  the self propelled artillery is expensive , but yes it is n't very well armored . 
  tough their long range compensates for that , i think . 
  no we did n't . 
  where did you get this info from ? 
  the latest purchase by the lithuanian military from germany was panzerhaubitze 2000 - self propelled artillery ( 16 pieces + 4 spares/training ) . 
  lithuania does n't have any tanks , nor is looking to buy any in the near future . 
  we ** might ** buy german made armoured personnel carriers or infantry fighting vehicles , if they win the contest that was extended to 10 european and nato ( i remember germany , poland , turkey , france , italy being one of them . 
  i suspect finland and austria should also be included + 3 more ) corporations , making such vehicles . 
  the winner and the deal should be announced this fall . 
  wow wow wow . 
  shot 's fired . 
  unlike serbian basketball players do it to the net . 
  hell , i 've actually read an article a few years back , saying he is lithuanian . 
  iraq would be among the least surprising origins . 
  yeah , but i can understand uk for example . 
  there , the televoters gave 1st place to lithuanian . 
  in reality , almost all of those televoters are just lithuanian immigrants ( they are really loyal to lithuania in eurovision , compared to other countries immigrants ) . 
  so we should have had 12 points from uk , but the jury steped in and did some justice . 
  gave us a lower place and i agree our song was n't the best ( was n't the worst either ) . 
  so this case i understand . 
  but when our jury gave a small amount of points to russia just so they would get 0 points is very bad . 
  no matter how i dislike russia and their actions , this was vote manipulation and it seems like we kind fell to their level in that case . 
  i would have felt a lot different if the people would n't have voted for them ( like i did at first ) , not a jury setting it up . 
  then this is very wrong . 
  i would have been ok if both the voters and the jury did n't give them any points , because of their standing on russia . 
  now , it seems that the jury did it on purpose , not giving any points to them . 
  of course , the votes from lithuania might have been made by russians here , but that does n't matter . 
  a lot of immigrants vote for their homeland ( including lithuanian immigrants from ireland and uk ) . 
  i 'm not all that happy about this thing after all , the judges did it on purpose . 
  they could have given them at least 4 points ... 
  really ? 
  could you give me a source for that ? 
  i know eurovision should n't be about politics , but damn was i happy that we gave them nothing . 
  it 's like the whole country actually does support ukraine over russia and agrees with our foreign policy . 
  i also thought we 're gon na be a few places higher , but oh well ... 
  the latvian [ maiden ] ( https://38.media.tumblr.com/4e3d63411c80dd1122da45c73f495991/tumblr_inline_mk0k7jcihs1qz4rgp.jpg ) is one of my most , if not the most , favorite euro coins . 
  i like how detailed it is and how very latvian the woman there looks . 
  you do understand that it was a non-aggression pact between the ussr and the nazis , right ? 
  they divided europe with that pact . 
  literally , split it in half . 
  was soviet union invading poland a form of non aggression ? 
  god ... 
  i am saying that the ussr and nazi germany started ww2 . 
  did i say that they started it by attacking each other ? 
  i am saying they both started it together , as i mentioned before - friendly to each other . 
  what the hell does uzbekistan and kazakhstan have to do with anything ? 
  i am talking about what the ussr occupied prior and during ww2 . 
  countries that were free or fought for their freedom , not the ones that were already occupied . 
  so what if lithuania was part of russian empire for a century ? 
  ever heard of the lithuanian declaration of independence ? 
  soviet russia acknowleged the lithuanian independence . 
  that 's it . 
  they did . 
  said it 's ok . and then , 20 years later - they do n't anymore . 
  they sent troops here and took the country . 
  you know what this thing is called ? 
  occupation . 
  how am i changing facts ? 
  did i mention somewhere of lithuania not being occupied by the soviet union or the russian empire ? 
  the whole point of my text was that they did !, 
  oh my god , seriously ? 
  ok then , let 's go tell finland that they are evil and should go love and hug and join the russians , because hey , they had a war and fought them . 
  it 's wrong to defend you independence , according to you . 
  i do not care who ruled the ussr . 
  it could have been a lithuanian , it would n't have been any how less evil for that . 
  you know , nazi germany was ruled by an austrian , maybe then they all did nothing wrong too ? 
  yes , russians are soviets . 
  the october revoliution happened where ? 
  in russia . 
  the soviet union was called how before 1922 ? 
  it is directly russia and even russians understand it . 
  otherwise , let 's take away all the russian achievements during soviet times ( like flying into space ) , because the ussr did it , not russia !, 
  i do n't see me whining anywhere . 
  and no , of course . 
  the ussr was a true place of good and peace . 
  do you know that nazis used the ussr model for their concentration camps ? 
  do you know that the ussr only under stalins rule killed at least 30 million various people ? 
  i do n't think it 's important what race they killed , it 's important they killed . 
  furthermore , do you know how many millions of people did the ussr deport to siberia and other places ? 
  how many people were killed after the war had already ended ? 
  how many women were raped ? 
  how stalin made the holodomor happen in ukraine ( in one year , 3 to 6 million ukrainians died of starvation ) ? 
  do you know , that the soviet union even helped nazi germany by rounding up some of the jews and sending them to their deaths . 
  these are all such joyful events , certainly shows that the ussr is true defender of good .

  no need to take it overly serious . 
  there 's no joke to be made with crack-oov . 
  and bulgaria !, 
  go estonia !, 
  there are so many jokes to be made !, 
  i ca n't decide !, 
  i wonder if crack cow 's milk is illegal . 
  you 're exaggerating . 
  what i see in this thread is people pointing out that the claims made in the talk show by some randoms are absolutely absurd . 
  no one sane is saying that norwegians are evil but as far as that particular organization goes if nothing else there is definitely a lack of communication which does n't help . 
  iirc during all the fuss in lithuania about that incident the norwegian cps did not provide any kind of comment about the situation to the lithuanian foreign affair officials . 
  it 's possible that the media blew it out of proportions ( which they did but i am talking about the lack of comment right now ) . 
  however , they did start some cooperation programs with the lithuanian cps which probably would n't have happened if not for the shitstorm . 
  the story kind of died down by now at least on the actual news outlets but it was pretty big . 
  i do n't watch lithuanian tv shows so i ca n't comment about that content in particular . 
  however , those talk show type things tend to invite anyone that 's willing to talk so there 's no lack of asshats with stupid stories and opinions on those shows . 
  i think there were two cases so i might be mixing them up . 
  essentially some child was taken from their parents in norway because he told his teacher that he was being disciplined for something by his parents . 
  ( i ca n't recall exactly but i do n't think it was physical . 
  do n't quote me on that though . ), 
  so the parents during a routine visit with their kid arranged it that when the kid went to the bathroom ( so that the person responsible for his safety would n't follow him ) he would go outside where his father or someone the parents trusted was waiting in the car to get the kid to lithuania . 
  the kid later was found in sweden and deported back to norway . 
  this story was posted a couple of times in here i think but it never got any traction . 
  i stopped paying attention to the story once in every mention of the story they would quote foreign affair officials saying that they 're handling the situation . 
  as i understand it the rules are wrong on tafl . 
  i downloaded all versions i could find and half of them do n't even have an option to play vs ai and the other half have the rules all wrong . 
  looks interesting . 
  found some games of it for android . 
  gon na try it when i have time . 
  of course not . 
  russia has so much stuff that they wo n't return because `` it 's lost '' that they could get back to good graces with everyone in an instant . 
  this made me die inside . 
  i try to avoid that type of stuff as well but it 's hard to do completely :( so i guess i envy you ;d, 
  true . 
  i still like the video but i would like the video a lot more if this were the first place that i ever saw her in . 
  surprise surprise . 
  totally . 
  sure . 
  i did say that it was an utopian idea of mine . 
  however , i also said that virtually no region can be compared with another region honestly . 
  k\u00f6ningsberg is a glorified military base . 
  that 's all it is . 
  a military base in the middle of europe . 
  that 's why i think that russia should get out and a european military base in the middle of europe would make more sense . 
  great ... now i know that exists . 
  the gist of the conversation : host asks her what she would do if she won 30k euros right now . 
  probably trying to steer the conversation to investments etc. 
  because that show is about that type of stuff . 
  her response is very reminiscent of the famous miss teen usa south carolina speech . 
  basically being on a show that discusses a topic that she has no clue about she tries to compensate by trying to blab out something that would sound smart and started talking about how the 30k euros would be worth more as litas ( our old currency ) because something something implying that the litas was not directly tied to the euro and thus talking bullshit she knows nothing about . 
  you seemed to have missed my point about china and india . 
  russians have no business in k\u00f6ningsberg . 
  they expelled the germans living there by force . 
  at most just one generation has lived and died in there . 
  that does n't make them ethnic . 
  russians are in the region because of political reasons and they should gtfo . 
  not really . 
  i see nothing wrong with seeking independence through democratic means . 
  i am actively trying to avoid stupidity so sorry but i would rather not look up her stuff to translate for you :p maybe someone else will . 
  basically the lithuanian kim kardeshian . 
  got famous via social media for some bullshit if i 'm not mistaken . 
  basically for being hot . 
  she 's attractive i 'll give her that but there are more than enough hotter girls than her around who do n't spew out nonsense every time they open their mouths . 
  her name is mentioned in the description of the video and that 's her youtube channel . 
  yeah , i agree . 
  i 'm mostly dreaming out loud :p, 
  there 's a difference between organic migrations and forced deportations by the governments . 
  russians did not go to k\u00f6ningsberg to look for a better life . 
  they were settled there on orders because they had specific skills needed in that area . 
  well like i said one region can not really be compared with another and since i do n't know anything about those colonizations you 've mentioned i will not comment about it . 
  my stance is admittedly utopian but i would prefer that the ethnic people of the regions should govern their regions and then we can all be in the eu and not bicker about those things . 
  romania is a perfect example though . 
  is n't there mostly hungarians in the middle of romania ? 
  using the line `` why ? 
  there 's no german population there anymore there , all the people there are russians . '', 
  should n't then the middle of romania belong to hungary ? 
  now , again , i do n't know much about the history of the region so i do n't have a strong stance one way or the other but as far as k\u00f6ningsberg goes russia has no claims on it and should gtfo but will they ? 
  probably not . 
  do other countries want it ? 
  not really . 
  i 'm just saying :p, 
  well since they arrived there completely unorganically then they can get out of there the same way . 
  that region was never ethnically russian and it 's just a glorified military base at this point . 
  the population arguement is a bit sketchy imo . 
  of course you do n't want some minority populations `` controlling '' the majority populations but if the territorial integrity of countries can be disregarded only because the current majority of the population wants it then india or china could easily spill over to other countries and say `` hey , we 're the majority so this is china or india now '' . 
  obviously it 's more nuanced than that and no region could be compared to another but hopefully you get my point . 
  also i 'm far from an expert on the matter but to my knowledge k\u00f6nigsberg belonging to russia was supposed to have an expiration date but nobody is calling russia out on it because there are no real claimants to the region because old prussians ( the original ethnic people ) and the german prussians do n't exist anymore . 
  lithuania could arguably make a case for a 1/3 of it but that 's not gon na happen for obvious reasons . 
  imo russia should gtfo and nato could set up a base in there to protect the region instead of setting up bases in every country around it . 
  edit : word . 
  haha , this video is famous in my circle of friends :d, 
  i would be inclined to like this video a lot more if not for this attention whore being used as the model . 
  russia should get out of k\u00f6nigsberg . 
  that 's what russia should do . 
  in bars it 's usually fried black bread with mayo + melted cheese sauce or roasted pig ears or onion rings . 
  lots of ideas but this is the first thing to pop to my head . 
  lithuania : [ foje - paskutinis traukinys ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vakwj-8wf08 ) bonus : [ unofficial anthem of the baltics ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0kokq20rul0 ), 
  there were quite a few facts with poor phrasing , nevertheless , it 's a neat little video . 
  you do n't seem to get the point so i 'll stop trying to explain it . 
  i have better things to do than argue about semantics .

   you sound more like a troll . 
  `` put them in camps '' ... unfortunately , you 're probably not a troll , you 're just a dumbfuck . 
  refugee camps already exist in europe and turkey . 
  we 're talking about benefit seekers in this thread . 
  i 'm just making an economically viable suggestion how to discourage that kind of people . 
  care to give any viable suggestions or you 'll just insult everyone who does n't agree with `` mirror mirror on the wall , who 's the kindest and non-nazi of them all '' policy that works so well at the moment ? 
  you must be a troll, 
  me and you are forced to earn our living too by our governments, 
   i do n't know how you think that officials will be able to ` check databases ' of people war-torn countries i 'm not suggesting keeping actual refugees in camps, 
  it does n't mater what they say , officials could check database by cooperating with presumed state of origin . 
  actual refugee can apply for asylum . 
  this would scare some of the benefit shoppers . 
  it 's not forced labour , unless you count wage labour as forced labour ? 
  you work , you earn money , you spend money . 
  it 's not a prison , they could go back home once they remember where they come from if they 're not actual refugees . 
  put them in camps , they can stay there and work for food and housing until they remember their names and nationalities . 
  damn , fam , you 're hanging out with the wrong crowd . 
  because poland 's democracy is threatened by the new government 's actions . 
  the government 's media reforms give the treasury minister the power to appoint and fire the heads of public television and radio , as well as civil service directors . 
  they will no longer be hired through public contests organised by the national broadcasting council like it was previously . 
  all because pis believed that journalists are biased against them in their coverage . 
   lukashenko stated that `` this is a geopolitical project '' . 
  what does this mean ? 
  my guess is that belarus is cornered by another country to carry out this project just to fuck with lithuania once again . 
   what has changed in belarus ( if anything ) since ukraine changed course from russia towards eu ? 
  [ they 're slowly reversing self-rusification ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jan/28/-sp-russian-belarus-reclaims-language-belarusian )  do you envision same thing happening to belarus ? 
  nope , never . 
  unless russia gets eaten by the largest sinkhole or a civil war happens in russia . 
   and a more down to earth question , how is your everyday life afected by eu-russia sanctions and cooling of relations ? 
  i believe milk price dropped ? 
  that 's a good question for a non european subreddit like / r/askanamerican, 
   is turkey actively aggressive towards their neighbors ? 
  cause russia does constant fly-overs over lithuanian , estonian , swedish borders , and european countries kept selling them arms . 
   and you 're telling me eastern european countries , that are part of nato and therefore guarenteed by law that we would intervene in case of agression , want our troops to be deployed because they `` feel '' threatened ? 
  how would you intervene in case of aggression if all of your troops are deployed in your former colonies ? 
  it would be already too late . 
  that 's one of the many reasons ee relies on usa to be protected . 
  me too, 
  it 's really simple : 1 . 
  press `` alt + shift '' to change language input from english to lithuanian 2 . 
  now you type these letters '' \u0105\u010d\u0119\u0117\u012f\u0161\u0173\u016b\u017e '' instead of numbers 3 . 
  press `` alt + shift '' to go back to english . 
  now you can write numbers and symbols like '' @ # $ & '' again . 
   get the whole sense that the country is somewhat stuck in that time 1990 that 's true for the country side  i would like to see a more brighter side of the country you 'd need to check pictures of major cities , not peripheries then ;-), 
  [ we alternate between lithuanian specific leters and numbers/symbols ] ( https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:and9gctzaxyqn05tov-au_n9ixtdafr40uvd-2zmiiva0fzas-jkuwio ), 
  were you expecting to see something in vilages/towns in the middle of nowhere ? 
  i only remember one instance when germany supported south stream . 
  after the project was canceled and it was merkel backing bulgaria to negotiate again with russia after russia announced plans with turkey . 
  germany 's stance seemed indifferent during the time . 
   you claim that ` only six countries were in favour of ss ' `` only '' ? 
  i meant six eu countries : austria , bulgaria , croatia , greece , hungary and slovenia + non eu countries : serbia and russia , which signed inter-governmental agreements , were in favor . 
  i 'd argue that common currency is convenient too, 
   source ? 
  source of what ? 
  that it was blocked by the eu ? 
  or that bulgaria halted the south stream project twice because of the eu and usa pressure ? 
  what does `` your countries ? '', 
  refer to ? 
  since you replied to a user with latvian flair , it probably refers to baltic countries ? 
  well lithuania was against it and pushed for `` eu 's third energy package '' . 
  and the south stream halt was called `` good showcase of european unity '' by our president . 
  both projects are frowned upon here . 
   when has eastern europe ever cooperated ? 
  always ? 
  ee does n't negotiate with terrorists though . 
   why did n't your countries oppose south stream then ( prior to it being abandoned ) ? 
  it was opposed and was blocked by the eu . 
  6 countries were in favor of it . 
   deeply concerned, 
  as i understand it 's more about : * `` we want to be equal '' ( everyone is poor except the ruling class ) * `` we want to be respected in our jobs '' ( you get a ribbon or a cheap metallic pendant ) * `` we want order '' ( you get beat up by the milicia/police and you ca n't complain to anyone about it ; you get tortured or `` removed '' by the kgb , nobody asks any questions regarding it ; for saying certain things you lose your job , you get kicked out from you school/university . 
  your family is deported ) * `` we want someone to lead us '' ( you get a ruthless dictator ) * `` we want free shit !, 
  like free housing '' ( someone gets killed or deported and you get their home ) * `` we want to be feared and respected ! '', 
  ( your economical and social situation does n't change because of that . 
  everyone despises and ridicules you instead ) these people think socialist utopia is free , you just need to change the system and suddenly there 's money for free cars , free houses/flats , free healthcare . 
  most of them are just simpletons feeling nostalgia for those times and uniformed youth . 
  or just people with slave mentality . 
  more than half of russians do n't understand what they want . 
  apparently we had a couple of those back in the good old days . 
  but not in the modern sense .

  latvian council/soviet ? 
   btw : `` is it contagious ? '', 
  ... seriously ? 
  they 're afraid they 'll become gay turtles too, 
  a tradition ? 
  it 's extremely new . 
  the notorious hacker known as 4chan ? 
  eu is the agressor right ? 
  poor russia being bulied again . 
  evil eu wants to conquer them ? 
  exactly , a referendum about joining both eu and nato would be welcomed, 
  where , you europhobe ? 
  we could have been a kingdom too if somebody had n't stolen the crown, 
   m\u0101ras zeme your neighbor would think it means `` plague land '' . 
  `` maras '' - `` plague '' in lithuanian . 
   so many people just think of belarus as of white russia rather than ruthenia of rus ' . 
  and it oppresses real identity of the nation it does n't help when majority of them speak russian natively, 
  extremely triggered, 
  do n't feed the troll,

  personally i do n't even use the term `` former soviet republic of lithuania '' or whatever . 
  it 's not harsh , it 's just uneducated and using term ex-soviet state as much as russians call everyone fascist whoever disagrees with their politics . 
  but after all you 're pro-ussr/putin 's authoritarian regime , are n't you ? 
  because it 's used as old fashioned political term , not as geographical one , we 're as much northern as denmark , even more than that , and far less eastern than finland or greece . 
  the term should n't apply to us . 
  even then our cultures have nothing similar with russians , belarusians , or ukrainians . 
  i do n't , it 's just simple non sense which was fallowed by your non sense . 
  do n't worry , i can catch sarcasm very well . 
  oh sure , give me a break , soviets would have invaded finland either way , after all they shelled their own troops to justify actions against finland . 
  alright mate , former spanish territory of portugal . 
  after all their king was also legally your king . 
  of course you 're not a nationalist , you 're die hard russian/soviet apologist that would love to lick stalin 's boot if he could before being sent to gulag . 
  you do realize soviets installed their pro commie puppets after take over of our countries , which issued latter to join ussr ? 
  after ww2 lithuanians and all of e. europe were stuck in partisan war against ussr rule for next 9 ~ years , lithuanian partisan war was specifically most brutal in the region . 
  soviets would torture first before disposing you . 
  they were the only ones that did n't want dissolution of ussr . 
   their culture reflects this period even today examples ? 
  why the fuck writing that we 're an ex-soviet republic matter in the first place ? 
  it 's not like we ran or did anything in ussr , we were occupied territory that was enslaved . 
  you do realize ussr send army , ditched our government , killed them in forests , installed their commie puppets which issued a latter to join ussr ? 
  what do you call it ? 
  will of the people ? 
  legitimate occupation and annexation ? 
  may i ask why the fuck soviet label matter in the first place ? 
  here is simplified version on how ussr occupied us . 
  after hitler gave ultimatum to give up klaip\u0117da region and after we refused to make an alliance and joint attack on poland to regain vilnius , germans pretty much lost any faith on seeing us on their side . 
  year later soviets gave their ultimatum to either let install few military bases with non-specified number of soldiers or be invaded , it was n't hard to choose because lithuanian army was filled with high command officers but what we lacked was lower rank soldiers , we did n't had the numbers to even stall the soviets and germany was already on our bad list as we were on theirs , so we choose strict neutrality and accepted the ultimatum , after that our authoritarian president who did n't want to kneel on soviet demands left the country as our legitimate government kept working , but they soon started to get ditched one by one by soviets and new pro-commie puppets started to appear , soon they replaced everyone , because of rigged elections , while they murdered any political opponent in most brutal fashion . 
   [ the soviets cut off tongues , ears , genitals , scalps , put genitals into mouths , picked out eyes , pulled off fingernails , made belts of victims ' skins to tie their hands , burned them with torches and acid , crushed bones and skulls , all done while the prisoners were still alive. , the organizers of the massacre included pyotr raslan , boris mironov , nachman dushanski , political leader of 8th border army mikhail kompanyanec , nkvd kretinga county deputy director yermolayev , nkvd lieutenant zhdanov and others . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rainiai_massacre ) after that they pretty much had control of the country and just issued paper to join ussr and well hell has started for our people before even nazis set foot to the point that nazis were seen as liberators . 
  they apologized for it on official level and now are one of the biggest investors in our countries . 
  give territories back to finland too . 
  you do realize we did n't join ? 
  we only accepted their bases to be on our soil , after that was ratified and their army was coming unopposed they soon ditched everyone from our legitimate government while our president fled to west and later usa , just to be burned alive in his own house by soviets spies . 
  while soviets installed their pro-commie boot lickers and those asked to join ussr . 
   according to the coroner 's examination after the exhumation , both the report and the testimonies of witnesses , concurred that ** the soviets cut off tongues , ears , genitals , scalps , put genitals into mouths , picked out eyes , pulled off fingernails , made belts of victims ' skins to tie their hands , burned them with torches and acid , crushed bones and skulls , all done while the prisoners were still alive ** . , the organizers of the massacre included pyotr raslan , boris mironov , nachman dushanski , political leader of 8th border army mikhail kompanyanec , nkvd kretinga county deputy director yermolayev , nkvd lieutenant zhdanov and others . 
  there is a reason lithuanians greeted nazis as liberators ... let 's not even begin what they done with second occupation . 
  half of poland was ethnically cleansed , half of germany was ethnically cleansed , deportations , 2 million women got raped by red army , they raped even female pow ... 
  even in the 90 's soviets did n't change , january events shows that very well , using tanks to crush un armed civilians . 
  former * people 's * republic of china you know , your government for sure makes it look like . 
  yeah i know that . 
  but still the point stands that we wanted to distance ourselves from poles as further as we could . 
  there are neither evidence nor facts about such agreement for `` no east ward expansion '' . 
   said agreement not to expand east ward in nato this is a myth , there was no such agreement . 
  besides it 's not up to russia which countries want to join nato . 
  then write it to mods instead of bitching it to me . 
  i mean geographical sub-divisions of ru fed . 
  specifically . 
  if you posted something from russian poetry , nature anything , that would be interesting . 
  the sub-divisions of ru fed . 
  do n't really matter since it 's only federation in name . 
  plus it shows russian occupied crimea . 
  that 's because he was [ polish-lithuanian ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polish-lithuanian_identity ) ( not in modern sense , rather that of british/roman etc. 
  well ... lithuania makes more sense to be rohan , since it was north of gondor . 
  we have similar flags [ [ 1 ] ] ( http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/lotr/images/d/de/rohan.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/250?cb=20110313203419 ) -  [ [ 2 ] ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/coat_of_arms_of_lithuania#/media/file:lithuanian_coat_of_arms_vytis._16th_century.jpg ) . 
  plus [ battle of kircholm ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_kircholm ) is like real life version of [ ride of the rohirrim ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emtz7eaylrs#t=3m30s ) given the ratio between the armies and tactic they used ( charging from the hill while shouting \u201e mu\u0161ki ! `` - `` attack '' , inducing fear ) . 
  we borrowed your alphabet to spite the poles . 
  but we 're known to be good at basketball . 
  except germans , because germans are cool . 
  lithuanians mostly go for exotic and warm places e.g. 
  thailand , greece , spain , turkey , egypt . 
  map you showed on this thread covers more than it should be , [ here ] ( http://i.imgur.com/xzyc6vu.jpg ) is a map comparing modern lithuania and old grand duchy of lithuania . 
  it has something to do with [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lithuanian_book_smugglers ) and [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lithuanian\u2013soviet_war ) . 
  the moment nazis rose to power we started prosecuting every single one of them during last 5 years before beginning of ww2 . 
  that 's one of the reasons why hitler gave up on achieving lithuania as an ally ( they took klaip\u0117da region from us and we refused to do a joint attack on poland from the north to regain vilnius region which we sought hard to recover ) and just sold us out to soviet sphere of influence for parts of poland . 
  k , time to conquer gudija . 
  our blood is closer to finns and estonians than to poles or russians . 
  check genetic make up , not history . 
  i agree with you , modern commie lovers are straight dumb . 
  excuse me ? 
  there were talks about join lithuanian-latvian state after regaining independence in 1918 but it was n't that much popular , polish-lithuanian war did n't help either . 
  china is far from communist , it 's more of hyper-capitalist dictatorship .

  pls let us into [ nordic ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nordic_council#members ) , we have been waiting forever . 
  the victory was unworthy and they failed their actual task - conquering whole of finland .

  i mean , lithuanian ulta nationalist will just talk about lithuania , he does n't care about poland , belarus let alone russia . 
  while polish ulta nationalist spit how great their country was , muh hussaria which over shadows [ lithuanian hussars ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_kircholm ) , poland is always white , never black . 
  i 'm perfectly fine with poles , i have many of them as good friends , but sometimes when i go through sub-reddits , i see so many `` modern lithuania is just samogitia '' ; `` modern lithuania is artificial nation , schizophrenic province of poland '' bs . 
  why you do this ? 
  you broke the [ nobles ' republic ] ( https://i.sli.mg/lwvwme.gif ) circle jerk . 
  that person just has anger issues , that 's all . 
  this guy , literally pm 'd me quote * `` go kill yourself '' * . 
  well we were last state in europe to adopt christianity . 
  and after that most of the nobles still kept being pagans even today we still have pagans . 
  that 's why we got poles on our side , they infiltrated all the strategic toilets , prepare for the original [ commonwealth ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polish\u2013lithuanian_commonwealth ) to kick your frencho-germanic ass . . 
  depends on a language , for lithuanians it 's easy to spell . 
  why is that ? 
  both ussr and tsarist russia were forcibly trying to russify the lands . 
  for us russia is same turks are for greeks .

  but he was doing things to improve the city from day 1 of being elected . 
  i think majority of people before the elections were worried he is n't going to fix things average person cares about since he is a millionaire , but now i think he would get re-elected again and again .

  he 's fixing everything in kaunas . 
  if one happens it will end in days . 
  north korea is all bark at this point , they do n't even have any real allies , china would n't go to war with usa for them .

  ledai is plural as is . 
  even greece managed to get something . 
  damn you guys got robbed by yourselves . 
  even if something happens in the next generation it 's not going to take a few years , it 's going to take decades . 
   that can change in just a few years . 
  no it ca n't . 
  you would need to wait for a whole new generation of people to get anywhere with a massive change like that . 
  even english would take a decade to settle in . 
  lukas is just a very basic name that 's also one of the saint 's names so grandmothers like it . 
  it 's actually decreasing in popularity http://image.prntscr.com/image/639e161ceedb479d91ec27d5a91a32d8.png l\u0117ja is definitely on the rise though . 
  most likely it 's because you do n't make sense . 
  accentuation slightly different . 
  in sentences it does n't really matter since it 's easy to tell which one it is , hard to mix up the two . 
   the locative differs , here , only in the stress pattern : in the locative , the form vaike is stressed on the ending : vaik\u00e8 , in the vocative , it is stressed on the root : vaike !, 
  yeah , so they take different places ? 
  it would be d\u017eeimsas if you were to do that . 
  but there are no rules as to how far you have to take it . 
  nowadays it 's being done less and less since more and more people know how to pronounce english names as is , the ending is only changed to make sense in the language . 
   jamesas would imply it being pronounced / jam\u02b2esas / , would n't it ? 
  it would , but it wo n't be if person reading knows how to pronounce english names . 
  like i said you can get away not changing the name at all , it just sounds very awkward when speaking lithuanian . 
  sophia/sofia and sophie/sofie are different names . 
  if you type yonaitis in google translate ( english ) it reads exactly how you would say jonaitis in lithuania . 
  unitas does n't sound at all like jonaitis to me even though it says it 's a phonetic transliteration . 
  sudeikis lucked out it sounds exactly the same in english . 
  jonaitis would be just similar to yonaitis . 
  unitas is not lithuanian at all . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/johnny_unitas are you related to him ? 
  there is no such thing over here so , yes . 
  also it 's just the word . 
  \u017dydras is just another way to say gay now . 
  we are n't hating the colour , you can wear pink or teal or whatever . 
  are you sure they did n't change it themselves ? 
  people do that so others do n't have to struggle getting their name right . 
  it sort of did mean that a while ago , but lithuania suffers from a case of mild/medium homophobia so it does n't now . 
   does lithuanian have personal pronouns ? 
  oh yes . 
  aka old name . 
  yes . 
  we even `` lithuanize '' other names like lebronas jamesas , because it sounds very wrong if we do n't when speaking lithuanian . 
  that makes him an honorary lithuanian . 
  he is not at all retired .

  we have access to the sea . 
  no sharks in it . 
  if we do it that way we would be fine with it . 
  yeah , but it 's castrated . 
  spain is just letting it die on it 's own , if you fight it too hard it might spring back . 
  like most other countries in the west . 
  price is similar compared to us . 
  that 's the thing with our language . 
  if you can say the alphabet you can say the words . 
  americans struggle to say \u017e ( zh ) turns into sh , io sound and long e 's . 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pobeyjotuaq but in general it 's not about the sounds they struggle to say it 's just that they have learned to pronounce letters themselves differently . 
  since in lithuanian every letter is read as it is written , while they sometimes snap into pronouncing it like it 's english . 
  moana was pretty good . 
  why ? 
  o is next to i, 
  did you google it before asking here ? 
  which one are we talking about now ? 
  wolverine ca n't come back from the dead anymore . 
  he used to be able to in few of the first comics . 
  deadpool literally ca n't die . 
  he was cursed to eternal life by thanos . 
  i think he removed the curse , but only very recently and i 'm not sure if that was in the main story of some spin-off . 
  it used to be chebureki , but now it 's below mediocre kebabs . 
  aka we do n't have that . 
  there are a couple of places i 've never been in . 
  so , no . 
  not really . 
  the third one is stupid as well . 
  as if majority of europeans know what american cities are like . 
  i have an old plan for just 7.82 eur which is : unlimited calls/sms + 5gb data . 
  however , since the roaming changes i will probably be forced to change once my plan ends next year and then it will be ~ 11-12 eur for similar plan . 
  that is indeed philosophical nonsense . 
  i do n't know what i expected . 
  but the thing is majority of estonian population still remembers soviet times . 
  the life in estonia is better than it has ever been and that life is in eu . 
  what you are proposing is to drop a good thing for some dream of an utopia . 
  essentially `` eu is necessary '' is a fact from a mind of an estonian , because there has never been anything better before it . 
   much like how you 're expected to believe that the earth is round . 
  now i ca n't tell if you 're trolling  they think that we absolutely need the eu to survive , they believe that everyone would become impoverished if we left the eu .

  it 's enough to prevent the ruskies from dicking around in our airspace .

  yeah allegedly really good movies can get standing ovations when the credits roll . 
  i 'm afraid people are playing down the anti-american feelings in the eu . 
  certain people , given the opportunity , may take it upon themselves to violently make fun of your american son , especially if they remember the presidency of george bush . 
  if you think your son can deal with these possibilities , then he may be suited to brave and survive in the desolate wasteland that is , the european union . 
  and to tip everyone . 
  and to shoot up the school . 
  and to clap in the movie theater . 
  and to be obsessed with his car . 
  but only able to drive automatic . 
  try more subtly . 
  when you come out guns blazing it immediately rings troll warning bells . 
  just say something like `` finally , some measures for combating the aids epidemic . '', 
  i see what you did there . 
  sweet notes regardless . 
  we finally won something !, 
  i honestly hope they get what they wish for . 
  note my flag . 
  yeah the baltic sea is freaking sweet in this . 
  if only ... 
  lithuanians are ... hiv resistant . 
  the hell ? 
   apparently they 're being forced to live like , shudder , eastern europeans . 
  this amuses me . 
  maybe they should take some cues from us . 
  trying to make best of a bad situation , working hard , practicing financial responsibility ( banks and credit cards are seen as somewhat evil or last resort here ) . 
   the policy of deliberately killing a nationality or ethnic group . 
  maybe not directly . 
  the siberian exiles heavily targeted the local intellectuals - business owners , land owners , writes , thinkers , political activists . 
  anyone or anything that could carry on the countries identity . 
  in return we got countless waves of russian migrants . 
  the intent was simple enough , just replace `` killing '' with `` destroying '' in that quote up there . 
  i 'm sorry for jacking the thread with my ramblings , but hopefully this will give readers here an insight on why this whole thing is a big deal for the baltic states . 
   the russians living in latvia are the result of a sustained and thankfully failed campaign to erase latvia , one of the worst kinds of crimes . 
  latvians are justified in trying to reverse that , and frankly they are being very fair about it all , as far as i can see . 
  very very well put . 
  i 'll add the exiling of 40,000 lithuanians to siberia , - a quarter of who were under 15 years old - onto the table . 
  i 'm not familiar if they pulled the same crap in latvia or estonia . 
  she can maintain any nationality she wants . 
  if she lives and operates within latvia , maybe it 's time to pick up some latvian instead of calling for a referendum to have russian made into a second state language . 
  you 're right . 
  i 'm kinda skewed towards my own situation . 
  i suppose if there 's been peaceful co-existence between two populations , there 's nothing wrong with having two state languages . 
  i hope you 're aware of the bloody history between russia and the baltics - in my case lithuania . 
  genocide is not something you can co-exist on . 
  if you spend your life in country x , maybe you should learn the native language ? 
  controversial opinion i know . 
  just an opinion . 
  do n't kill me . 
  you 're right . 
  it 's way worse in africa , so what happened in the baltics is completely meaningless . 
  all is forgiven . 
  look , if i lived in russia , i 'd learn russian . 
  if i wanted to speak lithuanian day to day , i 'd go back to lithuania . 
  good . 
   also , larger panel\u00e1k developments were n't planned only as a residential areas , there were also shops , some services , perhaps cinema or theater . 
  it 's true that these non-residential buildings are terrible , more terrible than any panel\u00e1k you ever saw . 
  but it 's there . 
  in the new development projects , there is nothing . 
  houses and parking lots , nothing else . 
  yeah , it 's so sad here . 
  i live in one of those places , there is nothing but a shop here . 
  my kids are going to grow up in a parking lot . 
   but because of the very fact of old soviet buildings disappearing due to their bad building quality . 
  you know the new buildings in some of the developments are n't better . 
  gypsum and styrofoam walls through which you can hear your neighbors breathe and cheap badly trained labor has made for some crappy buildings in vilnius . 
  i 'd rather live in a soviet panel house . 
  the college of siauliai university . 
  well it 's no mit but you 'll probably do fine there . 
   is it easy to travel outside of lithuania ? 
  i was looking at studying law in a european country and it is so hard to get into the eu if you do n't study there first . 
  i have no idea . 
  especially with a student visa . 
  as far as quick google searches , you can apply for a schengen area visa that will let you travel trough most of europe for 90 days . 
  what college are you going to attend ? 
  and yes if the courses are in english you 're probably off to a good start . 
  nah it 's good . 
  keep asking if you have questions . 
  as i said most 20-somethings have a rudimentary understanding of english and if you play your cards right - who knows . 
  your problem is that siauliai is a bit rural . 
  imagine getting stuck in the middle of the us south knowing no english , just spanish . 
  you can live decently for $ 5000 for 9 months with rent included . 
  we still use the litas , our economy is too crap to do otherwise . 
  honestly you may wan na consider india as i think you 'll find lithuania just immensely boring . 
  hey , lithuanian here , though i live in the capital , vilnius 1 . 
  english is taught as a second language at the moment , however a lot of people sail through high school with only a rudimentary understanding of it . 
  butt of many jokes in vilnius . 
  it might not be very friendly to a foreigner . 
  but i 've never been and i might be completely wrong . 
  it 's sort of like the deep american south . 
  i ca n't answer this one atm , i 'll give this one some google fu . 
  honestly i ca n't see you make more than pennies . 
  think $ 350 a month for a 40hr/week retail job . 
  if you 're lucky . 
  compared to europe yes .

  is there a video online ? 
  samogitia is one of the five ethnic regions of lithuania . 
  pretty weird to call lithuania - `` teutonia '' when only a small part of it was conquered temporarily .

  knowing one language is nothing to be proud of . 
  i do n't think you do , friend . 
  [ indigenous language ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/indigenous_language ) , [ native language ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/first_language ) . 
   share of the population stating they know at least one foreign language a study on english proficiency is an entirely different study . 
  ~ ~ basically everybody in ireland speaks a foreign language . ~ ~ it 's the indigenous language that is in danger . 
  no , if an irish persons speaks english from birth then it 's his native language by default . 
  a foreign language is a language not spoken in the native country of the person . 
  [ well , over 70 % of irish ca n't speak a foreign language ] ( http://www.thejournal.ie/foreign-languages-2548648-jan2016/ ) . 
  historical circumstances ? 
  everyone knows at least one foreign language . 
  in school you learn lithuanian ( obviously ) , english as a first foreign language and a second foreign language - german , russian or french . 
  in the prison of nations everyone had to learn russian and prior to that people used polish as lingua franca . 
  religion aside , no way estonians and lithuanians have the same word for `` wheel '' - `` ratas '' ? 
  and italy is not in nato and schengen ? 
  why are you comparing apples to oranges ? 
  if there was a civil war in russia we 'd be as flooded with eastern refugees as southern states with people from mena region . 
  there is no `` protection '' from refugees , we 're just geographically `` lucky '' in this case . 
  russia and belarus are functioning states , if there was a civil war there we 'd be just as flooded from east as are southern states from mena region . 
  there is no `` protected '' border and no common eu policy . 
  what op wrote is nonsense . 
   whether we protect them ( like the eastern ones currently are ) how is the eastern border protected by the eu ? 
  so now us will have to hack them in turn ? 
  you 're two years late, 
  thank you , belarus , for keeping the potato jokes alive for another year . 
  the other option would be to start a new life in russia from scratch . 
  so it 's an easy choice . 
  and start a nuclear apocalypse ? 
   crimea was important because it has a port with access to the mediterranean sea , and importantly , not frozen over in winter like the ones in estonia . 
  baltic ports never freeze during winter either , except for sheltered bays and shallow lagoons . 
   even then to get to the atlantic you have to pass inbetween denmark and sweden which means even if you were to get a port there , unless you were willing to invade denmark to maintain safe passage in the eventuality of war with nato it would be useless anyway . 
  and to get to the aegean sea you have to pass bosphorus controled by a nato member * which means even if you were to get a port in * crimea , * unless you were willing to invade * turkey * to maintain safe passage in the eventuality of war with nato it would be useless anyway * .

  politicians promise a lot of things electorate wants to hear during elections , but once elected they seem to forget about their promises . 
  talks do n't matter , actions do . 
  barely any comments , threads being posted hourly and nothing critical being posted ever .

  trump will take office only on january 20 . 
  so this imaginary trump administration is n't `` getting close to russia '' at the moment . 
  care to explain ? 
  and there 's no highlandian , samogitian , suvalkian , dz\u016bkian and memelian !, 
  that reminds me of the fact that albanian language family consists of a single language - albanian . 
  easy to consume joke and amusing to new users who did n't see it for the 100th time yet . 
  the populations of andora and usa do n't participated in direct democracy and do n't vote on matters in the un , representatives of their respective countries do that . 
  every country has the right to recognize or not to recognize a country no mater how small it is , it 's their choice . 
  people of andora do n't have the same voting power as usa , because neither us or people of andora vote in the un . 
  \\* colonized, 
  maybe because of the root word in ziemassv\u0113tku . 
  that would explain the different shade of blue . 
  what you described is n't a problem at all . 
  because everyone was so equal and free under previous system . 
  that 's hardly possible and would be problematic . 
  a lot of countries would n't exist on a map if that was the case because every country has an agenda . 
  lem me put it in other words . 
  you see kosovo as a separate state on maps because more than half of un members recognize it . 
  but fortunately locals themselves managed to do that instead ? 
  kosovo 's independence is recognized by 110 un member states , the accession of crimea into russia is recognized by 11 . 
  why be patient ? 
  we already know who 'll win . 
  is he taking putin with himself too ? 
  i 'm sure lukashenko could find like-minded friends in pis, 
   you do n't even fit in to baltic with that !, 
  remove finno-ugrian spy !, 
  no , we wish there was a sea between us . 
   but . . why compare us to the nazis ? 
  well , the formula goes like this : nazis = evil , if nato = nazis , then nato = evil . 
  nazis sought to exterminate russians and the victory against them is celebrated as the greatest thing ever to happen in their modern history since it was about the survival of their people from total extermination . 
  so take that inspiring event as an example and compare your enemies ( real or perceived ) to nazis and it becomes easy to rally the people against your enemy . 
  i agree , it 's hard not to sleep when there 's no real threat and you 're just there to sit through a presentation . 
  [ these are the faces of military officers being told that 4 thousand troops is a threat to the russian federation ] ( http://imgur.com/a/qtgke ) . 
  they would rather go home than listen to this nonsense . 
  either by someone who was recruited by russian intelligence or the computer network was hacked . 
  needs some explanation what it means for the lazy people . 
  '' ... the higher the score the better cardiac care a country has ... '' and etc. 
  at least lithuanian constitution prohibits having foreign military bases in lithuania 's territory , bad experience with them ... occupation and all that jazz . 
  to circumvent this we have nato troop rotations . 
  different nations send their troops to do military exercises or do air-policing missions and etc. , but they ca n't stay here permanently . 
  i know that but old prussians we 're as distinctive from lithuanians as latvians , with even more conservative baltic language than lithuanian might i add .

  we have some fairly good evidence that there are lots and lots of terrorists planning attacks in europe . 
  not many alternatives now . 
  the title is kind of shitty , i agree . 
  anyway , i have no strong feelings either way , lukoil has a few convenient locations ( it 's the closest filling station to my house , useful when i want a hotdog ) but other than that it 's meh . 
  a small apartment , a couple new-ish cars , bankrupt in a month . 
  ukrainians are fine , quite a few came to lithuania too . 
  they 're quite close to us culturally so it 's not an issue . 
  someone from pakistan is an issue . 
  eh , it 's [ not too bad . 
  ] ( http://i.imgur.com/ufihvnx.jpg ) it was way more depressing 15 years ago . 
  it would , and the government is helping people get these renovation projects going , to make them look more [ like this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/t3avfxf.jpg ) but majority of the people living in the building have to agree to it . 
  you still have to pay quite a lot . 
  it would pay off quickly due to significantly reduced heating costs and increased value but old people and poor families still object to it . 
  there are a few old and cranky grannies in my building , they object to pretty much everything . 
  that 's actually quite cool , / r/oldschoolcool . 
   they have a lot of parking spaaaaaace , over here they have none . 
  one in five families had a car , if not fewer , back when those buildings were built . 
  now most families have at least one , often two cars , so the lack of parking space is a nightmare in vilnius . 
  everything is actually much nicer on the inside . 
  i had a guest from the us a while ago , he was really surprised that all buildings looked like absolute shitholes ( the staircases too ) but inside the apartments were nice and modern . 
  oh for fuck 's sake , you two are actually arguing who hates russia more . 
  brand new , cheaper buildings are a lot more problematic . 
  those old soviet ones are actually fairly decent . 
  you ever been to any of the more crowded districts in vilnius ? 
  cheap , old and shitty chinese-made receivers usually can only receive one channel at a time . 
  with just one dish everyone in the building would have to watch the same thing . 
  we all have plenty of ugly grey apartment blocks , so instead i 'll show you our magnificent [ tv tower . 
  ] ( http://i.imgur.com/hidfiui.jpg ) looks like [ shit ] ( http://i.imgur.com/zjsifrx.jpg ) , but is actually fully functional , in decent condition and there 's a restaurant where all the tables [ move in a circle . 
  that looks just like any typical lithuanian residential area . 
   why ? 
  to make overweight people feel better about themselves ? 
  be careful , reddit admins do n't like this sort of attitude . 
  does n't matter , liberals will just keep repeating that terrorism has nothing to do with islam , not connected in any way whatsoever . 
  so lithuania would just stay lithuania ? 
  weird , i was pretty sure that we had some angry minorities here . 
  yes , i 'm pretty sure that you 're a typical sun reader . 
  did you just call yourself an idiot ? 
  all foreign-funded . 
  you can get a hostel in warsaw for # 6.08 ? 
  that sounds too cheap . 
  ah , so just using the opportunity to get into eu with the crowds of other migrants . 
  so it is n't anymore ? 
  i 'm just confused why it 's in the top5 in that list op posted . 
  is albania still a communist dictatorship ? 
  do they still have it ? 
  some obviously were , but it was really difficult and not many people could do it . 
  leaving the soviet union was difficult , just to be clear . 
  it was a bit like north korea these days . 
  if you leave your family/friends behind , then they will probably be interrogated , tortured or imprisoned for aiding you , even if they were n't . 
  how is that relevant ? 
  a few years ago poles were legally allowed to migrate and work , just as they are today . 
  romanians and bulgarians just recently were allowed to work freely , without seeking additional work permits . 
  many are lying about being from syria because that makes them much more likely to get asylum . 
  albania is not exactly at war , so you would be sent back . 
  it 's not just us helping us , we have foreign troops ( usually with jets ) stationed in lithuania all the time . 
  a whole bunch of americans has just arrived with tanks and armoured vehicles of all sorts a couple days ago , they 'll stay here for a few months . 
  yeah , we 're getting tired of that crap . 
  russia constantly blocks imports of some products from lithuania , and threatens to shut off gas . 
  at the moment most foods are banned , but in the past it was very common to ban chicken for a few weeks/months , or pork , or something else . 
  i think they banned flowers for a while , so lots of trucks ended up with tons and tons of flowers which were no longer good for sale . 
  we really do n't have much choice . 
  as someone else here said , if we do n't do something , who will ? 
  so we 're doing something , increasing the military budget , trying to reduce our reliance on russian natural gas , etc. 
  bought a [ new boat ] ( http://i.imgur.com/olkkzrk.jpg ) to bring natural gas from pretty much anywhere in the world . 
  there definitely wo n't be any sort of full ( or half ) scale invasion . 
  they could only do the same sneaky shit as in ukraine . 
  some random `` locals '' will start being oppressed , start a `` revolution '' and then declare their village an independent state , or something . 
  it was n't an exaggeration , i think many people were actually worried . 
  such drastic moves by russia , so close to us . 
  all baltic states are preparing for whatever russia will think of next . 
  we have just brought back mandatory military service , now we 're looking where to buy some new armored vehicles , guns , etc. 
  often there 's no sink with running clean water available when camping , so i do n't . 
  the state is , not the people . 
  because you 'll kill it ? 
  well then , it 's up to them to decide which side they want to take . 
  russia is obviously a land of great prosperity and innovation these days , would be hard to pass up such a treat . 
  sending all those poor families to ireland turned out to be a good decision . 
  now we look better in statistics maps . 
  it really has a lot to do with russia . 
  not many people would like to go back to the soviet days . 
  definitely better than that fodder from \u010cili , charlie or cancan . 
  the actual number of syrians is probably quite a bit lower , as many migrants throw away their passports once they get into europe , and then tell everyone that they 're from syria . 
  does n't matter . 
  we ca n't just take in everyone who 's having problems . 
  they found the gun in the same building . 
  they found and arrested him , no one got hurt . 
  over 3000 officers took part in this , so it 's definitely good practice . 
   ( why the hell do they even have it there ?? ), 
  cops were given aks because of the recent paris events . 
  i feel so much safer now . 
  there 's alaus studija in vilnius , they have lots and lots of different foreign beers . 
  high quality place , great food . 
  \u0160nekutis pubs have only lithuanian beer , also really good lithuanian food . 
  ignore this , guys . 
  surely there were just a few guys who were crazy fucknut islamists among all those soccer fans . 
  majority of them are nice people . 
  she argued that his blast did n't kill anyone , so it was clearly an accident caused by stress and he was always a really good kid and all that bullshit . 
  i think this is a pretty shitty fad . 
  like , do you absolutely have to change lighting or your fb profile pic to `` show solidarity '' ? 
  will the french think that you 're a giant asshole if you do n't ?

  this does n't change the fact that russians were literally imported with a sole reason of russifying the country . 
  also , as i already pointed out earlier , if russians in latvia and lithuania were not such a huge assholes , they could easily learn the local language and there would be no need for any referendums . 
  but no , they do n't even try learning on purpose , because they want to show that lithuanians are stupid and russians are smart and that russian language is the best in the world . 
  seriously , how is it possible to live in the country for decades and not learn the language ? 
  even kids who were born here still manage to avoid learning the language . 
   it 's funny that most places in africa still speak their colonial languages . 
  what does this have to do with colonies ? 
  are you saying that occupying other countries is a good thing ? 
  should it be used as an example of good politics ? 
  it was official language because russians occupied the country and killed everyone who disagreed , same as in lithuania . 
  i guess it 's not difficult to understand why latvians and lithuanians do n't like russia that much . 
  amazing history ? 
  yes . 
  calling our capital a property of poland ? 
  not so much . 
  if you decided to move to uk , would you still intentionally stick to russian language ? 
  would you avoid learning english at all costs , even after you lived there for a decade or two ? 
   curbing liberties is n't the right way to do it . 
  making russian an official language would be exactly that . 
  russia is evil . 
  soviets fucked things up so much that it will take many decades for us to recover . 
  if the bill passed , it would mean that russians have won . 
  there are literally thousands of exceptions . 
  in lithuania we have lots of russian and polish schools , all subjects there are taught in their language , rather than lithuanian . 
  naturally , many kids can speak lithuanian as good as i can speak spanish ( not very good ) . 
  hundreds ? 
  not at all . 
  soviet government literally imported lots of people to force lithuanians to assimilate to the russians . 
  edit : polish people are here also because they immigrated during the war and all those occupations . 
  many still claim that vilnius belongs to them , as they rightfully conquered it many years ago . 
  you see , the problem in the baltics is that russians here are assholes . 
  they do n't even try to learn the local language , * intentionally * . 
  some of them have been living here for decades , yet ca n't say much more than `` hello '' and `` goodbye '' . 
  seems like switching to the local language would mean accepting the defeat and giving up their history . 
  i really hope they will never pass that bill . 
  lithuania here . 
  after the fall of the soviets , government told all the russians and polish to either assimilate or leave . 
  some left , others took lithuanian citizenship and stayed . 
  however , they never assimilated . 
  there still are plenty of people who ca n't say a single word in lithuanian , even if they 've been living here for 30 years . 
  poles are now demanding to add polish letters to our alphabet and use polish street names where majority of houses belong to polish . 
  it 's the same occupation all over again , attempt to get rid of lithuanian language . 
  we already have more non-official-language schools than any other country in the world . 
  i would prefer it to stop here . 
  i doubt such union is possible , even hypothetically . 
  governments in some of the countries are just fucked up too much and i do n't feel like spending my taxes to cover debts of someone from another side of eu . 
  if we replace the governments , then all those countries will still need some governing power , as running the whole europe from brussels is just not possible . 
  obviously , those sub-governments will have to be elected . 
  that 's where we run into the main problem : people are stupid . 
  we would end up with the same nuts as we have today . 
  fun fact : we requested war reparations from russia after the soviet union collapsed ( for occupying us , sending thousands to siberia and all that ) but russia refused , claiming that we asked to be accepted into the soviet union and no one occupied anything . 
  they kind of forgot that part where unarmed people were going against russian tanks , which crushed them . 
  / lithuania, 
  being there as a tourist or in retirement is not the same as trying to raise kids and get a good job . 
  one needs very good language skills to pull that off . 
  more importantly , are you willing to learn ? 
  because if you 're not , then you 're left with old boring england . 
  i have never been to america . 
  it looks like the stereotypical image of americans being not very intelligent is quite close to truth . 
  op , watch [ this video ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b017j25v/art_of_america_modern_dreams/ ) and tell us what you think . 
  ok , i see where you 're coming from . 
  you believe that there are things worse than death . 
  i do n't think that torture is a good way of punishment . 
  wait , are you saying that criminals should not be punished in any way ? 
  it 's fine as long as we do n't let them interact with the rest of the society ? 
   why not lop off your head , then ? 
  again , investigation . 
  or did you question the decision of court when they killed hussein too ? 
  was there a possibility that he might have been not guilty ? 
   how much alcohol is sober ? 
  there are clear laws stating what concentration of alcohol in blood means `` drunk '' . 
   what if he did n't kill by pleasure but for some other reason ? 
  that 's why a proper investigation is needed , to find out whether he has a reason or if he is just crazy . 
   from how many people killed does it apply ? 
  one . 
   what if there 's a single imaginable possibility that you do n't know all the truth ? 
  again , investigation . 
   also , the justice system is n't there to take any vengeance . 
  it 's there to protect citizens . 
  you are just as secure with him dead or in a good prison . 
  it 's there not only to protect the citizens , but also to punish the criminal . 
  we can put him in a good prison in sweden , but you know how prisons are there , it 's like living in a hotel . 
  is it really that much of a punishment , if the only thing that the criminal loses is ability to freely move wherever he wants ? 
  he still would have all other joys of life , like interacting with friends , learning ( you can get a degree in most prisons in developed countries ) , watching tv and so on . 
   you ca n't be against death penalty while supporting it for some crimes that you think cross a line . 
  now you see , in this case the line is quite clear . 
  if one is intentionally killing lots of innocent people simply because he does n't like them , then it 's obvious that this person can not be fixed . 
  again , `` an eye for an eye '' applies here . 
  why should they be allowed to live when they ended lives of so many people ? 
  the main problem is that they did this intentionally , they knew what the result is going to be . 
  in some cases it is not a direct fault , for example some guy gets drunk , tries to drive his car home and hits a bus , killing a bunch of people . 
  it 's terrible , but the guy was n't intentionally trying to kill anyone . 
  in such case death penalty would n't make sense . 
  however if he was sober and intentionally tried driving on sidewalks and hitting people , then it would be a completely different situation . 
  sure , i do have my reasonable amount of doubts , but what if they are actually guilty ? 
  while i am not against the death penalty in this case , i do think that a proper investigation is required , since a shitstorm would happen if it later turned out that those guys were not the ones . 
  it 's quite likely that they were , though , since they would n't submit and accept the death sentence by being beaten . 
  i see no reason to let them live , to be fair . 
  `` an eye for an eye '' is not even strong enough , since they killed lots of people for fun , basically . 
  who can assure that they will not do the same if they will ever be released from jail ?

  hundred of thousands here is much higher percentage than in india . 
  and the second statement is not absurd at all , so yeah . 
  personally i do not despite muslims , but i despise islam . 
  dont take that for islamophobia though , i hate all religion . 
  i think religion is a mental defficiency . 
  but thats just my personal opinion and thats where it should end . 
  `` muslim brothers , your holy book literally tells you to kill every non-muslim , you are either an extremist or not a muslim . '', 
  data repeatedly shows that even second generation well integrated muslims in western country in majority support isis anyway , so what we do isnt going to change much . 
  the inherent problem is the ideology itself . 
  yep , everyone knows that was finland instead !, 
  / s ( but ye , finland joined the axis for the urpose of mutual defence against soviets ), 
  to me sounds like your cousin was trying to make a joke there . 
  a poor one but i dont think she really believes it . 
  it does not offend me when somone points out that my country has done shit things in the past . 
  what does offend me is when people claim that i am somehow responsible what my country did 100 years ago and must make reparations to the victims . 
  example : soviet union has usurped jewish land that it later sold to my granduncle who built a house on it and multiple generations of my family lived in there . 
  after soviet union collapsed the grandsons of those jews showed up demanding that the land , with the house on top of it , would be given back to them . 
  alas it was soviets , not germans that did this and as such our government didnt feel a need to pay reparations . 
  marriage is one of possible ways to get eu visa . 
   but why not ? 
  in eu this is super easy - you can only hold your old citizenship , or apply for the new one after a few years , or apply for dual citizenship . 
  dual citizenship is nonsense . 
  you can either be a citizen of x or of y , not both . 
  dial citizenship is just a way to inflate your population statistics to not look like your loosing people to emigration . 
  its worth noting that in the last 10 years a quarter of quebec population migrated there from france , so a lot of people find it very attractive . 
  there are two types of emigration here : 1 . 
  brain drain . 
  good quality specialists are migrating westwards . 
  primary reason for that is wages . 
  they can do the same job , get paid 5 times more and live in a better society . 
  most of them never come back . 
  society doesnt know they exist and think most emigrants are the type number 2 . 
  uneducated , unemployables . 
  they are usually the lowest rung of society that is capable of traveling west for emplyment . 
  they tend to work in low end jobs , often illegally and send money back to relatives in lithuania . 
  they are highly prone to crime , especially stealing . 
  they intended and often do come back , but most go back west soon after because they cant find income here . 
  society both are jealous and despises them at the same time . 
  they are . 
  you seem to be the misinformed one . 
  i have never been to t_d so i got no idea how their mods behave . 
  au\u0161tai\u010di\u0173 is what is considered proper lithuanian that is taught in schools . 
  other dialects are not acceptable in official documentation . 
  personally i think dialects is stupid . 
  i dont believe there was anything significant in my country since that date thats worthy of history books 30 years from now . 
  at least nothing that isnt just part of a much bigger picture such as the russian propaganda thats been going on for years , ect . 
  just nuke belgium , make it impossible to invade radiactive wasteland . 
  that will teach them !, 
  well , he is from sweden , so for the most part , it is . 
  so , ill pose two opinions . 
  one from my country and one from myself . 
  in lithuania we are moderately patriotic however significant influence from us culture has made us less so and more acepting of us culture than our old one . 
  however because we have a uniting boogeyman that is russia nationalism is still strong as it is required to retain sovereignity from the soviets . 
  from me personally , i am not patriotic at all . 
  i am a cultural imperialist . 
  i think we should pick the best parts of cultures around the world to create one superculture that is the most beneficial to its inhabitants and spread this culture across entire world , by force if necessary . 
  the two are same thing . 
  i dont see what you dont udnerstand . 
  a bunch of muslim extremists are killing sikhs that now number in hundreds of thousands . 
  its not my modiji , im not indian . 
  i dont know why he would claim that though as it has nothing to do with islam . 
  well you know what they say , you have to weak makeup for camera , and there are a lot of cctv cameras in britain :d, 
  shit , i just got a new show to add to my watchlist !, 
  no , i stopped watching eurovision in 2008 . 
  it became a shitshow of politics and horrible mangled sounds that people call music somehow . 
  the problem is proving that he discriminated it based on your nationality and not , say , how your face looked . 
  the sad thing is that your colleague was probably right . 
  it took until mid 00s for most people i meet online not imediatelly go `` soviet union '' when i tell them where im from . . you 're not the only ones . 
  can you explain to me why thats a thing ? 
  why confuse you to think i speak french if i only know 1 word ? 
  wouldnt showing you upfront the language i can communicate via be more desirable ? 
  sure , as soon as a better organization happens . 
  we started using euros last year . 
  it was the first time i could travel without exchanging currecy . 
  very handy . 
  while lack of tarifs sure is nice , shipping to eastern europe is highway robbery . 
  as somone whose job involves following eu reglamentation and at one point even helped translate one of them - i would pose severe doubt on the quality of translation to local languages , at least when it comes to smaller languages . 
  a lot of it looses its meaning when you read the translated version . 
  corn syrum is the most common substitide for honey and basically any sweets in us . 
  they produce a lot of corn there . 
  i wouldnt consider this a minor thing but hell yeah we are leading the world in green energy . 
  i would argue differently regarding colonies . 
  my experience with african colonies at least is that we built a lot of infrastructure for them that they use to this day . 
  worth noting that they only started offering those planes when eu announce its decision regarding that . 
  before it was still pricey to use your phone abroad . 
  yes , sadly there are people who think non-nationals deserve some special treatment because they are so inferior they can not live without being cuddled . 
  yes , you should definatelly remove non-polish schools in poland as well . 
  bi-language schooling system is a leftover from soviet union . 
  it doesnt exist elsewhere . 
  but then wouldnt that just be a redundant nato ( ignoring that there are a few eu countries not in nato ), 
  but you need more and more power for it to succeed nowadays . 
  for one , conspiring no longer can just be done in a basement of your friend , you also have to find a way to completely remove government surveilance from your meetings without raising suspicion about surveilance removal . 
  secondly , as weapons get more and more automated and powerful , less people are able to stop larger groups if they have the technological superiority . 
  storming military barracks and stealing thier guns worked in french revolution . 
  good luck doing that to a modern military base . 
  in bigger ones youll be moved down by automated turrets without human soldiers having to lift a finger . 
  if the higher ups are communists and majority of people are communists then there is no need for a revolution to turn things communist , though ? 
  as far as welcoming and occupation , id like to think people learned about that one last time my country did this , but i know they didnt . 
  ghadaffi was overthrown solely because the rebels got support from abroad . 
  without it they would have been crushed .

  whe are beastuania when it comes to internet speeds . 
  a bit more like middle eastern stand-off . 
  obviously porn . . 
  well all estonians live on the internet , where we have a lot of people who would struggle to find a browser . . 
  that is how revolutions start . 
  eastern europe is pretty much florida of eu . 
  is n't florida a fictional place with a villain called florida-man running wild ? 
  damn that is way worse , at least here no one got hurt . 
  and in general i believe that this incident actually benefited us , police can now look at what they do wrong and correct itself ( of course that will happen . . ) without any harm done to people . 
  accidental exercise . 
  i was really hoping that it might be not real and just an joint police and aras exercise in case of emergency . 
  i was not saying that they did not have them earlier , but they were given out to way more policemen than usual recently . 
  i am quite chill , that was just a joke . 
  i think that my country might just be mental . 
  usually , in normal countries , police tries to take automatic riffles away from people , our police are giving them away . 
  usually most of bars will have potatoes , you are fine . 
  apparently he worked mostly on bmw cars , this might explain why so many of them crashed into bus stops recently , it is all according to keikaku !, 
  it is just hard to understand how is this happening , some random drug addict with mental issues can outrun and hide from all of the police . . 
  dude , we live in eastern europe . 
  so ... apperantly #prayforvilnius is spreading , and this video is also pretty common https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghxqiittttu&amp;app=desktop , this whole thing is so crazy . . 
  i think that he might be some super spy from uk . 
  i hope not , apparently they handed out ak-47 to police yesterday because of the paris events and heightened danger . 
  magic !, 
  the ak was in the police car , how did it exactly go we might never find out . 
  i thought shit like that can only happen in movies . . 
  we also have china 's athlete factories which might not use doping but could also be considered unhealthy for athletes . 
  soviet brainwash is lingering on . 
  he is american , he would die if he did not tip . 
  that 's why i ca n't call myself lithuanian , i hate both of those . 
  pretending that you know something is basically the key element of politics . 
  guy probably lives in the colonies . 
  do n't forget the terrible food . 
  yea i realized that from source of that comment , but just weird way to code text bolding . 
  edit : why does hashtag make the words bold . . 
  that would not be easy to afford for a lot of people in ee . 
  come on everyone knows toilet water is best water . 
  so that is where the secret cia prison is !, 
  i think that guy is trolling . 
  he ca n't be serious . 
  we like to pretend that that is not vilnius . 
  i always found this building intimidating . 
  quite fitting place for them . 
  pretty cool how fast some of the things are build . 
  sad that renovations are lagging all the time though . 
  those renovation companies are so mismanaged . 
  glad that my apartment block got finally renovated and it is definitely huge improvement in how much heat remains inside . 
  the annoying thing is that them running away is going to add additional costs and draw of resources when they already were given so much . 
  i think it really depends on the city . 
  hey no spoilers , i am still not sure it is him . 
  oh so that is why it seemed so familiar . 
  and why they used hitler so casually . 
  that portrait of hitler was hilarious . 
  interesting that they used him the way they did . 
  poor russian warship , being bullied by tiny malta . 
  drifters have pretty interesting concept , pretty decent animation and fun action scenes . 
  though it is not perfect i have been enjoying it a lot . 
  the problem is that lending to russia is not as attractive as to other high spenders . 
  obviously us baltic countries are plotting to topple down russia again . 
  yeah , did n't india recently send strikes against `` terrorists '' in pakistan ? 
  can there be more than 20 parties making it possible for non of them beat the threshold ? 
  that 's because he takes into account russian regions which are not in russia , like crimea . 
  seems a bit impractical and uncomfortable to use though . 
  it is like asking fish not to swim . 
  luckily he is very rich now . 
  yea but i am not sure how much nato can rely on turkey . 
  that is almost how brexit went . 
  they are silly people . 
  we decided that it 's a silly sport . 
  they were also the ones who were holding us back . 
  nah , we need to turn them into a snowglobe . 
  the problem is that we have snow but we do not have mountains . 
  heck we had to build some http://www.skiresort.info/ski-resort/snow-arena-druskininkai/ . 
  yea , the dumb media is full of segments about this . 
  yea , we only hate local poles . 
  i am pretty sure that this will actually increase costs for them in the long run . 
  lower than 3 % is bad . 
  that at least explains why are they all so extreme in the same direction . 
  no shit . 
  like what the hell are these newspapers . 
  they get posted here with their crazy covers so often . 
  are these some kind of fringe newspapers ? 
  has been raining whole day , still surprised that there is quite a bit snow left . 
  looks nice , but this creates so much waste . 
  difference is couple of thousands of nukes . 
  pretty nice , but red tide is coming . 
  our diets are also pretty crappy . 
  but why would anyone open door for random people ? 
  it just does not make sense . 
  you never know who they might be . 
  ignore that part , we have had u\u017egav\u0117n\u0117s for a long time which is essentially halloween just more for the kids and the masks are creepier and this might have more impact on peoples acceptance to halloween . 
  ah brings back good memories , saaremaa is such a great island to travel to , lots of small things to explore and good place to go camping . 
  though i think there was no water when i was at the crater , might be remembering incorrectly . 
  more like icarus . 
  surely sabas is more famous . 
  have you seen how stupid the sample size is ? 
  also if you checked you would see that syria is the top1 as the # 1 threat with 6 fucking votes . . 
  though the latest data is from 2013 . 
  i have degree in statistics and that is probably worst survey i have seen . 
  results are literally worthless with sample sizes like that . 
  you clearly have n't . .

    nato came in and fought on the side of the albanian militant groups , and ultimately carved up serbia . 
  because you started it with oppressions and executions . 
  what did you expected , that they would side with you ? 
   something you are probably going to see from russia soon in your country , or worse . 
  impossible as much as you wished for our nation annihilation . 
   i 'll probably feel some empathy , even though i 've seen many of your countrymen justify what nato did to serbia . 
  where , when , what ? 
  it 's not justified , but it 's also wrong to blame nato for keeping your teeth from innocent people . 
   the nato bombing of serbian infrastructure lasted for 90 days . 
  ** by that time we could have wiped out every single albanian civilian in kosovo if we wanted to ** . 
  oh guess why you did n't , if it was n't for nato you would done that , if that 's what you 're saying ? 
  you really disgust me . 
   if there was a will to commit genocide , genocide would be committed . 
  serbians were already committing genocide . 
  it does n't matter how much we prepare , russia can steam roll us ( nation of 3 million people will not stop a nation of +140 million people ) . 
  what we need is to make sure that europe and especially usa stand besides us . 
  well , it 's not trump that made us wake up , but russian aggression towards it 's neighbours . 
   your choice only depends on the good will of others who would allow you that choice . 
  neither russia , nor usa , nor eu are the ones that command what we can and what we can not . 
  treaties can be amended or withdrawn from . 
  which is unlikely given usa 's and europe 's history . 
   if the russians , or somebody else was to attack , i would ' t lift a finger for either side . 
  nobody forces you to begin with , we do n't need cowards . 
   i have nothing against your existence , nor do i think russia would have any benefit if they were to enslave you . 
  i also do n't think us benefits by promising to defend you against such a thing . 
  when why are you so keen on dismantling nato ? 
  why are you so keen for usa resources to be used in middle east or elsewhere than [ baltic states ] ( https://c2.staticflickr.com/6/5703/22413217086_7499d841c4_o.jpg ) ? 
  ( even then they have like what ? 
  4k soldiers here , that 's nothing when you look at usa 's budget , those are cents for them ) where soldiers have 0 chance to die unless russia goes full retard and invades us . 
  it 's not up to you what america 's foreign policy is any way so your opinion is irrelevant any way . 
   nato is the biggest threat to my home . 
  and why is that ? 
  because they stopped [ serbia ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nq_j2c6hrz0 ) from being a genocidal nation ? 
  if you have n't done such radical things nato would n't have put a finger on you , action have consequences . 
  that 's the same reason we joined nato , to not be occupied by russia , just look at modern russian federation , it 's only federation in word , every single piece of land that is non-russian gets fully russified . 
  it has been done since mid xix c. , in lithuania people would get hanged , lithuanian language , literature , latin alphabet , catholicism was banned . 
  soviet union did same shit with their sovietizination policy that was a bit slower russification than russian empire used . 
   so you 're fine with nato unilaterally decided to attack a country , as long as you like the reason ? 
  no , i do not like , my country was not part of nato at that time , so it has nothing to do with it , but to stop aggression you have to use aggression . 
   it 's questionable would it fuck anything really . 
  you 're not exactly an economic powerhouse . 
  most of the countries are not , so what ? 
  does that mean we have no free choice that we should be absorbed by larger neighbour and accept their language , culture and values ? 
  because if so , i 'm all for european federation , for anything else we will stayed independent . 
   the us can choose whether they want to defend korea or taiwan separately . 
  it has nothing to do with you . 
  they 're have same treaties with usa that protects them from more militaristic neighbours that want to threaten them with invasion , just like us . 
   as for the eurozone , how would not helping you make the us an enemy of the whole eurozone ? 
  who needs who more ? 
  usa and eurozone will not be enemies , russia and eurozone will become enemies if russia thinks that invading a european union country is perfectly okay ...  did you just say you hate me ? 
  harsh , i do n't know how i 'm going to live that one down . 
  you show hate towards me and my country , saying that we do n't deserve to exist and should be on our knees towards russia . 
  does n't really put nice feeling toward you after this . 
   i do n't care if you 're enslaved , and i think the americans are slowly understanding that they do n't care either . 
  it 's certainly going to be an interesting time for you . 
  yes you do , you trying to hardest to spew anti-nato sentiment in reddit . 
   that 's funny considering nato 's offensive actions . 
  after your fellow serbians started to slaughter innocent people left and right . 
   again , the alliance is meant for people to be safe in the region , to deter potential wars . 
   if russians roll in and take your country tomorrow , why should the us care ? 
  what do they lose ? 
  they would lose whole nato , china will able to roll over taiwan , north korea can roll over s. korea , why would usa help these tiny nations after all ? 
  besides we 're part of eurozone , that would fuck whole eurozone , gj you just made sure major part of europe is your enemy . 
  russia 's leadership are not idiotic . 
  besides you literally have nothing to do with nato , you do n't even live in nato country , you do n't even live near russia , you 're not a guy whose family members and their friends were out right slaughtered in forest , deported to siberia , without return , or pulverized by tanks . 
   i do n't hate russia or russians , but their leadership and useful idiots like you who apologize their invasion and other bs around the globe , who wants other nations to be enslaved . 
   it obviously is , considering what they did to ukraine and georgia . 
  nobody wants them now . 
  which is why people rush into nato , they do n't want to end up like ukraine and georgia , being ally of russia means being permanently on your knees sucking , else you will get stick shoved up your ass . 
   but , i was n't talking about that . 
  what i wanted to say is that it 's certainly up to the west which countries are going to have their protection . 
  i see a lot of noise coming from the baltic states , but i 'm not sure what do they bring to the table exactly . 
  our noise is to not trust russia , plain and simple , we do n't want war , we just want to be left alone , but russian government are way too clingy . 
   is n't it completely natural for americans to ask themselves would they really risk everything to defend these states ? 
  if they do n't defend us they risk far more . 
  you join army with a fact knowing that you might die in a battlefield . 
  better question is why should russians die for putin 's desire to stay in power and keep lobbying it 's fellow countrymen ? 
  nato is a defensive military alliance created purely for making regions as stable as possible . 
   would they us do that if they did n't think it was beneficial for themselves ? 
  stable europe is one of many usa 's priorities . 
   the great powers also have a choice of whom they 're going to let into their sphere of influence , and whom they 're going to promise protection . 
  it 's not up to russia which countries want closer ties with west , you can show up that `` muh sphere of influence '' up your ass this 21th century , stop living in the past , russia 's glory , if it ever existed , is over . 
   what they see as their rightful sphere of influence they go fuck themselves with a stick in ass , we do n't belong to them and will never will . 
  people would rather set themselves on fire than live through the shitholish totalitarian regime . 
   but did n't give us any money or resources postwar they wanted to , but ussr forced everyone to refuse the marshal plan . 
  i hope the first but not the latter . 
  latvia and especially lithuania is going to reach it in few years . 
  peter the great is well known figure because he 's the only russian leader that was most europhilic . 
   wait , what happened to `` america did nothing during wwii and just showed up late , fuck amerikkka ! '', 
  we hoped americans will show up first than soviets , we did n't expect them to go to war with soviets . 
  we do n't hate america , they did n't recognize baltic occupation by ussr . 
  -  but still the us should have stayed out of europe in wwii , lets the russians take it for all i care . 
  when after first soviet occupation nazis were greeted with flowers and people shouting that they liberated us from evil you know something is fucked up in the commie regime , here is a glimpse of glorious soviet army first occupation :   according to the coroner 's examination after the exhumation , both the report and the testimonies of witnesses , concurred that ** the soviets cut off tongues , ears , genitals , scalps , put genitals into mouths , picked out eyes , pulled off fingernails , made belts of victims ' skins to tie their hands , burned them with torches and acid , crushed bones and skulls , all done while the prisoners were still alive ** . , the organizers of the massacre included pyotr raslan , boris mironov , nachman dushanski , political leader of 8th border army mikhail kompanyanec , nkvd kretinga county deputy director yermolayev , nkvd lieutenant zhdanov and others . 
  2 million german women were raped by red army , even non-german women who got released from prison camps were raped by red army . 
  * better dead than red . 
  * - i 'm more than happy that americans stayed in europe , it made sure that w. europe was not over run by ussr and was not made the same economic and social stagnated shit hole that ussr ruled e. europe become , thank god it ussr is long gone and we 're part of both eu and nato that not only improves our economy greatly but also makes sure we 're safe from any potential aggressor ever again . 
   i do n't give a fuck about russian expansion , it has nothing to do with me or my country . 
  then stop spewing hatred towards nato . 
  you 're free to live in a country that is not part of nato . 
   we should not risk one life on it .

  \\* sigh \\* ... to the headsman 's block !, 
  was it this [ one ? 
  it 's been confirmed on news that conscripts wo n't go for training in other countries . 
  cut the rest of the curonian spit for us , will ya ? 
  for the love of perk\u016bnas , just summon the fucking snakes and be done with this . 
  we all love each other < 3, 
  as far as i 'm aware , latvia does n't have direct presidential elections like we do . 
  the parliament elects the president . 
  i 've been thinking about the same idea for a while now , but i 'm too lazy to do anything . 
  sorting traffic cones by age is so german i ca n't believe . 
  this is the best series in a while , keep them up , we need more countries !, 
  you make me want to try and go to prisma again . 
  how 's prisma ? 
  is it the best retail chain in finland ? 
  we have a ton of prismas here but i 've only been once and it seemed like they have less product variety , and it was a hypermarket . 
  ** you forgot lithuania you bastard !!, 
  ** also , [ chocolate naive ] ( http://www.dansu.lt/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/181_880-700x438.jpg ) for all you posh cunts !, 
   pole , reigned by :  an elected person checkmate america . 
  edit : lithuania was part of the commonwealth back then so what is polish is also lithuanian muahaha !, 
  or it would be if it were n't posted on april fools . 
  baltic megalomania explosion incoming !, 
  any fans of vilnius trolley line 1 and line 7 ? 
  this is so accurate . 
  i had the ` pleasure ' of travelling to helsinki by ferry a few years ago . 
  literally anything can and will happen there !, 
  the infernal noah 's ark of gambling, 
  our legendary historical expansion and medieval multiculturalism and tolerance . 
  our uniting sport - basketball . 
  our growing economy and quality of life . 
  our freedom that we were n't given , but fought for . 
  that enough is something to be truly proud of my country . 
  but i also feel like a european and i believe that we are culturally and socially close enough to identify as * europeans * as well as our own nationalities . 
  yeah , having a ton of lakes and lots of urban forests is a huge bonus any time of year . 
  during cold winters , the forests are very relaxing and shelter you from wind . 
  lakes provide an awesome extreme ice fishing experience . 
  in summer , forest-parks offer a ton of shade and a quiet , fresh place to chill . 
  and lakes ... lakes are a godsend during july/august draught season ( i really dread calling it like that , but if it returns for the third consecutive year , i will really start to think that we 're becoming slightly more subtropical . 
  if it 's going to be week-long 38 \u00b0 c like it was in 2015/2014 , i am going to die .

  there points to be made about both sides . 
  please use lithuania and not you , while i understand what you meant to say , it nevertheless feels accusatory . 
  now then , my own beliefs on the matter : yes , poles have a right to be poles . 
  however , ** anyone ** living in the country for more than a few decades , without learning the local language is perceived negatively and as being disrespectful . 
  the russians left from the cccp era , the english businessmen , that goes for everyone , not just the poles exclusively . 
  if you 're no longer a guest , start learning , i do n't care if you 're not fluent but get to at least a conversational level . 
  most lithuanians do not consider that to be optional . 
  as for anything else you said , i honestly have no issues with it . 
  i have very few fucks to give if some sign has a crossed l on it alongside the lithuanian word . 
  i would n't like for that to be made the default system ( polish minorities are very regional and effectively non-existent in say northern lithuania ) , but if a community requests something to be added to specific signs , you 're free to do so . 
  most of the issues with that hail from the lithuanian language committee ( i 'm not sure how they name themselves in english ) , and as a lithuanian , i myself have enough of a beef with them as it is . 
  as a researcher , they are a somewhat persistent nuisance to me as well . 
  not really , no . 
  english has very soft consonants , while lithuanian has very hard ones . 
  speaking lithuanian with an english accent basically sounds like you 've bit your tongue . 
  hitting a rock once damages it a bit , but that 's about it . 
  hitting a rock repeatedly in succession , even with smaller blows , will shatter it . 
  an election by itself ca n't do that , however , an election in the midst of a lot of other shit can . 
  brexit/the refugee crisis/general problems with the mediterean economies combined have shaken the eu quite a bit . 
  if we get another few decades of `` nothing happening '' i 'd say that it would return to the point where the answer would be no . 
  hmm . 
  poland/russia/teutonic order throughout history , that 's about it really . 
  we 're pretty much neutral to poland , if not positive . 
  friendly from the point of a lot of shared history , some antipathy does , however , exist in specific regions due to some 20th-century nonsense and some polish communities who do n't know the adage `` when in rome , do as the romans do '' . 
  but beyond this , i 'd say our position towards them is rather a friendly one . 
  russia , trading partner . 
  that is about all the positives i can say about our relation . 
  our position towards them is pretty much `` the enemy we ca n't do shit about , but grind our teeth and wait for a brighter future and hope that they wo n't fuck with us '' . 
  not exactly friendly . 
  if i 'm being completely honest , russia is basically our boogeyman . 
  i suppose i should take the germans over the teutonic order , as it does n't exist anymore . 
  honestly , ca n't say anything bad about them . 
  the general perception of them is a very positive one . 
  to be fair , different cultures different outlooks . 
  the only reaction i can imagine from the stereotypical lithuanian to a gay pride parade is `` get these perverts off the streets '' . 
  the only thing i can see it doing is making them more isolated . 
  faina/as is used here as well, 
  i did n't do languages in my gymnasium classes . 
  i pretty much went full in into stem . 
  so i ca n't really comment on the final grades . 
  generally speaking , it 's lithuanian authors and european classics , such as don quixote / kafka 's metamorphosis etc. 
  i do n't really think i even remember something from american literature . 
  here are two lists , the first one is a schools required reading list for the gymnasium classes http://www.antakalniovm.vilnius.lm.lt/index.php/pagalba-mokiniui/literaturos-sarasai-5-12-kl the second one is the recommended reading list for grades 5 to 12 . http://www.mindaugo.vilnius.lm.lt/images/2015-2016/dokumentai/rekomenduojam%c3%85%c2%b2_perskaityti_knyg%c3%85%c2%b2_s%c3%84ra%c3%85_as_5-12_kl_.pdf i have no intentions of translating the titles , but you can get a sense from the authors list . 
  ech , i suppose so , i am 26 . 
  that 's a very friendly demographic where `` technophiles '' are concerned . 
  really ? 
  i see flagships a plenty . 
  well , not iphones , but still , the samsu\u016bng s phones are very common . 
  that period is generally referred to as the wild west in here as well . 
  basically , anything goes , no real government regulation to speak of . 
  words are n't static and meanings change from place to place , from era to era . 
  i doubt `` nazi/fascism '' means the same thing to a german and someone brought up in polynesia . 
  it claimed that what it was doing was communism to its citizens , that 's all we need to hate it . 
  to be fair , `` communism '' is viewed by young educated people here in mostly the same way you view `` rape '' , `` manslaughter '' . 
  it is not a term that has * any * positive connotations to us . 
  most societal problems are generally referred to as `` leftovers of communism '', 
  we do n't care . 
  `` communism '' is synonymous with the cccp to us . 
  when discussing communism , we discuss the cccp . 
  siblings - names/nicknames . 
  mom/dad - mom/dad grandmother/grandfather - grandma/grandad kid to older members - maam/uncle adult to adults - name that is if we use pronouns , pronouns , on the whole , can generally be omitted in lithuanian , only a verb is necessary to have a a valid sentence . 
  not rednecks per say but we do have localized gopniks . 
  \u0160iauliai , kaunas ir panev\u0117\u017eys is known as `` gez\u0173 trikampis '' basically the gopnik triangle . 
  other than that , the villages are n't exactly held to high regard . 
  tried some ended up with a lot of `` not available in your region '' and went `` fuck this '' spotify is nice , but i do n't really listen to enough music to have it run permanently . 
  so i had it for a bit over a year and decided that it 's just not worth it . 
  traditional names - yes . 
  all soviet depictions , in public areas , are banned . 
  i grew up in a relatively multicultural environment , so while i 'd like to give a sob story about learning a lesson , the only thing i can say is `` more of the same '' i guess the only real change is that i now think about nations that are more removed from me than i did before . 
  i certainly do n't lean left by ** our ** standards ; if anything , i 'm centre-right . 
  the problem is that what you call `` the right '' is what we refer to as `` the lunatics '' . 
  there 's a joke ( not the actual etymology ) about the lithuanian word for germany - vokietija , where a german is vokietis . 
  if speaking in a dialect , `` vo ans kiets '' or the shorter version `` vo kiets '' basically means `` that one hard '' or equivalently `` that 's a badass '' . 
  so jokingly , we named the germans after some badass . 
  i 'm not actually certain what the real etymology for the word is . 
  i visit them about 5-6 times a year . 
  i call basically every week . 
  that 's the honest answer . 
  while you probably would n't have many issues with the youth in richer/more educated areas , the public *** at large *** is not welcoming . 
  a piece of legislation outlying the rights of an employee vs the rights of the employer . 
  i 'd say lgbt rights . 
  paid education , work codex reform ? 
  i 'm not really sure . 
  grannies and grandpas are economically socialist and socially conservative . 
  the 40 somethings are a bit of a mix economically and are socially conservative . 
  young people are socially liberal , economically socialist if they 're from poor areas and economically liberal if they 're from rich areas . 
  these are my impressions . 
  in general as a 26 year old young specialist living in the capital , most of the people i interact with and my friends are classical liberals . 
  i imagine that position would change quickly if i was living in a dieing little town having nothing to do and no money . 
  to be fair , i do n't imagine sweden having a section of the population that are `` prisoner idolisers '' . 
  the americans have their wannabe gangsters and us post bloc countries have gopniks . 
  generally speaking anything that 's popular with that lot becomes inversely popular with the people that are n't like them . 
  hell , a track suit , if you are n't in a gym or in the middle of a jog is an ideological statement here . 
  and an ** excessive ** amount of tattos is basically associated with the aforementioned groups . 
  honestly my impression is of something like 1/3 fit , 1/3 chubby and 1/3 overweight . 
  basically all three types are common enough to where you do n't really notice them that much . 
  as for the `` i need a scooter to move '' fat , have n't seen one yet . 
  and lastly , as for fat shaming , we fat shame . 
  relatively openly , however most comments are basically in the `` i need to lose some weight '' style of self-deprecating humor by hte fat people themselves . 
  the people you have no connection to will rarely comment on it , unless they 're really drunk or you 've pissed them off .

  they cut a priests head off . 
  when do the games start ? 
  that 's what happens when you eat too many kebabs . 
   please tell me a viable solution if you have so many . 
  setting up refugee camps in surrounding countries , helping to fund them when necessary . 
   but do n't forget most refugees are innocent . 
  innocence does not merit integration into european countries . 
  sure we can help , but funnelling them into europe where so many are clearly dissatisfied is not a long term solution . 
   most refugees are in fact still in the neighboring muslim countries . 
  check your facts . 
  yeah facts do n't lie . 
  saudis arabia , qatar , kuwait , uae , all did n't take any refugees , arguably the leaders in the region . 
  and of course , no syrian refugees in israel . 
   ca n't blame people for wanting the best for themselves and their families . 
  where does aid end and entitlement begin ? 
  i want a lot of things , does n't mean i earned them . 
   we are part of the problem . 
  aaaand here it is folks . 
  the white guilt bullshit . 
  you are n't responsible for the actions of a people inclined towards religious violence . 
  if you had n't sold them the weapons , the next country on the list would have . 
  it is the regions own responsibility to maintain peace and root out criminal and extremist elements in their society , not propagate them . 
   how do you vet a person that has no papers ? 
  you 've really stumped me with this one . 
  every border control guard i ever came across told me to just waltz on in when i told them i forgot my passport , drivers license , and any identity documents . 
  that 's how you vet them , you do n't let them in , and if they insist , you can send them to one of the refugee camps in the bordering countries where they can wait for the war to be over if they are so adamant in staying out of the conflict . 
   those camps exist . 
  they are terrible . 
  if they prefer they can go into the war zone if the peace of the camp does n't satisfy them . 
   if you think that is actually why anyone commits a suicide attack you have no idea . 
  [ you 're right , they did it because they were n't real muslims / they did n't know what they were doing / their community did n't accept them / there were no pools banning women nearby , right ? 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/charlie_hebdo#muhammad_cartoons_and_aftermath )  the ones actually committing suicide attacks are often victims ah yes of course . 
  pardon me , i must have gotten myself all mixed up . 
  why are we condemning these terrorist attacks ? 
  they are the real victims here !, 
  y' know , after the attack in nice , i really did n't care much for the frenchmen who had a lorry driven over their skulls and the ones who were shot to pieces , no , i just felt bad for the real victims , the muslims . 
   people who are willing to help innocent refugees even if it comes with a risk yes , people like you who would sacrifice your neighbors safety so you could feel better about yourself , when there are other solutions that are present . 
  these people do n't deserve anything , the fact that you choose to help them is a gesture enough . 
  for them to act the way they do in a country that extends a helping hand is mind boggling . 
  why do n't other middle eastern countries accept them ? 
  why are they being funneled into europe ? 
  saudi arabia has the means to host large populations of hajj pilgrims , yet is taking no refugees . 
  strange huh . 
   but refusing to help innocent people just because it comes with a risk ... that is just cowardly . 
  you can help , without losing limbs in the process . 
  vetting them correctly for starters as opposed to inviting as many as you can and playing into the hands of human traffickers . 
  setting up relief camps in neighboring countries , rather than importing them straight into the heart of europe and expecting them to behave themselves when they come from such a different cultural background . 
  and no , not all cultures respect others the same way , regardless of how much you believe they do . 
   but saying `` it can be justiified '' does not mean `` i would do it , too '' . 
  are you listening to yourself rationalize this ? 
  in case you do n't know the meaning of the word , justify it means believe there was a good and correct reason for it . 
  if they are blowing people up over cartoons and choice of dress , you have a serious problem on your hands when 22 % share in those views . 
  but do n't let that stop you from patting yourself on the back , you are on the right side of history on this one . 
  it 's people like you and elphinstone that will continue to form logically detached ideas for as long as it caters to your narrative , even when your countrymen are dropping around you . 
  there 's a difference between `` solving the problem '' and announcing an open borders policy to the migrants before a system that can handle them is set up . 
  a completely irresponsible move on merkels part that has put an unnecessary strain between eu countries . 
  a country 's leadership is first and foremost responsible for its own citizenry . 
  when your leaders start making moves that help the citizens of other countries at the harm of your own , you need to re-examine that leaders priorities and who they work for . 
  and no , greece and italy should not be left to fend for themselves , but they should not be forced to deal with merkels publicity gaffe either . 
  why are n't the local middle eastern countries like saudi arabia taking in refugees ? 
  a rich powerful muslim nation that regularly accommodates for the hajj in mecca , building large tent cities can not be bothered ? 
  or are they happy to see someone else foolishly footing the bill and then instead of working to close the hemorrhage , tearing it wider open ? 
  merkel 's rhetoric is better , at least it did n't endanger anyone in france or germany , or contribute to brexit . 
  no worries , sorry if i came off as snappy, 
  except they have been like that since before the soviet invasion , especially after the ousting of dost mohammad . 
  anyone having any relations with westerners was viewed as a puppet and even leaders that were friendly to the west had to hide it from their subjects . 
   except now they are n't resisting an occupation , they are invading other countries . 
  last sentence in my 4 sentence post , yes . 
  yes i know about those stories and links . 
  that does n't change how muslim dominated ghettoes in europe operate . 
  showing them more liberal ideals only seems to enrage them . 
  so you either pander to their life style and forfeit yours , or you piss them off . 
  that 's the point i 'm trying to make . 
  and no , this is not about every muslim . 
  to suggest every muslim is evil would be stupid and get this conversation nowhere . 
  if they are persuaded that easily to murder people , then i have a feeling they would have been just as quick to murder people over drawings or pork . 
  let 's just pat ourselves on the back while ignoring the fact that these same moderates do n't help the police when it matters , choosing instead to keep silent . 
  same shit has been happening for a long time . 
  war against the infidels . 
  afghanistan in the 1800 's and britain 's experience with it is a great example of the fanaticism involved with these people . 
  except now they are n't resisting an occupation , they are invading other countries . 
  it was a kid 's night . 
  it was n't at 1 a.m. they have a curfew by midnight for those nights . 
  no alcohol being served , it 's a `` no id needed night '' . 
  think of it as a dancehall during those evenings . 
  the guy attacked when they were being picked up by their parents . 
  knowing bmw drivers , he did n't use his blinkers . 
  old people would be slow to adapt . 
  do n't be so hostile . 
  now they actually need to be overthrown . 
  what the hell is the justification for this ? 
  well the ban obviously was n't enough , the area should have been designated a gun free zone / s, 
  i guess you have n't looked into islamic holy wars , or massacres like the one in kabul in 1842 , which was fanned by mullahs preaching against infidels . 
  this is overwhelmingly a religious problem . 
  bad troll , bad . 
  leave it to a brother to say what i was thinking . 
  i think it 's more along the lines of someone who has been eating expensive food all their life , only to be immediately cut off and served peasant slop . 
  a marked decrease in enjoyment from something would encourage less use of it , in my opinion . 
  however , a peasant who has been eating it their entire life would n't know the difference , so they do n't care . 
  again , all theory and stuff .

  still bad at the game . 
  going to be privateer nation ? 
  can i pick asian countries for example korea ? 
  for that one week . 
  you are neighboring water , global climate change will make sure it will invade you . 
  original constitution of 1918 had vilnius as our capital . 
  why would we ? 
  it is historically and culturally lithuanian city . . 
  that is not how it works ... heck after soviet union we ** reinstated ** independence . 
  all of your population is made up of immigrants . 
  you forget that in those 240 years we had europe 's infrastructure devastated by wars . 
  us barely felt a hit . 
  yep , and you probably can get it in other countries for free too , not only your own . 
  it is kinda correct , that is the point of taxes . 
  the ratios are just off when it comes to refugees . 
  are we sure that this is not actual hitler who gets angry about this arrest , time travels to the past and starts ww2 ? 
  obviously serb replied with that . 
  they are were vikings and we were land vikings . 
  or when police arrested a guy in vilnius , who proceeded to steal ak from police car when they stopped for w/e reason and then got out of car and ran away while handcuffed . 
  city went quite crazy with police sirens everywhere . 
  the salts part . 
  though poland is known for their salt mines . 
  we have beaches and bitches mate . 
  ofc we are part of florida . . 
  more kids = more people earning money for the family , add medical achievements of 20th century which reduced mortality before adulthood and you get population explosion . 
  for countries in asia/africa differently than in first world countries children do not add to the cost but add to the income . 
  obviously this is changing nowadays , but will take some time until they drop to europe/us levels of reproduction . 
  it looks nothing like it though . 
  you mean the strangled chicken ? 
  sea freighting is pretty much the only thing latvia does . 
  recent events in romania shows that crap is actually shoveled on top of the rug . 
  we ca n't into canada . 
  just because we are being critical of the source it does not mean we hate russia . 
  russia and most of their people are not the problem . 
  oh i understand that you are joking because of the context . 
  but seeing comment like this outside of this would be tougher . 
  the sad thing is that it is hard to tell if you are joking or you are getting paid for it . 
  come one russian news channels are the bestest source of facts ^ ^ ^ tm out there . 
  vikings pillaged some maybe ? 
  there was that one time they stole water from neighbors to fight some fire . 
  so they were involved in international firefight . 
  did so , he told me he was my third cousin , not sure how he ended up there from northern europe and became prince , but good to know my family is doing well . 
  probably worst impression out of all so far . 
  how is that a joke . 
  i really hope we will have one of these for every country in the world . 
  those are strong words coming from a romanian . 
  probably a big issue in surveys like this , though do not think it would have big effects . 
  and a lot more of elderly uses internet than you think , again we need to look at other countries and our relative usage seems to be oddly low especially knowing how good our internet infrastructure is . 
  this says nothing in this case . 
  latvia and estona has high % . 
  well technically we are 3rd . 
  because china numba one and america is tied with them . 
  surprised our number to be that low . 
  well i believe she sounds very right . 
  i have similar view on russia and some other places . 
  it is quite clear that a lot of countries under this type of rule are suffering economical problems and people are not getting better . 
  how can they not see that it is the government which is failing them ? 
  sun ? 
  i think this fin is trying to communicate , but cant understand his speech . 
  can someone translate ? 
  it is cloudy and gloomy , ofc it is summer . 
  triggered . 
  no they are leaving both economical and political union with europe . 
  well it is a legit thing . 
  humans are not perfect , too much accuracy could indicate an ai . 
  sorry but when the bridge decides to detonate one of the ramps it is hard to serve a purpose of a bridge . 
  you think a bot could write something that dumb ? 
  still have the hannibal . 
  well once we are all second eu will be first !, 
  you do n't understand , corruption is obviously better , you just never tried it !, 
  has any of you even tried being corrupt mp ? 
  this guy has real experience and he knows what is good . 
  how dare you to barge into his echo chamber ? 
  cool bot . 
  so when are the riots since protest did not work ? 
  in putins russia you buy grad rockets in duty free . 
  markets only factored in the unpredictability of situation , that is why pound has dropped . 
  same . 
  if she is from kaunas then her view might be skewed . 
  would not be too different ( probably larger % ) if we looked at 25-30 . 
  we only do n't like the poles who live here because they are very reluctant on assimilating and cry wolf on every tiny thing . 
  and we had black sea before the commonwealth . 
  well it is more realistic after brexit than it was before it . 
  lithuania can into education . 
  they do n't really have european values though . 
  heck this probably shocked vw out of their stagnated state and now they will push for something actually new and innovative . 
  what ? 
  it has been european thing for long before us existed . 
  it is surreal to see that people from one country in alliance want asylum in another country in the same alliance . 
  we are busy shopping in poland so we do not notice latvians . 
  did not expect estonia/latvia be higher than us . 
  new tourists ? 
  yea , they sell puke marketed as chocolate . 
  why ? 
  line ups somewhat similar without having the same implications it represented . 
  the gdp map is not about changes in gdp so how does it show how it fallen or risen . 
  damn this article is hard to read because of it 's lack of accuracy . 
  everyone knows that redline skin on ak increases your headshot % . 
  oh dear , our braliukas is retarded . 
  zombies i guess .

  go to rojava ... 
  interesting , wonder were they left . 
  for example lithuanians who fled during first communist occupation ( or before second , when soviets started pushing ) went to germany , sweden and other places but later moved to us , australia and so on . 
   no fake asylum seekers because russia is too poor  erhnicentric sentiments meh , russia has a lot of nationalities , some are trying to get independence too , it 's just that russia has a tight grip  peaceful muslims got to caucasus for that , and they are not as well as integrated as you think , it 's just that it 's more cultural aspect then religious . 
  k then . 
  but do n't expect people to agree with you . 
  neo colonialism trough puppet states would be the best option , we are just too big of pussies . 
  we were either in same state or part of other state for like 700 years . 
  heh , they are dead though . 
  where is this cheese from ? 
  i hope it 's from lithuania too . 
  it feels like we travelled to early 20th century , when people would smuggle not only tobacco and alcohol over the nemunas , but also food too . 
  i have actually asked for this . 
  indeed . 
  you did not even try ... 
  25 k , pretty low i would say , and those who did not return probably got assimilated pretty good . 
  neo colonialism ftw , this time with less hands chopped off and with more aid . 
  how so ? 
  `` why we do n't destroy these dictatorships ? '', 
  where do you see immigrants mentioned here ? 
  so no . 
  how sweet the sound, 
  `` told you so '', 
  so pakis will still be immigrating though ? 
  i 'm waiting when we can get good and cheap bionic limbs for humans . 
  his anus can accommodate them ... 
  `` but then why we do n't destroy these dictatorships ???? '', 
  yeah , in fact my former classmate comes from this [ family . 
  i mostly agree with exception of origin of nobles 15-16 century and onwards a lot of nobility was indeed ruthenian/polish/russian , even in what is now today a lithuania , but before that most of noble families were lithuanian . 
  like astikai , radvilos , mantvydai and so on . 
  who ? 
  well i personally maybe could say few more things but average lithuanian does not know much about portugal . 
  basically , in grand duchy of lithuania , and later commonwealth , old belarussian , polish , latin were main languages used by nobles , clergy , administration . 
  russians use this to say that it was russian ethnic land , belarus wants to be lone successor of gdol , or say that modern lithuanians are russians/poles that got assimilated by samogittians or something ( topkek from someone who lives in eastern lithuania ) and so on . 
  for some reason nobody sais this to brits ( even though their noble spoke and lived too in france ) . 
  if migrants do n't integrate and flow of them increases it could get ugly , pogrom level of ugly , but i think it wo n't get on that level . 
   should not be protected under discrimination laws nah . 
  instead though , we should try to root out free thinkers and closet atheists among muslim immigrants and help them to ditch their religion , and it can be hard for them because of pressure of families , friends . 
  screw it , they do n't need it . 
  put some in poland and estonia . 
  sure . 
  that means you are half . 
  arbitrary , i know . 
  some people do n't like to hear snackbaring in the morning or when at church . 
  this . 
  how many times i will have to tell this to some russian or polish dude . 
  free, 
  also , atheists please . 
   nuclear power plants were shut down well there 's your problem ... 
  well naturally , they should try selling more at the same price , open more markets up . 
  no markets for cheap cars ? 
  * whispers in american accent * communists ... 
  meander in the making, 
  is it like that all way up stream , or it has water pockets ? 
  comments section is full of ignorance . 
  yeah , i 'm disappointed it 's not included . 
  sometimes, 
  pure balt . 
  just thought scrub would visit poles of vilnius . 
   stop fucking with bulls that 's insult to people who actually do fuck with bulls . 
  how do you know ? 
  teach me master , pm . 
  fuckings mods ... should have voted for one that got drunk and set sub to private ... 
  fuck signs . 
  i 'm getting annoyed . 
  first poles now , serbians and croatians . 
  just make them all in latin or esperanto , and fuck you all . 
  well scotland is on the other island . 
  did not visit wilno ... what a scrub ... 
  nice idea . 
  oh , of course ... 
  looks like i 'm late into the train but ... freeeeeedooooom !, 
  i always said ... make artificial meat . 
  ( no , i ca n't be vegan , that 's still a life ) . 
  one should not be annexing other countries territory and creating proxy wars ... 
  but that 's none of my business . 
  no for separation , even if belgium feels like artificial country at time , it still has it ; s of niche uniqueness . 
  should have kicked out russia ... 
  sure . 
  i will come for cigarette contraband . 
  slavic brotherhood ? 
  tell that to ukrainians . 
  first they came for ducks ... 
  i 'm fine with this . 
  then i will able to post about it in / r/tifu , or is there an opposite sub of it ? 
  sure . 
  just remember . 
  no russian . 
  i was talking about plant , it is made from . 
  i know ... 
  i was talking about other ... coca ... 
  if only you could put putin and his goons in place and to let us export in . 
  i mean sure there is swine plague in lithuania , but we could export chicken , diary , poles - apples and so on . 
  i knew we are rastafarians , i mean shape of the country , flag colours , just bring some weed . 
  ca n't have vilnius , but if you help to deal with russia , you can get ukraine . 
  i 'm scared ... and confused . 
  so anyone know who made this geographic monstrosity ? 
  like hell no . 
  you belong to finland , while latvia is our baltic brother . 
   syriacized dunno about that ... what is a syrian in that sense ?

  as for creating additional units and mobilization , that would take some time . 
  in the interwar actually , lithuania had a great system , where we were capable to reach 150k in 72 hours . 
  i wonder if we would be able to anything like that nowadays . 
  ay , units around moscow may be strong . 
  but how many of them are there ? 
  and would they send the best they have here ? 
  of course , we need to prepare for the worst , but in reality , would they not use them in some possible more important places ? 
  israel now , yeah . 
  they are aggressive . 
  but in the past they were able to defend quite well against larger enemies . 
  i 'm not suggesting us becoming exactly like them , but take the good qualities and adapt . 
  mate , go to sleep if you need , we can continue later :d, 
  oh , sorry if it seemed like i think you know nothing . 
  i tend to over explain , so it was n't intentional :d talking about deployment , you know , it really depends on how and where we deploy . 
  if we are in range of their artillery , then yeah , sure . 
  they could do a lot of damage , if the unit does n't have any protection . 
  but i 'm certain that the military would n't deploy so close to the border as to be in reach of artillery strikes while we 're not even at war . 
  i 'll also note , that war would probably be expected . 
  i mean , i highly doubt that russia would just one day decide , without some period of tension to bam - attack the baltics . 
  i also would n't praise russian soldiers as such good ones . 
  from what i 've seen , they do n't take too much care for them ( even their field ration packs suck . 
  btw , i 'll note that who ever created the polish field ration pack deserves a god damn medal . 
  from the ones i 've seen , they 're probably the best in all of nato ) and maintain such a large force with so much equipment . 
  their weak link would be either bad equipment or bad soldiers . 
  and i would be iffy on both of those things . 
  about the nasams , as the government is still in talks , i do n't know either if we get 1 or 2 . 
  i 've only heard rumors that lithuania would get nasams from norway stocks and then upgrade them to nasams 2 through the developer company . 
  but we might get a different deal , who knows . 
  talking about their quantity , i do know that lithuanian military wants to have 2 batteries ready by 2018 . 
  i 've only heard rumors , but we could potentially buy up to 24 launchers . 
  that 's good enough for us , i 'm sure that russia would n't waste all their military equipment and capability solely on lithuania or even the baltic states . 
  i 'm sure they would expect a large war attacking us , so they would have a lot more valuable targets to attempt to destroy . 
  in the end , we really do n't know what kind of war could we expect with russia . 
  would they go full nazi germany ww2 style and blitzkrieg everything ? 
  would they go for another hybrid war ? 
  or maybe even force good old buddy lukashenko to tempt nato security ? 
  we do n't know how would they attack . 
  i myself believe that what our military is doing now , what we are purchasing , how we are moving forward and planing is the best we can do with advice from top military analysts who know how we need to handle our purchases . 
  israel is the best example we have on how to do it , they managed to solely defend themselves against a lot more enemies quite a few times , yet hey also have a lot of high tech and expensive equipment . 
  so us baltics need to follow that example ( while understanding what is different ) and the result of the war and a possible occupation would ultimately rely on nato . 
  would they delay taking actions and helping , will they not develop more countermeasures in the region ? 
  or will they react swiftly . 
  our military objective is to delay as much as possible , while keeping as much of our territory intact as possible . 
  i would not say russia would be able to so much hurt , that even none of our drones or radios would work , while also they would have to be overextended defending their huge territory , open to attack from many areas . 
  and yeah , good chat . 
  tough we have differences , i do agree with some of your points on what we need to buy and about efficiency . 
  no aircraft carriers , that 's for sure :d, 
  as i 'm lithuanian , i will mostly talk about my country . 
  so actually lithuania is not buying tanks at the moment , we might buy them in the future ( 5-10 years , because we have holes in other areas of our military ) . 
  only estonia had announced before that they plan to buy some tanks . 
  while they are expensive equipment , in the future we will need to buy these vehicles not only because of defence , but because our potential enemy - russia - has a lot of tanks . 
  any attack they would do would be with tanks . 
  thus our soldiers need training with these machines to understand how they work , how to react when a tank attack is happening etc. 
  currently , lithuania is buying infantry fighting vehicles . 
  this is much needed equipment , especially because these machines will be used for our fast reaction forces ( the soldiers who first react to an attack ) . 
  also , lithuania did n't just think oh we need useless expensive equipment and it is not the fault of lithuanian generals for buying equipment like this . 
  lithuania , as is poland , is a part of nato . 
  we are a collective defence alliance . 
  that means not only joining a war if one or another is attacked , but also if our military has gaps or things , that can not be bought by us for we do not have the capability , other countries provide us with these capabilities . 
  like for example , we can not afford at the moment to have any fighter jets for air policing , thus nato provides us with them . 
  the same would be said in a war . 
  if lithuania is unable to have a strong naval forces , nato will collectively provide us with their stronger force , while we help in other areas ( eg . 
  concentrate our naval force on mine countermeasure , while other navies concentrate on firepower etc. ) . 
  the current nato plan for the baltic states is that we would have 7 brigades in total , of which 3 ( could be 4 , forgot ) need to be armored . 
  that means tanks and other heavy equipment . 
  buying only manpads and anti tank missiles would be like fighting a partizan war . 
  we need to have our territory as much intact in case of an invasion for nato forces to arrive . 
  liberating occupied land is a much harder procedure . 
  so lithuania is trying to follow this plan by providing our fair share as best we can , since we could not do it when no cared about . 
  first step this year was recreating a second brigade that was disbanded for lack of funds 10-15 years ago . 
  next step after 2020 likely will be a 3rd brigade . 
  our military equipment would not be destroyed in their bases . 
  lithuania would get intelligence that russia is building up their forces near our border and thus our units would be moved out of the bases to their respective areas of dislocation . 
  cia chief said that lithuania would get up to 48 hours warning from them . 
  that is enough time to move your equipment , at least the main things . 
  and lithuania already when russia and belarus does their infamous zapad 20xx exercise moves soldiers and equipment out of the bases . 
  if you think missiles or anything would hit military bases , then you should know that we are already preparing for that . 
  by 2018 , lithuania should have nasams ( not sure if the older 1 or 2 ) mid range air defence system , capable of taking down planes as well as rockets . 
  this will ensure extra air space security on at least our most important military objects and important cities , areas . 
  i will also note that lithuania does indeed buy the things you noted as important too . 
  recently we even bough grom manpads from you guys and have plans to get more . 
  also , some extra javellin missiles and the boxer ifv will be equipped with spike lr . 
  also , we 're investing in our own drone project , buying other country drones , night vision equipment , radio equipment and targeting devices . 
  our military budget when we reach the 2 % and maybe even more will really be quite good for us . 
  if in 2020 we will have 2 % ( we plan to reach it in 2018 ) or more , then it will amount to ~ 900 mln . 
  euros . 
  20-30 % will need to be spent on new equipment ( nato target and we already do that now ) , so that should be ( if 20 % of 900 mln . ), 
  180 mln . 
  euros every year for new stuff . 
  that is sufficient for our country and will increase as gdp rises . 
  sorry for the long post :d, 
  we would have a very well equipped army if we spent a decent amount of money on it ( poland spent 2 % of gdp well before lithuania did . 
  lithuania spent only 0.8 % of gdp in 2012 , that was barely enough to maintain the soldiers we had , not enough to fill the units even ) . 
  as for corruption , i have to say that i am pretty surprised now of the amount of new ( higher tech , expensive stuff as well ) and old stuff ( slightly used ) being bought , considering that our military budget wo n't be that huge even when we reach a normal amount from gdp ( decent amount for us , would be better if it would be more than 2 % ) . 
  all the purchases that are made are very public usually and gets a lot of media attention here , so they ca n't afford to be corrupt . 
  at least , i hope that our military is as clean as possible . 
  tough still not perfect of course ... 
  we did not buy 8 howitzers separately this year . 
  lithuania bought 21 howitzers from germany ( a little used at a very good cost , will be modernized ) , of which 16 shall be used for military purposes ( that means to make our current 1 artillery battalion equipped with only self - propelled howitzers ) and the other 5 for spare parts and training exercises . 
  the ones that came to lithuania now are likely going back to germany soon anyway to be modernized , because these ones were n't , from what i heard .

  or mostly towards , as you said , non-brits . 
  by this measure , literally any country in the world is bad . 
  no country accepts everybody from any country without any conditions . 
  which kinda makes sense imo . 
  which of these is a race ? 
  far-right = = nazis/fascists/etc in my books . 
  there 's a big distance between being on the right of spectrum and being `` far-right '' . 
  as i said , being anti immigration is being strict on work permits . 
  if they 're profiled by race , then it 's racist . 
  if they 're profiled by sex , then it 's sexist . 
  if they 're profiled by employment/careers/etc , then it 's careerist i guess . 
  may does not want to deport `` black doctors '' or smth like that , thus it 's not racist . 
  or is `` eu citizen '' a race now ? 
  most of what you listed is much much more than being just `` anti immigrant '' , which would be just being more strict on giving new work permits . 
  i do n't see anything even remotely `` far right '' in what may said about doctors too . 
  i 'm saying that if far-right bar is that low today , how low is communism bar ? 
  by your standards , it looks like anything off the center-left is far-right . 
  so being anti-immigration is literally a nazi now ? 
  is any kind of welfare worse than communism too ? 
  v\u0117darai is traditional lithuanian food too . 
  no idea wether we or belarussians came up first or just happened at the same time . 
  we have [ blood + cereal version ] ( http://www.delfi.lt/1000receptu/receptai/zemaitiskai-kraujiniai-vedarai.d?id=67067828 ) as well, 
  germany : give us 10 turns to prepare, 
  1274 never forget, 
  i 'm surprised latvians do n't join us :(, 
  the pro-migrant people sometimes look like latent racists . 
  they think their culture/country/race / whatever is so superior that anybody just given opportunity will follow their way and become just like them . 
  people with resources are not necessarily the educated/smart ones . 
  sure , some smart people do come . 
  but proportionally much more opportunist scum joins them . 
  while educated people are held back by their families and stuff . 
  yes i did . 
  after first few fails , i do n't bother with the rest with similar ingredients . 
  although i 'd like to support local/smaller manufacturers , nutella it is ... 
  which , to be fair , is pretty good . 
  peanut butter is a problem too . 
  most grocery shops carry only crappy ones . 
  fortunately there 're some places to get hold of the real thing . 
  the core issue may be that chocolate/peanut/etc spreads are not common over there . 
  traditionally there 're all kinds of meat/veggie/cheese spreads . 
  chocolate/peanut spreads were n't a thing until recently . 
  there 's not much market for them , people do n't know how it 's supposed to taste and there 's no local mass production . 
  i do n't care about brand , all i want is damn spread . 
  over there , there 're no non-nutella but not-shitty-cheap spreads . 
  i tried most of them and they 're sugary as fuck . 
  it 's not just `` different taste '' . 
  and boutique stuff is not just `` premium spread '' ( which would be nice ) , but the whole `` made by 105 y/o nana off the grid bla bla bla '' bullshit . 
  which is whole next level of food idolising . 
  in the end , nutella , even if it 's not the original thing ( tm ) , is the only ok-ish option . 
  which kinda sucks . 
  but you 're right , it does n't suck that much . 
  2nd world problems i guess ? 
  there 're already some shops doing that . 
  they seem to import mostly laundry stuff and cookies ( which are great ) . 
  hope they 'll start doing nutella or overall on-request stuff too . 
  taste buds do n't help if thing is good enough-ish and you do n't compare side-by-side . 
  what else should i do if i want nutella-like spread ? 
  over there , there 're some super shitty alternatives , would n't buy them ever . 
  the only other nutella alternative is making one at home . 
  which is both messy and expensive in small quantities . 
  there may be some boutique-store-home-made-premium stuff but paying literally 10x for `` fair trade eco '' alternative is not my thing . . 
  thus nutella it is . 
  lindt masterrace !, 
  probably one of very few mass produced chocolates that are good . 
  then you guys should fix your platform from inside and remove assholes . 
  or let 's build a new platform that 'd be for fairness and equality . 
  and anybody with tumblr account would be banned  i hope feminism/social justice can get back to it 's core . 
  but so far . . it looks worse and worse year after year . 
  yea , he should just head home . 
  fuckin brasilians occupying portugal and forcing their language . 
  looking at recent us election and stuff , it looks like those things i kinda opposites these days : /, 
  their `` equality '' seems to have turned to preferential treatment these days . 
  i 'm strongly against any kind of affirmative action or quotas . 
  a lot of their `` equality '' seem to end up establishing x-only days/festivals/etc . 
  i 'm also for all-goes freedom of speech . 
  i want you to have a right to offend me . 
  these people seem to prefer a very complicated kind of `` freedom of speech '' which involves a lot of no-nos what is ok and what is not . 
  latest example - lithuania 's independence was announced by men-only committee . 
  given that it was 1918 , it 's kinda . . natural . 
  women were given a right to vote in constitution compiled by the same committee though , back in 1918 . 
  now some feminists/sjws say that independence day is `` men 's day '' and they want separate `` women 's independence day '' . 
  i kid you not . 
  and this is not some lone 15y/o tumbler . 
  this shit was on national tv and everything . 
  sorry , but i do n't see how this platform goes for `` equality '' . 
  and the platform sucks . 
  it 's tall pyramid and it 's set up to fight for x/y/z , but not for universal equality and freedom of speech . 
  it 'd take a shitload of work to override this . 
  i do n't feel like working for a platform that i do n't agree with for the sake of fundamentally changing it . 
  i think he means people are bored by social justice as the current platform . 
  at least from sidelines , it looks to be highly geared towards name-any-minority . 
  turning the wave to fight for the true equality seem to be next to impossible . 
  why bother ? 
  we love georgians there . 
  armenians are ok too . 
  funny thing is , there 's a lot of money spent on all kinds of social programmes . 
  how much of it is spent on making having kids easy & fancy ? 
  if there was as much political will to make people have babies instead of pushing { insert identity politics issue here } we could solve the birth rate thing in a generation or two . 
  what about `` humanitarian superpower '' aka sweden ? 
  their mainstream parties seem to be kinda keen on immigration .

  it 's those who hold these `` secular values '' who are in a minority here ... countries are n't defined by `` values '' . 
  articles like that are purposely misleading us . 
  `` solidarity '' in eu-speak just means they want more power and control . 
  do n't speak up . 
  do n't fight back . 
  everyone just hold your hands and let it happen ... that 's what they mean by this `` solidarity '' . 
  for the love of god , is this `` white savior complex '' genetic to us or what ? 
  do you have too much money ? 
  you could n't find somewhere else to put that money ? 
   when you learn to read that it wo n't fix it , but help cover the issues until fixes are in place , however long that will be . 
  yeah , and my point was that it will never be . 
  mass immigration has been going on for 50 + years . 
  has it fixed anything ? 
  nope , it made everything worse . 
   it 's cheaper to live in poland so a small british pension , or savings , or a pension made from remittances . 
  meanwhile , if they returned to their origin country they do n't use the nhs in their destination country this is just plain insanity . 
  are you paid to post such nonsense or what ? 
  we 're the richest continent on this planet , yet you 're telling me that we ca n't even afford to have kids or even train our own native workers so we have to import them from some rural towns in eastern europe and then deport them back for retirement ... holy shit you must be really educated to be this stupid . 
   immigration can help deal with it . 
  yes , and how long does that `` supplementation period '' should last ? 
  because germany ( and europe as a whole ) has had mass immigration for ~ 50 years now . 
  when will immigration finally fix it ? 
  or do you just want to admit already that this is nothing but a giant ponzi scheme with no end in sight ? 
   the free movement of people helps in a way , by making it easier for polish or other european workers to return to their country of origin for retirement ... and who pays for their retirement in poland ?? 
  polish government ? 
  why would they give out money to people who have never worked a day in their life or paid taxes into poland ? 
  gdp is a useless measure these days especially in countries in eastern europe . 
  yes , people receive more euros in their paycheck , but the actual value of that euro has n't stayed the same . 
  cost of living , for example , has gone way up . 
  so is the cost of everything in your local ( and by local , i mean german owned ) supermarket . 
  combine that with the complete destruction of our local industries , and you 'll see that those `` gdp growth '' reports are almost meaningless in the real world . 
  maybe relying on `` international capital '' is a problem in itself ... ukraine has full control over their banking system . 
  they do n't need to rely on some rich german multinationals for `` new startups '' which mean nothing but cheap software engineers doing their work and making profit for multinationals and their owners in germany . 
  ukraine 's # 1 problem is corruption followed by demographics , and not the lack of `` foreign money '' ... 
  this is just insanity . 
  so germany 's is a business now ? 
  this is more than about economics . 
  why have babies at all ? 
  just have completely open borders and let other countries raise `` new german workers '' , send them to germany , and repeat this every year . 
   immigration can help deal with it . 
  how is that going to work in the long run ? 
  i swear to god ... the only reason this was posted here was to further normalize turkey as a `` european '' country . 
  this is a subtle propaganda and definitely deliberate . 
  stop trying to make it happen . 
  you need to have babies . 
  poles wo n't raise german birth rates . 
  so you will be right where you started the next year . 
  how the fuck is it even possible to russia to go bankrupt ? 
  they have more resources than all of europe combined . 
  they 're the largest country on the planet . 
  no reason why it should n't be a superpower . 
  they must have africa-level corruption that 's the only explanation . 
   at some point we will need to buy so much food , water and practically all kinds of resources , that there will be no money for pensioners anyway !, 
  that 's what the new world territories are for . 
  and that 's why it is important that they remain european . 
   its not possible to keep growing your population forever . 
  how about just keeping it constant ? 
  because right now poland is expected to lose ~ 30 % of its population every generation . 
  these are ww2 numbers . 
  black death for comparison only killed ~ 40 % of population . 
  you will lose more than that in 50 years . 
  how exactly do belarusians or vietnamese help in raising polish birthrates ?? 
  would n't that do the exact opposite ? 
  poles now have to compete with others for housing and jobs = they will start having even less children . 
  have we learned anything ? 
  so you think all those `` new germans '' will vote for pro-german parties in the future ?? 
  you must be delusional . 
  nationalism makes no sense for pakistanis in germany . 
  they can only be `` nationalistic '' back in pakistan . 
  have n't we learned anything from what 's happening to america now ? 
  it 's the same strategy they used in america and now sweden and other parts of europe . 
  where is that article from some politician in sweden saying how `` diversity '' is good for the democracy ? 
  what do you think they mean by that ? 
  you do n't have to accept them . 
  send them back to wherever they came from if you wish . 
  they 're not `` anti-migrant '' , they 're pro-german . 
  stop making up all these `` feel good '' terms for non-existent things . 
   it is not the socialist idea of placing all wealth and property in the hands of the state , but the anarchist plan of `` expropriation , '' of plunder on a gigantic scale for the benefit of the revolutionary masses , which really appeals to the disgruntled portion of the proletariat . 
  the socialist intellectual may write of the beauties of nationalization , of the joy of working for the common good without hope of personal gain ; the revolutionary working man sees nothing to attract him in all this . 
  question him on his ideas of social transformation , and he will generally express himself in favour of some method by which he will acquire something he has not got ; he does not want to see the rich man 's motor-car socialized by the state -- he wants to drive about in it himself . 
  the revolutionary working man is thus in reality not a socialist but an anarchist at heart . 
  nor in some cases is this unnatural . 
  that the man who enjoys none of the good things of life should wish to snatch his share must at least appear comprehensible . 
  what is not comprehensible is that he should wish to renounce all hope of ever possessing anything . 
  \\ - nesta helen webster, 
  merkel is n't stupid though . 
  she just imported a million ( 10 % of germany 's population if you think long term ) `` better voters '' . 
  it does n't matter if germans do n't approve of her now . 
  `` new germans '' will approve of her and her party 10 years from now . 
  you think syrians/eritreans will ever vote for any afd-like party ? 
  this is all part of a long-term strategy . 
  there were no neanderthals in northern europe . 
  oh , and vast majority of humans beings on this planet have neanderthal dna . 
  we 're not unique on that . 
  either way , european history did not begin with neanderthals , it began with europeans who have descended from neanderthals some 30,000 years ago ... not sure how any of this is comparable . 
  chinese history does not include neanderthals even though they 're just as `` genetically neanderthal '' as us . 
  [ so this is how it 's going to end ... ] ( http://www.nationalists.org/assets/images/fate-of-empires.png ), 
   how the fuck can u be anything for a thousand years u ass ?!, 
  identity has continuity . 
  my ancestral continuity to europe and its people is thousands of years old .

  he was 16 and a fucking idiot . 
  it 's a joke , not a dick . 
  do n't take it so hard . 
  come on what ? 
  the trevi fountain ? 
   ublic ownership does n't mean that you have to give up your phones and computers and televisions , that 's personal property . 
  it only means you have to give companies and aparments/land that you do n't use for living . 
  that is right slave , your generous master will allow you to keep your hovel and your rags . 
  but do n't you dare use that axe to chop your neighbors firewood in exchange for a sack of potatoes . 
  that would be speculation , capitalism and exploitation . 
  then your axe is mine and your ass is in the gulag . 
  well what can you do when communists ca n't even keep an intelligent conversation going , not to mention entire countries . 
   those goddamn chinese idiots multiplying gdp per capita and enriching millions of people !, 
  by implementing free market reforms , ditching any semblance of workers rights , environmental protection , state ownership of means of production and encouraging corporations to move their business to china to set up sweatshops . 
  the only thing communist about modern china is the name of the single ruling party . 
  wherever you implement public ownership for the sake of equality you get no human rights . 
  always the case with comunism or socialism . 
  oh man the memories ... mostly of female construction workers with their short shorts hammering away at walls while gently swaying their hips ... 
  i need to be alone for a while now ... 
  still not as good as a rare pepe . 
  biologists could answer the how part i think , we just need to set up a goal . 
  there was an episode of sci-show on youtube about the eradication of mosquitos . 
  they said that eliminating them would have little impact on the ecosystem . 
  and those buggers have a serious amount of biomass around the world , while ticks are comparatively few and far in between , so eliminating them would probably be less of a problem . 
  probably i 'm just expressing my irrational hatred of those little fuckers , and since i work outdoors i see them a lot . 
  now i 'm vacksinated , but i know a few people who suffered deblitating efects from tickbites . 
  one of my classmates for example basicly has a non functioning liver and nerve damage from tickbourne encephalitis . 
  maybe it 's time to eradicate ticks in general . 
  the ammount and variety of deadly diseases these eight legged freaks spread is incredible . 
  these fuckers keep me from hiking for about four months every year . 
  and i doubt that it would have a significant ecological impact . 
  there are other , lovelyer bloodsuckers who could do their job just as well . 
  well the joke is on them , i get my news on reddit and i never read the articles , just the comments !, 
  your parents get fined , arested and then if they presist , get sent to prison , if you do not go to school pretty much everywhere where education is compulsory . 
  school ? 
  most modern combat takes place in cities . 
  and defenders have a huge advantage there . 
  god , that fucking clickbait title ... 
  ever heard of urban combat training facilities ? 
  yeah , countries with militaries usually have them . 
  politburo is only friend you need . 
  well i guess it 's possible , however military is definitely not an institution that should have problems of finding where to spend their money . 
  i mean it already is understaffed , underequiped and underpayed . 
  why not just buy ammo in bulk ? 
  some more assault rifles ? 
  some new javelins ? 
  hell , by a few thousand rpg-7 from ukraine . 
  i belong to the rifleman 's union and i get 40-50 bullets for training every year . 
  all other training comes out of my pocket . 
  why not up it to say 200-300 shots . 
  the money would be much better spent on things like that . 
  now they bought a bunch of tactical pots and pans . 
  got ta hit that 2 % target !, 
  they are both run by bureaucrats tasked with spending other people 's money . 
  so while not the same people , it 's the same category of people . 
  simply put russia is seen as a threat . 
  we are small , russia is big , and there are two conflicts in ex-ussr countries where russia plays a big role . 
  both conflicts started with dodgy pretexts of protecting ethnic russians and calling the countries fascist . 
  same excuses can be easily used here and russian media has been spreading similar propaganda about our countries for a long while now . 
  eu is shaky , nato is shaky so obviously there is cause for concern . 
  however most people do not blame russians as a nation , only the government . 
  but the enthusiastic support that the current administration has is slowly eroding this . 
  wild capitalism - best capitalism !, 
  no , this is the glory of capitalism !, 
  if there is popular demand for crimes against european cuisine , there will be companies willing to provide it . 
  i just love it !, 
  are the requirements for getting it very strict ? 
  making your own is actualy very easy , but i guess that will also be forbiden ? 
  that is really horrible . 
  sad that your government does not trust you with something as basic as the right to defend your life . 
  the drunk guy could have pulled a knife out . 
  it would have been the same . 
  and while the odds of a girl with a gun vs a drunk guy with a gun is in the girls favor , the odds of a drunk guy with a knife ( hell even with his fists ) vs a girl with a knife are in the bad guy 's favor . 
  found the control freak ... 
  hey east of berlin we need guns to protect ourselves from the russians . 
  that is a very valid reason . 
  `` gun deaths '' is a bullshit statistic because it includes suicide with a gun . 
  i use my gun for putting holes in paper . 
  look in to blackpowder weapons . 
  fun to shoot and very little regulation in most places . 
  what could be more glorious then dispatching assailants with rifle , bayonet and a good old sixshooter ? 
  yeah it realy is a great event . 
  criminals are already armed , terrorists are already armed , depressed teenagers are already armed and all illegaly . 
  making firearm possesion even more restrictive for normal people will not change that . 
  actualy they alredy are late to the game . 
  in a lot of cases thinking that others will defend you is the definition of false sense of secuirity . 
  no there is not . 
  and if you are so sure , please proove it . 
  my life is everything i have , and if i need it to protect my life then it is worth it . 
  honestly , yeah i sometimes wish we would do a bit less whining and remembering shitty history and think more about the future and how to make it better . 
  precedent . 
  they 've already invade two ex-ussr countries with dodgy pretexts of protecting ethnic russians and calling countries fascist . 
  they can easily use the same excuses here and they have been spreading similar propaganda about our countries for a long while now . 
  eu is shaky , nato is shaky and russia is the most agressive it has been since the end of ww2 . 
  free ? 
  but with some restrictions ( no nutters , no criminals and basic training ) that can be a beneficial thing . 
  defending your life is a basic right , and having the necessary and effective means to do that should not be practically impossible for most people . 
  for example i 'll be moving out to the countryside 30 km outside of the capital and if anyone would decide to break in or attack me while i 'm at home the police would be there in 30 minutes at best . 
  if two or three people would attack me , i would probably not be able to defend myself if i would be unarmed , even though i 'm fairly fit and have some martial arts training . 
  my gf would easily be overpowered even by a single aggressive guy .

  more like we got a chance to choose side . 
  because it was never meant to be a country but part of romania, 
  feels bad man , for real , f * ck ussr and it 's shitty ideology that ruined our economy far too greatly . 
  well we 're part of more `` successful '' stories while talking about ex-commie bloc economy , but our economy is still getting revived by eu even though 25 years passed since fall of ussr . 
  well our bm is cigarettes , dammit belarus , why you so cheap . 
  let 's just unite under tallinn , their government seems know what is best for their small country . 
  well native and english is probably must know in every european country , third language might be optional and depend on your geographical location . 
  you 're disappointed about latvian government yet you do nothing about yours when it 's far worse . 
  russia removed it 's troops because we were screaming for it . 
  we have nato troops because we 're asking for them . 
   why do you think russia will be happy with this ? 
  they would n't , because we actually manage to escape their `` sphere of influence '' . 
   unfortunately , russia can not trust nato . 
  so ironic . 
  i 'm also got banned from that sub-reddit just because i was expressing my views on ussr war crimes . 
  as a white person . 
  i happy to see golden horde [ getting kicked ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_blue_waters ) out of ex-kievan rus ' . 
  turkey can into eu now !, 
  do n't forget who [ we are ] ( http://i.imgur.com/catiazi.png ) . 
  5 ~ % our minority is not like latvian or estonian though , maybe because they 're smallest in all of places . 
  so i do n't really care what they listen , we have news shows in russian on tv in evening but they 're rare , but i never watch them since i do n't know russian language and i do n't care . 
  but for estonia and latvia also ukraine it 's big deal , their minorities can be influenced so much that they could start `` civil war '' in a country , i 'm pretty sure you would n't want those `` refugees '' to create militia and get guns out of nowhere . 
  delete your acc already . 
  there is a thing you do n't have , called ethnic russians who were sent here in soviet times . 
  russia is the only one butthurt , for losing all influence , because it 's a total sh * t hole . 
  do n't worry , broliukas will protect you . 
   not enough lebensraum . 
  needs more lebensraum !, 
  you know , in a non-aryan way , seeing how this is before wwi , not even wwii . 
  :d this never had anything to do with aryan anyway , nazis just used it in their propaganda . 
  [ germans always felt that they did n't had enough sun light on their empire ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruetmrjbkwi#t=50s ) . 
  yes , i encountered one . 
  he wanted to drink coca-cola before i even bought it in store . 
  and even though drug problem in lithuania is very low , people who spread them are always gypsies , sh * t they appear quite often on tv on shows like `` farai - cops '' or `` tv pagalba - tv help '' . 
  call me stereotypical cunt but i will never , ever trust a gypsy . 
  you 're not romanian , you 're gypsy . 
  mama merkel will take care of her children . 
  i never said that i agree with him . 
  germany would n't want us to lose , we 're part of eurozone , usa would n't want to lose because that would mean end of nato and usa as trustful partner . 
  they already [ questioned ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-33325842 ) it . 
  they can suck our d even if they wanted to occupy us . 
  even if they were we would n't be left alone to deal with enemy , there is poland which would scream `` kurwa '' with their tanks coming to our aid . 
  i would call him the lucky one . 
  there is 0 , literally 0 chance that little green men will appear in latvia or estonia , let alone lithuania who 's russian minority is smaller than polish one , our army already made strategic counters against such scenario . 
  ethnic russians who travel to russia from estonia or latvia know exactly how many times their life is better than that of russian . 
  so supporting little green men would literally mean you want hell instead of heaven . 
  how i [ imagine ] ( http://replygif.net/i/147.gif ) them after that . 
  who said i do n't want them to watch me :\\ ^ ), 
  what do you mean ? 
  nato , notable usa troops are stationed here , attacking us will be attacking them . 
   baltic states would lose it . 
  no we would n't because nato and our brother in arms - usa . 
  works for russia . 
  it 's kinkier , they can watch me while i masturbate . 
  i actually find fun in traveling , watching through window and seeing how horizon become more brighter and brighter , all while listening to music . 
  though i hate traveling with low economic trains , because all of `` tun dun dun , tun dun dun '' . 
  why ? 
  no empire think they will ever fall , but they always do . 
  which is sad . 
   misguided view for you . 
  expand on your bs please . 
  turkey is definitely an ally , it 's part of nato for gods sake . 
  what do you mean by that ? 
  that 's some cold war mentality still living on . 
  yeah , that 's why we started to expand to south east very fast - from [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/pq9wzud.png ) to [ this ] ( http://www.jewishgen.org/belarus/newsletter/myvitebskappendices_files/image002.jpg ) , we took ruthenians and even tatars to our army who would get rewarded with land , that 's how [ lipka tatars ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lipka_tatars ) appeared . 
  [ not really ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_saule ) . 
  though they were our greatest nemesis till [ battle of grunwald ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_grunwald ) . 
  at that time ethnic lithuanian population was like half a million . 
  not a little , but [ greatly ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/partitions_of_poland ) . 
  old prussians , never forget !, 
  i do n't understand why people refer to europe as whole when talking about just london or paris ... europe is full of tiny countries , which could give far better view of european culture than those well known places where `` gray mass '' goes . 
   demolish everything except your cool old buildings , take everything valuable that was brought in ( you know , ussr pumped a lot of money to make you a `` showcase of socialism '' ) , leave you with your independence . 
  and what point would that be , to demolish buildings ? 
  even if ussr did n't occupy us we would have built what it 's now , of course it would look a lot better than ugly ass buildings that ussr brought . 
  good thing we getting euromonies and modernizing it . 
  besides ussr did n't brought anything valuable . 
   you know , ussr pumped a lot of money to make you a `` showcase of socialism '' i thought it was eastern germany . 
  and reason why they pumped money in us was because we were n't some shitty states like rest of republics , we were one of the richest if not richest territories before and after occupation of ussr . 
   leave you with your independence . 
  did n't that was what ussr did , first killed our civilians then screamed if you want to independent you wo n't get gas etc. 
  leaving us without any way to use transport and cold flats . 
  ussr what a wonderful country ... fuck anyone who embraces it . 
   sure you do !, 
  as i said most of those people were getting paid by commies and they knew little about `` communism '' that was happening in ussr . 
   hoorah-patriotic volunteers who ready to kill for their beliefs and special forces are not the ones i can call `` innocent '' . 
  yeah you 're right . 
  russians are maniacs who likes to kill . 
   maybe it was , maybe is was not . 
  i just think that when soviets let you go they should 've taken everything they made with them . 
  maybe , including russian population . 
  to take what ? 
  commie blocks ? 
  factories ? 
  how ? 
  it would be rather a real pleasure if they never came here to begin with . 
   just like baltics `` begged '' to join ussr ? 
  please , do n't be ridiculous . 
  [ oh yes we begged our way to usrr ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lithuanian_partisans ) !, 
  those were paid by stalin you know , nazism and communism was out-lawed in interwar lithuania . 
  besides you ca n't compare a totalitarian dictatorship and an alliance .

  nah , they fly low as a fake airport approach , change direction , fly for a while and then `` pop up '' on radar as a surprise to keep the `` watchers '' in russia on their toes . 
  true , they are cool for the most part , but two or three years ago , you could see that germany was using f4 phantoms in air policing , and a 50 year old fighter is n't that reassuring . 
  people do n't see behind the votes ... as early as last june , so many americans , especially democratic voters loved the fact that trump was at the time trying to present himself as a `` real candidate '' . 
  the joke at the beach was `` i 'm switching to republican just so i can vote for trump in the caucuses and primaries !, 
  we can make the joke that sinks the gop ! '', 
  one thing to consider in the presidential race is marijuana . 
  20 states will have legalization ballots along with the presidential election . 
  this prompts new voters to turn out , such to the point that marijuana got more votes than the winning candidate for president in many states . 
  if sanders wins primaries , but loses due to delegation issues , will he go independent as revenge ? 
  he knows that he can bank on the marijuana voters to give him a lot of clout . 
  so , marijuana will win the presidential election , not trump . 
  `` common ancestry '' ??? 
  so wrong . 
  apparently , poles and russians are more closely related , and resemble their european neighbors , to the point of being the same . 
  more and more americans are moving towards kebabs ... they taste the same , but are cheaper . 
  serbian govt says to the pootin ' that `` nato ? 
  nah , no one even talks about it ... pffft '' . 
  http://www.rferl.org/content/serbia-wont-join-nato-endorse-eu-sanctions-against-russia-moscow-ambassador-says/27549850.html but russia finds out people are making deals http://rbth.com/news/2016/02/18/russia-sees-new-nato-serbia-agreement-as-attempt-to-broaden-influence_569005 so they send the pootin ' posters to belgrade , because russia is so ... well , nobody can explain how russia is so , well , `` russia '' to serbia , it 's people and it 's history , and that unknown , unquantifiable , mystic whatever russia is to them is so , `` important '' . 
  `` you ca n't hear anything about the protest in serbian news because of media manipulation . '', 
  you mean russia does n't manipulate the media there , like other countries ? 
  how do you manage that ? 
  of course . 
  you could always buy from amazon.de , or do it other ways , though . 
  as it is now , post from britain is quite expensive . 
  i buy anything i can online , and for some reason , i would rather buy from irish sites , which often have reduced or even free shipping , usually with a minimum purchase , than spend what is always much more from a co.uk site as it stands now . 
  countries align with , and then subsequently join nato ... on the other hand , we can see that in almost every case russia joins you . 
  ... until their agricultural products ca n't automatically be exported to the eu . 
  altering trade treaties , worker 's rights and agricultural pacts are certainly enough of a difference to warrant another vote . 
  hardly a `` charade '' as much as a required assessment of the new rues put on the ground . 
  what it would come to is commonly known as a `` vote '' . 
  the exit would take until 2019 ... when the eu said is the earliest that any treaties regarding trade could be made . 
  guess * verb * estimate or suppose ( something ) without sufficient information to be sure of being correct . 
  to be sure , it is beige-like in it 's neutrality, 
  from medieval and modern times , jews in europe were given extraordinary protections under magdeburg rights . 
  so criticizing israel for violating international treaties concerning occupation , annexation , and segregation are `` anti-semitic '' ? 
  before mentioning anything about a restored palestinian state , has israel offered everything back the way it was before , to at least the pre-1967 borders ? 
  labeling the goods is justified as a political action . 
  the arguments for ireland leaving the eu after a `` brexit '' are far less compelling than the arguments we have seen in the past few weeks suggesting the post-brexit benefits to scotland and n.ireland declaring independencefrom the uk and joining the eu one their own . 
  when the ussr let us go . 
  russia is a whole other sack of nuts and bolts that do n't quite fit together ... 
  lithuanians enjoy hearing stories about how much people drink in other countries . 
  we do have one day every year where stores can not sell alcohol , though , september 1st . 
  a recent government study revealed we would have to have an entire month of alcohol-free days before another country would tie us for most liters ethanol consumed per person per capita, 
  yeah , it 's gospel . 
  i have never seen , handled , or laundered this money ... this is what i get instead of single socks , though ... http://imgur.com/deff44a, 
  pssshaw ... people in the uk think you can get a dish called `` curry '' in india , and use the letter `` u '' in words like color and flavor just for extra scrabble points . 
  wrong on all counts . 
  any form of `` nationalism '' would have to be based on some kind of common culture , and outside of eurovision ( puke ) and the annual collective sewer flush that has every nation sending it 's erasmus students to other european capitals , i do n't see any common culture that is really shared , at least on any meaningful level . 
  of course , we could always pick up that idea of nationalism that the us embraces , and it 's unified sense of patriotism and jingoism, 
  yet in russia , everybody * everywhere * is using us dollars ... for everything !, 
  the country is awash in benjamins . 
  you would think that big denomination euro notes would have replaced dollars a few years ago , but it is n't the case . 
  let the brits leave , if the want ... or dare . 
  not like they wo n't be printing invites to scotland or northern ireland to join the eu if the uk does decide to leave ... and if the uk does leave , no one is going to veto scotland or nis admission to the group . 
  of course , will it be as easy for the rest of the `` kingdom '' to get back in once they have bailed ? 
  any chance of the favorable terms they stand to get now ? 
  bwahh ha ha ha !, 
  ok , so you do n't pay a tax to subsidize people who ca n't afford to live in dublin ... in this case you simply get municipal services run by people who presently live in dublin , but as time goes on , you simply end up paying 30 % more in wages to people who do better work , but live further outside the city . 
  i guess just stating that city workers will get a 30 % raise did n't sound as good , but you 've convinced me otherwise ... 
  we 've had a lot of sushi places in lithuania for years . 
  i 'd say any `` hype '' with it is that every second - and third-rate chinese restaurant ( meaning every single one in lithuania ) has turned , or has been turning `` asian fusion '' so they can serve sushi like the many smaller places that serve only sushi with a little japanese stuff on the side . 
  not as cheap as doner/turkish kebabs , but not as much food , either . 
  kebab stands really did n't pick up in lithuania until 2005 . 
  the point is that these countries are n't really angry at each other , particularly the ones in the russian federation . 
  a lot of history and culture is shared . 
  as far as `` nukes '' go , nothing would be going on in that direction ... the russians would have to remove them , and the places where they might have trouble with that , others such as the us have , and would step right in and `` fix thngs '' . 
  yes ... we have low quality food from international chain stores like maxima and prisma , which is fine for finnish people , but quite below our lithuanian standards . 
  soon some awful vendor of offal called lidl will be opening up shop here ... it 's gotten so bad we have to eat german food products . 
  the cost of living in lithuania is greater than the minimum ( part time ) salary . 
  it is an ongoing national joke disguised as a serious discussion about how everyone can even afford to live ... without thriving black and grey markets . 
  yes , bring friends ... we 'll know you by green suits ... 
  now talk about this `` norwegian white '' ... https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/poland#/media/file:herb_polski.svg inobvious monty python reference ... 
  between the two of you , somebody is dead wrong . 
  and i 've never seen a fucking unicorn , even once . 
  i thought it was to `` save '' the jews ? 
  jesus never intended for christianity to be spread to the gentiles ... that 's where rome used paul ... 
  you talk the talk , you walk ... well , drive it up and down the street , anyways . 
  some religious law will be written in accords to when one must wear the holey colander , and probably sooner than later . 
  ... when the next guy will get his own private reading of `` how it all works '' before he also backs sanctions . 
  i 'm just realizing that lithuania has drank itself out of europe !, 
  no referendum , protest , or revolution ... just tossing back the mere equivalent of 35 liters of 40 % vodka per capita every year . 
  okay , maybe the map/figure is just * wheak * . 
  more people die from methadone outside of treatment using illegally-procured supplies . 
  ... or condom/safe sex practice . 
  you 're much more likely to get hiv from sexual contact than from shooting drugs . 
  besides , you can just buy needles at the pharmacy otc in russia . 
  no , hiv is spread mostly by male to female sexual contact . 
  it 's true , i hear it in their nomadic camps , situated by trash collection containers across the city !, 
  we make a lot of movies about fighting repressive regimes here in `` the west '' also , as well as many movies of disturbing violence perpetrated as revenge on criminals . 
  a lot of holocaust movies too ... or are they just watching porn ? 
  ... how many dungeons you gon na build ... and where ? 
  even though germany * ran * `` extermination camps '' , they certainly did n't build them in germany . 
  i would think you would know , not just understand that when it 's done locally , it 's called terror . 
  you mean bad china spies on it 's own citizens ? 
  in a lot of countries ( chuckle ) that would be considered illegal !, 
  even here in europe many men have multiple concurrent relationships ... particularly wealthier ones . 
  but this depends where you are . 
  here in lithuania there are approx . 
  86 men for every hundred women . 
  there is no discernible problem socially .

most likely it 's polish embassy . 
  also , the embassy is just a couple hundred meters away . 
  china is a middle class of the world, 
  tears appear in estonia 's eyes, 
  good guy putin unites nazis and communists, 
  old record, 
  i dare to say , you do n't know what you are talking about . 
  what 's your source ? 
  turkey - 91 hungary - 33 romania - 43 bulgaria - 46 http://www.ihrri.com/ also , other things matters , such as democracy , freedom of press , economy , law , geography ( i know it is unfair ) , and most the willingness of a society to accept european values . 
  i ca n't see how turkey could ouperform according to these things any of the 3 countries above . 
  i 'm very pro turkey to join eu , yet i 'm against lowering the entrance standards just because turkey is already seeking eu membership for a long time . 
  the standards have nothing to do with racism . 
  there are obvious problems that eu asks to deal with because otherwise eu will have to deal with anyway after turkey joins , while turkey may be much less motivated . 
  it was not a noble move but it was pragmatic in terms that baltics should stick with a partner , who could have our backs in case of troubles . 
  additionally , it landed baltics an invitation to nato . 
  would france backed baltics otherwise ? 
  i doubt it . 
  too often france and germany chose russian side . 
  i can easily see how poland surpasses spain in the near future . 
  military expenditure is very comparable but poland 's economy has a brighter future and , even more important , poland has a bigger necessity to have a strong military . 
  http://www.rferl.org/content/france_agrees_warship_sale_to_russia/1952128.html http://www.economist.com/node/15514914 examples that baltics were involved from the beginning . 
  france for sure proved to be a responsible partner, 
  what annoys me the most is that poland and baltics were screaming that it is a stupid idea long before signing the contract but french politicians arrogantly refused all the critique and basically told them shut up and blamed that they know too little about how international politics works . 
  sigh , good old days ... 
  i like a sea to the east of lithuania, 
  what are they going to do ? 
  ban our food exports ? 
  cut oil supply ? 
  do some military exercise near our borders ? 
  start seizing our fishing ships ? 
  start propaganda campaign bashing our country ? 
  make difficulties for our transport companies to enter russia ? 
  threaten military invasion ? 
  damn they are creative, 
  browny pants at r/darknetmarkets, 
  this is a stereotype about norway ? 
  dear the rest of europe , please , stop bitching about russian sanctions . 
  sincerely , lithuania p.s.we do n't, 
  let 's call it gdl and riga maybe capital , how about this ? 
  we should join in one litvia/lathuania federation . 
  we would be stronk !, 
  another slice of salami ? 
  russia cut oil pipeline to lithuania `` due to maintenance '' shortly after lithuania sold a refinery to polish company . 
  milk anyone ? 
  fuuuuuck ... 
  yeah , bloody nazis creating a reich near baltic , which soon will take control of slav lands like in old times, 
   the russians name belarus , china and kazakhstan as their top-three friends , while having the u.s. , ukraine and * lithuania * as its top foes . 
  lithuanian-russian relationship : had a recent war ( georgia ) - no `` oppress '' russian speakers ( latvia , estonia ) - no have disputes about borders ( japan ) - no order to split gas distribution company for competition - yes russian priorities !, 
  the point of not allowing to write in polish letters is political . 
  llra escalated it to such a level by the way not without poland help that now overturning the law would be their win and political suicide for any lithuanian politician as lithuanians see llra anti-lithuanian . 
  britain , do you have anti-european politicians who are british and not married to foreigners ? 
   how much is that worth in eur or usd ? 
  blue-10 , pink-20 , brownish-50 , green-100 . 
  1eur = 3,45 ltl edit : fixed ltl/eur rate, 
  this all sound very bad but ... wtf was she thinking when going to the protest in the first place ? 
  nazis + antinazis in one place `` what could possibly go wrong ? '', 
  central europe , you suck in wining this non-singing contest, 
  lithuania - a nation of auto-traders, 
  i do n't want to be a dick in pointing mistakes , just numbers , which are higher , would make it easier to understand the subject . 
  for example , deportation only from lithuania to siberia was much higher than 90 ' 000 . 
  wiki mentions ~ 280 ' 000 + people who died in resistance , that would make almost ten percent of the population at the time . 
  i also would like to read op 's reaction to the answers, 
  check your numbers, 
  good point , but as eu ans us are net importers , i imagine the graph of consumption may look very the same, 
  i knew that american use much more resources but this is almost twice more ... and we have more people, 
  two things : 1 ) lithuania you are either stupid or you have balls of steel 2 ) if uk withdraws eu , we are doomed, 
  what program are you using to make this kind of maps ? 
  yes , we keep asking ourselves the same question : `` why we wanted to form a union with poland ? '', 
  well , even if eu and nato have not accepted us , we still would not wanted to join russia and better be on our own . 
   could n't they just move to ... that is how ethnic cleansing begins, 
  sorry which exact part was antirussian rhetoric ? 
  do you even read ? 
  my point is that turkey did n't stay aside . 
   turkey has been keeping aside of this conflict because it 's not it their interests to go against russia actually vice versus , turkey was one of the first to [ criticize ] ( http://lmgtfy.com/?q=turkey+crimea ) russia , as it does have a big tatar community, 
  i think this time they will make something less obvious . 
  110 % should make it, 
  there is no secrecy as you ca n't vote `` no '', 
  i actually think that 7 % lied because , why would you go to referendum when there is basically one choice ? 
  yes , it did . 
  however , in some countries it replaced not german but russian . 
  immigration to the uk is still higher after 2011 because of the language and impulse/network , e.g. 
  if i know someone that already in uk and could help me in finding a job i 'll go there than fr or de where i do n't know anybody . 
  language, 
  c'mon what source are you looking for ? 
  travelling , living and working without boundaries ( just count how much money people used to spend on visas and time near customs ) . 
  having a vote in a biggest economy in the world . 
  compare neighboring countries eu2004 vs non eu countries : difference in gdp growth , corruption level , foreign direct investment . 
  and for serious source just use scholar.google i 'm sure someone written a paper about it . 
   auto-sufficient economy for 70 years good joke . 
  you ca n't even feed your selves , not to start about goods that are not of primary necessity, 
  yay , we are first ... wait a minute ... 
  short translation : totalitarianism may come to russia for a short period of time . 
  the danger is not in police , army or other services but in people 's mentality . 
  people may start to live more comfortable under totalitarianism but soon it would end and they would start suffocating . 
  edit : grammar, 
  this can be `` done '' very fast . 
  also , they do n't actually need right wing nationalist or anti-russian laws , they just need to show that on rt.com, 
   the rt article https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvdlox9n-lu, 
  if they get at least half of it back , they would not need financial help from eu, 
  there is an old russian ( !!! ),

  if euro sinks then ship sinks . 
  ehh maybe so since albania is in nato . 
   higher laws than orders . 
  not really . 
  i think we agreed many centuries ago that written down law is higher then word . 
   too bad the kla is under western control and that this is just a false flag operation wat ? 
  2 upper ones look like our minister of foreign affairs http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/linas_antanas_linkevi\u010dius goddam clones everywhere . 
  so ... could someone say why it 's bad ? 
  only thing i saw were privatisation of healthcare , lower standards for products , and harsh laws on information and pharma . 
  frankly i do n't like that . 
  i got ptsd because of feminists : /, 
  voted for 3rd, 
  ehh larp does n't use real thing i do n't think . 
  i 'm talking about martial arts and hema stuff . 
  in latvia ? 
  in lithuania cops are mostly for taking away your money , then you can kill yourself . 
  where is my flintlock matey ? 
  that 's true . 
  if person has northing to lose he will probably not hesitate . 
  yeah , fuck genoese merceneries . 
  as much as people laugh at this many people would think before attacking someone , though of course that would not stop other killers . 
   maybe teachers should wear chainmail from now on plate would better at these distances . 
  would be fucking awesome . 
  give one guy pavise and i would take dane axe . 
  now people attack medieval reanoctors and people who like medieval weopanary in general . 
  all over some idiot . 
  expulsion of germans and many peoples in general trough history not that it matters . 
  repressions of ssrs too . 
  interesting ... 
  send some soldiers while you 're at it . 
  i know . 
  that 's why we will need to get votes to put you on throne . 
  prepare to sell you dignity . 
  people might ban you just for disagreeing . 
  that 's the internet for you . 
  emperors need no votes . 
  well , unless you are from hre . 
  and since eu is basically hre then we might be in trouble . 
  it sucks . 
  but it also means that answer is not here . 
  put them all in lampedusa ( rhymes with meduza ) . 
  and i do mean all of them . 
  just kiddin ' . 
  ahh a honest populist . 
  nice to have one for a change . 
  well maybe we should n't remove gypsies i mean what will we do with romania then ? 
  you would have done better by saying poland . 
  sure . 
  do n't kill any more of them , serbia . 
   crusader against whom ? 
  this sucks . 
  i would not vote for any of these ... 
  or you could have been deported for being intellectual , teacher , policemen or for owning land . 
  and sometimes for no reason at all . 
  batka what 's going on ? 
  republic ? 
  it should be empire !, 
  why not . 
  we once ruled the world . 
  we can do it again . 
  for syria maybe . 
  but for africa ? 
  continent is volatile with or without europeans . 
  what evidence . 
  i 'm not arguing over this , i 'm just saying that lithuanian media does n't give a shit about this . 
  we are staunch supporters ? 
  well you do n't see people talking about this ... 
  someone mixed up lithuania with latvia i think ... 
  how to get more vodka ? 
  nice, 
  what have you done ... 
  and ukip ... 
  near were i live there is one . 
  there is like a park , golf fields nearby . 
  but you know it 's just one of many . 
  sealand ? 
  calm down . 
  it 's just booty ... 
  hey we are somewhat unique . 
  cheers . 
  warsaw paris or london ? 
  : dddddd, 
  what is that about creating bank account ? 
  i might become e stoner for this , 
  ehem . 
  so i thought ukip wants a strong britain . 
  and yet uses chauvinistic ways to get votes . 
  is n't that a record ? 
  umm not much he can do . 
  either get a passport or move to ukraine . 
  what are economical implications ? 
  after all gaining value of currency is not necessary great especially if you export high cost goods . 
  yeah i know . 
  i just found it funny . 
  our regions both are quite poor compared to western europe . 
  but there are places in the world where people have it worse so ca n't complain too much i just wish we made bigger progress . 
  where 's my fusion ... 
  it 's just political show . 
  i do n't think much of it since if greece want to get rid of dept they have to do it trough their debtors . 
  `` tail '' of coins is usually more interesting though .

  you 're really something . 
  it 's clear that it 's people like you that make others weary of jews today . 
  context is not allowed with you . 
  it 's beyond ironic how you claim `` blaming the victim '' and then do it yourself . 
  it 's beyond ironic how you reduce a nation and all of it 's history to one tragic event as if it defines us . 
  i hate hypocrites . 
  we 're done here . 
   history goes around and around and around . 
  time is a flat circle ? 
  i 'll just say it again because you do n't seem to get it . 
  it 's hard to understand what you mean when you keep saying two things that mean different things at the same time . 
  and besides all that , your whole point is about what ** you ** think is the moral high ground . 
  your personal opinions do n't mean anything when talking about things in the past . 
  things happened . 
  they could have happened differently but they did n't . 
  now you shitting on lithuanians who had nothing to do with it is n't proving anything other than your own personal flaws . 
  calling you a hypocrite for being a hypocrite is not an ad hominem . 
  you really need to learn the distinction . 
   some fought the invaders all the way . 
  others fought one with the other . 
  ** just like the lithuanians . 
  ** the latter do n't deserve freedom , the former do . 
  so same game but different rules . 
  haha , you ca n't be real . 
  you are contradicting yourself agaiiiiiiiiiiiin . 
   now you 're going even more ad hominem . 
  i 'd report you , but i 'm not going that low . 
  i 'm done with you . 
  i 'll grant you that that was n't intended as a flattering description but when you act like a clown do n't expect people not to call you one . 
  good night . 
   is this a thinly veiled threat ? 
  that the jews are powerless and that ` you know where it can go so we should avoid that ' . 
  the jews are n't powerless anymore , this is n't 1939 , we have the ability to physically defend ourselves through a state , this includes anti-semites in europe . 
  omg , dude . 
  you just proved my point . 
  you go into discussions aggro . 
  you see everything as a threat and an insult and then you 're surprised when you 're answered in kind . 
  it 's not a threat . 
  what would that accomplish ? 
  and that other part about jews being powerless . 
  wtf did you see that even implied by me ? 
   what a load of nonsense , you do realise every neo-nazi starts his sentence which such vile rants . 
  the prerequisite for anti-semitism is either to a ) deny it b ) not deny it but claim the jews ` milk it ' . 
  you should be ashamed for spouting such rubbish . 
  you 're delusional if you do n't think that there are jews who milk it . 
  now again if you 're going to be hostile to me for no reason implying that i 'm a neo-nazi then saying that i 'm not is pointless . 
  here 's a hypothetical for you : `` if you think that all lithuanians are like that then why should i think that all jews are not like you ? '', 
  do you even grasp this concept ? 
   like i said , i saw absolutely no outrage by the native lithuanians for the crimes their nationalists did . 
  it thus falls on the responsibility of the surviving jews to speak up for our slaughtered brothers/forefathers . 
  this includes lithuania . 
  i have a strong feeling throughout your comment that you have something against jews . 
  this for example . 
  so if you did n't see an outrage then it did n't happen ? 
  that 's holocaust denier logic . 
  he did n't see it happen himself then it means it did n't happen . 
   again , complete rubbish , this never is ` brought up ' . 
  okay , maybe you never do . 
  but i 've seen it and heard it brought up . 
  same way that you spoke with some lithuanians that did n't condemn nazism . 
  i do n't hold you accountable for some jewish asshole and i do n't think that all jews and israel as a whole are retards . 
  do you get what i 'm trying to tell you ? 
   look i do n't believe you are anti-semitic at all , you claim you condemn such believes , i do believe however that you feel guilty for the crimes some of lithuanian nationalist did during the ww2 period and thus to allieviate this guilt you 're going on rants on how the ` jews only view themselves as the victims ' , by doing so , potraying those whom went through genocide as the wrongdoiers , it helps alleviate it . 
  this is my belief anyways . 
  i get ranty about this topic for the previous things that i 've said . 
  jews in lithuania flourished and we had good relations as people and now every jew you run into on the internet straight up starts claiming that lithuanians are holocaust deniers . 
  it 's annoying to say the least . 
  not to mention the thing that you have brought up as well . 
  that they were lithuanian citizens . 
  it 's like you rob us of a tragedy and then blame us for it for not dealing with it while having no autonomy during occupations . 
  that 's how i feel about it sometimes . 
  also i never portrayed jews as the wrongdoers . 
  that 's a whole different topic of why jews have been universally disliked during history ( not that it 's a valid reason for genocide ) . 
  i was just merely pointing that that there are assholes everywhere and how you 're frustrated by blatant idiocies when confronting some lithuanians , i can assure you that there are more than enough of equally retarded individuals among your people as well . 
   and yes , many of them ( lithuanians ) literally praised the german occupation/government of ww2 , which was disturbing for me to read . 
  i realise now this might have been more out of hatred for the soviet union/russia than actual anti-semitism . 
  this is because the germans fought the russians , whom they viewed the russians more of their enemy ( i did not know during the time lithuanians today strongly dislike russia and the soviets ) . 
  those who actually praise german occupation are either ill informed or neo nazis . 
  but let 's be honest here . 
  both groups are probably uneducated on the topic . 
  it 's natural that you would be upset more about a toothache that lasts for a month than a broken leg that you had a few years back . 
  if that analogy makes sense . 
  also keep in mind that litvaks were mostly in vilnius . 
  you do n't need to be of a different race or nationality or whatever for there to be a disconnect between people living in urban areas and people living in rural areas . 
  not that that 's an excuse it 's just part of the context . 
  you answered it yourself regarding the link . 
  people that get `` honored '' are people who fought soviets . 
  a bunch of em were shady but that honored stuff is blown out of the water honestly . 
  they just have plaques . 
  no one would know about them if the jewish community did n't cause a stink about it . 
  and then it goes international as if we 're holding parades for them . 
  btw there were plenty of jews in authority positions sending lithuanian families to gulags during russian empire times . 
  this gets mentioned in documentaries as one of the reasons as a catalyst to how jewish and lithuanian relations soured prior ww2 . 
  make no mistake , however , this fact does not make me hostile to jews even though i 'm sure most would defend those individuals . 
  it 's just tribal . 
  you talk shit about some group of people and other people from the group get the urge to defend them . 
  i just do n't get what is to be accomplished branding everyone from a nation as nazi sympathizers because you ran into some dickheads . 
  you keep talking about an outrage . 
  what do you expect to happen ? 
  lithuania recognizes the holocaust etc , our first president issued an official apology .

since when germany dictates what european values are ? 
  we have been in one union where all equal but somehow one nation is more equal then others . 
  the whole europe should dance to german politics because you like it so much ? 
  if you want more of usa influence in europe and more conflict , go ahead . 
  i 'll prepare some popcorn waiting for those riots . 
  i think you 'll join after a fight , and do n't get me wrong , i support your fight very much . 
  i think in the end every eu country will take amounts of refugees , maybe it wo n't be called quotas , but still . 
  i just hope with you and polan fighting , all c/e europe will get more money from germany to process the refugees . 
  we take quotas of refugees , you keep those sanctions in place firmly . 
  european solidarity boyz . 
  people who `` survive on those 325 '' already vote for populists , so it wo n't change anything . 
  will those 600 eur come from lt budget ? 
  i do n't think so . 
  and of course one refugee costs more than local , you have to teach language , integrate and so on . 
  but that 's not a point , the point is that refugees are coming and solutions are still not catching up , so we will have more of them in europe , and we have to solve the problem . 
  we can do this quota . 
  i bet we can easily do at least 1000 every year . 
  would just need some money to pour into integration industry and we 're good to go . 
  with pleasure if it would be mine decision . 
  we just need time and good example to change the moods , 
  good news , they start to solve the problem . 
  majority in lithuania see u.s. as an ally . 
  we consume lot 's of u.s. culture throw cinema , tv , music , books and we like it . 
  so i 'd say , general attitude is positive . 
  of course we 'll find some good 20 % who will see u.s. more negatively because of wars , and some having a russian view point on u.s. , nato and shit in general . 
  from a geopolitical point of view , for lithuania u.s. is the most important strategical ally . 
  they give us protection and we work for them in un , eu , intelligence field and so on . 
  i see it as a good deal and hope that it will last . 
  lithuania has no choice in its geographical position , it 's either russia or some other big military country . 
  now it 's u.s. and for us they are not the worst protection mafiozis around . 
  of course they do some really shitty stuff in some places but you have to be realistic about those things . 
  it 's a possibility i do n't even want to think about :( if nato would collapse and usa withdraw its military influence from europe , baltics would be fucked for good . 
  german deepthroat and some big russian from behind as it happened numerous times in history . 
  at least in baltics , our security is based on strategical ( from our perspective ) alliance with usa ( nato ) . 
  that should n't change no matter what happens with eu . 
  dude comes from bulgaria , so of course he has lower standards . 
  it 's just strange that german university has the same shit like universities in balkans and post-soviet europe . 
  oh , we understand that love very well . 
  even if we wo n't go deep into history mr. gerhard schroder and his love for russian money will always be remembered . 
  great stuff !, 
  thank you . 
  what the fuck guys ? 
  handle your jesus . 
  fascinating . 
  i need to visit siberia someday . 
  we all love some good old s & m in east europe < 3, 
  that hungarian stuff were real bubbles . 
  just imagine , full bag of different color bubbles o_o, 
  yeah that gave me some perspective on capitalism vs communism . 
  no bubbles in cccp but sometimes it was possible to get the shittiest gum called `` piglet chuk '' . 
  that stuff lost taste in 10 seconds and was unchewable in a minute . 
  bubble gum . 
  i had a pleasure to visit hungary and they had bubble gum , my mother bought me a big bag of it and i was in shock . 
  could n't believe that i 'm really an owner of all that . 
  love it !, 
  young people in the video are political science students . 
  that 's a crimea for you . 
  so no facts just oversimplified youtube and twitter based pov with no regards to complex realities of real situation . 
  thanks , we can end the discussion here . 
  and what 's kaliningrad ? 
  and what about belarus with all those russian military bases ? 
  lithuania also does n't have `` real border '' but it did n't prevent our occupation . 
  the fact is that there are no facts about these claims , just putins words which you chose to believe . 
  it 's about regional dominion not about isis oil . 
  this game was between turkey , iran and saudis , then putin came and began to act as a hegemon in turkeys backyard , bombing rebels that turkey supports , empowering assad , strengthening iran position . 
  it 's just natural that turkey got angry . 
  isis oil has nothing to do with all this . 
  totally agree , hollande has a spine . 
  and that leaves us with a question - who 's better prepared for consequences and who had what plans for such situation . 
  well it 's a bit different situation . 
  in this case it 's war going on just over the border , it 's turkmen involved , it 's turkeys plans for syria overruled by russia and more . 
  it 's not a random showmanship in the middle of nowhere . 
  i think russia expected to be treated as always . 
  they even kidnapped estonian officer and nothing happened . 
  so i think putin decided that he can act as he wishes and nato will stay put as always . 
  it 's just strange that he believed that he can fuck up turkeys plans in it 's backyard and they wo n't object . 
  it 's really a good question . 
  do they have a plan ? 
  fair enough . 
  i think in those times optimism for the future was very high . 
  have you even read the article ? 
  number of refugees that will be taken by usa is agreed some time ago , now they talk about diplomatic help dealing with gulf states , about cooperation in mid and about sharing know how for border control . 
  you will , we wo n't . 
  and let the bargain about refugee quotas begin . 
  but it is the same story , why would anyone sell different one when reality and the story are the same ? 
  times change you know . 
  back then russia was not a totalitarian state ruled by kgb and trying to overthrow western dominion . 
  even lithuania were kinda buddies with russia during yeltsin rule . 
  we even had a pact of not fucking over each other in intelligence field . 
  now they kidnap officers form estonia . 
  nato ai n't creeping , countries are jumping in with great enthusiasm . 
  first thing lithuania did when regained independence was to establish strategic policy of joining nato and eu . 
  i agree , from russian pov nato is creeping to their borders but form small ex-soviet states pov - we are running away from those fuckers as fast as we can . 
  in two hundred years we got more than enough of russian rule . 
  anything is better . 
  i like this new polish government . 
  we wo n't have to shout so loud about russia and 'll get a breather . 
  the same with refugees . 
  while poles are fighting for common foreign policy interests we can concentrate on internal matters . 
  at least i hope we will do that .

  poland-lithuania ) . 
   you actually claim that lithuanians are some kind of special people with a much longer history of warfare against russians ... that lack of education is bothering me so much on you . 
  no , you 're just butt hurt for not seeing estonia above all . 
   again , are you for real ?? 
  peasants vs knights , what a great conflict . 
  still does n't involve russia vs latvians , estonians . 
   of course , every nation can only have one enemy . 
  i do n't know how russia could have been your enemy when they were n't the ones that occupied you at that time , your occupants waged wars to russians not you . 
  and they organized land militias of estonians and latvians as well and the locals still perished in those conflicts against germans , not russians . 
   seriously , how fucked up nationalistic the lithuanian history education can be ? 
  you really need a chill pill , your mental stability is getting over the sky , just to show how much you hate russians , you 're the one nationalistic here sadly . 
   do you actually claim that lithuanians have a long history of warfare with russians and estonians and latvians do n't ? 
  unlike your nation we stood our ground and fought back foreign invaders , your enemy was germans at that time not russians , teutonic/livonian order was the one that fought against russians not latvians or estonians . 
   lol , like estonians and latvians have n't had `` bad blood '' with them even longer than the 14th century like ? 
  i do ? 
  yes we are . 
  we have been adversary with russia since mid 14 century . 
  we got far more bad blood ( historically speaking ) with them than you do . 
  half of us do . 
   this can be pinpointed to the memories of soviet repression sadly it goes deeper than that , from the [ deluge ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/deluge_ ( history \\ ) ) times , to [ occupation ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/third_partition_of_poland ) for 123 years by russian empire and [ language oppression ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lithuanian_press_ban ) that fallowed . 
  and giving us a total [ psycho as governor ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mikhail_muravyov-vilensky ) , that would be nick named `` hangman of vilnius '' . 
  other than belarus and russophiles in e. ukraine , russia does n't have any support in e. europe . 
   alzheimer 's what you mean by that ? 
  please do not lump every european into one , we 're different people , with different culture , different politics and different national interests , do n't lump europeans who really sees you as saviour of european continent to those who talk shit . 
  oh yes , we 're beggars , how [ ca n't we defend ourselves against nation ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmynp0ovv2c ) that only has ~ 46x bigger population , that has nuclear weapons , that has been our [ adversary since middle ages ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/muscovite\u2013lithuanian_wars ) . 
  [ love you america ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/state_continuity_of_the_baltic_states#list_of_recognition_and_non-recognition_of_annexation ) . 
  there was no benefit for prussians . 
  it 's that protestant  orthodox religion ( though lithuania is officially a roman catholic , out side memelland ) when it comes to rights of minority . 
  germans felt our and polish pain . 
  no it 's a [ thing ] ( http://i.imgur.com/refhodn.jpg ) that causes [ war ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polish\u2013lithuanian_war ) . 
  you 're right , problem was polonization and forgetting your own customs and national identity which was n't even important back in the day . 
  so it 's pretty much selling your own soul for something else . 
  do n't do it !, 
  good old days , eh ? 
  [ moment when germans are the good guys ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lithuanian_book_smugglers ) . 
  you 're closer to russians than we are  , 
  only near lakes or other natural water source . 
   do you want to be eaten alive by bugs ? 
  i thought that was only possible in australia ? 
  damn america , you 're scary . 
  fascist pribaltika why ca n't they speak russian ? 
  we saved you , open your ass cheeks . 
  they have bears with machine guns attached on them . 
  it 's not belarusian forces that are going to attack us , but russian ones , belarus is just territory from which aggressor could launch an attack but it ca n't be an actual threat because it has no actual power ... other than building power plant right next to our border . 
   ok , but they are and they show the peoples ' opinions . 
  some * people opinions that is going to fade over time , it also depend on whom they ask , what age group they choose etc. 
  and on russian subreddit you will find how russia is great , how ussr was great , how putin is great leader etc. 
  we have nothing in common with other baltic states other than having same foreign policy and being in same language group with latvians . 
   also i 've seen the opinion polls in which poland is considered second most dangerous country to lithuania , right after russia and there 's quite a lot of anti polish sentiment . 
  to me these kind of polls are bullshit . 
  not really . 
  other than poles who have superiority complex and lithuanians with inferiority complex . 
  probably poland , belarus is way too russified . 
  other than language we 're the same . 
   enemy of enemy is my friend pretty much how lithuanian and polish relations got revived . 
  macedonia for sure . 
   poland & lithuania still a big way to go . 
  you tell us . 
  heir to lithuanian throne is ` prince that was promised ' . 
  the plan is going well , soon hordes will settle that land . 
  too much cold war for you . 
  it has more to do with holy roman empire , austrian empire , polish-lithuanian commonwealth , teutonic-livonian order , russian empire , german empire , swedish empire etc. 
  it just shows how much great power in the past influenced territories culturally that are still seen today ( buildings , religion , customs etc ) . 
  because we still live in a past , give it a time . 
  eslali federation . 
  you know you 're coming with us . 
  :\\ ^ ) we 're born for each other . 
  broliukas is same blood , does n't matter . 
  no , it was very flawed . 
  hitler just believed in his retarded idea of pure race . 
  do n't worry , we all belong to master race . 
  something , something that caused ~ 600 years alliance disappear over night , after ww1 . 
  how so ? 
  stealing money from his own country , sending innocent soldiers to die for his own gain ( into separatist republics of e. ukraine ) , causing russia into shitty economical situation etc. 
  judging from our western standards , he 's absolute sh * t. 
  because russians ca n't catch a break with a really good leader . 
  every nation is mix of different people . 
  we 're not special snowflake . 
  well russians like their partners to get on their knees , so you can guess . 
  that region you 're speaking of is artificial , has 0 history with russia , while we were sandwiched between poland and russia through almost whole our history as a state . 
  and bulgarians are definitely not turks . 
  the deluge times were actual nightmare , far worse than ww2 by population losses . 
  ethnic lithuanian lands and lapland were last regions in europe to convert to christianity even after that paganism was still prevailing . 
  the only nation that was erased from map was old prussians . 
   actually , from the ordinary man 's point of view ( quality of life , wealth , etc. 
  ) , putin 's rule ( at least from mid-zeroes to the start of the oil crisis ) was one of the best periods in russian history . 
  which is really sad ... 
  i think he 's turk living in uk . 
  germoney ?

  a system where king was elected by szlachta ( 15 % of commonwealth 's population ) was more `` democratic '' than a system where kings were `` elected by god '' .

  sounds like a populist , neither of those things will happen .

  ----- overall it seems that you would like to have more taxes and spend more money on food and products .

  57 per cent of residents are not producing anything in lithuania . 
  these are children , the unemployed , students , elderdly people and the ones unable to work . 
  this means that the remaining 43 per cent have to produce all stuff . 
  another thing is that it is no longer true that people who leave are the ones who ca n't find a decent job . 
  there are plenty of decent jobs and lots of people go abroad simply because of cultural reasons or because they are hungry for opportunities , not because of poverty or anything like that .

  [ empti - saloje ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xbfnlvcrayi ) ( * on an island * ) , a quintessential lithuanian summer track from 1999 . 
  yes , these are results after a run-off . 
  it would be considered a landslide victory in many other countries , where two candidates are competing for two major parties . 
  however , lithuania has a multi-party system with some candidates often running ( and winning ) independently . 
  two rounds are usually needed and fluctuations in public opinion are much larger . 
  by lithuanian standards this victory is ` convincing ' . 
  landslide would be something like 70-30 . 
  the turnout was 47.31 % . 
  that 's not far from an average election in lithuania . 
  well , you are not too far from being correct . 
  the runner-up indeed often demonstrated a certain * do n't give a fuck * attitude . 
  yet ... grybauskaite was seen as a strong favourite , but not as an obvious winner . 
  her final result of 58 percent against her opponent 's 40 percent is far from being a landslide victory . 
  this kind of electoral split does leave some room for hopes and surprises . 
  i would disagree that the runner-up did not want to win . 
  he did a lot of work to consolidate voters whose preferred candidates dropped out after the first round . 
  he was also a lot more agressive before the run-off than he was before the first round . 
  that 's right . 
  in political , social and military contexts russian term * provokatsiya * indeed has a bit more narrow meaning than english * provocation * . 
   * provokatsiya * simply means taking control of your enemies in secret and encouraging them to do things that discredit them and help you .

  / r/europics, 
   could it be expected that lithuania will soon be on the lookout for new fighter jets ? 
  no fighter jets , at least not in the short term . 
  surface to air missile systems , akin to patriot are likely to be among the first costly purchases . 
  we are about to make a large order for wheeled apcs , but this plan was already in the pipeline before deciding to increase the spending . 
  also , we 're about to buy some polish grom man-portable missiles . 
  it is expected that the infantry should be modernised . 
  i do n't know what will be done next . 
  however , minister of defence explicitly told that there currently are no plans to buy planes . 
  lithuania is opening a lng import terminal later this year , first on the baltic shores , i think . 
  other countries that have ability to import lng would be able to benefit from this new legislation too . 
  however , our energy sector is heavily dependent on russian gas , and we are forced to overpay for it by about 30 % , so this request is very much ours . 
  yeah , that was quite emotional for a senate hearing .

  probably there was not a single time throughout a history of time when russia would do anything good to any other country without actually attempting to invade , occupy or otherwise harm it as a result of that aid .

  huylo and the leaders of civilized world, 
  i think what he meant is that far right and far left are both socialist , one targeting a class while the other targets ethnicity . 
  unsure if makes sense , both are equally rubbish imho . 
  it 's odd how the electorate are flapping between socialism and facism there . 
  now that 's concerning . 
  i appreciate and kind of feel pleased if foreigners ( and i mean expats ) choose to learn lithuanian while they stay , but i would never set this as an expectation . 
  the default is to speak english with them and i think it would not make much sense the other way around . 
  yup , founder of nkvd which was known for public executions , torture , etc. 
  i can not back it up now but imo it was way worse than kgb ever was . 
  he was also the one expanding the labour camp system . 
  like he never done anything else than killings and torture . 
  i ca n't even comprehend why anyone in their sane mind would appreciate anything this person did . 
  also about supression of a group . 
  it 's a thing in lithuania that you ca n't establish a party that would openly speak nazi or communist ideas . 
  normally i would agree with you however our historical bacground and geographic location has to be taken into account . 
  after regaining the independence in 1990 the leftovers of communist party attempted to establish a situation that could be looked at as a civil war so that the red army would come to the rescue which they tried to do a bit later causing civilian casualties ( jan 13 , 1991 ) . 
  the leaders of this fled to russia and those who did n't were brought to trial rendering the communist party illegal as anti-state . 
  and for nazi it should be obvious as relatively many ethnic lithuanians collaborated with nazis during ww2 and it is a stigma here . 
  now we do have national youth ( pro-nazi ) and socialist front parties now and both of them together never collect more than 1 % of a vote in ellections the ban is still in place as a never again statement . 
  do n't get me wrong , i 'm not saying you are defending it i 'm just surprised of how many people are . 
  in regards to the u.s. if i had to choose whether to live in the states or in ussr ( or rf ) i would choose u.s without a crystal of a doubt . 
  and i think many redditors would regardless of that u.s. bashing and russia praising is ( or rather was before putins another little war commenced ) a thing in this community . 
  not saying us are perfect , americans know better . 
  it always surprises me when people mention idustrialisation and/or modernisarion as perks of ussr . 
  western world have managed to go through all this without gulags and collectivisation , have n't they ? 
  i 'm pretty confident that most of the former soviet states would have been better without it . 
  especially russia with all the natural resources it has . 
  also this : http://www.novayagazeta.ru/storage/p/2014/05/01/1398942234_776632_74.jpg oit of all the scums somebody managed to pick berya ? 
  wow , just wow . 
  you do n't see many soviet union flags and pictures of stalin being carried around `` all over a world '' . 
  regime that is directly responsible for hundreds of thousands ( if not millions ) of deaths including russians themselves is no different from any other of such kind and should not be adored . 
  as sobebody else mentioned you do n't see germans celebrating hitler 's birthday on the streets of berlin much . 
  of course it 's all in the eye of the beholder and is a subject to local laws , however i fail to comprehend how can somebody be apologetic to any of these regimes and their crimes in current society . 
  living there sometimes makes me forget how beautiful it actually is . 
  thanks buddy . 
  i 've seen this map somewhere on facebook with numbers of troop divisions , tanks and fighter jets against each european country . 
  i was surprised of how strong poland actually is compared to any eastern european country . 
  while in lithuania we actually rely on poland to come to the rescue if anything , you know , would happen . 
  just to add to your `` the crimean population wants to be with russia , let it . '', 
  statement , i partially agree with it . 
  let them keep it , it will be yet another highly successful and valuable win , next to abhazia or transnistria / sarcasm although this is probably not the case here this attitude may be harmful . 
  with enough funding the propoganda works pretty well . 
  having a successful precedent it would not take long for certain parts of other countries to claim a wish `` to be with russia '' . 
  it would not even require a military intervention , economic blocade of the rf and and the crimea would do much more damage . 
  also if i 'm not mistaken crimea itself is totally dependent on ukraine when it comes to a supply of drinking water and electricity . 
  good for you . 
  other people might bring some company confidential data with them and risk being sued in their countries for the disclosure and otherwise held in custody for not disclosing .

  what if they take my company issued laptop while on a business trip ? 
  i work in a bank and can possibly have some confidential stuff relating to other people and companies out there . 
  what if the laptop will be online when they will try to seize it ? 
  if i will shut it down in their presence ( the hdd is encrypted ) they will definitely find that suspicious and my trip will be ruined if they will take it and hold me in custody for not unlocking the device , if not - some smartass will browse through the confidential files of a foreign bank !, 
  yes and this is because we are the southernmost of all the nordic and baltic states . 
  we 're like spain of north-eastern europe !, 
  i think the difference between the us and eu from sovereignty perspective is that the us was established as a new country as a consequence of gaining independence while in eu case the countries would lose their independence from geopolitical point of view . 
  and while people in the us identify themselves as us citizens in a first place rather than citizens of their state as such , in the eu it would be the opposite .

  what we have now is gazprom and only gazprom which is being constantly used as a tool to punish us for not licking putin 's balls . 
  we need a west funded player in our market to stop a monopoly asap . 
  nobody else ever wanted to step in except for chevron and now thanks to our putin apologist leftist government we are still dependent on gazprom .

  we have a psycho ruled country beside us - and we need as much of us and eu in our markets as we can get,

  the rf has recently ( last year if i recall that correctly ) started legal action against citizens of former soviet states , not rf , who have refused to be drafted to the red army during and post indepence declaration of these states in 1990/1991 . 
  so it 's not a simple rights and obligations claim this one . 
  i 'm confused how can this be in u.n. 's agenda at all ? 
  given this was the thing why not vote on re-establishment of slavery or that women are treated worse in israel than in saudi arabia .

  dude , even you agreed that russia invaded georgia , while georgia did nothing bad to russia , only being the unfortunate country to border russia . 
  http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/27n7f6/russia_warns_finland_against_joining_nato/ci2vox5 http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/27n7f6/russia_warns_finland_against_joining_nato/ci3ntmm nah , i just think you eat too much propaganda for dinner . 
  but you did - just read your messages , where you tried to bend over and not call it an invasion . 
  calling other ignorant for saying that it was an invasion . 
  and if you still try to say otherwise , then i 'm sorry - probably was speaking to other vladibot on this account the other day . 
  well i hope to backpack/hitchhike in central europe . 
  i have tickets to berlin from vilnius for 3 euro . 
  although , i 'm not really sure about hitchhiking , but i probably have to risk something :d . anyway , i plan on visiting my sis in stuttgart and then maybe going to denmark to visit a friend . 
  and if i 'll still be willing to go somewhere then i have no idea where to go :d . 
   well , duh !, 
  so why did you try to say otherwise ? 
  : ddd  so did nato in serbia , and they did it for basically the same reason ( although it was much more brutal ) . 
  and when everything fails we go the other russian way - blame west . 
  you finally found the courage to say that russia actually invaded . 
  does not want `` hot '' region near it 's border , so the best decision is invasion . 
  well yeah . 
  because you ' r story is missing russia . 
  you said what happened , like georgia tried to force abkhazia to stay ( just like now ukraine is trying to keep east parts of the country ) , abkhazians responded violently and then bam - russia modafaka . 
  so that 's what everyone is saying . 
  no , i mean russia 's invasion of georgia . 
  where georgia tried to calm down separatists of abkhazia . 
  a `` country '' which organised a cleansing of georgians . 
  and cis ( read russia ) had sanctions on abkhazia until 2008 when putin decided to invade . 
  russia is just not the country to bring peace and prosperity . 
  courses for what ? 
  you are living in an environment where everywhere you go it 's foreign language . 
  idk how it 's possible not to learn the language in decades . 
  that 's just higher level of closiness, 
  i 'm sorry to break this to you , but invasion does n't work without shooting or blowing things up . 
  so stop lieing to yourself, 
  so you are stupid because russia helped to keep `` peace '' in that region ? 
   because south ossetia is russia are you this fucking stupid ? 
  yeah and media has something to do with it . 
  like i remember reading some time ago , that german and polish media collectively decided ( probably with help/push of governments ) to publish more positive news about each other and keep negative ones to the minimum and it improved both countries peoples opinion on each other . 
  and here it 's definitely not like that . 
  for example we are subscribed to `` lietuvos rytas '' one of bigger newspapers . 
  and i have noticed that they tend to put poles in a bad light . 
  when i see article about poland/poles i 'm always like : `` oh this gun be gud '' . 
  usually it 's some shit like crazy poles and their 110 % devotion to christianity . 
  although last time it was some serious stuff - stories how mother kills 5 or more children ` cuz abortion is forbidden . 
  anyway , that newspaper does n't form hostile opinion , but it certainly makes poles look like some crazy shit people . 
  and i must agree , there have n't been a lot of problems in polish side . 
  yet polish card ( karta polaka ) is a bit controversial , but as far as it 's not a massive thing it will be pretty much ignored . 
  i have not idea . 
  and i believe it was 20 years ago . 
  it 's a shame that it has been so long . 
  i see no reasonable points in not allowing it . 
  well you failed to prove that that you had any rights to it before 1920 , that is after we declared independence in 1918 with capital vilnius . 
  so i do n't find it hopeless . 
  well yes there were quite a lot of poles in the region , but does it really gives a reason to annex a part of other country ? 
  see ? 
  you are just trying to be the pole that we want to kick ass . 
  well they are not nazis , but they are not the friendliest fans . 
  whenever polish team is going to play lithuanian team the media just goes on like this : `` oh shit !, 
  poles are coming !, 
  watch these x years old videos of poles starting a riot in vilnius stadium , x+y years old video of poles coming with swords and daggers . 
  but do n't worry - this time we quadruple our police forces and we are sure that there wo n't be a lot of damage done '' . 
  well it has a bit to do polish minority . 
  like you have good relations with countries you do n't have border with , unless they do something really bad . 
  and they try to `` protect '' polish minority in lithuania . 
  and countries do n't like when other countries interfere in other countries affairs . 
  like polish foreign affairs minister said he wo n't visit lithuania until poles are able to write their names/surnames in polish letters . 
  kek, 
  well you simply agreed to it . 
  [ with suwalki agreement ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/suwa%c5%82ki_agreement ) . 
  but i do n't think we should be taking this any further , because it just adds to the problem . 
  one of the reasons why lithuanians hate poles is because `` wilno nasze '' . 
  we were pretty much friendly until 1920 , but then poland decided to expand a bit . 
  and after that lots of propaganda was published in lithuania about those dirty poles and it just keeps on being alive . 
  yes , i 'm quite disappointed that the only polish party so pro russian and does n't really do anything for the poles themselves . 
  for example , in polish media you probably heard that we do n't allow polish people to write their names in your special letters . 
  as in only lithuanian litters allowed . 
  but for the first time llra ( polish party ) is in the ruling coalition and nothing has changed ( a bit over than 1.5 years after elections ) . 
  and do n't even ask about economy in those polish regions . 
  although they are near capital vilnius - economical powerhouse , llra ca n't even attract money to the region around vilnius , in which they single handled have control in them , ( regions around vilnius only get few % of what vilnius is able to attract ) .

  it 's pretty cool to have government close by too . 
  instead of having someone thousands of kilometres away deciding things . 
  exactly . 
  nationalism is not about claiming it 's the best nation . 
  my country survived over occupations and regained independence both times thanks to nationalism . 
  there was no claim that we 're better than the empires occupying us or whatever . 
  just that we want to speak our language and have our own laws . 
  there 's a lot of cow milk produce that do n't have ( much ) lactose in them . 
  like hard cheese . 
  in addition to that , there 're other types of milk . 
  which may or may not be included in this pic . 
  i 'd rather look at my country . 
  which survived occupations and various tries to eradicate our language and culture thanks to nationalism . 
  but they do n't . 
  nationalism is about each nation having it 's own state and ruling itself . 
  once we get into `` better than other '' territory , it 's chauvinism . 
  herkus monte - never forget !, 
  more like still do n't trust russians ... 
  karaliau\u010dius rightful baltic clay !, 
  it is . 
  there 's a nursing degree in vilnius university . 
  lithuania provides live [ ammo ] ( http://www.reuters.com/article/us-lithuania-ukraine-iduskcn1190f3?il=0 ) and [ rehab ] ( https://www.baltictimes.com/lithuania_to_provide_rehabilitation_for_injured_ukrainian_soldiers/ ) to ukrainian soldiers . 
  i 'm too lazy to google for more , sorry . 
  we 're incapable of doing more thanks to putting ourselves in this situation . 
  like with migrants . 
  our own laws prevent us from doing anything meaningful . 
  although we have technical capabilities . 
  but we 're stuck . 
  as i said in another comment , there 's ( some ) hardware and manpower but there 's no political will . 
  sucks to see how eu is destroying itself and doing nothing to truly be a global power . 
  while trying to laugh at trump for what is actually going on in eu . 
  funny thing is , ee states were the ones that pushed for pro-ukraine/georgia response . 
  poland and lithuania supported ukraine from day 1 and still provides a lot of support , including military . 
  i 'm sure `` has-been '' powers have more capability than pl or lt. . . or at least the same  eu frequently published a common position on certain cases . 
  let it be infamous georgia 's war report or various papers on ukraine . 
  eu-wide sanctions on russia counts as `` eu foreign policy '' as well in my books . 
  eu invades russia -  boom , ww3 . 
  the only problem with georgia taking the bait is it gives an excuse for people to white wash russia . 
  but russia has done enough shitty actions no white washing will help them . 
  aside from those who have skin in the game , of course . 
  in both cases , different eu response could have prevented outcomes we see now . 
  . . while russian forces where already on southern side of the tunnel . 
  that was a great manoeuvre by russians so they can claim moral high now . 
  it 's like classical school fight . 
  bully threatens a nerd day after day after day . 
  one day nerd hits first and is suddenly the offender in bully 's eyes  are you implying that russia/south ossetia rightfully enlarge their clay now ? 
  given how most eu countries do n't maintain their own armies , nato is becoming what you described . 
  what eu needs more than military is will to back it up . 
  there 're capabilities already , but no will to use them . 
  eu army would n't magically give will . 
  but make single members less capable to attack if they 'd wish to . 
  i do n't mean `` invited '' directly by asking to come . 
  but enough things were said that was easy to read in this way . 
  the whole `` we can do this '' and `` refugees welcome '' campaign . 
  all of this applies if it was eu navy . 
  op said european navy could solve this . 
  my point was that italy navy today can do as much as european navy tomorrow . 
  what would be different if it was european navy instead of italian navy ? 
  yeah . . merkel really did n't ever say questionable things that many people took as invite ... and there were no migrants saying on record they think merkel invited them . 
  why is n't italian navy doing exactly that ? 
  nope , we 've flat vat . 
  we do have the usual additional taxes for alcohol/tobacco/gas / etc. 
  i 'm not sure about vat in germany , but it looks like in most countries only food gets vat exemptions . 
  if vat would be raised in exchange of corporate tax , we 'd need much more exemptions . 
  basic clothes , housing , transport , kids goods ... that 'd be a huuuge can of worms . 
  i agree that too easy to avoid taxes shall be either much lower or do n't exist at all . 
  but i 'm not so sure about increasing vat . 
  unless vat would have several tiers for different products . 
  like lower vat for essential food etc. 
  otherwise it would n't go down well with most of the public . 
  and i 'd be sceptic if that 'd would benefit society as a whole . 
  yes , franchising . 
  but not as franchise-available-to-anyone , but internal franchising . 
  i 'm not a lawyer and do n't know from how is that different from subsidiary company and which scheme kaufland bg might be using . 
  but `` selling '' trademark franchise internally seem to be a popular scheme to transfer profits to lower tax territories . 
  i remember reading that 's what ikea do . 
  and vp market do ( or used to do ) the same . 
  they theoretically already do that . 
  but they rent the original trademark from the parent company . 
  which is accidentally equal to their pre-trademark-fee profit ... by the way , this is not necessarily a west/east divide and western import vs homegrown companies . 
  for example , our homegrown grocery chain vp market aka maxima aka tmarket . 
  their root holding relocated to netherlands a while ago do n't pay much taxes in lithuania anymore . 
  at least few of their founders relocated to tax heavens as well . 
  one of the biggest local-grown construction companies is now residing in estonia purely for tax reasons . 
  so much for local vs western companies . . 
  what does it have to do with pagan swastika ? 
  those dudes wore tricolor as far as i know . 
  i would n't be surprised if they wore vytis as well . 
  but they did n't wear baltic pagan swastika or were related with neo-paganism of the time . 
  by your logic , tri-color ( and possibly vytis ) should be banned . 
  yet baltic swastika is alright . 
  history of what ? 
  baltic pagans killing jews ? 
  when grand duchy of lithuania was one of the most jewish-friendly states at the time ? 
  i totally support ban of nazi and soviet symbols . 
  but i 've nothing against hammer or sickle or 5-pointed star per se . 
  if you want to rock a hammer and sickle as a sign for your agriculture company - go ahead . 
  in addition to that , we should remember that it 's important what the symbol stands for , not the symbol itself . 
  no symbol is inherently good or bad . 
  we should evaluate any symbol in given context and do n't take it at face value .

  i had a couple of russians tell me that baltics are not countries , could n't figure out what are they , but they made it clear that they are not countries . 
  meh , that 's not the main problem , human waste is organic so it does n't completely destroy the whole sea . 
  you mean france and spain spew out industrial waste into mediterranean ? 
  yes , but one half of the globe is russia and another is n't . 
  you can pick which way you want to go . 
  sure there is , globes have two halves . 
  half way and the wrong way . 
  moose , mooses , meese , english language at work . 
  what do you mean weak atheist , that 's straight up atheist and that 's it . 
  you do n't believe the story , need proof , that 's every atheist on the planet . 
  if talking about younger generation , very . 
  that 's going to cost . 
  but they are norwegian so , whatever . 
  church was and still is a way to get money out of people . 
  here in lithuania you want to have your dead relatives name mentioned before prayers ? 
  30 euro . 
  you want the whole mass to be dedicated to them ? 
  60 euro . 
  you want a priest to come and bless the grave ? 
  30 euro and you have to take the priest to the grave and back . 
  you want to marry in the church ? 
  60 euro . 
  these prices are actually printed on a poster . 
  it 's disgusting . 
  my close relative was divorced and apparently you can still marry in the church after you divorce , you just have to pay 300 euro and wait a year . 
  that made me laugh and then cry inside . 
  oh russia , how do you manage to be so funny and extremely sad at the same time . 
  not at all . 
  it 's a trade-off . 
  i think we would think about it . 
  even if we open borders they will keep them closed and tell everyone how awful we are . 
  sounds good to me . 
  we would move to the other side of the globe if we could . 
  so both major russian cities , how unexpected . 
  he can retire if he wants , but i know he never will , that 's not what dictators do , so there is only one solution , death . 
  man i hope putin will die before 2042 . 
  that 's way too long to have putin for . 
  in soviet russia ... 
  you mean kaliningrad . 
  did you know that kaliningrad still has no waste treatments plants and dumps everything straight into the baltic sea ? 
  how nasty is that . 
  yes , it 's mostly for contraband . 
  in which case it 's not all that pointless . 
  just needs some more barbed wire and a couple of miniguns . 
  you go guys . 
  also less gold, 
  ask them . 
  also personal experience . 
  dogs are like toddlers , you have to constantly take care of them . 
  yeah , that could work , a little close to russia tho . 
  you mean most people in eu do n't like danes ? 
  way to go guys . 
  yeah well , we will be taking them in . 
  i still do n't see your point . 
  1 ) we need to reduce world 's population not increase it . 
  2 ) same as above . 
  3 ) exists in more countries than norway , they just have no resources 4 ) bullshit , that is your choice , if you force it you are stalin 5 ) same as above 6 ) ridiculous , north korea 7 ) north korea 8 ) ussr 9 ) crazy vegan 10 ) sure why not , but give support to people who ca n't afford it 11 ) most people do n't like dogs , including me 12 ) like people do n't travel already 13 ) north korea 14 ) wtf , sources please 15 ) north korea 16 ) north korea, 
  we are taking them in , they do n't come . 
  christians too , but some of them are crazy enough for me to stay away . 
  really unpopular opinion , because religion constantly tries to ridicule those who are irreligious , why ca n't it be fair ? 
  we talk shit , they talk shit . 
  baltics would move their land over to antarctica if russia joined eu . 
  i do n't like danes because they do n't like eu for no reason . 
  \u0160vedai , yes . 
  i mean there is no point for them to leave , of course it would n't be the same if they left , it would be big change . 
  british people would n't even notice something happened to be honest , i do n't see what would change for them , they have no euro , they are n't in schengen . 
  it 's pointless because we can never do anything right in the first place and need to keep fixing it . 
  if we could build an actual 200km/h + train it would n't be pointless , it would be great . 
  same thing happened with via baltica road , we could n't just do it right in the first place and make it 4 lane 100km/h + all the way , it 's now a stupid 2 lane road with 70km/h speed limits all over the place . 
  whoever is planning these projects needs to be fired . 
  the problem will exist with any type of suits , because you ca n't get that stuff of you without washing really well , which as you might imagine is pretty hard to do . 
  the only real way we could maybe avoid this is if we had suits like those new nasa z-2 suits which you would dock to the outside and never bring inside , just jump in and go . 
  [ like that . 
  ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a7/suitport_testing_-_z1.jpg/800px-suitport_testing_-_z1.jpg ), 
  except you 're somehow trying to justify one of them by comparing to another . 
  both situations are awful and are comparable . 
  just like isis and sa . 
   murderer who shoots their victim and a murderer who slowly tortures their victim to death are equally bad ? 
  yes . 
  the end result is that they are a murderer . 
  i do n't . 
  circumstances are . 
  method no . 
  why do you assume saudi arabia does n't torture who they execute ? 
  do you have any evidence of that ? 
  the method being different does n't really change anything . 
  and again , saudi arabia has to keep up appearances , isis just does whatever they thing is `` right '' . 
  you asked when was the last time . 
  you can see it happens pretty often . 
  they have to keep up images after all . 
  are n't they giving up everything we gave to them ? 
  pretty sure they ca n't even legally work in any of the countries they run to . 
  why do you think they can ? 
  self torture, 
  it 's low compared to the west , but high compared to the rest of lithuania . 
  rent and apartment prices mostly , then food . 
  it 's small because it 's supposed to be fashionable and high class , not for most people . 
  this is vilnius , they do make that . 
  even more than than on average . 
  so most people do indeed make that .

  and some germans . 
  and then a bunch of other ussr-sourced people . 
  not exactly what i 'd call monocultural . 
  the theme in this thread is `` war makes innovation many times faster '' , not `` no war - we 're pre stone age '' . 
  sorry if you got memo wrong . 
  who knows , may be it would have existed . 
  maybe not . 
  what we know is military played a big role in creation and advancement of it . 
  as well as computing in general . 
  because it evolved from us military project ? 
  fast , reliable and secure communications is critical during war . 
  internet , as technology , is perfect for that . 
  they did n't have conflicts on home soil , but they engaged in a lot of conflicts far away . 
  they had both motivation and secure home base to innovate . 
  welp , if you 're total minority . . 
  there 's not much you can do . 
  but changing the system the other way may mean that other people , who are majority in your regions , may have no representation . 
  if there would n't be enough of them eu-wide . 
  or if closest to them popular eu-wide persona would n't represent them well enough . 
  eu is still influenced by nation states . 
  thus eu army decision would be decision of nation states . 
  the difference is how you and i define representation . 
  wether it 's by views or that someone is affected by my vote . 
  maybe it 's cultural differences ? 
  over there , we have regional representation in national parliament . 
  even worst dipshits try to work their regions to make sure they 're re-elected or at least another guy from their party is elected instead of him . 
  if there 's enough noise , even not from their fan base , they usually try ( or pretend to try ) to turn some knobs up there to get it fixed . 
  they usually hold public meetings in their regions once in a while so you can come and question your local dipshit and try to convince him to pursue something . 
  i agree it 's not working perfectly . 
  but even if it 's a bit of democracy theatre , i kinda like this representative democracy thing . 
  i 'd better fix it to make local representatives more accountable to their region than drop them completely . 
  it 's not that i want or do n't . 
  it 's representation of majority of my region . 
  but it 's still my representative and , when calling to him i do n't have to say wether i voted for him or not . 
  but i can expect for him to look into my question if he expects my vote in the next election . 
  that 's the core of representative democracy , is n't it ? 
  in the other formula , i can end up with no representation at all . 
  neither based on ideas , nor geographically . 
  there may be no one who gives a fuck about my vote in any way . 
  even in theory . 
  the one who was elected in my region ? 
  huh ? 
  i can easily google the number and call the dude ( well , more likely his secretary ) . 
  at least there 's some kind of representation . 
  even if the dude is likely to tell me to piss off . 
  who do i call and who represents me in non-regional system ? 
   but arguing you wo n't be guaranteed defence and at the same time saying you 'll be dragged into foreign missions is ingenuous . 
  that 's what i 'm trying to say . 
  let 's say where would be a unified chain of command . 
  if all countries have to sign off , i see problems to get any defence at all , not only `` entire eu '' . 
  if minority of countries can drag whole eu into a conflict , it kinda sucks too . 
  if it 's multiple chains of command . . no eu backing . 
  so pretty much loose-loose situation . 
  imo eu army would be a final nail in eu coffin at the moment . 
  it may work after another 50 years . 
  now ? 
  no way . 
  the main thing is chain of command . 
  does it require all-in or at least majority consensus ? 
  if yes , i 'm out . 
  i do n't trust france/germany/italy enough . 
  if any individual country is able to dispatch some partition of military at it 's own will , that 's not much difference from what nato is . 
  another thing is sending military on missions abroad . 
  france seem to be happy to deploy to their ex-colonies . 
  i 'm sure most countries would n't be ok with that . 
  let alone any offensive operation . 
  like in syria against isis or libia . 
  unified chain of command would bring up the issues i mentioned . 
  separate chains of command are not worth `` unified army '' title . 
  shopping together and equipment standardisation is already there . 
  as well as training together . 
   what happens in ukraine is n't a specific interest of any country in europe well ... lithuania and poland ( and maybe other countries ) are doing a lot to help ukraine . 
  for example , lithuania sends so called lethal aid to ukraine . 
  as well as helps in training ukrainian military . 
  medical help is provided to both ukraine military and civilians . 
  this is our specific interest to help ukraine to keep russia busy & away . 
  there are ( were ? ), 
  quite a few non-gov initiatives as well . 
  ranging from helping displaced civilians to non-lethal aid to military . 
   the european $ position party is n't it virtually the same as current system ? 
  regional parties have their own views and then join at ep with parties they can agree with . 
  coming from the one of the border states , we just do n't trust that centralised army would help us if shit hits the fan . 
  the response to georgia and ukraine was underwhelming to say the least . 
  us is working hard on making us trust them . 
  france , germany or italy ? 
  well . . 
  so pride in being diverse and having no common ground ? 
  i doubt that 'd fly . 
  and once there 's some common ground , the `` inter '' bit starts vanishing and we 're left with pure nationalism . 
  one of the points for regional representation is you can contact your representative wether you voted for him or not . 
  in your system , who 'd i call to if my guy was n't elected ? 
  that is obviously worse than your first attempt which was worse than what i describe . . 
  anyhow , you should question one of the experts by a grocery store in some small town . 
  they may have better answers than me : /, 
  nah , it 's too cold to get angry over there . 
  why waste energy for anger ? 
  well , that `` semi-jokingly '' part is what sets us aside from romanians . 
  we love to laugh to death . 
  which is usually by suicide , 
  no need even for that .

  not against my country but a less known incident : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/korean_air_lines_flight_007, 
  that makes two of us, 
  maybe the problem is your way of seeing things ? 
  maybe you 're not always right ? 
  for example ,  however , when someone calls the more left-winged users literal `` putinbots '' , for something they have n't even done yet , it seems perfectly acceptable . 
  no one called a left-wing user a putinbot here yet . 
  do you have a victim complex ? 
  and what does right-wing reactionary conservative russia has to do with left-wing ideologies/parties ? 
  i do n't think `` upgraded '' was the word you were looking for, 
  what does lithuania have to do with the balkans ? 
  [ we used to have passports in green color ] ( https://www.dokumentai.lt/images/dok/e-pasas.gif ), 
  across europe : german , russian across world : spanish , french, 
  february 11 , 1991 never forget, 
  well , it 's complicated . 
  here 's the short story : late 19th - early 20th century was a time of lithuanian national revival . 
  you see , because of long period of common polish-lithuanian statehood and russification that followed in russian empire , lithuanian language was n't perceived as `` prestigious '' for middle and higher classes to be used ( they spoke polish ) , basically lithuanian was only spoken in rural areas , western lithuania ( samogitia region ) and kleinlitauen ( lithuania minor ) in east prussia . 
  after the abolition of serfdom in the russian empire , emerging lithuanian national movement sought to distance itself not only from russia , but also and mostly from polish-lithuanian commonwealth . 
  seimas ( our parliament ) wanted to distance itself from the flag of the grand duchy of lithuania , which also encompassed belarus and ukraine . 
  a flag representing a national lithuania was needed , so the three frequently used colors were chosen from folk weavings and traditional dresses . 
  yellow , green , red tricolor was chosen as a `` temporal flag '' until a new one could be adopted , but a coup happened and any discussion for the national flag was delayed until 1940 when a new `` yellow , red , white '' flag was proposed but not adopted , then a soviet occupation happened and the flag was banned , then our state was reestablished as continuation of interwar lithuania and because of that soviet ban our interwar lithuania 's flag/current tricolor represents lithuania 's fight for freedom and self-determination . 
  btw [ a different flag representing lithuanians existed in lithuania minor since at least 17th century ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d5/flag_of_lithuania_minor.svg ) . 
  yes, 
  i just want to able to use [ our state flag - vytis ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/62/flag_of_lithuania_%28state%29.svg/1600px-flag_of_lithuania_%28state%29.svg.png ) as a flair . 
  according to the article it 's more of a joint russian-belorusian exercise with serbia bum rushing to be part of it too . 
  strangely enough i 'm okay with this, 
  someone is geographically challenged, 
   anthony kied ** is ** tho ? 
  _  - eid ** is **, 
  nationalist . 
   our taste and your . . size \u0ca0_\u0ca0, 
  except poland does n't have monopoly over him . 
  do n't be a retard like those few lithuanians downvoted somewhere below . 
  not everyone is brainwashed like them . 
  this is higher-magic, 
  probably . 
  for the record i did n't suggest that . 
   so you think that they should have an easier exams ? 
  what 's done is done . 
  keep in mind , that because of learning polish and lithuanian , their english language skills suffer . 
  and if you 'll suggest `` they should learn lithuanian as native language ! '', 
  that pretty much eliminates them being natively polish . 
   and please explain why does the llra keeps getting so many votes in polish populated regions if the polish minority are so loyal ? 
  polish people are n't one hivemind that all vote for one party . 
  last election llra had to take part in seimas elections as coalition with `` political party russian alliance '' to win merely 5,83 % of votes ( 5 % is the threshold ) , i know for a fact that my polish-lithuanian colleagues voted for the conservatives . 
  came to say the same thing . 
  curse you !, 
  we have a large polish minority . 
  we also have shitty media that likes to spin thing the way they like and generate hatred which leads to them writing articles with provocative headlines which in turn leads to making more money . 
  for example , a wish for a simple thing like bilingual signs were portrayed as polish chauvinism , minority schools getting scared because of our ministry of education out of nowhere deciding that from now on minorities would have to pass exactly the same exams like native lithuanians as `` poles ca n't speak the official language lol '' , poland reacting to all of this as `` poland sticking it 's nose into lithuania 's internal politics . 
  who gave them the right to dictate us what to do in our own country ?! '' . 
  now we have citizens who actually know poles and citizens who believe that our lithuanian poles are disloyal , do n't speak lithuanian and hate lithuania . 
  a pro-kremlin polish-lithuanian politician managed to build a successful career out of all this . 
  all of this drama ruined the relationship between poland and lithuania . 
  only after the war in ukraine started did relationship between poland and lithuania started to improve . 
  for better understanding think of our largest and most influential news website `` delfi.lt '' as fox news . 
  i find it strange how a foreign country can decide that a child without uk citizenship ( but with a foreign one ) can be adopted by their citizens and ignore latvia 's government . 
  now we have a 7 years old latvian kid with british parents , who 'll be culturally british , will speak english natively , but have a latvian citizenship if everything stays like it does now . 
  this odd situation could lead to a problematic future for the person in question . 
  imo , the child should either be returned to latvia and , like you said , be separated from his current parents or be given a british citizenship . 
   the child was found in england and is protected by english law because of it . 
  yes . 
  hopefully british officials will sort this out with latvian officials and returns the child to her home country and not kidnapes a foreign citizen . 
   if i go to latvia and do something stupid , i get prosecuted under latvian law not sent to england to be trialed . 
  a child is n't acountable for her parent 's actions . 
  the story is about a latvian citizen who was neglected by her parents . 
  parents were punished under british law . 
  because 21 months old child does n't decide to emigrate, 
   she was 21 months old when removed from her mother woops , i missed this part , i saw 7 years old and my brain shut-down, 
  idk about you but when i was seven years old i only spoke my native language which helped me find friends since , you know , they spoke the same language . 
  but anyway , it 's her native country 's responsibility to take care of it 's citizens . 
  the child is a latvian citizen . 
  if the child must be adopted she should be adopted by latvians in her home country . 
  i 'd recommend drinking cold lithuanian beer in the summer . 
  hot temperature and vodka do n't mix too well . 
  separitism is illegal according to russian law , it 's the most militarised place in europe and the region could n't sustain itself . 
  we do n't have `` w '' in our alphabet, 
  one was 6 years old , the other was forced into red army , took berlin and won the war . 
  what did your grandfathers do ? 
  russia stronk , burn flowers that were already paid for , europe weak , suck it , europe ? 
  can we burn kremlin 's never ending propaganda ? 
  well , he did have estonian citizenship . 
   i would say that it 's a good thing that they won . 
  not op , but i 'd say it would have been a good thing if both lost . 
   russophobic using this term so loosely is really disrespectful to groups who are actually persecuted and discriminated . 
  like homosexuals in russia . 
  you commie crime deniers are as sickening as holocaust deniers . 
  and yet prouds it 's collapse as the bigest catastrophe of the 20th century and whitewashes the crimes committed by the regime . 
  i do n't support war and putin did nothing wrong ? 
  * eu is making everything intentionally worse . 
  * there 's a pedophile lawyer ring controling lithuania 's judicial system . 
   \u0161s what an abomination . 
  these two letters should never touch . 
   i would n't expect things to get better you mean it would get better if this sub supported russia in it 's hybrid war against ukraine ? 
  `` vl\u00e4diimir '' , but friends call him `` nordicmir '', 
  lithuania : 7.8 * get satisfied latvia ( 7.3 ) and estonia ( 7.2 ) *, 
  `` godus '' is the correct lithuanian word . 
  `` sk\u016bpas '' is lithuanized slavicism that according to our beloved lituanists should not be used . 
  `` mr. medvedev , open this gate . 
  mr. medvedev , tear down this firewall '', 
  go for it !,

  this map shows the medium variant ( most likely scenario as per un ) of expected annual % change of population between 2015 and 2020 in europe and surounding countries . 
  ** report done : ** june 2017 ** report info : ** the 2017 revision of world population prospects is the twenty-fifth round of official united nations population estimates and projections that have been prepared by the population division of the department of economic and social affairs of the united nations secretariat .

  i think it recently the government announced to start using czechia for english purposes . 
  i thought for colour blind people its easy to differentiate the shade from dark to bright ? 
  the map has only one colour . 
  i would be interested to hear what designs would help colour blind people to make it easier . 
  before i used to make maps like that . 
  but got hate because it was colour blind unfriendly . 
  so now i make maps with one colour darker to lighter . 
  i guess you can never satisfy everyone . 
  is it personal or there have been errors in the past ? 
  by the way eurobarometer actual surveys are not done by eu institutions . 
  for this particular report the slovak data and survey was done by tns slovakia which is slovak statistics firm . 
  because you do n't like it or you have something against the europbarometer methodology ? 
  this map shows the % of each eu member state support for common foreign policy . 
  question asked : are you for or against common foreign policy of the 28 member states of the eu . 
  ** survey done : ** april 2017 ** survey info : ** this survey was carried out by tns political & social network in the 28 member states of the european union ( eu ) between 15 and 25 april 2017 . 
  some 28,501 eu citizens were interviewed face-to-face at home on behalf of the directorate-general for communication . 
  ** key findings/insights : ** * almost two thirds ( 65 % ) are in favour of a common foreign policy of the 28 member states . 
  * lithuania is the most favourable towards common foreign policy of eu . 
  * sweden is the only country where more than half are against this ( 55 % ) . 
  * uk not last . 
  * netherlands higher than finland . 
  * report done by eurobarometer .

  great for the balkan . 
  integration is the only way to provide long term peace and prosperity for the region . 
  simple people have only to gain from joining eu . 
  i can understand that some of the rich and powerful in those countries see it the other way as it would reduce coruption and reduce their influence . 
  that is going to be a fun one . 
  its not that they could lose it , they definitely will if they leave the eu . 
  while i agree that uk usually was the one always dismissing closer integration , i think with enough time we can make them integrated with us . 
  i would welcome them back with open arms . 
  separating will be extremely damaging for uk while also will hurt us . 
  we as europeans should be the force leading the world in peace together , not separated !, 
  good for france . 
  they chose the smart populism . 
  something definitely needed to be done and it looks like the french people really chose smartly and were not manipulated as easily as anglophones . 
  if vatican would apear in statistics it would be the richest country by gdp per capita . 
  not only that , it would be richer by an order of magnitude compared to other countries . 
  yes church is filthy rich . 
  what in your opinion is the likeliest brexit scenario ? 
  soft , hard or none ? 
  good for greece !, 
  it is to avoid any unintended tourists, 
  salty because you ca n't buy alcohol anymore ? 
  i do n't think its as much as a fuck you as just simple economics . 
  $ 2.6 trillion economy vs $ 14 trillion economy . 
  its no brainier that india will prioritise eu trade over uk . 
  for the eu , uk or india is about the same size ( 2.6 vs 2.4 ) so whoever will be easier to deal with . 
  hey , hey man i think you had enough of that stuff, 
  ok really ? 
  referendum was 61 % no at 31 % turnout , that 's like 19 % of voting population deciding for the rest 100 % . 
  there is a reason why almost all democracies are representative and not direct . 
  simple citizens elect representatives to make smart decisions on their behalf . 
  for me i see referendums as undemocratic as usually what happens is manipulative politicians influence simple people to vote one way or another without understanding the consequences and to only benefit the manipulator himself . 
  we have to retake our rightful clay !, 
  come belarus and ukraine we have cookies, 
  ok lets try some facts : gap between rich & poor in russia among world 's biggest . 
  wealth inequality in russia is one of the world 's highest . 
  a report by credit suisse says 35 percent of russian household wealth is controlled by just 110 billionaires . 
  poverty is widespread , living standards are low and , typical of a non-developed country , exportation of natural resources fuels much of russia 's economy . 
  russia is borderline at best on most developed-country metrics . 
  its per capita gdp is $ 24,451 while it is true that russia has a trade surplus it exports are heavily dominated by raw materials while its imports are dominated by hi tech equipment and manufactured goods , meaning that it is extremely reliant on other countries for manufactured and high tech goods . 
  more than 79 % of exports are raw materials , more than 70 % of imports are manufactured goods . 
  looks like russia is truly of highest self sustaining capability . . 
  but where is the freedom ^ tm in that ? 
  they were included not because of political prestige , they were included because officially they matched the criteria to join . 
  only after some 10 years it was revealed that greece government faked the data to get in . 
  now , were the eu auditors incompetent not to see the fake data ? 
  maybe , it depend how well the greeks faked it . 
  how is greece the proof ? 
  corrupt politicians faked data to get euro , spend lavishly with no long term plan , and got into huge debt . 
  was eu supposed to say `` oh well , happens '' and let them go for free ? 
  you pay for your stupidity , greece is on track to long term stability now even though its gon na hurt in the short term . 
  but do n't blame eu , blame greek politics . 
  any proof to your false statement ? 
  if anything eu cares more about simple european people than some national governments . 
  i loved the australian ass, 
  i think it will have one of the biggest impact in eu history as this is a big hit for eu , and it can be increased or decreased depending on how the exit is negotiated . 
  so far it looks like both sides are demanding unreasonable things and honestly i do n't think a deal will be reached in 2 years as the time is too short and we will see hard exit . 
  it will have an effect on europe in short term in decrease of quality of life and economic recession . 
  militarily i do n't expect much to change as eu does not have a huge role in military and most members handle army themselves and through nato . 
  i would have preferred uk staying in as now more than ever , with changing geopolitical landscape we , as europeans , should be united and strong , it is sad that british people decided to go at it alone . 
  however , i think the impact will be a lot more negative on the average british person than on an average eu citizen . 
  eu is losing $ 3.6 trillion economy while the uk is losing access to $ 12 trillion economy . 
  i think recession in eu will last anywhere between 2-5 years , while my prediction for britain is a lot more grimmer , probably they will not see same standard of living for the next 10-15 years . 
  on the bright side for the eu , without uk , we might move with federation reforms quicker which should increase efficient resource allocation within eu , that should accelerate growth . 
  also now common eu army reform should also be reached easier . 
  what is the process of printing euros in eu ?
