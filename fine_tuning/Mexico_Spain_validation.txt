  here in spain you can even find as a souvenir the coat of arms of your surname . 
  this does n't mean we 're all part of the nobility - quite the opposite - . 
  it 's just as a curiosity , and it is n't related with social prestige . 
  d'you mean this ?

  pro tip : do n't buy those microwaveable popcorn unless you want cancer in a few years . 
  buy a popcorn machine like this [ this one ] ( http://www.electronicavicente.com/fichaarticulo~x~palomitero-vintage-orbegozo-pa5000~idarticulo~18611.html?gclid=cjwkeajwutxibrdv7-sdvdinsuosjaciltqltki1uqyq01kesspmfq3lltxb2tq6qy9sszyznbarlbocrnvw_wcb ) and use ecologic corn .

  i do n't know if in america they produce bastardised versions of spanish food .

  we did n't get any lithuanian history at all .

  as a spaniard myself who is also fluent in english , i always laugh my ass off when the pilot does his speech in english . 
  i do n't understand what he says even knowing both languages !, 
  wait what ? 
  how about all the good things about spain ? 
  any country in the world can be nitpicked of its shortcomings . 
  this is the kind of pessimism i was referring to in my first post . 
  it 's baseless and unfair . 
  as a spaniard , this could be a very polarising opinion , but really , screw the pessimists . 
  spain is awesome , great lifestyle , food , culture and history . 
  our diversity is also great . 
  spain is amazing . 
  period . 
  i would n't change the spanish national anthem but i think it 's about time we add some lyrics to it . 
  dude you guys have the best anthem ever made !, 
  yeah . 
  op already mentions it, 
  in 1898 we lost cuba , puerto rico and the philippines as well fyi . 
  spaniards are clever folk, 
  even more weird , they all go to the south of spain where it 's all sunny , andaluc\u00eda . 
  so basically the brits go to the florida of florida if that makes any sense !, 
  i 'd say carlos iv . 
  he basically gave the country to napoleon and shat his pants . 
  spain has a professional standing army and a reserve force made out of civilians who want to contribute to the army and work with them part time . 
  despite its name , basque country is n't a country :p,

  well yeah but as the original author of that comment , i can assure you that it is n't the perspective you 're thinking about if you still had the doubt . 
  and that 's what i said in my first post . 
  not justifying but i like to view both sides of the coin . 
  saying that his actions were completely bad is just fanboying . 
  he is badly viewed and sometimes is the subject of jokes . 
  objectively he did many good things for the country but his atrocities and backwards mentality overshadow any service he did for the country . 
  edit : lol , getting downvoted for being historically accurate . 
  just so you can see how fanatic some people are about the topic . 
  i think both can coexist with the right mind set . 
  nationalism is good as long as there is tolerance . 
  of course they are european . 
  you ca n't deny what you are . 
  the british isles are in europe and they are culturally european . 
  do n't get me wrong , i love history , geography and vexillology and i know what i say . 
  the thing is , you 're correct with your assumptions . 
  i do n't like those flags as the colours just do n't go that well together . 
  its just an aesthetic thing . 
  i like simpler flags with less colours and if they have symbols , the better . 
  i hate it . 
  it just looks like an latin american flag . 
  the first republic 's flag was much better . 
  not really . 
  the parents can choose which surname goes first . 
  if they want , the mother 's surname can go first . 
  the thing is , nobody cares ( or do n't know they can choose ) and just leave the default arrangement . 
  i love canada and i 've never even been there .

  germans , richer in average and with more help from the state have way fewer children than for instance , a person from india . 
  it 's mainly cultural . 
  not for denying a visa it is n't . 
  that 's for trials , not for granting a visa . 
  you 're not taking them to prison , just keeping them from coming to the country . 
  again , we do n't owe anyone a visa . 
  if the police is suspicious that person is dangerous , that should be enough for them not to never get one . 
   i read a dutch news source , and there it is mentioned that he was being monitored , not listed as a terrorist . 
  why are people suspected of terrorist activities given a visa ? 
  did we need this guy to live among us so bad ? 
  we do n't owe visas to anybody , if some guy is suspicious that should be enough not to let him in . 
   furthermore , should you not exile terrorists , why kick them out and make them someone else 's problem ? 
  just lock them up or something why on earth should we let them in ? 
  we should make them someone 's problem when they ** are ** someone else 's problem , as in this case . 
  if they are second or third generation we 're stuck with them , but welcoming guys who we already suspect to be radical ? 
  i just do n't get it . 
  a moroccan national , who was in the lists for terrorist activities . 
  why was he even allowed to live in europe ? 
  guy should have had his visa revoked and kicked out back to his country . 
  i just ca n't comprehend how anyone can see that as wrong , or racist . 
  i just do n't understand how they are allowed to roam freely after getting into schengen area . 
  they came illegally : prison -  deportation . 
  their country is a mess ? 
  not . 
  our . 
  problem . 
  we 're letting in people that fucking hate our societies and us . 
  we all know what that paper roll is for ... ... and why there 's other two empty ones, 
  he 's not from russia ... 
  fuck that guy . 
  that does n't have anything to do with them being part of the eu or overseas territories . 
  you 're getting overly defensive . 
   using greece as a third-class member and a human deposit box for ` undesirables ' aside , what are these people going to do for a living ? 
  nothing . 
  stay until the war is over , then back to their countries . 
   should their children be given citizenships ? 
  no  since they are going to be staying for a while , will we be ignoring their right to self-determination , or give them the right to voice their opinions on munincipal/regional/national matters ? 
  self-determination ? 
  they 're not citizens . 
   where are hundreds of thousands of idividuals going to be housed ? 
  same as in lebanon or turkey . 
   all in all , why ? 
  so that the rich countries can continue to ignore the problem until it affects them ? 
  or because eastern citizens who have probably never seen a refugee or a migrant in their entire lives , want to whine about how they took their jobs ? 
  because we do n't have to and because we do n't owe them anything . 
  this is charity and nobody is entitled to force you to be charitable . 
  if we want to be , we should be able to decide when , where and how . 
  and of course if . 
  yeah , when america was booming and there was a job literally for everybody . 
  in other words , they needed them . 
  we , right now , do n't need unskilled immigrants , and with automation is not likely we 'll need them any time soon . 
  that freaking guy shadow-banned me once because i mentioned how he was removed as a moderator from / r/canada . 
  yeah all those guys with zero years of education and zero work skills are going to integrate just fine in our economies and will adapt to our cultures in no time . 
  we definitely need you guys and the only reason spain is not seeing lately the waves of immigration that are arriving to italy and greece is because the government of morocco is stable and is acting as a wall , unlike the one in libya . 
  this problem is only going to grow . 
  black africa 's population is expected to triple during this century , and is the only continent where population growth does n't seem to be stopping . 
  the richer they get , the more children they have , so they will simply remain poor and migrate north . 
  they 're not gon na stop that dynamic . 
  it needs to be us . 
  a third sunni , a third shia and a third christian and somehow they 're not killing each other every day . 
  according to spain we do , since the treaty of utrecht specifically establishes that the waters surrounding the rock are spanish . 
  that 's how it starts , though ... 
  they just love bachata . 
  all these european phone companies that used to be in the top , how could n't any of them adapt to the introduction of the smartphone ? 
  nokia , ericsson , alcatel ... not a single one did . 
  according to the article it has already . 
  the adjective `` european '' itself would n't be as important , and we 'd talk about euro-mediterranean , post-christian , western or some other denomination that would include northern africa . 
  sounds greek to me . 
  great , i just connected to the guy of golden dawn starting speaking and the translator saying they 'd not translate him . 
  imf : the sky is blue . 
  corruption is damaging and all but about the cuts ... for good or bad , education , health care and pensions carry a majority of the budget , like * really * , a huge part of it . 
  all other points you have mentioned are peanuts compared with what could be and was saved by cutting there . 
  was it ? 
  i know the word cojones is relatively known in english , but enough to make a pun out of it ? 
   by don quijones don * quijote * . 
  don quijones sounds suspiciously like don cojones . 
  italian, 
  21 million is nothing for a country , even for one struggling economically , and it sends a strong message and publicily embarrass the government . 
  i 'd say that allowing politicians to forge numbers is way more damaging than paying 21 million . 
  how is building a bunch of parks and towers going to help the economy long term ? 
  sorry , but that video reminded me too much of spain 's housing bubble era .

  the euro taking a hit is n't necessarily negative and will be temporary anyway . 
  i do n't know the official position about brexit , but many of us think the uk has to leave the union so we can continue with further integration . 
  i do n't see europe making concessions so the greeks get to stay . 
  it 's on them to either make the cuts or default already . 
   we do n't really buy cheap populism says the catalan nationalist . 
  neither did syriza , and they already have a foot out . 
  the axis cropping makes it look way too dramatic . 
   bricgs wow , you guys are delusional . 
  sure , unlike his friends in the greek government who of course are completely free of blame . 
  europe should just throw money at greece indefinitely without any guarantee of reforms . 
  what prevented syriza to announce the referendum a week ago ? 
  why did they need to wait until the last day and then have to ask for an extension of the loans ? 
  this is just a desperate last minute attempt to save face . 
  i hope the deadline remains unchanged . 
  sure , we 'll see about that . 
  specially now that they 're at risk of losing the tartus base .

  the main problems of the system are : * volatility . 
  * market manipulation : * subsidies everywhere : capacity payments for combined cycle plants , bonus for special regimen renewal energy , subsidies for burning spanish coal ... * excess of capacity . 
  * bad regulation that made profitable to build an unneeded combined cycle plant . 
  * [ too many politicians in the board of the companies ] ( http://dd.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1qhzhf/spain_toughens_up_new_sun_tax_law_homes_can_now/cdd807e ) . 
  * the industry associated with a construction bubble is energy intensive : concrete , cement , steel ... the energy demand has fallen more than the economy just when a lot of plants have been finished . 
  that 's a literal translation , we import the gas from algeria . 
  the problem is that the energy cartel built a massive amount of combined cycle plants and we do n't have an economy to use the electricity that these plants can generate . 
  spain could export electricity , but france is also a net exporter ( and it 's cheaper usually ) , portugal has its economy in ruins also and does n't need more energy and morocco wants to generate its own energy and we do n't have so good connections and we are importing the gas anyway . 
  no , the plants are n't needed and should be shut down . 
  them or the nuclear plants , or the coal plants that use mostly spanish subsidized coal ( that generate 14 % of the spanish electricity . 
  ** spain ** the shit hit the fan in the energy sector . 
  the government is going full retard in energy policy and has turned against consumer associations , large utilities and renewable energy producers . . , the government is approving emergency decrees and retroactive changes that are going to backfire soon .

  i only can find an outdated report that talks about some production center in portugal and zero in spain . 
  let us back in europe , please . 
  can you tell a more progressive law approved by this government ? 
  the combined cycle power plants , one of the largest industrial investments in recent history , are operating only to 10 % capacity after the fall in electricity demand . 
  at the country of the airports without airplanes , silent and empty toll roads and half-finished developments , the excesses age 's fables abound , and their morals . 
  here is another is narrated , but this is n't simple one more , because what is stuck is one of the largest industrial investments in recent history . 
  energy giants invested over 15 billion euros that were spent to raise tens of combined cycle power plants to generate electricity from natural gas . 
  now they just run 10 % of its capacity , the government discussed with the companies the temporary closure of some and there is several people who talk about dismantling them . 
  the official aspiration , a decade ago , was moving to a sustainable future hands in hand of more efficient plants , which use a cleaner fuel than coal or fossil fuel . 
  and that adapted better to renewable sources for its ability to adjust its contribution to the electricity network : something essential when the intermittent sun and wind gain prominence . 
  but the plans failed the test of lack of demand . 
  in 2008 , with the combined-cycle and at full speed , 32 % of the electricity consumed in spain was produced with gas , double than with coal ( 16 % ) . 
  so far , as expected . 
  but when the increasing usage of renewable energy combined with the crisis and other factors , the script failed : coal production holds ^ 1 , while generation from gas collapses . 
  this year , the combined cycle plants have generated only 9 % of the electricity , compared with 14 % produced in coal plants that emit more than twice the greenhouse gases . 
  pedro linares , co-director of the research center for energy economics , explains why , in the early years of this century , combined cycle plants were the main answer for companies to the then growing power demand . 
  `` there were cheap and easy to finance , construction was less expensive and faster than other conventional power plants and were less pollutants . 
  perceived little risk , there was over-investment , `` says the coordinator of the bp chair at the pontificia comillas university of madrid . 
  `` we must go back to the conditions under which these decisions were made , '' insist mariano marzo , professor of energy at the university of barcelona . 
  as in the nesting dolls , the gas would be a bubble inside another ( consumer ) within the huge credit bubble of the past decade . 
  `` energy planning is done years away , and then the demand in spain was rising like a rocket , '' emphasizes march . 
  the public sector support also contributed , with millionaire investment incentives charged in the electricity bill , that can recover more than a third of spending several years . 
  only germany stands comparison in continental europe , though even there the deployment was n't so intense . 
  since the first combined cycle plant opened in 2002 until the 27,000 megawatts of installed power were reached , it 's the technology able to generate more energy in spain - , only seven years passed . 
  and pending applications reached double that figure . 
  [ ... ] the auction system in effect multiplies the effects of lack of demand . 
  because not only gives priority to renewables , but placed ahead hydraulic and nuclear power stations ( most owned by the big three ) , which is paid in addition to the price of the last conventional thermal to enter ( coal or gas naturally ) in the system . 
  `` nuclear and hydroelectric plants , which have recouped most of the investment are those that benefit most , '' said fabra . 
  [ ... ] the future of combined cycle plants , however , depends on what the government has been two years avoiding to face . 
  `` they have to define a new regulatory framework for the remuneration of the entire energy system , '' explains professor march , and spain is also missing a new energy plan to 2030 , to incorporate the new economic conditions and clarify which energy mix will be better . 
  a process that the government , pushed by controversial power auction for the next quarter , seems now willing to address . 
  but in a desperate situation , without known planning , and with the dubious distinction of having turned against consumer associations , large utilities and renewable energy producers . 
  there are more details but i was tired of fixing the translation . 
  full transation [ here ] ( http://translate.google.es/translate?hl=es&amp;sl=es&amp;tl=en&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fsociedad.elpais.com%2fsociedad%2f2013%2f12%2f26%2factualidad%2f1388082770_720869.html ) ------- 1 . 
  spain is giving ( decreasing ) subsidies to generating electricity with spanish coal until 2018 starting the last steps of the phasing out in 2015 . 
  nobody likes that , not even british people . 
  you should ask to their conservative government . 
  how many generations should live there before becoming norwegian ? 
   the way you describe the situation makes it seem very bleak . 
  the situation is very bleak . 
  that make sense . 
   is there any political party capable of making the necessary reforms ? 
  the current government ( pp/conservatives ) concentrates all the powers has an absolute majority and control the justice . 
  but , they lack the will to reform . 
  honestly the best spanish parties with an acceptable leadership and a clear project are basque and catalan nationalist . 
  as alternative parties in spain we have : * united left : not actually united , the party with the most constant internal fights : having libertarian communist , eco-socialists and ex-communists ( do n't ask about their current ideology , they do n't know either ) , and generic left-wing like the current leader and former farmers union leader in the same coalition is n't easy . 
  they already had some fights for the next eu elections because do n't agree in if we should continue in the eu and the euro . 
  julio anguita , [ the most respected previous leader created recently a citizens platform ] ( http://www.frentecivicosomosmayoria.es/quienes-somos/ ) , actually is the only left platform one with a clear project for the country , left wing policies and euroscepticism . 
  * upyd : moderate party without a clear ideology , it has been officially center-left and center-right . 
  it was founded by a high officer of the socialist party ( rosa diez ) after losing the internal elections for the leadership ( the united left was already fighting for left wing voters thus she created a * center * party ) . 
  the party is growing steadily and with the current conservative government they have been a populist , spanish nationalist and moderate conservative opposition party . 
  * equo : recently a green coalition separated from the united left has been created by the former leader of the spanish branch of greenpeace , very weak . 
  on the bright side the biggest party to right of the ruling party has 20,000 voters . 
  there is n't any racist or xenophobic party in any spanish regional or national parliament . 
  however , this is n't surprising even our right-wing dictatorship was n't exactly xenophobic and our dictator had [ moorish bodyguards ] ( http://forum.axishistory.com/download/file.php?id=22943&amp;sid=b6935ef55fb1b9fab4d9095fdc05b8b3 ) . 
   if not , how can they be made ? 
  creating a party in spain is n't exactly difficult : a lot of them have been created . 
  i do n't expect any new big party in the next years ; unless in the left julio anguita and his * frente civico * ( civic fron ) or the plataforma de afectados por la hipoteca ( mortgage victims association ) participate in it . 
  and it 's unlikely .

  i think merkel 's open door was a terrible idea because of the pressure it puts on the external borders of schengen/eu which we do have to deal with as the only land border with africa . 
  but as of now , long term visas are still a national issue , so that 's a german problem . 
  they give other countries trouble because of the sheer scale . 
  they do n't come here in that scale so it 's not really an issue . 
  a person that would fill that could easily find a job just walking into hotels until one would hire them for more money than that . 
  notice how there are zero applicants ? 
  yeah , i can offer you to sell me your house for 10 $ , but it does n't matter unless the other side accepts . 
  just having a job offer does n't mean they 're going to find someone at that price . 
  and someone that speaks german in madrid is also likely to speak very good english so even without skills could just walk into hotels until one would hire them for more than that . 
  you are assuming changing the fundamental costs of operation will not change how things are distributed and operate in general . 
  i will use the example of atms here . 
  it used to be to operate a bank branch you needed a team of bank tellers to deal with depositing and distributing money . 
  well , then the atm came and made that task ( note i did n't say job ) mostly useless . 
  so what happened ? 
  now that you do n't need a team of tellers you can open a branch with just 3 or so people , the costs of running a bank branch fell through the floor which meant banks were able to open branches all over the place and that led to even more bank tellers . 
  and tellers are now more focused on the more complex operations that an atm is n't good at . 
  the point i make is you ca n't just apply how the world is changing to how it is now and assume everything will be the same except for that single change . 
  changing underlying costs and making it cheaper to run a supermarket could mean a lot of towns where a supermarket is marginal now could easily support one in the future and they still require humans . 
  there is very little student loan infrastructure though . 
  i paid about $ 10k a year in the us ( and i had most of it from the government ) but i was able to cover the vast majority with loans . 
  i would n't have been able to pay even a few grand on my own . 
  that 's just a natural result of women entering the workplace . 
  you 're now competing with lots of people with dual incomes . 
  is there any talk about just subsidizing routes more ? 
  like i get that the idea that the debate is between private with minimum subsidies or fully national train operation . 
  that seems like a terrible false dichotomy . 
  there are plenty of example in air transport where subsidizing private operation works very well and you get the benefits of both sides . 
  do something like set a price and service guarantees and have a sort of reverse auction for companies to say how much money they would need to operate that route under those conditions . 
  you generally end up paying a lot less that way . 
  yeah , but spain is pretty much across the board pro-refugee . 
  refugees generally do n't want to come here , though . 
  and as was mentioned most of the people trying are spanish . 
  there is a decent sized spanish arab population from both moroccan immigrants as well as from ceuta and melilla . 
  but those groups also produce a lot of people that join the police and are a huge asset to catching the assholes . 
  the moroccans are by and large not radical in their views at all , but we have over a million of them so obviously it 's something to watch for given the current global climate . 
  i dislike the banner because it looks dumb and poorly made on an iconic building , but not for the message . 
  the training and knowing how to use infiltrados . 
  it helps that there are a lot of arabs from ceuta and melilla that feel very fiercely spanish that can help . 
  no , but id is . 
  it 's usually on the airlines to check . 
  that said some countries/airlines are more rigorous than others . 
  here in spain , you 're not getting on any plane ( international or domestic ) without proper id . 
  the requirements for domestic are a lot less ( it can be expired by a certain amount or be a driver 's license ) but you need it . 
  germany tends to be a lot more lax on the issue and i 've gotten on a plane plenty with no id . 
  in theory you need id here , but they only check the ticket for trains . 
  regardless , you do have to go through security and they would have caught him in spain for carrying a pistol . 
  i 'm not against id checks for that sort of thing , it 's already how flights here work ( you even need id for domestics ) so it 's hardly against the spirit of schengen . 
  all of this is at least if you are in a country with a mandatory id requirement . 
  it would be a problem without that requirement in the first place . 
  but having id when crossing borders is generally required regardless . 
  i mean , it 's pretty easy to find places for even near 150,000 $ in the city and the average salary in madrid is around 30,000 $ per year . 
  and most people buying will have two people working . 
  so even at 300.000 it 's 5 years of two average madrid salaries . 
  that does n't seem excessive to me . 
  you have to look at household , not personal incomes . 
  single people are going to have a harder time buying homes everywhere for obvious reasons . 
  i do n't know estonia at all , but that looks to fit in pretty well for the rest of the street . 
  yeah , the dutch have some really random se asian aspects of their food from the whole indonesia colonization . 
  could be that the real estate was just open then since croatia and lithuania were the only catholic countries to come out of the breakdown of the communist bloc . 
  though now that i think about it , i do n't actually know how catholic slovenia is . 
  mcdonald 's is actually usually really good with keeping their designs tasteful for the location . 
  a major nit to pick with the headline . 
  it 's not the jobless rate , it 's the actual employment numbers . 
  the unemployment rate is measured by the active population survey which will be out for q4 on 26 jan. 
   the weird thing is the big cities still have insane house prices . 
  i mean , i think it 's pretty reasonable . 
  you can easily find a reasonable place for 350,000 $ in central madrid . 
  i find that to be pretty descent for a major european city . 
   to be fair , i thought the other connexion to portugal ( vigo-oporto ) works much better ? 
  well , when it does n't derail and kill the passenger , yeah . 
  i mean , it 's what i pieced together from portuguese news while i was there , mostly from the written part . 
  but i 've spent enough time there that i can start to pick up bits of portuguese , i still wish they all spoke like brazilians , then we could get along . 
  yeah , but it can be a bit of a pain to get to from the city center . 
  frankly , i 'd have the same issue for pozuelo in madrid . 
  and with talgo wining the ave contract , there 's going to be a lot more people working out there . 
  it 's plenty nice and all , it 's just annoying , especially without a car . 
  i do n't know ... see the `` europe according to spain '' thread for what i know about the portuguese side . 
  according to wiki , it 's set to open this year . 
  i do n't believe that . 
  the cut service to granada was only supposed to last a couple months , too . 
  my wife does some recruiting for barcelona and one of her biggest issues is how many people just outright refuse to go out to sant cugat or cerdanyola , despite the huge number of companies out there . 
   20 fenchurch street i had no idea what they were talking about with the name . 
  just call it the walkie talkie and everyone will get it . 
  worth remembering that most monarchists are basically that way to be anti-republican , which is seen as radical left . 
  i 'm kind of apathetic to the whole idea and at least with felipe , i think there are much bigger problems to worry about for the time being . 
  i honestly do n't know which way i 'd go if it were a referendum , but i oppose a referendum on the monarchy because it 's wasting a huge amount of political effort on something that would n't materially change anything for the vast majority of people . 
  i just remember that during tourist seasons , spain will send police from galicia to help deal with spanish tourists since they can deal with the language barrier that should not be as stiff as it actually is . 
  but we visit portugal in droves . 
  we just speak spanish at you because we know you understand and do n't give a fuck what you say because we wo n't understand it at all . 
  the cut off corners add more parking but yeah , mostly in garages . 
  to put it even more simply , cathedral is just relevant to church organization . 
  it 's just that they obviously want the impressive buildings to be the important ones , too . 
  think of it like a country calling a city its capital , usually it 's the biggest and most important , but that is n't always the case for any variety of reasons . 
  a basilica is basically any non-cathedral church that 's deemed for a special designation . 
  since the diocese of barcelona is not based in the sagrada familia , it ca n't be a cathedral , so it 's a basilica . 
  and now people see why we fly or drive to portugal . 
  fuck that train . 
  i 've got an unattractive anglo look and still did pretty well to get my wife . 
  i was gifted portuguese towels for my house . 
  seriously they are seen as superior towels .

  trumpmerica best america . 
  that was quite the parody . 
  so erdogan first calls germany a haven of terrorists , then the turkish opposition gets terror charges . 
  logic went 404 not found, 
  is that a giant star trek themed dildo ? 
  relevant : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8j-rxz41-y kill people , burn shit , fuck school, 
  you mean erdogan came for the gulenists and stayed for the coup !, 
  direct democracy , you mean anarchy ? 
  a dictatorship project . 
  i bet boris johnson has a premium membership in 4chan . 
  portuguese irredentist scum using galician flag . 
  this would make for a good final fantasy game plot . 
  maybe if we drain the mediterranean there 's cthulu down there .

  we 're going to have to change the slogan from 420 blaze it to ... 1492 enci\u00e9ndelo ( \u0361 \u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361 \u00b0 ), 
  breaking news : putin declares that if russia does n't win eurovision he will point another european country as potential nuclear target at random . 
  will decide with a custom made d&d dice . 
  well , thanks for the lesson in dutch politics . 
  it 's a bit odd someone would say criminal x-nationals rather than criminal foreigners or some such . 
  so if i understand properly , his party is anti-eu , right-wing/conservative and anti-foreigners ? 
  sounds kind of like the ukip , but dutch . 
  does moroccan mean moroccan exclusively or does it have other connotations in this context ? 
  could any dutch elaborate on what was the trial exactly about ? 
  you 's it !, 
  agreed , interesting stuff . 
  berlin is pushing for some ** block magic ** * badum tss *, 
  is that a book ? 
  if they dropped that on the ground i 'm pretty sure we 'd have a nuclear holocaust . 
  probably more common in bigger cities . 
  but i 've never seen people do trick or treat . 
  in spain only businesses celebrate halloween . 
  we might need to start moving is news to / r/madlads / . 
  i think this thread is a duplicate of this one : https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/59prtx/angela_merkel_internet_search_engines_are/, 
  `` we 're bad , but they 're worse '' i think you 're more spanish than you 'd like to let on . 
  i do n't think being leftist and betraying voters are opposites . 
  might be your train of though , but being clean is n't something exclusive of the left , and being a corrupt is n't something exclusive of the right . 
  i wish people got their shit together before making shitty political statements . 
  just for the sake of fun . 
  i 'm going to point out that vater in spanish means toilet .

  i personally do n't like how wikipedia can give monopoly of editing pages to certain groups of people , as the internet is used more and more as a source for education this is bound to distort the perception of any given topic . 
  ngos with a political agenda worry me the most . 
  but i agree , i do wonder what 's the motivation . 
  every country at any point has more than one `` current issue '' at a time , i do n't see why ` some ' people parrot reply `` x has other issues currently '' . 
  any issue is to be considered and addressed . 
  my name is jos\u00e9 and i do n't take an offense to that . 
  fite my jos\u00e9ness one on one bruh ( \u0361 \u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361 \u00b0 ), 
  that is pretty much the summary of the communist manifesto . 
  to define yourself by your adversary . 
  i think it 's a great time to see examples of this , i see many people having an identity because `` they 're not x '' rather than because they formed an identity of their own . 
  not irrelevant in the slightest . 
  so with morocco too . 
  every time there 's a talk about spain-gibraltar the uk yells ceuta and melilla . 
  i agree with letting russia refill in spanish territories . 
  `` legitimacy of a unilateral referendum '' . 
  we do n't pretend it did n't happen , we just know it happened to our parents , not us . 
  we do n't want to pay for the mistakes we did n't make . 
  i was born in 89 , franco was already dead for 14 years . 
  i was going to say he did n't `` invent '' gravity , he only discovered/describe/formulate it . 
  but this answer is so much better . 
  this is wrong on so many levels , podemos said they 'd support the referendum and the catalan process . 
  and the psc just flips sides every time they see a chance to get more voters . 
  it 's hard not to . 
  but i do n't think brits who left the uk for spain necessarily behave like that son of a bitch . 
  although with the amount of race relate incidents the uk has , it might just be a ticking bomb . 
  so what future are we shaping right now ? 
  now we 're getting our fill of other kinds of extremism sadly . 
  what manifested in the uk as brexit , in france as lepen , in italy as lega nord , in greece as syriza and golden dawn ... is propelling the extremism elsewhere too . 
  including spain , see catalan nationalism . 
  i would n't be surprised if catalonia had an outbreak of far right in response as well . 
  these people wo n't just understand two wrongs do n't make a right . 
  to further ridicule your rhetoric , france completely wiped out anything that was not french . 
  see the french shame `` vergonha '' . 
  also , you suppose that spaniards that have nothing to do with said people or acts should be held accountable ? 
  you 're a brainwash hack job . 
  the catalan proposal of creating new victims to replace old ones is stupid . 
  their most notable import was oil and credit for the francoist rebels during the civil war , sadly . 
  you 're not a victim , you 're a perpetrator . 
  two wrongs do n't make a right . 
  two criminals attacking each other do n't make one victim , or two . 
  your brainwash nationalist rhetoric does n't add up . 
  so two wrongs make one right ? 
  is that your point ? 
  pathetic .

  catalans have been burning spanish flags for decades , you get no right to complain now . 
  they already removed it though . 
  get denied then .

  i will never give you 1 gold per turn for your 20 gold and 9 diamonds per turn .

  nowadays is a poisoned topic most politicians do not want to touch because whatever their decision ( regulate it or ban it ) there will be an outcry from a part of the population . 
  the only thing that we all seem to agree on is that street prostitution looks bad , so even though pimping is technically a crime we tend to look the other way on regards of brothels since they take the problem out of sight . 
  there are lots of brothels on the roads , some of hem huge as hotels , as well as small ones operating out of ordinary apartments . 
  there have been attempts at fixing the problem , though , albeit usually half-assed . 
  since trying to kick prostitutes out of the streets is sometimes impossible some cities are now fining their clients instead . 
  there have also been crackdowns on brothels for human trafficking . 
  and there are organisations that have been asking to regulate it for some time now . 
  but there is not a general agreement on how to deal with it , so it remains in a legal limbo . 
  i 'd say around 95 % or more of the milk we drink in spain is uht and comes in cartons . 
  some brands also sell it in big plastic bottles , but it 's the same stuff . 
  i remember seeing bags of what i assume was fresh or low-pasteurised milk when i was a little kid but not any more . 
  non-uht milk has been very hard to find for a long time ( unless you happened to live in a milk-producing area ) but it 's making a shy comeback : you can now find small quantities of it in supermarkets , and in some places there are milk vending machines . 
  yep , we do . 
  there 's a televised military parade every 12 of october , which is our national day . 
  and it invariably triggers protests and debates , which is becoming a tradition on its own . 
  your version makes more sense . 
  ` novio/a ' sounds a bit too formal and implies exclusivity , so when people do n't want to use those words they do n't really know what to say . 
  it 's usually `` your ( special ) friend '' , or `` your boy/girl '' , or just `` that person you go out with '' . 
  i guess we 've never had a dating scene big enough to come up with more specific words . 
  in a park of my small hometown there was a beloved statue of a kid shepherd . 
  the park was neglected for a long time , and one day the statue disappeared . 
  our local conspiracy theory is that the then-mayor stole it one night and put it in his countryside property . 
  a lot of people think so but of course nobody has bothered proving it . 
  i 'm convinced what happened is much simpler : council workers tried to remove it to start renovations in the park , but they broke it and the council silenced it because they did n't want to piss the town . 
  eventually the statue was replaced with a replica . 
  because , as i said , even though it 's taught in most schools and high-schools as a second language , there 's a lot of private and public language schools teaching it , and in sectors like tourism , finance or science it 's basically essential , most people still do n't speak it properly . 
  we are definitely doing something wrong . 
  few people speak it fluently . 
  it 's usually taught in high-schools as a second language , and we have official language schools which teach english as well , but even for those who do know the language ( mostly those younger than 40 ) i 'd say the general level is b1 at most . 
  in spanish : - novio ( boyfriend ) - novia ( girlfriend ) those two words are also used for ` groom ' and ` bride ' , which are their original meaning . 
  they come from the latin word ` novus ' , which means ` new ' , as in ` new marriage ' . 
  at some point in history their use was expanded to the initial courtship as well , because i guess there was no dating back then and relationships were supposed to end in a wedding . 
  in a juvenile way , no matter the age . 
  in the sense that we are not capable of talking about it if it 's not in a dirty way . 
  i guess it 's a consequence of our strict catholic heritage : sex became a taboo , and taboos are broken , not discussed honestly and maturely . 
  the silver lining is that since we grow up with this lewd concept of sex it does n't faze us . 
  someone shows her tits on public tv ? 
  we cheer and joke about it instead of bringing out the pitchforks . 
  yes , but rarely in a radical way . 
  i guess a 40-year totalitarian conservative dictatorship was enough for most people . 
  there is still some `` red scare '' around , but i think generally speaking there is more of `` live and let live '' attitude . 
  nope , nothing like that in spain . 
  the concept of `` celebrating the community '' does n't exist . 
  we just do n't give that much importance to the institutions as such , and juvenile sports are not even remotely as popular as they are in the usa . 
  i know there are some leagues for schools and universities at a local and regional level , but they are small and inconsequential . 
  schools sometimes have events that involve all students , but they are related to holidays and special occasions . 
  and the only thing that might unite university students is a strike or a party . 
  that is not to say that both school and universities do n't have their own signs of identity , but they are understated ( logos , mottos , maybe a flag ) and we do n't have the need to make the students feel part of something bigger . 
  we are much more pragmatical than that : a place to learn is a place to learn , and that 's all . 
  also , there is just not money for things like bands , professional teams , or printed newspapers . 
  children are usually taken to swimming lessons , which is seen as an essential skill , but it 's neither compulsory nor part of the school curriculum . 
  and since not every town has a swimming pool , and only about a third of the population lives in the coast , i 'm pretty sure there is a number of people who ca n't swim . 
  in any case , swimming is a minor sport here , not particularly popular . 
  we like `` standing on a field '' sports better ( football , basket , tennis ) . 
  there is certainly a gap between those who lived the dictatorship and those who have only known democracy . 
  but aside from that , it 's the usual cultural differences you could expect from two different generations . 
  which do n't seem to be that great , given how freaking fast older people have adopted facebook and whatsapp . 
  oh , yes , i have the feeling a lot of people think we live like a century ago , where you could just talk to a shop-keeper and ask them if they would hire them to sweep the floor for a few coins or take them as a apprentice . 
  that does not work that way !, 
  there are visas , and permits , and contracts , and taxes , and ( in the case of spain ) very few jobs for a very long list of unemployed unskilled people who do speak the local language . 
  depending on how badly they do it , it can be more or less easy . 
  i could spot a spaniard speaking broken english anywhere . 
  but if you were to put me in front of a portuguese , a spaniard , an italian , and a greek , all with a similar knowledge of spoken english , i would probably have a hard time telling them apart . 
  i 'd say at this point that falls in the stereotype category . 
  a biggest misconception , which we have to dispel in / r/spain quite often , is that you can come to spain knowing little to no spanish and find a job teaching english or something like that . 
  sorry , people , that 's not how it works . 
  first , if you are not a eu citizen there is quite a bit of paperwork you have to deal with before you can even come here . 
  second , if you do n't speak spanish you are going to have a very bad time because we do n't speak english . 
  and third , unemployment is very high , so finding a job is anything but easy ( and even if you do find one , it 's likely it will not be well paid ) . 
  not the soft local cops from my southern hometown , that 's for sure . 
  but we could always borrow some ertzaintza . 
  or better yet , bring in the legion , they can probably take care of all of them bare-chested and using just a knife . 
  i think we would lose the bigger cities pretty quickly , but the smaller places will probably be able to push them back . 
  it 's never a good idea to piss off a whole town of sun-hardened countrymen . 
  if the zombies ever get there , i mean . 
  some areas are so sparsely populated , and some villages so remote , that they might not ever see one . 
  generally speaking , not much . 
  most people can do perfectly fine with just english . 
  but in some parts of the country there are large communities of expats , so knowing their language can make it easier for you to land a job ( this applies mostly to french , german , and russian ) . 
  also , the export industry is always looking for people who can speak several different languages perfectly , including less-common ones like norwegian ( and , of course , they do n't find them here ) . 
  snopes did a very good job explaining this : http://www.snopes.com/politics/religion/nogozones.asp as for what spain is concerned , same as what other people from other countries answered : cops go wherever they are needed , but there are certain rough neighbourhoods i would certainly not go in willingly . 
  i do n't , because i 'm an atheist , but my parents do have a cross in their bedroom , and i 've seen them in a lot of older people 's homes . 
  i 'd say it was pretty normal for religious people from the previous generation . 
  you still can do good stuff , as ` deutschland 83 ' proves . 
  it had some pretty glaring flaws but i really enjoyed it and i 'm looking forward more seasons . 
  well , there 's the us show timeless now , which has literally [ ripped off the core idea ] ( http://tvline.com/2016/09/27/timeless-lawsuit-el-ministerio-del-tiempo/ ) . 
  although now that we 're two episodes in it looks a lot less funny and entertaining , on top of having very forced mysteries and a less organic development ( the fact that ours happens in a ministry , with its bureaucratic problems , the office gossip , and its own bar is what really makes the show ) . 
  i like some current music artists ( like fito or russian red ) , although i 'm one of those who believe for the most part we stopped making good music in the mid 90s ( part of it is an age bias , since those were my teenage years , but it 's also a fact that there was an explosion of creativity in the 80s , right after our dictatorship ended ) . 
  i do n't watch spanish movies in general because too many of them are cheap comedies or slice-of-life dramas i 'm not really interested in . 
  there 's also a marked lack of quality in a lot of them that really does n't help . 
  but i do think there are good directors and writers out there , and every now and then i find myself enjoying some ( last one was ` la isla m\u00ednima ' , which was a bit overhyped but i thought was pretty good anyway ) . 
  and i think the tv shows landscape is a mess for the most part . 
  way too many gossip and interview programs , for one . 
  there 's also the problem of the `` all-family '' shows . 
  since the spanish audience is not too big , and historically there 's not been much money around , tv channels tend to invest in shows that are 1 ) not expensive , 2 ) very long ( more than 2 hours sometimes ) , and 3 ) marketed to an audience as broad as possible , including kids and adults . 
  that kind of shows cope the prime time and do n't leave room or money for more niche things , so if you want something different you are out of luck . 
  things have been improving , though , and now you can find shows like `` el ministerio del tiempo '' ( a time-travelling show , which is a very rare thing indeed ) . 
  i also enjoy the new kind of documentaries that some channels are doing , like the travel ones that follow around foreigners in spain or spaniards in foreign countries . 
  it was a spanish colony , the last one in the continent , right until the war with the us in 1898 , which made quite an impact in our history . 
  there 's a spanish saying , still used today sometimes when you give up on something , that goes `` m\u00e1s se perdi\u00f3 en cuba '' ( `` we lost much more in cuba '' ) , meaning `` it 's okay , this is n't as bad as what happened in cuba '' .

  pretty much , yeah . 
  no , i 'm in europe so no need for predictit or max amounts . 
  which was also true before the us election , apparently . 
  i have already bet on it . 
  1/6 was exactly the odds prediction markets and bookmakers gave trump right before the election ( brexit had even lower odds ) . 
  they now have le pen winning at 20 % -45 % and rising . 
  ah the left , always democratically forcing people to do stuff whether they like it or not . 
  it 's going to be le pen vs fillon , and le pen will win . 
  `` people end up voting for the status quo in referendums , brexit will not happen '' `` trump has a minority of dedicated followers but he 'll never win the republican nomination '' `` trump has a ceiling , he 's alieanated so many demographics and is so far back in the polls he has no chance of becoming president '', 
  i 've been saying since the very beginning le pen will win . 
  yet people keep underestimating the populist wave , just like before brexit and before trump . 
  fillon has no chance against le pen in the second round . 
  macron might beat her , but that 's not a guarantee either , and he 's not going to make it past the first round anyway . 
  president le pen it is . 
  how is that wishful thinking ? 
  i 'm just being realistic . 
  is what you guys are doing . 
  just like before brexit and trump . 
  le pen will win . 
  wait and see . 
  what do those words mean ? 
  is n't deductible and out of pocket the same ? 
  there are other single-payer systems like the bus . 
  it 's the same in spain . 
  what ? 
  it 's often windy and rainy though . 
  winter is definitely not the best time to come as a tourist , though you can get lucky . 
  on average i 'd say around 10c , but it can fluctuate from 2-3 in cold nights to over 20c on hot days . 
  the moderating effect of the sea is exaggerated . 
  summer in valencia is hot as hell . 
  it makes spain the only nation to have land on both sides of the strait of gibraltar . 
  remember prestigious polls like abc had clinton leading trump by 14 points just two weeks before the election . 
  polls are far from perfect , and it only takes a change of mind of 7 % of the electorate for her to win . 
  i 've been saying it for a while : if it 's against fillon , le pen will win . 
  if she goes against macron , macron might have a chance . 
  polls do n't have a better record than betting markets lately . 
  you clearly do n't know enough about what you 're talking about . 
  most of hypermind 's users are french . 
  its discussion forum is in french . 
  hypermind , one of the leading betting markets with the most detailed prediction markets on the french election , is french . 
  betting markets had brexit and trump winning at 10 % -12 % probability on the eve of the respective votes . 
  they now have le pen at 17 % -35 % and rising . 
  been saying from the start that le pen will be the next french president . 
  i keep hearing the same answers i heard before brexit and trump . 
  `` polls say she 's behind '' , `` there 's no way it 'll happen '' , `` this time is different '' ... 
  wait and see . 
  you should put a bet on le pen now that the odds are good . 
  i 'm a `` proper spaniard '' , but i live abroad and i 'll admit i 've adjusted my eating hours a bit . 
  siesta stays though . 
  not adjusting that . 
  no that would be accurate . 
  which reminds me , it 's 1:30 pm . 
  good night !, 
  you might want to explain what a fh is ( university of applied sciences , with somewhat lower entrance requirements ) . 
  how so ? 
  is it because of the holy week parades etc. 
  maybe ... you 're wrong about that ? 
  as is the case for spain , and to a lesser extent portugal and italy . 
  have a look at maps regarding religiosity and belief in god , spain is actually the least religious catholic country of the ones people think about traditionally ( ireland , italy , poland , portugal , etc. 
  ) , poland the most religious one . 
  spain is less religious than slovakia , poland , even italy , portugal , etc. , which does make a difference . 
  you did n't address his point . 
  he 's entirely right . 
  i never said i think he 'll made it to the second round . 
  i just think if he does it , he 'll beat le pen . 
  i predicted trump would win , and as i said some weeks ago i think if it 's macron vs le pen , macron will win . 
  if it 's fillon vs le pen however , le pen will win . 
  queues * are * shorter a bit further north , in valencia , where there are no british expats . 
  the problem is that while the brits get their healthcare * expenses * paid for , they do n't contribute to the national health service via taxes . 
  since they are disproportionately old , the ratio cost vs. contribution is worse in those areas than in other areas , where there are proportionately more younger people in working age working and paying for the health system via their taxes while not going to the doctor as often , i.e. 
  being net contributors . 
  copying and pasting from my comment above : i grew up in an area with lots of british expats ( alicante ) , and while they bring money into the local economy , it 's not like there are no disadvantages to the whole thing . 
  real estate prices have gone up and up due to the influx of british pensioners , and that means they 've gone up for local spaniards as well . 
  to a lesser extent , prices of other things have gone up too . 
  while the cost for health insurance is transferred to the uk , healthcare is provided in spain . 
  since britons are disproportionately old , they visit the doctor more often than the average population . 
  a common complaint is that they clog the waiting lines for doctor appointments , etc. 
  there are literally less than a hundred spanish retirees in the uk .

  tell that to the spaniards who have to wait in line longer at the doctor 's because of the british retirees . 
  no it 's not . 
  the effect is minimal as the number of eu migrants who claimed benefits and ca n't claim them now is small . 
  please edit or delete your comment . 
  everything in it is wrong . 
  only the central valencian dialects have lost the voiced / z / sound , most native valencian speakers retain it . 
  valencian does have the same 7 vowels that every catalan dialect has in stressed positions ( the five spanish has plus open o and e ) . 
  the difference is that western dialects , in valencia and in western catalonia , have five vowels in unstressed positions ( the five spanish has ) whereas eastern dialects have reduced them to three ( schwa , / i / and / u / ) . 
  that is in fact the criterion used to separate catalan dialects in western and eastern . 
  there is a reason why western catalan dialects ( valencian and western catalan ) sound closer to spanish .

  they are just social democrats further to the left than your classic social democrats ( psoe ) , but still not anywhere close to true socialism . 
  sure , they are n't the pcpe after all xd i just called them far left since it 's the furthest left party with representation , and many european countries have similar parties . 
   eh bildu is not the `` political branch of eta '' in any shape or form . 
  the party is a coalition of left-leaning pro-independence basque parties , mostly made of abertzale left parties ( the basque `` patriotic left '' ) . 
  they do n't have any relationship with eta other than having support from the abertzale left ( the so-called basque patriotic left ) . 
  guess i was wrong there ( i was n't very sure about that one ) . 
  i made the connexion mostly on it having serious troubles being legalized iirc ( i was like 13 at the time , ca n't remember exactly what happened ) and otegui ( which went to jail for belonging to eta , or at least sympathising with them ) being the intended candidate to basque country governor . 
  to be fair , one of the alternatives was holding them on the 1st of january : /, 
  except there is such a mechanism . 
  a party needs at least 3 % of the vote in a constituency to enter parliament . 
  however since most constituencies do n't have enough seats for that rule to be triggered that only applies in madrid and barcelona . 
  you also get results like the canarian coalition geting one seat with 0.3 % of the vote ( they are fucking experts at that . 
  in the regional canary islands election they won coming up third in the popular vote ! ), 
  and pacma getting none with 1.3 % . 
  mostly because we are not used to this ( while we use proportional representation , in practice we had a parliament not too different from the uk 's , with 2 big parties and a couple regional small ones ) . 
  `` hung '' parliaments were n't rare , but it was easier to get into agreements then than now , due to regional parties being now pro independence . 
  for example , in 1996 aznar became prime minister with a pp+c iu ( catalan nationalists ) + pnv ( basque nationalists ) + cc ( canarian nationalists ) deal . 
  such a deal would be unthinkable today ( only cc supported the pp today , and they only have 1 seat and are in serious risk of disappearing at the national level . 
  meanwhile in 1996 they were much more healthy and had 4 seats iirc ) also , catalonian parties being pro independence now makes getting a deal even harder , and to top it all off , the prior pp government was hated by everyone except the pp, 
  i think there were 3 reasons : * 1 : to put pressure on the other parties * 2 : iirc it was the only date that would make us avoid an eu fine * 3 : the alternatives were the 1st of january ( new year 's day , even worse than christmas xd ) or the 8th of january ( 2 days after the 6th , the traditional day when kids get their gifts ), 
  that seems the most likely scenario . 
  btw , it would n't be `` around '' christmas , it 'd literally be on christmas xd ( 25th of december ), 
  tl ; dr : not likely at all . 
  with some negotiations and will it * could * be done , but not in 48 hours . 
  anyways , here 's a rundown of the parties that voted both in favour and against ( no abstentions this time around ) : ** in favour ** pp ( people 's party ) ( 137 seats ) classic right wing party and rajoy 's party . 
  comparable to the german cdu or the french republicans ciudadanos ( 32 seats ) : a classic liberal party , like the alde group , the german fdp or the lib dems in the uk . 
  went from an abstention to a yes after a long period of negotiations . 
  canarian coalition ( 1 seat ) : centre-right canary islands nationalists . 
  not independentists . 
  ** against ** psoe ( spanish socialist workers ' party ) ( 84 seats ; el mundo is counting nc 's seat as theirs ) : classic centre left party . 
  comparable to the german spd or the british labour ( pre corbyn probably though ) . 
  podemos and allies ( 64 seats ) : anti establishment far leftist group . 
  comparable to syriza in greece . 
  erc ( republican left of catalonia ) ( 9 seats ) : leftist catalan independentists . 
  pdc ( democratic catalan party , formerly democratic convergence of catalonia ) ( 8 seats ) : right wing catalan independentists pnv ( basque nationalist party ) ( 5 seats ) : right wing basque nationalists . 
  mostly against independence . 
  compromis ( 4 seats ) : left wing valencian nationalists . 
  contested the election in coalition with podemos eh bildu ( 2 seats ) : left wing basque independentists . 
  to an extent , the political branch of eta ( i 'm not sure on this one ; maybe some basques would help ? ) . 
  nc ( new canaries ) ( 1 seat ) : left wing canary islands nationalists . 
  not independentists . 
  contested the election alongside the psoe seeing this , there are various scenarios , none of them particularly likely : * rajoy convincing the psoe to abstain themselves , giving allowing them to easily get a simple majority . 
  * as a backup to the above , the pp convincing the pnv to vote in favour ( hard , ciudadanos does n't like them and even then they 'd have to wait until the basque country 's regional elections on the 25th of september ; but it can be done with enough willpower ; aznar did it in 1996 ) and nc to abstain themselves ( hard as well , their ideas are safely leftist and they 'd be supporting a right wing government ; such a deal would not be understood at the regional level . 
  however the canarian coalition supported that , maybe with a bit more nc will abstain ) * getting the pdc to somehow support the deal ( insanely hard , ciudadanos hates them to death and they probably wo n't settle with anything less than a referendum in catalonia , which is n't an option . 
  * maybe , maaaaaaybe * they 'll settle with greately increased taxing powers , but that is n't likely ) * the psoe deciding to make a move and create an alternative psoe+p odemos + compromis + erc+pdc government . 
  however that definitely requires a referendum in catalonia ( erc is even more pro independence ) , and the psoe does n't like that . 
  they are more open to it , but not much more so than the pp . 
  i ca n't see any more alternative scenarios though , other than voting on the 25th of december edit : wow , never thought i 'd see this , but i 've been given gold :d not too bad for a comment i made with my phone xd . 
  thanks random redditor , 
  to be fair , i wonder what would be those consecuences . 
  putting tariffs on eu products or what ? 
  ( actually , that would n't be that surprising if trump wins ), 
  same in spain . 
  even at the peak of the 00s bubble , unemployment was at 8.5 % . 
  that would be mediocre for other countries , but for spain that was amazing data . 
  yay , below the 20 % threshold !, 
  to be fair , can you live , get a job and the like in the us without knowing english ? 
  actually , american style pizza ( ie the one with the thick crust iirc ) is just as good in my opinion , as long as it 's not from say , domino 's or pizza hut ( though domino 's and pizza hut       telepizza , the leader here ), 
  to be fair , it 's not that uncommon to do that kind of stuff , especially for lazy people that ca n't cook ( like myself unfortunately ) you just cook the pasta , add in packaged tomato sauce ( not ketchup though ) , tuna and that 's it . 
  though absolutely no one eats it that way , you add the sauce to mix it with the pasta and then serve , not dip the pasta in the sauce as if it were french fries xd, 
  - this is blasphemy !, 
  this is madness !, 
  this is lithuania !!, 
  probably germany , with the uk or ireland being nice options as well . 
  seeing headlines like this i kind of feel happy that our nhs is handled by the regional government instead of by madrid . 
  come to think about it , the article mentions england , not the uk . 
  is the scottish nhs handled separately at edimburgh ? 
  to be fair , when was the last time spain and portugal went to war ? 
  i ca n't remember any recient one ( bad history teachers ? ), 
  can confirm . 
  there are actually many cuban doctors over here . 
  yeah . 
  the only critizism to the uk on the falklands i can see is the cost/benefit one . 
  the uk had a lot to lose ( namely money ) and not much to win ( defend some islands with 1k people ) . 
  still , the uk fought an uphill battle and won , they should be congratulated . 
  gib moniez plox, 
  hell , even if the eu became an actual country tomorrow , i doubt it would comoete as one country . 
  most likely a deal loke the one wales and scotland have for football would happen . 
  even if they did ( they do n't ) they should n't integrate ; they should be assimilated , they should forget islam and asopt the customs of the place they go to . 
  when in rome do as romans do ; or so they say . 
  i thought clinton was pretty much the us merkel ? 
  to be fair , the psoe platform is indeed centre-left ( podemos is plain left , pp is right and ciudadanos is liberal , more than pp in some aspects actually ! ), 
  it 's just that they 'll definitely not keep their platform , and they 'll behave like a right wing government anyways . 
  plus , zapatero 's second term hurt the party way too much , to the point where i 'm not sure if they 'll ever recover . 
  this actually reminds me of the 2013 ? 
  psoe primaries , where the corbyn-ish candidate got 20 % of the vote or so . 
  however , there 's also podemos , which i guess is basically a party full of people like that, 
  well , if labour went further to the right , would n't that make the lib dems redundant ? 
  to be fair , the us and russia have enough nukes to destroy the earth several times over . 
  it definitely would n't hurt if the us or russia unilaterally cut their nukes by like 90 % or so . 
  hell , they 'd even get free fuel for nuclear power plants , so they 'd be helping the environment as well !, 
  well , considering vienna to santander is a 21 h drive ( 2200 km ) ; it 's definitely not `` just a drive '' . 
  [ relevant polandball ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cd/poland_can_into_the_european_space_agency.png ), 
  or it :p, 
  well , in spanish we use nini instead , but i 'm not sure that 'd work in english ( neither-nor does n't sound that well ), 
  short for ni estudia ni trabaja : ( he ) neither works nor studies, 
  well , if all 4 of greece , italy , spain and portugal need a massive bailout then the eu is probably busted . 
  most likely ( temporal ) return to peseta/lira/dracma / escudo and subsequent chaos ensues . 
  if it 's only some of them ( 2 can definitely be manegable ; * maybe * even 3 ) then things could go better . 
  then again i 'm definitely no economist .

  so what ? 
  britons have been very vocal in proposing that capital is to be favoured over workers . 
  i daresay that this is the kernel of the uk opposition to the rest of the eu countries . 
   because the slaughter , nepotism and corruption perpetrated by the revolutionaries after their rise to power was really good anyway . 
  because the antirevolutionaries were not murderous , nepotists and corrupt . 
  how many irish died in the great starving ? 
  i do not know what you are talking about . 
  maybe you refer to wars , these tend to be pretty murderous , just ask the usa when they decided capriciously to attack iraq in 2003 . 
   napoleon [ ... ] caused a lot of wars . 
  rather the monarchies of europe did not want the french revolution to be successful , and by their attacks on france made napoleon the unavoidable leader . 
  ever heard of general ironside ? 
  should i remind you that the usa were born from a revolution against a supposed oppression that was much lesser than the one suffered by russians ? 
  i hope it is sarcasm . 
  that 's why they want to get out of the echr to set ** british ** human rights . 
  should i need to say that is true of most people in the world ? 
  having to assume responsibility for one own decisions fills most people with fear . 
  the reason is because capital part in gains has grown without comparison to workers part . 
  britons have nobody but themselves to blame for that . 
  i do not see that the su was a real free leftist system , it had many external negative inputs . 
  now if you look at italy under mussolini or germany under hitler or spain under franco you can see genuine right wingers getting what they want , without external interference , except for hitler when he expanded beyond its borders within europe . 
  liberty is a leftist concept , against the right wing concept of unrestricted power . 
  the right to have a private property is only valid in a functioning society , as otherwise the way to acquire property is too often plunder . 
  and note that slavery was not ill considered by right wingers . 
  people deprived of liberty and turned into private property , a definitely right wing position . 
  afaict , right wing ideas are anti human rights . 
  well , or rather bad , this is history , and quite recent . 
  he is a right winger , who would expect him to care about human rights ? 
   apparently you can not be racist against white people / s in xix century usa , irish were not considered white . 
  so being racist against irish people , like with nina ( no irish need apply ) signs , was not being racist against white people . 
   there is a narrative in western european media that eastern europeans are supposedly barbaric and uncultured . 
  no need for that , simply reading / r/europe what eastern europeans write is enough . 
   and hungarians never knew that they choose hitler and pol pot in one person orb\u00e1n might not be hitler and pol pot but only because of lack of resources . 
  hungarians knew very well what kind of politicians he was before the last election . 
  does n't represent me ? 
  shot can mean chupito in this context . 
   afghanistan was required . 
  in the late 1970s ? 
  i 'm not talking about the attack after 2001 , that was a late consequence , not the source . 
  the usa went into iraq because of hubris by bush and co. 
  the rest is consequence of the dislocation . 
  as for syrians coming to europe ? 
  well european countries are quite nearer than the usa . 
  you do understand that a lot of the present problems are the product of the usa intervention in afghanistan and middle east ? 
  that they ** created ** groups highly trained in terrorism and helped them create the logistics to provide them with whatever they need ? 
   if you want to see what happens when you accumulate so much debt check japan - https://www.sovereignman.com/trends/japan-projects-to-spend-43-of-tax-revenue-just-to-pay-interest-on-the-debt-16338/ . 
  43 % of their tax revenues goes to paying debt . 
  and this number is likely to go higher which will slow their gdp growth more and more . 
  that link has all the appearance of a scamming operation . 
  and on general principles , it is impossible that japan is paying 43 % of its tax revenue in interests . 
  that would require japan to tax some 80 % of its gdp . 
  no , simply their behaviour is different . 
  euro area economy has behaved worse than the usa , that 's why i say all of them have been damaged . 
  andorra never had her own currency but used spanish peseta and french franc , vatican and san marino used italian lira . 
  monaco used french franc . 
  montenegro and kosovo used the deutsche mark due to their unstable situation . 
  and if you think that portugal is well , let me wish every of your health recovery be as successful . 
  all of them . 
  for the boss , not the worker . 
  the reason lies in the idiotic rules of the euro governance . 
  rules that would sink any country beyond a minimal size . 
   a second generation immigrant or foreigner who was non-jewish would meet no resistance in the third reich providing he was n't gay or roma , so why the false equivocation ? 
  so you 're fine with the jewish persecution , i gather . 
  afaict , there were no significant immigration in germany in those years . 
  anyway it is not a false equivocation , that does the tell on you , simply these people have a rationale for their behaviour that is just as despicable . 
  there are less that 350000 icelanders , that 's about the size of valenciennes . 
  the jews were dispossessed of citizenship after hitler came to power . 
  so they were like second generation immigrants , or foreigners . 
  those that never integrate . 
   and it is also politicians fault that they decided to make decisions against ~ ~ people 's ~ ~ ** criminals ' ** will . 
  there is always a minority that will disagree with any elected government . 
  they caught him in flagranti , that 's probable cause for the judge to allow listening , and to get register of last calls . 
  you forget that sweden population and economy is nearly twice finland ones . 
  my understanding is that it applied to the central banks of the euroarea only , as they would emit euros , if they do not emit euros then not . 
  i might be wrong . 
  123 is only for euro countries . 
  it is still a bad article . 
  budget ceiling is an idiotic idea . 
  its purpose is to disadvantatge the worker classes respect to money holders . 
  in france and southern europe there have been political parties that called themselves socialist or communist , those that went with socialist were those that proposed social democracy . 
  people did not feel confused in my experience . 
  taxes too low on houses plusvalue . 
   the bible is said [ ... ] by some , and other say that any guy can read it without any preparation and act according to his individual reading . 
  that is protestantism in case you are not aware . 
  in germany they warred so to kill a third of the population in the past . 
  you moved on because you were profiting from the murders that happened . 
  i 'm only saying that if the people that say the division is good would have been the dead , that would have been fine , as thing are they were the killers . 
  do you think that killers do not deserve to be killed in legitimate defense ? 
   it would be impossible to get ~ ~ a fair ~ ~ ** an unfair ** agreement for both sides if every single bit of it had to be debated at every step . 
  maybe you would be happy to have your country ruined because a foreign power thought it good for them . 
  sure . 
   the brits who are as always , deep down , pursuing that `` balance of power thing , '' which is probably a good thing . 
  now if the only people to die pursuing that `` balance of power thing '' had been british , maybe that would have been good . 
  the tea party is not a political party . 
   i really do n't know what happened in the middle east back then and why extremism took over , anticommunism . 
  it is much easier when you 're young . 
  unless it is recent , post present poland founding , immigrant minorities , they are strictly poland citizens , and as such have their rights no matter what happens in other countries . 
  learn history . 
  the former workers will have unemployment subsidies , is n't it ? 
  and they 'll still be covered with healthcare , their kids will still be able to go school , etc. 
  europe has a more direct role in that .

  what the fuck did you just fucking say about me , you little bitch ? 
  i 'll have you know i graduated top of my class in the miquelets , and i 've been involved in numerous secret raids on madrit , and i have over 300 papers mullats . 
  i am trained in panellet warfare and i 'm the top sardanista in the entire catalan armed forces . 
  you are nothing to me but just another botifler . 
  i will bore you the fuck out with pointless discussions the likes of which have never been seen before on this earth , mark my fucking words . 
  you think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the internet ? 
  think again , fucker . 
  as we speak i am contacting my secret network of embaixades across the `` entire world '' and your ip is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm , maggot . 
  the storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call madrit . 
  you 're fucking dead , kid . 
  i can be anywhere , anytime , and i can prepare a crema catalana in over seven hundred ways , and that 's just with my bare hands . 
  not only am i extensively trained in demonstrating , but i have access to the entire arsenal of the assamblea nacional catalana and i will use it to its full extent to complain about how opressed we are . 
  if only you could have known what unholy retribution your little `` clever '' comment was about to bring down upon you , maybe you would have held your fucking tongue . 
  but you could n't , you did n't , and now you 're paying the price , you goddamn idiot . 
  i will demonstrate all over you and you will drown in it . 
  you 're fucking dead , nen . 
  but did you * inhale * shortly afterwards ? 
  wake up sheeple, 
  yeah , but i mean , that is n't in spain . 
  beacause that would be like defining something with that `` something '' in it . 
  it 's hard to describe , beacause i ca n't think of any other example of a stateless-culture that is present in multiple states . 
  i knooooooow you guys are n't on the `` catalan nation '' train , i really did n't mean that . 
  but yeah, 
  yes , catalonia itself is part of spain , but its culture is n't . 
  we 're a stateless nation , but we 're * not just only * part of spain . 
  there 's catalan culture in france and italy ( as you just mentioned ) too . 
  i came across a bit agressive , sorry , it 's just that spain has had a bit of a * history * of claiming basically anything we had . 
  exactly how l'alguer is spanish ? 
  this is some twisted logic right here . 
  for me it was cotlliure , though perpiny\u00e0 is the most iconic `` catalan-french '' town there is , for sure . 
  exactly how ? 
  you 're just salty, 
  yep . 
  [ i 'll upvote yours , beacause well ... 40 % upvoted tells quite the tale ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5tlh86/the_most_catalan_of_french_towns_perpiny%c3%a0/ ), 
  dunno , but i 've got to admit , the french and catalan flags side-by-side look pretty cool . 
  ^ ( mind a little napoleoning ? ), 
  a `` so you 're spanish '' in catalonia would fit the theme pretty well, 
  and obviously rome . 
  calatrava , you sly starchitect !, 
  not really , it 's about not caring what other people do . 
  tolerance and openness is a side effect to that , leftists * push * for these issues , which liberals do n't . 
   liberal daily reminder that this does n't have the same meaning here that it does in the us though !, 
  liberals are n't leftist in the eu, 
  please do, 
  beacause not only americans like crazy shit, 
  nah , not really . 
  merci is a very old barcelon\u00ed thing, 
  i think it 's just an old people 's thing nowadays . 
  in barcelona too , it 's very common . 
  and in barcelona at least people do n't say merc\u00e8s , that 's an old people 's thing , here they say `` merci '' . 
  we do n't sell them , they 're banned !, 
  hahahahaahahah ^ ( checkmate ! ), 
  well , we do n't exist , so at least we 're not * dirrrrty meeexxicans * :p, 
  [ our demonstrations ] ( http://images.scribblelive.com/2015/9/11/da09b051-ec2d-4d66-b023-9c4f5ed5bc02.jpg ) had around 5 times more attendance despite our lower population , but i 'm glad we 're not the only ones doing them . 
  ^ ( see , we can too be patronizing :p ), 
  ehhhhhh not really though , beacause if that were the case we 'd be a republic already , we 've been pulling off 1,5 m demonstrations for 5 consecutive years and a total pop of 7,5 m. 
  of course , i was speaking mainly about c 's and pp , i do n't have anything against spaniards, 
  they desperately want to portray us as close-minded , isolationists , this thread is the example , and yet they fail to realize that * they * themselves are that . 
  i see , so with this france does n't currently have your run of the mill labour party then, 
  they kinda are though , not always , but sometimes . 
  i just asked questions and i got downvoted , i 've got no clue about anything at all , not even reddit apparently !, 
  nope , not at all . 
  but hey , * look , people do n't identify as catalans !, 
  secessionism is dead guys , for sure !, 
   and according to catalans support was 80 % several years ago source me this first , beacause nobody says that . 
  the result of the consultation * as is * does n't mean anything and you know it . 
  you just implied that only those who were in favour of the consultation and its result are catalans , which is hilariously wrong and purposefully obtuse , pretty trolly tbh . 
  oh , so you yourself admitted that non-independentists are n't catalans . 
  welp , the gift that keeps on giving . 
  this entire thread is such a joke ... 
  they 're weird , very weird . 
  we have 6 or 7 parties ( ca n't be bothered to count right now ) and we have both a right-left and a catalanist-spanish axis . 
  well , here in catalonia our main right-wing party has changed its name 3 times in at least the last 6 years . 
  soooo yeah :p !, 
  people just refer to it as `` pdc , or the old converg\u00e8ncia '', 
  does n't that just make ps a pseudo-populist party and em the actual continuist party ? 
  goddamm french politics ... 
  so , what does this mean ? 
  i 've heard he 's the closest thing to pablo iglesias ( kind of like corbyn in the uk ) in france . 
  what are his policies ? 
  thing is , independentism is supported by more people than catalans . 
  this `` catalan = independentist '' line of thought ( promoted by ciudadanos and pp , spanish nationalist parties ) is pretty flawed . 
  that 's beacause she is :p, 
  spain is the second most montainious country in europe , with the `` meseta '' region occupiyng most of the interior . 
  it 's a series of arid badlands with little to no water and so people did n't settle there unless there was a river ( like the manzanares in madrid , which allowed the artificial `` prop-up '' of the existing city into capital-status ) . 
  that 's why pop density in the interior always follows rivers and little else . 
  * if * we win a referendum i think not . 
  it would go against the foundational principles of the eu . 
  that 's why spain is so scared of it . 
  that 's what private meetings are for . 
  they know what this is about , they do n't need to be there . 
  yeah , there 's a list [ here ] ( http://www.vilaweb.cat/noticies/una-concurrencia-insolita-al-parlament-europeu-escolta-puigdemont-junqueras-i-romeva/ ) but it 's in catalan . 
  despite being victim to spanish boyco ... * dialogue * , it went pretty well . 
  no , but sabotage is foul play , and hypocritical when you do n't stop speaking about how much you want to dialogue . 
  good thing it completely failed . 
  well , since i do n't really like speculation , let 's just say that what you 're saying is probably closer to happening if only one of the two parties gets to talk to europe and that party is n't catalonia . 
  since we want to be part of the eu we have to negotiate with them , so this is just that . 
  again , as you said , eu membership is a useful thing in my opinion . 
  if the only info europe gets about us is from the same people that do * that * i find it pretty justified . 
  of course of course !,

  andalucian separatism is also non-existent . 
  it 's about regionalism and nationalism , not separatism . 
  the same goes for asturias . 
  also , the catalan one is not even representing its own territory , as valencia and baleares are not catalan . 
  the only real separatist movements are those in basque country and catalonia . 
  galicia has it too , but in a much more minor escale ( think of wales or brittany , for example ) . 
  and last , but not least ... why would you leave the current spanish flag for the remainders of `` spain '' . 
  that 's not spain anymore , that 's ... madrid and a bit more . 
  whoever made this map knows little about this , really . 
  unlikely . 
  galician ~ ~ nationalists ~ ~ independentists want their own nation , not getting annexed by portugal . 
  portugalicia is only relevant among portuguese nationalists . 
  that flag would be 1000 % cooler though . 
  january-february-march are the `` maybe it can snow '' months in madrid xd december is like a no-no . 
  yes please . 
  i live in madrid and pass through [ atocha ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyqq3xfb3ea ) almost everyday ...

  we too hate our government, 
  congrats brothers, 
   sure , the spanish army 's deployment in iraq was defeated in madrid not bagdad . 
  this is simply ignoring spain 's politics and even more , ignoring what happened during 2002 , 2003 and 2004 . 
  spain did n't want war , [  90 % of the population was against , hundreds of thousand if not millions marched on madrid against the war ] ( https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/manifestaciones_contra_la_invasi%c3%b3n_de_irak_de_2003#la_peculiaridad_espa.c3.b1ola ) before anything happened . 
  saying that the spanish army was defeated the 11-m is simply like saying us army would have been more prepared in 9/11 if they did n't go to vietnam . 
  exactly . 
  makes zero sense . 
   if spain engages in a high profile deployment to africa , every jihadi and his auntie will be looking to bomb madrid again . 
  not really . 
  africa is not the same as the middle east . 
   if the spanish people react in the same way again , by voting for a government that brings the boys straight home - the hit to the credibility of the spanish state could be huge . 
  even the opposition approves helping france in syria . 
   i certainly think barcelona will be pleased with madrid sticking its head above the parapet here , in the hope madrid gets one right between the eyes . 
  this has absolutely nothing to do with this matter , not like the army was going to be deployed in catalonia ... because it already is . 
  it 's part of the country still . 
  i think you have a huge lack of information buddy ... at least that 's my conclusion . 
  you really do n't know what 's going on here but you still thought you did . 
  there * is * already spanish troops and military equipment deployed in those regions helping france . 
  spain has enough military to increase its presence there without compromising anything in its own territory . 
  after madrid 's attack our military was called back because we did n't want that war from the beginning , and a government change happened . 
  the army did n't come back because of the attacks . 
  welcome to the spacial club , just do n't be so hungry up there or we will run out of spacial doritos . 
  while spain is indeed at risk ( you know , the 11-m , the reconquista , `` al-andalus '' thing ... we are always directly mentioned together with paris , london , rome or washington ) , today it seems france is the center of this horror , and looks like we need to support france in order to help us all . 
  i think spain is at risk , and even if it 's a priority it 's not first on their list ... so i 'd say let 's go help more france in africa , so france can focus on syria . 
  so do spain , although nor your islands nor ours are in the continent . 
  that 's why portugal and spain are the westernmost part of * continental * europe , and not iceland  edit : idiots downvoting just proving their stupidity . 
  portugal is not an island , bro . 
  let me know if you want to know more :p, 
  depends if you 're looking it upside down or not . 
  you forgot 47 million people in the westernmost part of the continent . 
  edit : oh , i 've just read your last sentence . 
  oh no , it happens , like you say , for a few weeks between seasons . 
  my point is that that should 've happened by this time ... in october , not now . 
  we should be freezing already !, 
  lol as you might have guessed , i hate warm temperatures . 
  and living in spain that 's ... a nightmare , at least in plain areas of the interior . 
  so i 'm always eager of the cold , freeze and snow finally arriving . 
  i see . 
  my point is that we ( as in madrid and interior of spain overall ) indeed have a continentalized variation of the mediterranean climate , although we really do n't have such contrasts the rest of the year . 
  sure , the temperature amplitude is larger than in the coast , and also we are around ~ 700 meters above sea level , so things get a little more extreme than being just in the sea shore , but still ... days should be cold , windy , icy ... etc. 
  but we barely have to wear a jacket at mid day , and you see people with summer clothes these days . 
  it 's not usual in this time of the year . 
  madrid at 7 am or so i 'm freezing my ass at 3-4\u00bac at most when i go to work , and just about 4-5 hours later ... bang , 22\u00bac . 
  * really !? 
  * i hate this . 
  i just want to freeze my ass * the whole day * . 
  it 's time already . 
  we iberian bros are bound to suffer the azores anticyclones with southern winds from africa . 
  plus snow and cold and ice and fog . 
  what people call `` bad weather '' is my good weather . 
  only thing is i 'm not galician , but that does n't matter , still iberian . 
  no problem , the day after catalonia goes independent this will fix itself , dw . 
  i hate it . 
  it says they wo n't obey the spanish constitutional court . 
  if that 's democratic for you ... ok , but for the rest of democrats we think it 's not , even if we disagree with the judges and the current politicians . 
  so no , you 're mixing up things . 
  it 's not about a referendum , it 's about creating an independent state ... that 's the quote . 
  unilateral secession . 
  it is for / u/aleixasv because everybody here knows what his political opinion is . 
  but / u/aleixasv 's political opinion is not the reality . 
  too bad for him . 
   we need to ignore the spanish constitution to be able to hold this referendum . 
  i see your point but ...  which is exactly what was voted today in parliament . 
  this is not true . 
  it 's actually absolutely false . 
  [ this is what has been approved today . ], 
  it has nothing to do with a referendum . 
  it literally says : ** `` parliament solemnly declares the beginning of the process of creating independent catalan state as a republic . 
  '' ** and also talks about `` disconnecting from spain '' . 
  not `` exactly '' what you say , buddy . 
   do n't even know the opinions of `` the rest '' of parties . 
  so you assume they want independence in a non-referendum elections despite not saying so ? 
  how democratic . 
  i would n't be so sure ... ciudadanos destroyed pp in catalonia because they represented the anti-independentism better than them . 
  this is going nowhere , so everybody do n't worry . 
  it was n't the unionists that wanted the referendum ... plus i ( you say `` then let the referendum ) do not have competences to do so , 
  no , precisely what i 'm sure is what parties are `` yes '' . 
  and ** the `` yes '' parties in that election had less than 50 % of the votes . 
  ** not talking about `` no '' parties but `` the rest '' . 
  check my comments again . 
  so ... yes , really , i do know what i 'm talking about .

  i wish the best for scotland ( and for the rest of the uk ) but this is a bit premature and not well thought . 
  i guess scotland would like to keep a free market and free movement with england ... how are they going to reconcile that with being part of the eu ? 
  we still do n't know in the terms of the relationship between eu and the uk . 
  it could be very well a norwegian alike deal , which is far from being a huge change .

  no , that 's not true . 
  no it 's not . 
  it seems so in seats , but in % of votes they have lost very little . 
  i wish i could upvote you a thousand times . 
  the rebirth of the popular front has helped them massively . 
  basically was pp or the commies ... 
  they do n't even have absolute majority in the parlament and need the support of a extreme left party . 
  they could n't approve the budget for this year , and a confidence vote is planned for september . 
  with this electoral landscape , i think the catalans would want to vote again . 
  mostly the same results , +2 % erc , -2 % cdc http://resultados.elpais.com/elecciones/2016/generales/congreso/09/index.html but i expected some big changes due the brexit . 
  i 'm reporting the results for catalonia because i wondered if brexit could have been a massive boost for independentism . 
  what we see is that both parties which form the government coalition there get a mere 31 % ( with cdc , which has been the ruling party for decades , it 's at pp level , which is irrelevant politically there ) . 
  i think that we will see elections in catalonia this year . 
  this just shows test any referendum where the winning side gets less than 60 % is a political failure . 
  cameron has lost both referendums , not just this one . 
  * shall you live in interesting times . 
  * ( chinese curse ), 
  there is no need to rush , but it 's a bit unbelievable that the uk pretends now to delay their departure and use it as a negotiating card ... 
  it looks like that brexiters did n't expect to win and want to buy some time . 
  so you are sovereign to remain in the eu for as much as you want ... 
  this is getting sillier every minute . 
  hmmm the stereotyped catalan and scottish are a bit ... ahem ... * frugal * coincidence ? 
  you read too much in my words . 
  i 'm not blaming anyone , i 'm not saying that nationalists ' do n't have the right to `` sell '' their votes however they want , i 'm explaining the situation . 
  the article hypothesizes about how portugal could be a model for spain , when the parlamentary composition is very different . 
  any coalition different from the conservatives + social democrats just does n't have enough seats to form a government . 
  it 's just that simple . 
  no , it 's not a model for us because we have nationalists/separatists parties which will vote against anyone , right or left , who does n't promise them something they want . 
  and giving them what they want could be very well a political suicide for mainstream parties . 
  * joachim l\u00f6w will guard your crown jewels * bonus points , nobody will ever want to rob ( or even touch !! ), 
  them for ages . 
  well deserved , spain 's defense was shit and the croatians could have scored before . 
  letting a defender kick the penalty was n't the wisest of the choices too . 
  i would love to let this thread die , but i have the impression that you truly believe in your lack of bias and think that your critics are fair and proportional , which imo is far from the truth . 
   both cabacas family and quintana went to the institutions were ciudadanos already was to protest about police brutality , which imo can be related to police brutality in venezuela cabacas and quintana were n't harmed due police brutality , at least not in a comparable sense to police using firearms agains ralliers . 
  those cases are about the approval by the administration of theorically non-lethal weapons which resulted in death an serious wounds . 
  or may be misuse of the equipment by the policemen which turned non-lethal devices in lethal ones . 
  but there was n't a deliberate intention of killing by the police , was it ? 
  what 's ciudadanos stance in the issue ? 
  it 's [ easy to check ] ( https://www.ciudadanos-cs.org/prensa/jordi_canas_felip_puig_ha_perdido_el_control_del_departamento_de_interior/5595/ ) ( [ 2 ] ( http://www.lavanguardia.com/politica/20131218/54398362698/el-parlamento-catalan-aprueba-la-supresion-de-las-pelotas-de-goma.html ) ) in quintana 's case . 
  do n't you agree ? 
  fair enough , let 's critizise then . 
  i ca n't find references to cabacas case . 
  ciudadanos had n't presence in the basque country by then , but if they can go to caracas to critizise maduro now , they could have had an opinion on the issue then . 
  it 's a valid point . 
  if you still want to judge politicians by their emotional responses it 's your choice , but ca n't agree , that is . 
   as for syria : http://www.abc.es/espana/abci-pp-y-psoe-temen-guerra-siria-reviente-campana-electoral-201511190255_noticia.html as i see the supported the idea of ground troops in syria as long it 's approved by the un and the nato . 
  surprising but not a big deal really . 
  in fact , it 's a rather unpopular opinion indeed : at the first televised decapitation his ellectoral prospects would plummet . 
   if you want to think this is just hate for the sake of hating that 's your choice the problem here is that you mix and match anecdotes and critics to policies and is hard to see a coherent discourse farther than the simple bashing for the sake of it . 
  he cried in a very specific moment ... an anecdote which should n't have more importance . 
  critizise him for his approach to the venezuela thing , not for that . 
  the people you cite was wounded/killed by flahs balls . 
  he did n't cry about it ... so what , what 's your point ? 
  what 's c 's policy on flash-balls ? 
  is it critizisable ? 
  is anyhow relevant to the thing we were talking about or you brought the point just because ? 
   after the paris attacks he was quickly willing to send ground troops to syria with some dubious idea of an un mandate as far i remember , he supported france 's response which was n't about ground troops but only `` surgical '' bombings . 
  as most european leaders did , btw . 
  even assumming you are right , i do n't think it 's unbelievable that he felt truly moved by a such sad story and that he did n't fake their tears . 
  people do n't care , we have enough problems already to lecture others about how they should fix theirs . 
  the thing is , is pretty unbelievable that a coallition that supports chavism ( sometimes openly , sometimes veiledly ) could go mainstream in spain , so the other parties are attacking that apparently weak flank ( unshamefully even ) . 
  it 's not working ; the bar is so low already that people despise some politicians and do n't care about anything else . 
  we have a pm who has received undeclared money , and a ruling party who has financed its ellectoral campaigns with bribes . 
  rajoy has awakened this `` monster '' and i despise him doubly because this reason , added on top of his own faults . 
   i doubt anyone in ciudadanos cried when i\u00f1igo cabacas died or when esther quintana lost an eye why do you stop there ? 
  what a crappy attempt of whataboutism . 
  the thing is simpler . 
  op says rivera is crying `` for venezuela '' , while he cried when a mother was describing how her son was killed . 
  humans respond more emotionally when they directly emphatize with victims than when they only intellectually know that a fatality has happened . 
  that 's what i was saying , nothing more , nothing less . 
  i think that 's a pretty understandable reaction , but op and you wanted to bash c 's regardless . 
  your choice . 
  a mother telling how her son was shot dead by the police could move to tears to most people , let it be in venezuela , spain , italy or any other country ... 
  psoe has renovated their structures after zapatero and accepted they did things wrong . 
  it 's true that in andalusia has n't happened that , but it will only do when the andalousians decide so , given it 's a federal party . 
  i would n't recommend anyone to vote them in a regional elections there , but for the central government , i do . 
  he said exactly that , see 17:49 in this video http://youtu.be/btiyap0imeo, 
  i bet it 's a recent graduate and it 's an entry level job ... am i wrong ? 
  how old is he/she ? 
  which sector ? 
  yeah , because their politicians are really shining right now ... you hater . . 
  oh ... my ... goodness ... 
  i ca n't even ... 
   trust me , there 's maybe two or three dummies out of the 5 million podemos voters that say that venezuela is an example . 
  that 's true ... 
  the problem is those voters are also the founders .

  it 's better if you just ignore him : it 's not like someone with half a brain will buy the shit he takes out of his ass , as usual . 
  if you want his sources , try in hyper-subsidized * panfletos * ( propaganda ) like vilaweb , it 's ** even ** worse than la raz\u00f3n lol . 
  not even bothering to answer how stupid sounds `` having to send money '' ... like if it was that simple . 
  idiocy at its finest . 
   has it been talked about how the debt would be split up ; by gdp share , population . 
  or expenditure ? 
  of course not . 
  what did you think , that nationalists use rationalism or just something else than sentimentalism and false arguments to try to convince people ? 
  real scenarios do n't even exists for those people , it 's just `` everything will be better without spain '' .

  ] ( http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2013/06/the-country-thats-most-accepting-of-homosexuality-spain/276547/ ), 
  and they claim they 're not spain . 
  how cute . 
  all this drama is the most spanish thing ever . 
  it does n't sound like the norm ... at all ( i 'm from madrid ) . 
  it 's christmas , not the time of a clown visiting us to make us laugh . 
  go back to your cave , tontito . 
  spaniards do n't think that way ... he does n't represent anyone but himself . 
  i think both are a bad thing . 
  a majority should n't be able to decide if a minority gets their human rights or not . 
  i think the way spain did it is better than how ireland did it . 
  obviously the slovenian one is even worse , considering a majority of people denied the rights of a minority . 
  not really , in spain we should be getting snow in many parts of the interior by now , and people ca n't ski yet in many places . 
  this is a non-winter winter :( i 'm afraid this one we wo n't see snow in madrid . 
  hopefully i 'm wrong . 
  the rich switzerland is the french aka latin part , buddy . 
  not really , no . 
  there are more cultural differences between a french-speaking swiss and a finn or a dane than the differences they have with their italian neighbours , or a spaniard . 
  so what you say makes no sense at all . 
  if switzerland is northern europe we are central . 
  -_- someone needs to go back to school and check geography again . 
  i mean , the beach , the mediterranean , baleares , barcelona ... all of that is cool and shit , but [ having the sense that you just arrived to the middle age , in an architectural sense ] ( http://i.imgur.com/exbjj9n.jpg ) , it 's just so fraking awesome ... [ this is not rome but segovia , spain ] ( http://i.imgur.com/mwlk8iy.jpg ) . 
  the interior . 
  only the japanese know about it :p, 
  totally fine with those cunts being yuros :d as well as the canadians :d, 
  hell , if they can into eurovision ... 
  how ? 
  we 're growing more :p, 
   it does . 
  ah , so i 'm a catalan independentist ... and here i am , did n't have a clue !, 
  ... lol, 
  what 's wrong with them ? 
  suck it italia !, 
  being a non statu quo supporter does n't make you an independentist . 
  that 's a fallacy . 
  i 'm not an independentist just because i want a different country , with a different regime ( i.e. 
  a republic ) etc. 
  etc. ... so no , not really , what you say is not true at all . 
  ada coulau is not independentist , the vote was a rebellious vote , and this is already said by herself in her facebook , back in the 9-n , the independentist protest , done by and for independentists , mostly . 
  podemos represent around 20 % of all voters , which is not far from pp ( 28 % ) and basically at psoe levels ( 22 % ) . 
  so it 's not a minority group at all . 
  also , you only account podemos voters as spaniards that want a different thing that what we have ... but even though psoe is an pro-establishment party , their bases ( ie most voters ) are federalist , republican and want a different spain . 
  sadly , that wo n't show up in the psoe 's leadership ... at least for now . 
  no she 's not . 
  i 'm on mobile now and ca n't provide sources at this moment , but she explained why she voted yes-yes ( rebel vote rather than indep . ), 
  and just a few days ago proclaimed that `` madrid can be our capital again '' . 
  so it 's clear , she is against statu quo , like most spaniards , but not pro-indep, 
  they want a referendum , not the independence . 
  they 're two different political stances . 
  you can be pro-referendum and be against independence at the same time , because you know ... democracy n ' shit . 
  podemos is pro-referendum , and it 's one of the reasons they are first option in catalonia and the reason why the confluences have been working . 
  podemos has got 69 seats , not 42 . 
  you have to add the different coalitions that they have formed in galicia ( en marea ) , catalonia ( en com\u00fa podem ) and valencia ( comprom\u00eds-podemos ) , so 42 +12 +9 +6, 
  we do n't know what the hell is going to happen at this point . 
  that 's everything . 
  welcome to spain, 
  psoe is second . 
  how disappointing . 
  if we add iu-up votes to podemos , they clearly have more votes than psoe . 
  at least rajoy wo n't be our next president . 
  hurrah !, 
   but madrid-barajas is more pleasant but more opressive !!, 
  :p i 'm just joking lol, 
  turnout is higher now in the second half . 
  looks like that 's the thing . 
  i reckon turnout will be much higher in the second half than in 2011 ... let 's hope . 
  old vs new politics , 
  i 'm quoting what they have said last night : that they will abstain if they 're in the opposition and if pp or psoe is first ... aka they will abstain if pp wins ( thus letting pp form a government indeed ) . 
  what you say is not a fact . 
  the only fact is what they said , that could be true or not ( who knows , they could vote against ... form a coalition ... or just do what they said they are going to do ... but it 's all opinion and speculation ) . 
  ciudadanos have said they will abstain so the winner can form a government if they are in the opposition ... so that means ciudadanos will abstain if pp wins and have enough seats to do it . 
  psoe+pp coalition is very unlikely , i would n't count with that . 
  iu-up has been critizing podemos lately , but it 's the only option they have to support ... so i do n't think they will vote ` no ' a podemos-lead coalition , but they will probably play hard ( like the cup in catalonia , i reckon ) . 
   and why are they only predicted to get 1-3 seats with 4 % of the vote , that seems a bit fucked up ? 
  that 's d'hondt for you . 
  exactly the same temperature in madrid that we had . 
  it 's crazy what i 'm going to say , but i want my balls to freeze already -_-, 
  thank you for your contribution , very insightful . 
  i just came back from the polling place !, 
  i 'm so hyped . 
  podemos looks like it 's going to surprise us all . 
  / u/slyratchet , friend , [ you should update the latest poll from andorra ... ;\\ ) ] ( http://i.imgur.com/udmcwur.png ) [ bonus track ] ( http://i.imgur.com/lbgsmki.png ) . 
  first , i 'm from madrid but i have family all around spain and i really love the country 's diversity . 
  no , podemos is not pro-independence . 
  we ca n't say that some podemos-supporters are not independentists and/or nationalist , there could be a few indeed , but the party is clear : podemos supports a united spain , but it is in favor of the different spanish peoples ( catalans , basques , galicians ... etc. ), 
  to vote a different relationship with the rest of spain ( even up to independence , like the scottish referendum ) . 
  like they say , they 're in favor of `` we must decide everything [ aka direct democracy ] , and everything is everything [ including territorial topics like this ] '' . 
  i , myself , will vote podemos today , but i 'm strongly against independentism because i love the catalans , the basques , the galicians or the castilians too much to see them splitted .

  a one-way ticket costs 85 ~ $ . 
  the bus from granada to madrid costs 17 $ and only takes one more hour . 
  to infinity and beyond . 
  the netherlands . 
   because countries going with reduced spending austerity are such a resounding of success . 
  hey , we have had austerity in spain for four years now and it is working like gangbusters , we have a 1.4 % expected growth rate for 2014 . 
  actually it 's going so well that i 'm going to have to leave the country with both my bachelor 's degree and my master 's in medical science . 
  you know , i could make a fortune if i stayed in spain but ... 
  i 'd rather be humble lad and let others take that wealth . 
  railway in spain is stupidly expensive . 
  i have only used once in two years . 
  why would i pay that unreasonably high amount when i can buy an airplane ticket for the same price or a bus ticket for half the price ? 
  yes , because what i was trying to show is the direct correlation between high taxes and prosperity that happened during the second half of the xx century . 
  [ the situation was similar for corporate taxes ] ( http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-soi/02corate.pdf ) , if you want to check . 
  or corsica , for some reason . 
  joke 's on them , we never had jobs in the first place :d they 're just volunteering , it 's just that they do n't know it yet . 
  i said their reckless lust for profit , not profit in general . 
  although you 're right , seeing your gdp increase is not the most important thing in the world . 
  you are our little brother , 
  hey , i would never do that . 
  * hugs *, 
   instead , officials who decide what to spend public money on will often go with people they know instead of the financially best venture . 
  i do n't know where you 're from but that should n't be happening . 
  [ history has taught us that leaving too much power to corporation ends up in economics collapse \\ ( basically what happened during the early xx century \\ ) and that the best way to lead the path towards an equal , economic growth is through support and maintenance of an stable middle class that will keep consuption rates high ( from the second half of the xx century on ) ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/income_tax_in_the_united_states#history_of_top_rates ) . 
  while i do n't think communism is a viable option at all , unregulated capitalism can be as dangerous as the latter . 
  i think we are both locked in our opinions . 
  you do n't think government expenditure is an investment in society and i do n't think , based on historical facts , that corporations ' lust for profit benefits society in any way . 
  this is clearly outdated . 
  bulgarians think of spain as the `` workplace '' . 
   what do you think banks even do ? 
  when you deposit money it 's not just `` locked in a bank account , '' it 's being invested by the bank . 
  in fact , in most countries , if you deposit $ 10 into the bank , it will invest $ 20 or $ 30 out through the fractional-reserve system . 
  first , that depends on the bank , the country and the regulation . 
  it is important to distinguish between savings banks , investment banks , credit unions and other money-storing entities second , we have seen through the early 2000s where banking investment leads us to : economic bubbles that will later burst in our faces . 
  about dividends , unions are there for many reasons , and one of them is preventing this from happening . 
  i 'm saying that a corporation , who lusts for profit , wo n't invest its money unless it is sure that it will get a greater amount of money from that investment . 
  also lobbysts do not work for the government , why would they get the public money ? 
  it 's usually the other way around , lobbyists `` pressure '' the governments to receive some legal benefits . 
  i do n't know about your country but , although we have several cases of corruption , i do n't think giving more money to the state will translate into more corrupt officials . 
  taxing them will allow governments to invest in their own country . 
  a big company might only invest if it foresees some profit prospect , otherwise it will keep the money locked in a bank account , which does no good to anyone . 
  still low, 
  it 's low compared to what they used to be when times were better . 
  you mean the top 10 % that is not rich enough to hide their money in tax havens ? 
  i believe you 're not naive enough to think that widespread use of international subsidiaries to avoid fiscal responsabilities is not a common thing . 
  in spain , for example , the most powerful companies have been [ hiding tax money that is equal to the amount of public debt ] ( http://www.publico.es/dinero/454897/el-94-de-las-empresas-del-ibex-elude-impuestos-en-paraisos-fiscales ) . 
  i believe [ the us has one the highest wealth gap between rich and poor in the world ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/economic_inequality#mediaviewer/file:gini_coefficient_world_cia_report.svg ) . 
  and [ there are constant reports on how the american middle class is slowly dying ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/money/us-money-blog/2014/apr/27/america-canada-middle-class-college-healthcare-taxes ) . 
  why is n't the university in the us as cheap as it was 20 years ago ? 
  why are n't there as many social benefits as there were 20 years ago ? 
  [ because the tax burden in the us has been gradually changed to favour the rich . 
  ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2012/11/30/us/tax-burden.html ) tax havens and loopholes are a scourge that hinders the development of modern societies , no matter how fashionable neo-liberal schools want to make free trade seem . 
  and no , i 'm not reluctant to pay taxes , as long as everybody else is fulfilling their duty , because that 's how middle class was built and that 's how you keep the economy of your country healthy . 
  and the examples are there : scandinavian countries . 
  taxes are there for many reasons , one of them being to balance income inequality . 
  paying taxes is basically investing in your own country through your government . 
  well , at least they are realistic . 
  neoliberals here tell you everything 's gon na be alright , you 're gon na see a gdp increase and you will get plenty of jobs and then , when shit hits the fan , they just blame the previous government . 
  france has the highest marginal tax rate on individuals , but its corporate rate is not that high ( 30 % if i remember correctly ) . 
  i do n't understand why the rich are so afraid of being taxed . 
  taxes ensure that society has a well-built middle class through different means ( social benefits , education , income regulation ) . 
  a well-built middle class is able to keep the consumption ratio stable , which in turn will translate into gdp growth and most likely into profit for their companies . 
  it has been working for scandinavian countries for decades , why are then the rich so scared of contributing to their customers ' and their own company 's wellbeing ? 
  but ... but ... the market ... 
  they 're generally pretty bad . 
  the only people who say they 're good are the ones that ca n't watch it in the original version . 
  or just trying to show off his poetic skills by making use of a beautiful oxymoron . 
  and an attempt to erradicate an entire ethnicity . 
  you know , everyday stuff . 
  he was just an aid worker ... 
  this kind of stuff makes me think that humanity is hopeless . 
  from the original webpage :  rainbow europe map reflecting the 49 european countries ' legislation and policies that have a direct impact on the enjoyment of human rights by lgbti people . 
  the rainbow map reflects each country 's situation and provides overall score on how far this country is on a scale between 0 % and 100 % . 
  so basically , if your country has implemented pro-lgtb measures , you get a higher score , whereas if your country has been an asshole ( law-wise ) to the lgbt community , you get a lower score . 
  [ according to the last poll ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/catalan_independence ) : 54.7 % yes , 22.1 % no . 
  edit : i forgot to state my view on the topic . 
  as a spaniard , as much as i love catalonia and would like them to stay with us , i am ok with it being an independent country . 
  democracy comes first , so everyone should be allowed to decide for the future of their country . 
  edit2 : apparently , i ca n't type like a human today ... 
   what do you think about tisa ? 
  i think it should as well be subject to approval via referendum . 
   yeah , american corporations must also control germany . 
  they already control the political and economic power of your country , why would n't they want to control the rest of the market ? 
  after all , they have the power and influence to do so . 
  come on , at this point we both know who wears the pants in the us . 
   i was taking about what justifies a referendum if you read my first comment , you 'll find this sentence : `` i think an agreement of such importance should be voted on referendum . '', 
  i think it 's quite clear that this statement implies that any bilateral agreement of the same importance such as one between india and the eu should as well be subject to referendum . 
  nobody 's trying to deflect from the initial point . 
   demonstrated by southern & northern european relations . 
  do i have to remind you that the austerity-based approach to economics was suggested by people who worked for american based-corporations , such as mario draghi and is based on the protection of the free market rather than the interestests of the society ( which is by far a rather american approach to economics ) ? 
  you may ask people around here what they think about such approach and you will get europe 's true thinking . 
   as well as british & polish relations with the eurozone . 
  just because they did n't adopt the euro as a currency does not mean they hate us . 
   india for one in no way endangers the middle class with cheap labor & in no way poses a risk with loose regulations . 
   who said said i support a fta with india ? 
  and you speak about it as if we had already signed the agreement , yet we have n't . 
  sorry , but it 's different . 
  in europe , we share a ( more or less ) common approach to economics and politics , so it makes sense that the european union was born . 
  however , i do n't think we need powerful american lobbyists buzzing around here at the moment . 
  corporations are strong enough already and if this is not going to benefit the middle class in any way , i do n't think there 's a reason for this agreement to be brought forth .

  it 's not like you have to pay more for the bonds that you 've already issued , that contract is signed and sealed . 
  and paying the existing bonds should be part of your current budget so if you use borrowing to get back to a balanced budget , then no , future price rises do not affect it . 
  but it 's going down because of the economic recovery , so by forcing lowered spending you are hurting the recovery that is lowering the deficit already . 
  all for what exact objective , i ca n't really tell . 
  spain has always had pretty solid public finances . 
  ( the bailout was for bank recapitalization and the crisis was mostly private debt ), 
  `` here , i 'll sell you x product for 50 % off '' `` no thanks , it will be more expensive in the future '', 
  right , then it should be reevaluated . 
  but interest is not more right now , so we should n't pretend like it is . 
  that 's like saying i should n't ever take a great deal on something because it will cost more money again later . 
  the realities on the ground are that we still have a huge unemployment rate and the cost of borrowing is super low . 
  it would be ridiculous to lower the deficit by a huge amount and hurt the economic recovery when you can borrow for under 2 %, 
  i 'm guessing just primarily agriculture workers . 
  i know a few venezuelans in guadalajara that work in madrid , so that may be it . 
  what is the definition of foreign here ? 
  just not holding the citizenship of the country of residence ? 
  does it include naturalizations ? 
  the head it guy in my company is romanian . 
   to be honest , i ca n't find any real explanation to why romania is the second ( and sometimes first , depending on data ) foreign nationality . 
  it 's not that near to spain ( further than morocco at least ) and romanians do n't speak spanish , unlike latin americans . 
  learning spanish is fairly easy from romanian . 
  there are a lot in italy for the same reason . 
  being someone that works on engineering projects , that sounds very plausible to how the planning actually happens . 
  i do n't know what they want from edificio espa\u00f1a . 
  they have a foreign investment ready to convert a shameful monument to the crisis into luxury space and they 're more worried that the fa\u00e7ade wo n't be exactly the same . 
  i get it 'd emblematic but it 's not that historical and it 's always been private anyway . 
  it just seems like they 're against it because pp was for it even though it was a solid plan . 
  it does n't rest on the seafloor . 
  it 's just floating there , still . 
  but the flooded legs act as a massive keel . 
  i 'm so fucking glad i 'm in downstream . 
  that just looks terrifying . 
  and refineries tend to be somewhat near population centers . 
  si is not metric for example a kilometer is not an si unit nor is a gram . 
  i do n't know anywhere that has speed limits in m/s . 
  i think `` barleycorn-dick '' could be a wonderful term of affection . 
  fathoms are still used in measuring water depth . 
  hands are used in measuring horses . 
  in fact everything around horses is just weird . 
  in the uk , 1 gallon equals 10 pounds . 
  that 's pretty reasonable , too . 
  i do engineering and metric is n't some magical thing either for conversion . 
  maybe if everyone used si , but that is n't true . 
  oh you need to convert your flow rate from m ^ 3/h to l/s , just multiply by 16.7 . 
  your pressure is in kg/cm ^ 2 and you need it in kilopascals ? 
  just multiply by 98.1 . 
  things like this pop up all the time . 
  the current government seems to be fine gutting plans for private investment and then being shocked when those investors no longer want to keep investing once the cost/revenue structures are drastically changed . 
  see : edificio de espa\u00f1a and the whole fiasco around the vicente calder\u00f3n, 
  the plans just got vetoed . 
  the government wants to keep the private investment but says they should have less of the profitable parts of it . 
  and most of the zone is either train tracks or an open construction site as of right now . 
  comparing daily swings in overall gdp measurement is pretty ridiculous to top it out . 
  it 's a long term measurement . 
  i 'll give the argument from the madrid side . 
  i 'm agnostic about the existence of a referendum , but i do agree with madrid that a government must follow the laws as they are written . 
  not following the law because it 's convenient is a much more dangerous precedent . 
  catalonia agreed to the spanish constitution overwhelmingly ( iirc , it was like 90 % yes ) and without boycotts like what happened in the basque country . 
  that constitution prohibits a referendum . 
  if you want a referendum , you have to go change the constitution and the independence minded parties had plenty of opportunities to try and force the issue when they were needed to form governments in the past . 
  they 've never really pushed hard for a change in the underlying law and it probably would have been possible if worked for in a constructive manner . 
  in stead , the catalan government and mainstream spanish politicians have had disagreements since the financial crisis and they just go antagonizing each other and ruin any goodwill to hopefully actually get anything done and just leave the situation hopelessly fractured . 
  the 2:1 was unusually strong . 
  that was the fucked up environment around the property bubble and it seems everyone forgot how insane oil was in 2008 , too because it crashed so hard after lehman collapsed . 
   why is that the european markets have fallen more then ? 
  when you value all of them in usd , ftse is pretty much in line with the rest of the european major markets . 
  i just do n't get it . 
  inflation would be good for them , too since they are exporters . 
  yes there are times when inflationary policy is a major problem , but that does n't make it universally true . 
  it 's like saying that turning right on a left curve made you crash once so you should always turn left regardless of the circumstances . 
  ( not trying to make a left/right political point there ), 
  i 've never been to austria , but in germany and netherlands ( accepting cards ) is not the same thing as accepting visa/mastercard . 
  it 's often just maestro which we do n't have . 
  yes because the choice is between 0 % inflation with deflationary pressures and completely debasing the currency . 
  a healthy currency should be 2-4 % inflation . 
  well the language is called catalan . 
  also they may not speak it in barcelona . 
  if they did they 'd be flattered but then think it 's weird you speak catalan but not spanish . 
  ge has a pretty big presence in shannon . 
   and not full of all the hate towards hipsters and startups that berlin is full of barcelona seems to have gotten pretty hostile toward foreigners recently . 
  you 'll see plenty of `` tourist go home '' graffiti around . 
  and yeah , you 'll end up in that group even if you live there so long as you do n't speak at least basic spanish . 
  well , at least in spain , part of the requirement is to have health insurance . 
  so they are contributing even by using health care . 
  right , it 's designed to increase inflation through increasing the velocity . 
  but it 's not `` printing money '' . 
  i just find that to be a really pernicious oversimplification of what the whole program is since it leads to a lot of public misunderstanding and anger over the policy . 
  but schengen has exit controls . 
  if they are going to try and cross illegally , the current agreement does n't change much , then . 
  just a nitpick because it 's a pretty nasty misconception . 
  qe is not printing money . 
  it 's just moving future liquidity to the present but does n't fundamentally change asset values that are out there . 
  i do n't know a single eu country that does n't have a visa like that . 
  it would be ridiculous not to , you basically get people that spend money earned elsewhere in your country . 
   it is anything but `` real '' . 
  this is speculative value . 
  well no shit . 
  the whole damned thing is speculative based on buying and selling in the market until any of the stocks actually goes for an m&a or tries to delist itself to declare its value . 
  you ca n't just say the currency is speculative but the equities are somehow more `` real '' . 
  they all reflect the emergent price points people are willing to buy and sell at .

  i think there 's been a shift in opinion about eastern europe in spain in these past years . 
  eastern europe used to be mostly ignored except for `` being the place where some immigrants came from '' . 
  there was a generally good view of eastern europeans ( save for the roma ) , which were considered hard workers and people that adapt well , but if you asked a random person in the street whether [ random eastern european country ] is in the eu or something about it , you would get mostly blank stares . 
  nowadays however , there 's been a rise in tourism towards the east , both from erasmus students and because the lowering of purchasing power due to our economy made eastern europe an attractive tourist destination - pretty much any place in europe implies higher prices than at home for spaniards . 
  and practically all people that go there return with a very improved opinion of eastern europe , recommending the trip and wanting to go back . 
  there are still some important points of clash though ; spaniards tend to strongly dislike the east 's lack of lgtb acceptance and similar comparatively conservative ideology . 
  it 's amazing how technology is making opening signs fall out of fashion . 
  i find it weird when i see them , since it 's only seen in books or written press , and the latter tend to not feature a lot of questions . 
  i do n't know anyone that uses opening marks for texting or social networks , and even in emails it 's becoming more and more rare . 
  on a related note , you guys are weird for using those quote marks that start at the bottom . 
  usually kitchens are near a large window or balcony , which is where you 'd usually hang your clothes to dry ... it would be very weird to hang them from the bathroom , since they usually have small windows if any . 
  i 'd imagine that it 's different in countries where it 's too cold or humid to hang clothes outside , where you 'd either hang them over the bathtub or use a dryer , but here it is really common due to the amount of sunlight . 
   well that 's it , but maybe it 's stronger/worse in andalusia where i was , or maybe people just liked to exaggerate this custom for the foreigner . 
  keep in mind that andalucia is basically spain 's spain ... so spain squared haha, 
  what about la meglio giuventu ? 
  people have recommended it dozens of time to me yet i ca n't find a good copy ... 
  in spanish it 's suecia , which is annoying because switzerland is suiza . 
  most kids mix both countries as a result . 
  austria rolls off the tongue far easier than `` easter kingdom '' though . 
  in spain we call you `` paises bajos '' ( literally `` low countries '' ) . 
  i 'm not gon na lie though , most people just go for holanda . 
  finlandia sounds really cool in spanish , since `` fin '' is spanish for `` end '' . 
  that plus the weather gives us a mental picture of `` going north till the end of the world '' . 
  i absolutely trust them for protection and dealing with crime . 
  however , there have been cases where local police becomes way too `` trigger happy '' enforcing rules that result in fines ( speeding , public alcohol consumption , etc ) due to pressures to collect more money . 
  riot police is also an exception , they can abuse their power and/or use non-lethal weapons in illegal ways that make them more harmful than they should ( usual example being shooting rubber ball guns in close range , when they 're supposed to be pointed to the floor so the balls bounce towards the mob ) . 
  ah , my bad , i read it a different way . 
   at home , the usage , being higher than spanish , is shown at 20,8 % ( 21,8 % in 1991 ) . 
  i do n't understand that part . 
  if euskera accounts for ~ 21 % and spanish is less than that , what 's the other ~ 60 ? 
  yeah , most of the time you see it here is among latin american immigrants as well . 
  murcia is lately becoming the butt of all jokes , as a backwards and shitty place . 
  el mundo today , which is our version of the onion , frequently features articles such as : - [ horror and unease in murcia due to the first sight of a red-haired girl - local police try to chase away the `` fire woman '' using sticks . ] ( http://www . ), 
  - [ murcia 's mobile world concress announces fire ] ( http://www.elmundotoday.com/2017/03/el-mobile-world-congress-de-murcia-presenta-el-fuego/ ) - [ murcian parents find out that his son has been sponsored by a norwegian family ] ( http://www.elmundotoday.com/2016/12/unos-padres-de-murcia-descubren-que-su-hijo-esta-apadrinado-por-una-familia-noruega/ ) - [ uber moves out of murcia because their donkey refuses to carry people ] ( http://www.elmundotoday.com/2017/01/uber-abandona-murcia-porque-el-mulo-se-niega-a-llevar-a-nadie/ ) - [ spain tries to transfer murcia to the uk pretending it 's gibraltar ] ( http://www.elmundotoday.com/2017/04/espana-intenta-ceder-murcia-a-reino-unido-haciendola-pasar-por-gibraltar/ ), 
  english names are trashy , but there 's something way worse : english names written in spanish spelling/pronunciation . 
  in one of the schools where i studied , there was a south american girl called leidiyoana ( from lady johanna ) . 
  you ca n't go much lower than that . 
  another big no no are names that are clear references to famous people - cristiano after the football player , for example . 
  also , not exactly a name in itself , but if someone is referred to as name ( or diminutive ) with an article , you can be sure it 's trashy . 
  - `` maria '' or `` roberto '' -  fine - `` la mari '' or `` el rober '' --  brace yourself composition of long names points to a latin american background , meaning the person or their parents are very likely an immigrant . 
  things like `` israel alexander '' or `` roberto alejandro '' . 
  native spaniards usually have a single word name , with some specific exceptions ( `` jose + something '' or `` maria + something '' are usual ) . 
  single long unusual names `` cipriano , hermenegildo '' point very clearly to a rural background - not necessarily trashy though . 
  as far as i know , everything national level is located in madrid . 
  it makes sense after all , since the city 's reason to exist is to be the capital - its in the geographical center of the country and all major roads/highways start there . 
  however , some areas of government are heavily decentralized ( education , public health , etc. ), 
  so it is n't a big deal . 
  for what 's worth , my friends living in berlin pay the same i pay in madrid , which makes the rent really cheap in comparison ( since the average salary is way higher there ) . 
  it is however extremely hard for them to find a room/apartment to rent , but once they get it , it is n't crazy expensive . 
  that 's a good point although for some reason , it is not common to think about charles ' v kingdom as * our territory * . 
  it is thought of more as if we just happened to share a king for some time with the holy roman empire . 
  at the time of his crowning he did n't even speak castillian , trusted more his advisors from the netherlands than natives , and he is thought to have used his titles over spain just to be able to bribe his way into his position of emperor of the holy roman empire , which was his actual focus . 
  france has 67 million people , of which 64 live in europe . 
  for comparison , just mexico alone has twice the population of spain . 
  european spaniards would be a very clear minority if we got back practically everything south of the us ( minus brazil ) . 
  that 's a tough one . 
  i certainly would n't mind having for example cuba as part of spain - we 're really similar culturally - but i it is hard to imagine the system working when there 's an ocean in between . 
  the whole empire would be overkill though - with as much american territories our connection to europe would have been diminished , which i would n't like . 
  i know , it 's all the time the same conversation ... - where are you from ? 
  - madrid - yeah no but where are you from ? 
  - ... madrid - ( sigh ) i mean your parents , where ? 
  - madrid , i told you !, 
   i 've lived in madrid 25 years of my life , and i have only heard of one person who said her parents ( and a grandma ) were both from the city . 
  i 'm a third generation madrillian , and it 's a shitty childhood . 
  every single summer all my friends went to their town and i staid to fry under august 's sun :(, 
  the spanish newspaper el pais uses a weird style guide where they try to make some words happen ( either because they 're accepted by the royal spanish academy or because they think it 's best ) , and it always makes your eyes bleed . 
  for example , they try to make `` ucranio '' happen for ucranian ( the usual word is `` ucraniano '' , so it would be like using `` ucran '' in english instead ) . 
  the worst offender is `` gai/gais '' for gay people , which does n't make any sense because it is pronounced like the english `` guy '' , when every single spaniard under 60 years old pronounces `` gay '' the same way as english speakers ; even if they wanted to adapt it to spanish fonetics it would have to be guei - which looks just as horrible anyway . 
  another example that comes to mind is that the royal spanish academy accepted `` amigovio '' ( combination of amigo + novio , friend + boyfriend ) , when people never use that , they use follamigo instead ( fuck + friend , the equivalent of fuck buddy ) . 
  i was surprised by vigo because i found it quite pleasant , yet all locals kept telling me how ugly it is ... 
  i think there 's some inferiority complex going on there ( walking uphill constantly is annoying though ) . 
  not legal to fire someone based on their beliefs , afaik , as it would constitute discrimination . 
  i 've had far left coworkers . 
  not stalin supporters , but ideological communists/anarchists and so on . 
  no big deal , just some banter from time to time and they were the ones people asked for help when they had any sort of conflict with the company since they made sure to know their rights quite well ( contracts , agreements with unions , laboral law , etc ) . 
  fascists , racial supremacists , etc. 
  would probably be different . 
  not because of their opinions themselves , but it would probably end up causing conflicts - if a person for example refuses to work with a coworker or is dismissive/aggressive to him because he 's black , he 'll be out of a job in seconds . 
  that 's a good point . 
  throwing money at a problem wo n't solve it unless you have a way to guarantee that the money is reaching the right places . 
  and if you need to be strictly monitoring the process , at that poin you might as well do it yourself . 
   i do n't see a similar incentive in africa , except maybe a future power struggle with china , who are becoming increasingly active ithere as well . 
  i think the political component would be `` if africa is not fucked up , they do n't try to emigrate to europe '' . 
  - kissing on cheeks : every time when women are involved ( that 's to say , male-female or female-female encounters ) . 
  i 'd say it 's more common between strangers than between friends , since it 's part of the ritual of introducing people ( here 's john , here 's mary [ they kiss ] ) . 
  between friends it can sometimes be dropped . 
  * sometimes * switched for handshakes in business contexts , but even there it is common . 
  - kissing cheeks is also common ( although a little less so ) for children and between males in the family . 
  - hugging : absolutely common between friends ( both genders ) , never strangers . 
  a hug is a purely personal/emotional gesture , never done out of politeness . 
  keep in mind that you 're not just talking to europeans , you 're talking to european * redditors * . 
  while it is true that talking with random people is n't common here , the idea might not be perceived as negatively by all europeans . 
  every time i go to a small city or town i end up talking with old people in bus stops or queues that start telling you their life story ( although , to be fair , spaniards are more open than northern europeans ) . 
  in large cities it ends up being rude simply because you cross your paths with thousand of people every day . 
   do europeans not make friends acquaintances that way ? 
  sometimes , but only in specific events . 
  it would be fine in a concert , or in a football stadium , or in a night club - perhaps even in the gym or in a specialized shop like a niche bookstore . 
  places where a common hobby and/or will to socialize are implied , so it makes sense that you would talk to people that share your interests . 
  in the street or a bus stop , however , it does n't make sense to us - the line of thought would be * you do n't know anything about me to suggest we 've got things in common , so what leads you to believe we should establish a connection ? 
  in madrid at least there is a police office in the airport for emergency renovation of id/passport ( for locals ) .

  yeah , there 's already been years sunk into the ttip by the us and the uk 's departure means a lot of the negotiations are changing so it will probably take another couple of years . 
  you can bet the us wo n't even start until the ttip framework is figured out . 
  but the point is nobody is going to want to negotiate with the uk until they have their eu deal done since it 's by far the most important . 
  and the eu deal ca n't be started until the uk leaves the eu . 
  also , since it 's by far the most important , the uk is going to want nearly all of the civil service capacity working on that one . 
  i do n't think it will take 10 years , because everyone 's going to be working triple time to make it work , but it could be 3 years or so . 
  so you 're talking around 2021 before the uk can start the multi-year process of negotiating more trade agreements . 
  i assure you there are plenty of non-british european companies that are interested in whatever expansion plans you have . 
  oh , i know ... i 'm very liberal myself ( not quite sure how that goes between neo and classical , but whatever ) . 
  does n't mean things are managed well . 
  from the left or the right , the greek crisis was handled terribly . 
  a banking union is really sorely needed , as another example . 
  there 's no reason you ca n't be pro-eu but critical of it at the same time . 
  i consider myself in that camp . 
  it 's by far the best alternative out there , but we should constantly be working to better the institutions which as of right now are quite flawed . 
   before we joined , uk economic growth was slower that france and germany . 
  after we joined , economic growth has been faster than france and germany . 
  yeah , that 's what i did n't understand when the leave campaign kept saying the uk did fine before the eu . 
  just ... no it did n't . 
  seriously , all anyone had to do was mention the imf loan and the 70s in general to counter that . 
  the uk was a broken country . 
  and i love portugal . 
  so much food and you just speak with an absurd accent and everyone understands ( i do n't understand anything back , though ), 
  you 've spent too much time fraternizing with the english . 
  we only just hit 100 % of gdp and had lowered our debt load massively prior to the crisis . 
  also , spain never took a sovereign bailout . 
  the only eu help we got was to recapitalize the banks . 
  that was a clusterfuck , but the big problem in spain was always private debt , not public financing . 
  blame reuters , not rajoy . 
  rajoy does n't speak english and the statement was in spanish . 
   scotland will be welcome without long and tedious process . 
  this is the eu you 're talking about , right ? 
  it 's translated from * competencia * which is much clearer in spanish . 
  you sure they 're not going to be itching to keep out the english ? 
  it 's a major financial center with a large population . 
  dublin will do very well and punch above its weight , but there 's more people in just the madrid area than all of ireland . 
  because uefa and fifa have nothing to do with government . 
  ( thankfully ) at the olympics it 's a uk team , for example . 
  ( not that the ioc has anything to do with government either ), 
  why is having a land border an issue for having schengen or not ? 
  there 's plenty of schengen land borders . 
   spain had no problem with scotland staying in the eu whoa whoa ... nobody say anything about * staying * . 
  that would imply existing membership . 
  i think scotland would be welcomed as a new member , but i do n't know if it 's as clear-cut as an existing memory . 
   i think it 's a quite reasonable position of rajoy , maybe not very diplomatic though . 
  i think it might be a translation issue . 
  * competencia * in spanish is used just to mean the legal authority in this case . 
  while that version of competence exists in english , it 's a bit more esoteric . 
  he is not calling the scottish government incompetent , just that they have no authority to be negotiating international agreements . 
   and if you leave the eu , wether because your country leaves or because you leave your country who is an eu member , you have to apply and start from 0 . 
  i agree whole-heartedly . 
  they are likely to be in very quickly as the laws are already eu compliant , but there are other issues such as new versus existing member and it would be likely that scotland would be obligated to join the euro and schengen , for example . 
  nobody wants to prevent it . 
  but i agree with the position . 
  the ability to negotiate international treaties lies with the government of the nation-state . 
  not a nation-state , then no negotiation because there is no legal framework by why the state is established in the first place to start with . 
  basically each autonomy negotiates it 's relationship to the central state individually . 
  well , they can avoid the euro for the time being by just pulling a sweden and avoiding erm ii . 
  i imagine at some future point they will start getting serious about enforcing that obligation , though . 
  schengen probably will happen , though . 
  something something german cars . 
  ( let 's just ignore how the uk is also a major auto exporter ), 
  kumquat kingdom ? 
  that was the whole point , have the people that have great success with the university system pay them back in full to help subsidize everyone else . 
  most average people will get some form of forgiveness and now the universities are much more independent from the government for depending on their funding . 
  the payback terms are also very reasonable . 
  but the numbers are shockingly large , so people get upset when they see actual costs but i think they did well with the financing system . 
  norway also has the eea and joining the eea would be a blow in the face of democracy after the campaign that leave ran citing requirements to follow eu regulation , eu immigration , and paying for structural funds as the primary reasons for wanting out . 
  well , you still have all of those things with a norway deal . 
  yeah , i had n't even thought what the hell astrazeneca is going to do . 
  i 'm in oil and shell is in a fuck of a spot , too for their corporate organization . 
  after falling 15 cents . 
  so my point still stands . 
  again , we also have no idea this is real . 
  anyone who played the game shorting is going to want out to cash out and that puts upward pressure of stuff , too . 
  the pound is n't anywhere near recovering . 
  and while the ftse is back to almost what it was before , you have to remember that it 's the value in sterling . 
  so if you factor in the change in the underlying currency , you 're still talking close to 10 % real losses . 
  and who knows if this is real or just short covering from everyone that wants to cash out on their winning bets . 
   the european medicines agency i wonder where they will move to ? 
  i would n't be shocked if it 's dublin given the amount of pharma in ireland . 
   with time and some experience , the uk will probably be able to handle two or three of them in parallel . 
  and an easy one will take 5 years to complete . 
  so probably assume an average length of negotiation of 7 years or so . 
  the eu one will be so important that they will be 100 % focused on that meaning no other agreement gets negotiated . 
  hell , just look at air travel . 
  even in the best case of going back to the previous iteration is [ bermuda ii ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bermuda_ii_agreement ) hope you do n't like flying delta to heathrow or norwegian to gatwick since those are going away . 
  i think borrowing will go up if you are borrowing in gbp but will go down in other stable currencies ( eur included ), 
  i 've said that leaving makes sense if you 're a fisherman . 
  that 's why iceland would be crazy to join the eu and norway , too to a lesser extent because fishing is a big part of their economies . 
  so yes , i understand that uk fisherman would vote overwhelmingly toward leave . 
  that said , i just ca n't fathom taking their needs as all that important in a massive and diverse economy like the uk . 
  ryan just says things to make obama look bad . 
  the legislature basically has no power in negotiating this sort of thing . 
  aiui , the issue was basically that the uk would auction off licenses for quotas and due to eu laws , could n't discriminate against nationality . 
  so lower cost galician fishermen would just undercut the uk fisherman . 
  i 'm fine with that , that 's how a single-market works , after all . 
  but it was n't just the quotas in the first place . 
   militarily the uk will remain the special relationship , but economically the uk wo n't really matter to the us much . 
  they are going to have to make huge military cuts and nobody has even really talked about what will happen with the uk 's nukes .

  but his letters to king philip are fun . 
  well , the people who started podemos : iglesias , errejon , monedero ... all of them were militants of iu . 
  in fact they were electoral counselors of the party during the elections of 2011 . 
  they have argued that the old communist farts did n't follow their suggestions and got mad when those celebrated getting 11 seats during one of the worst economic crisis . 
  they thought that the conditions were ideal for their message and that outcome was awful . 
  a bit later , iglesias started assisting to political tv shows ( yes that 's a genre now ) and started gaining momentum thanks to his combative discourse . 
  they created a new party , podemos , to see where they could get ... and the rest is history . 
  does this answer to your question ? 
  qu\u00e9 tendr\u00e1n que ver los cojones con comer trigo ... * ca n't think of two things more unrelated ... *, 
   i hope they unite i hope it too ... but for the drama only . 
  android in quotes is what you call to anything based on aosp . 
  fine , but misses the point . 
   except you know , amazon . 
  and all those chinese oems . 
  what ?? 
  fyi amazon calls its operating system fireos , and does n't use any official android artwork . 
  it 's not android ( tm ) . 
  it 's `` android '' under your own personal definition . 
  but , more importantly than diving into technicalities , i do n't understand which point are you trying to make by accussing me of fud , no less . 
  the google apps , including google play services , are an integral part of the user experience of an android device and are n't open source . 
  that 's what i wanted to say . 
  nothing more , nothing less . 
   which are not part of android . 
  please do n't spread fud . 
  acting outraged does n't make you right . 
  android ( tm ) devices do include them . 
  as you can read in the news , google forces the manufacturers to include their apps and services or you ca n't use the android trademark . 
  [ citing the wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/android_%28operating_system%29#licensing ) : * only the base android operating system ( including some applications ) is open-source software , whereas most android devices ship with a substantial amount of proprietary software , such as google mobile services , which includes applications such as google play store , google search , and google play services -- a software layer that provides apis for the integration with google-provided services , among others . 
  these applications must be licensed from google by device makers , and can only be shipped on devices which meet its compatibility guidelines and other requirements . 
   can they stay in the eu and keep the euro ? 
  if yes , many other regions might say `` me too ! '', 
  of course , that 's the whole point behind recent events . 
  without the eu probably we would n't be in this situation . 
  catalonia have historically benefited of having access to the big spanish market , which outperformed in productivity and in which could sell on without tariffs , with the same currency , etc. . ( does this remind you of something ? ) . 
  it also got a huge part its workforce when it needed from poorer parts of spain , mainly andalousia . 
  ** but ** , and it 's a big one , has had to return some of that in form of fiscal transfers . 
  too much or not enough is another debate . 
  what we have now ? 
  a unified market , free of movement ... without real fiscal transfers ( cohesion funds are n't the same ) . 
  they do n't need to the rest of spain anymore , as milan does n't need naples and bavaria and does n't need ... idk ... turingia ? 
  if they had got their independence , let 's say , 60 years ago . 
  things would have been very different . 
  the peseta would have been weaker than their currency and other parts of spain would have taken partially the role of current barcelona ( probably valencia ) . 
  that 's the saying but we obviously do n't . 
  basque country and navarre maintain their fiscal autonomy because franco kept that going on in alava in navarre ; he had to pay to the carlist who supported them in some way . 
  then the democracy had no other option than to return that right to the * traitor provinces * vizcaya and guipozcoa . 
  and not all regions have developed equally their statues , so no . 
  and the criteria to designate the `` historical regions '' is also tragicomic . 
  i do n't agree . 
  google has been critizised for pushing functionality out of the core os and including it in [ google play services ] ( http://www.androidcentral.com/google-play-services ) . 
  google 's argument is that component is updateable so devices get new functionalities without whole os updates , but at the same time lots of apps are reliant on api 's included in it , so it wo n't run in aosp based devices . 
  so i do n't understand the * portugal won '' . 
  what it did win ? 
  android itself is not open source . 
  there is a separate project called aosp ( android open source project ) which does n't include some parts like the google apps and some internal services . 
  a manufacturer who wishes to distribute android ( the real thing and not something based in aosp ) must agree to google licensing terms which is what the eu is analyzing to see if it hinders competition . 
  sorry , but that makes no sense . 
  portugal before the restoration war was another kingdom at the level of aragon or castile under the rule of the habsurg dinasty . 
  makes no sense to say `` portugal was united and spain was n't '' . 
  that 's a conception which may be valid for the modern states of spain and portugal but not in the 1600 's . 
  edit : to clarify what i mean , i refer to this wikipedia entry : [ habsburg spain ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/habsburg_spain ) * `` spain '' or `` the spains '' in this period covered the entire peninsula , politically a confederacy comprising several , nominally independent kingdoms in personal union : aragon , castile , le\u00f3n , navarre and , from 1580 , portugal . 
  in some cases , these individual kingdoms themselves were confederations , most notably , the crown of aragon ( principality of catalonia , kingdom of aragon , kingdom of valencia , and the kingdom of majorca ) . 
  i do n't know about the siesta , but yes we are all definitely hot ;-), 
  is used as a political weapon pretty frequently . 
  strangely is more an issue nowadays than in the 90 's and first 00 's . 
  the sucession war was n't a civil war ? 
  but the point is our civil war was n't due to territorial issues ( mostly ) . 
  you just ca n't put a line to divide one side and the other . 
  honestly , despite been a teenager where the crime happened , i never paid much attention to the thing , so i do n't know what the alternative theories are , and how much credibility deserve . 
  the thing is a bit more complex . 
  there was a late night tv show , which somehow became centered in this crime . 
  one of the fathers of the victims appeared on it almost every night questioning the official version of the crime . 
  the program was called `` esta noche cruzamos el missisipi '' ( in english `` this night we cross the missisipi '' ) . 
  [ traslating from the wikipedia page ] ( https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/esta_noche_cruzamos_el_mississippi ) * fernando garcia , father of one the assasinated girls , and the criminalist juan ignacio blanco , signaled to several relevant politicians and bussinesmen as being part of a network dedicated to the production of snuff movies linked to this crime * . 
  pretty gruesome stuff . 
  the coup attempted the 23rd february of 1981 is one of the most persistent ones . 
  some civil guards took the parliament while were awaiting to some high rank officer who they refered to by the codename * white elephant * . 
  the identity of this officer was attributed to general armada who had been the king 's mentor , but commandant tejero never admited it and it was speculed that the very own [ king juan carlos was the * white elephant * ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/feb/17/books.booksnews ) . 
  i do n't think he ordered and organized the coup but it 's not unthinkable that he waited to know what was the real force of the insurgents before appearing in tv claiming his opposition to them . 
  it 's a structural issue . 
  bear in mind that even at it best moment unemployment was at 9 % , and has averaged around 15 % since the eighties iirc . 
  the causes . 
  depends who you ask , but there is some agreement in that spanish economy is oriented to low-skilled activities like building and hospitality ; the share of smb 's and freelancers is too high ; there is some abuse of temporary contracts , etc. . . 
   what are the prices like ? 
  what is the quality like ? 
  i 'm all in about discussing different regulations/legal frameworks regarding prostitution across europe , but i do n't think this consumer oriented approach fits here . 
  fortunately , until now most comments have focused in regulatory issues ... 
  hey , i 'm not taking a side . 
  as you see our interior ministry does n't agree . 
  ok , the auction was performed soon after a reform of the electric market and i assumed that was a novelty , which is was n't . 
  i still have my reserves about the ruling . 
  anyway , if true the fine is ridiculous , 25 millions is peanuts for such company . 
  a lie requires intention to deceive , so it might be false , because i do n't remember the well thing , but not a lie . 
  will check the facts later and concede if you are right . 
  afaik the ruling against iberdrola was n't still definitive , and imho a bit incredible that a single player can rig the whole thing . 
  thank you , i could n't find it . 
  i do n't know which kind of site is that , i was just searching for any source in english about this issue , which has been reported by spanish media. , and it fitted the bill . 
  that smells fishy ... 
  i do n't know , but those guys have pressed charges against all kind of politicians : left , right , nationalists ... and even against a princess !!, 
  they must have tons of enemies .

   i 'm not neoliberal , by the way . 
  but i believe there is not a liberal party in spain and in any other mediterranian eu country , and that 's part of the problem . 
  `` i 'm not racist but ... '' do n't worry , i trust you . 
  however as i said we are in spain and we need to think who would apply liberal measures here ( we have rajoy and montoro , not merkel and schauble ) , so we do n't end up in feudalism again . 
   that 's what i was talking about . 
  three sovereign states with 20 million people is a very low population rate . 
  it simplifies the system . 
  spain more than doubles that , so i believe that huge advantage is not possible here . 
  that 's only a problem because of unemployment rates , with lower ones it works even better . 
  do you remember how spain was reducing its deficit/debt during the boom ? 
  then it was sustainable and profitable because working people with decent salaries spend ( and latins a lot ) and pay taxes . 
  some pensions are indeed a problem , like early retired people with miner , shipyards or military pensions ( +2 k/mth ) . 
   i think welfare state is an imperative way of live both in spain and in the european union . 
  but i must say some things in the spanish system have been done wrong . 
  same as in italian , portuguese and greek . 
  i would support a rationalization of our welfare state and a deregularization of labor market . 
  that is as efficient as unpopular , i 'm afraid ... that 's unpopular because it 's proven wrong so far , it might work in another countries ( i doubt it though ) but not in spain . 
  you ca n't blame our unemployment rates on the labour market regulations being too rigid , when basically every single company do n't follow them . 
  union agreements ? 
  they are basically wet paper since the 2010 labour market reform , and i doubt i need to tell you about how fraudulent it 's to renew temporary contracts repeatedly or false freelancers contracting practises . 
  what did our governments do wrong ? 
  well , maybe killing entire sectors of the labour market like renewable energies , or basically allowing energy prices to strangle most businesses economies . 
  how can anyone be charged 25 $ / month with 0.00 electrical consumption ? 
  or using eu funds/debt emissions to never reform our productive model , even though that 's been an elections slogan since i was a child . 
  sweden , norway and finland together amount for more than 20 million of people . 
  if you put it that way it does n't look `` sustainable just because of the size '' . 
  if they can have such welfare is because their taxes are better employed than in other countries , and their politicians do n't kill the internal demand slashing salaries . 
  of course , trying to attach unemployment problems when rates are ~ 7 % helps a lot in terms of sustainability of a welfare system . 
  spain on the welcome side ? 
  well , maybe some cities with left-wing majors . 
  but i really doubt spain with rajoy as pm wants to take any refugee ( even if he stated otherwise , which i really doubt ) . 
  he is more of the `` shoot them '' mentality . 
  but you are not talking about refugees . 
  whether those are all war refugees or not is another question . 
  some countries are basically saying `` quota my ass '' to the refugees , like if this was n't an eu problem . 
  thus my question to whom support this stance . 
  those who are accepted are to be sent to a country in the eu , so we still require quotas . 
  border countries or germany ca n't take them all . 
  yeah , better do nothing and pretend they are not there , or waiting for a pure entity to solve the day . 
  that has worked wonderfully so far . 
  please , i have asked a serious question . 
  i agree all this is unfair to schengen citizens and legal migrants , but taking some of them back to those camps can be quite difficult because the lack of id 's . 
  and what if they came from a now isis zone ? 
  fair enough , any proposal ? 
  but they are already in , thus my question of what to do ** now ** . 
  and you ca n't solve a problem of starvation by saying `` do n't starve '' . 
  i ask for a real solution . 
  i throw a legit and serious question to some in r/europe . 
  why are you against refugee 's quota ? 
  i know it does n't solve the root of the problem or anything in the long term , ** but something must be done now ** . 
  the problem is you can not simply ride them to morocco and dump them because many of them are from other countries , or do n't carry id . 
  unless you take a different approach : morocco did n't do a thing to stop them , so here you have all of them back . 
  but it 's not like spain has a past of facing morocco regime . 
  go to syria with a global sane-countries alliance and force them to live in a civilized way . 
  there 's no other way . 
  leaving them to their own devices does n't work . 
  there 's no tradition of democracy there . 
  developed countries must colonize these lands again and enforce order . 
  then maybe after 2 centuries they 'll be capable of handling freedom . 
  that has worked wonderfully in this and the previous centuries . 
  this will keep happening as long as there are 1st and 2nd class countries in the eu . 
  and abolishing schengen for countries in the borders ( as it is suggested ) will backfire big time , no matter how big is the wall you build , it wo n't stop them . 
  so instead of throwing euros to border countries and scream `` do your job to stop them from going to my country '' or dublin ii bullshit they should think of a real solution in common . 
  not supporting rebellions ( syria ) or looting ( congo ) in their country of origin would be a good start . 
  funny , i met an old friend yesterday who is working in cardiff . 
  he came to spain on vacations , and our plan for tonight is probably like yours . 
  u/andy18cruz you 've heard the crowd . 
  surrender !, 
  it 's funny to see the same news every couple of weeks , always with a different country each time . 
  never ... ... unless you give some * francesinhas * in return . 
  i had lost faith in the german redditors after the greek negotiations , but the comments in this one and other immigration threads has made me recover it . 
  charging people for crimes they have n't done just because you think they eventually would works much worse . 
  isis and other extremists groups can live thanks to that hate speech . 
   i do n't quite get your argument because hartz4 could be seen as a form of austerity . 
  that 's probably correct from a german point of view , with all due respect , provided your unemployment subsidies were higher then . 
  however , compare the hartz4 with the reforms the troika ask to countries like spain or greece in matters like unemployment subsidies , pensions and such . 
  i can summarise them quickly : 1 . 
  wage depression to improve competitiveness ( who said produce high value goods ? ) . 
  some even ask for the total removal of the minimum salary ( ~ 670 $ / month , ~ 4.19 $ / h ) . 
  cut down unemployment subsidies , which are to put it simply , 50 % of your previous income with a maximum of 1084 $ and 24 months . 
  lower minimum pensions or even their removal . 
  we are talking about less than 400 $ / month . 
  nothing to say about early retired with 2k + pensions ( miners , military , ... ) . 
  cheaper sacking costs . 
  funny , because right now it 's literally free in the first 6 months . 
  guess what , the median contract in spain lasts exactly that . 
  in none of these cases people are entitled any kind of help to pay the bills , accommodation or the likes . 
  all those reforms are directed to destroy an already dying part of our society , not helping them . 
  more than 2 million of our unemployed do n't have any kind of income . 
  zero . 
  believe it or not , but such thing as the hartz4 in spain or greece would be seen as miraculous . 
  ps : i used data from my country ( spain ) . 
  for me there is a huge difference between formation offered and what the job market demands . 
  : why having so much nursery schools ( or available vacancies in each one ) when we are literally exporting them to norway , uk and such ? 
  why not temporarily reduce their number so less graduate each year to adapt to demand ? 
  and this can probably be applied to almost every sector or level of education . 
  that 's endemic in spain . 
  being registered for 4h/day and work 8h is just the norm in most of the services sector . 
  and there is literally zero effort from the government to stop that for obvious reasons ( better unemployment data and less social tension ) . 
   the 20 + % unemployment is not as high in reality - otherwise we would be in a very delicated problem with crime figures rising over the board ( it 's on a record low ) , or in a revolutionary status ( politics are changing which is very good but not getting out of hand ... we did n't get neo-nazis here for example ) .

  it is often difficult to determine which language is considered the local language of a particular city . 
  catalonia has autonomy on the paper , but it is actually useless because the spanish government , parliament and judiciary systematically overrule any catalan law that they do not like . 
  the most beautiful * mones * include chocolate models of houses , boats , animals , people , etc. 
  what about the european free alliance ? 
  if the package says `` gouda cheese '' and it is not from gouda you are misleading the consumers , just like a package saying `` chicago peas '' containing peas from turkey that have never been to chicago would be misleading . 
  camembert , brie , parmesan , champagne , rochefort , cognac , scotch , ... these are the geographic names , not the generic terms !, 
  they are known towns and regions in europe just like michigan is a known american region . 
  your initial point was that valencian people have never been catalan `` at any point in history '' and that is false because of their ethnical background . 
  following your example , english people were saxons during the 7th-11th centuries until isolation and the merger with other cultures such as normans helped create a different identity . 
  similarly , at some point in the 13th century , valencians were catalan no different from those that settled in tortosa , until the governance by a different legislature and the contact with other cultures helped develop an own identity . 
  if i understood correctly this woman is just the lawyer of some eta members . 
  there is a question on scottish independence but not about catalan independence ? 
  :-( also separatist is not in the list and nationalist does not mean the same ... 
  who let them use the internets ??!, 
  probably the intention is to prosecute separatist demonstrations . 
  many slogans used by those of us who want to split spain may be interpreted as offensive to the country . 
  catalonia has no self-government in practice . 
  all the laws passed by the catalan parliament can be easily overturned by the spanish parliament . 
  all attempts to protect the catalan self-government have proved futile , so the only way to secure it is by seceding from spain . 
  i know that such a separation would be traumatic , but it is still preferable to the prospect of losing the catalan self-government , because that would inevitably result in the extinction of the catalan culture and language . 
  for most catalans , helping in the preservation of the catalan language is one of the main goals in life . 
  perhaps we can convince the spanish politicians saying that if they let catalonia secede , they will have more chances to host the olympics !, 
  this conflict may resume in a near future because the local french authorities mean to demolish the bridge that separates the puigcerd\u00e0-ll\u00edvia road with the french rn20 and merge them in a big roundabout . 
  the people in ll\u00edvia have already hanged some big posters all around the town to protest about it . 
  why do you compare tobacco and alcoholic beverages instead of some other more common goods ? 
  this is a terrible example . 
  who cares about this law ? 
  it is not important at all . 
  the plan e , the 400 $ , the policies in railroad and airport management , the military spending ... these are big fuck-ups . 
  wtf nobody told me of that and i am doing their job for free !, 
  * [ els segadors ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hfv993yefvu ) * is our national anthem . 
  the second most important patriotic song in catalonia is the * [ cant de la senyera ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ptlufmhuzm8 ) * , which most people agree that is much better in the musical sense . 
  the traditional catalan folkloric dance is the sardana , and the most famous and most patriotic sardana is * [ la santa espina ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xhlrguqpr80 ) * . 
  in times of economic crisis one must think about that one thousand bull fans from catalonia that are losing a lot of money when they need to travel all the way to valencia or saragossa to watch a bullfight . 
  some people ask why catalonia needs independence if it already has autonomy and this story is the reason . 
  autonomy is useless if the central parliament overturns every single catalan law that they do not like . 
  these situations are also common in many catalan towns . 
  for example , in the the town hall of gallifa ( [ pic ] ( http://images.ara.cat/politica/lajuntament-gallifa-senyera-lestelada-bandera_araima20130111_0104_1.jpg ) ) they have installed a 20 cm spanish flag ( you can see it very small under the letters ) while three flagpoles with the local flag , the catalan flag and the separatist flag are next to the building . 
  yes , even the image of a childless aunt/uncle is somewhat present in the popular culture . 
  probably this lack of social stigma explains the low fertility rate . 
  so basques deserve it and catalans do not ? 
  catalan-speaking regions . 
  for some people yes , they are a potential future territorial claim . 
  the only region that could be problematic is the [ aran valley ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/aran_valley ) . 
  if the results in there were significantly different they could probably argue for a referendum to rejoin spain/join france/become independent of their own . 
  however , since most catalan people do not give a shit about them i do not think that it would be a problem to relinquish the aran valley . 
  here you have the official text of the [ declaration of sovereignty ( in catalan ) ] ( http://www.parlament.cat/web/actualitat/noticies?p_format=d&amp;p_id=129656021 ) , and a non-official [ english translation ] ( http://www.vilaweb.cat/noticia/4076896/20130124/declaration-of-sovereignty-and-of-the-right-to-decide-of-the-catalan-nation.html ) . 
  the preamble is a bit shitty , you can skip that ... 
  btw , finally 15 socialist mp have voted against the declaration and 5 socialist mp have not voted at all . 
  this could spark a big internal crisis within the party . 
  tomorrow the catalan parliament is going to approve a sovereignty declaration and these days everyone was discussing whether the socialist party should vote for it/against it/abstain . 
  what about the 24 guys from / r/andorra then ? 
  from the middle age * [ tirant lo blanc ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tirant_lo_blanc ) * ( `` tirant the white '' ) by joanot martorell . 
  from the modern ages * [ la pla\u00e7a del diamant ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_time_of_the_doves ) * ( `` the time of the doves '' or `` the pigeon girl '' ) by merc\u00e8 rodoreda . 
  the most famous series from catalan tv right now is * [ polseres vermelles ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1698292/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1 ) * '' [ the red band society ] ( http://www.tv3.cat/sales/genres/1270/series/red-band-society ) '' ( [ w ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polseres_vermelles ) ) about some kids that live in a hospital . 
  it is not inappropriate to show your political bias , we all have one . 
  yes , there are people that think politicians now should be focused in defending class interests . 
  i think that the time has come to solve the national question once and for all . 
  obviously everyone has its own opinion on what is the best way to improve society . 
   are n't the political figures leading the independence movement also responsible for the crisis and guilty of mismanagement in the past ? 
  these are the disadvantages of a political system with proportional representation using closed lists . 
  you vote for the party with your ideology even if you dislike most of its candidates , because there is no way to alter them . 
  so yes , some of the independentist politicians have been repeatedly in the parliament or in the government during the last thirty years , but there are plenty of similar cases in most of the other parties as well , so this is not a reason not to embrace separatism . 
  we eat a * [ tortell ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tortell ) * which is very similar to this bolo-rei , but only for the 6th of january . 
  it has a hidden bean that implies you have to pay for the cake , but also a figurine and if you find it you are `` the king '' of the meal and have to wear a paper crown . 
  catalonia : christmas eve : nothing , religious people go to midnight mass . 
  christmas day : family lunch . 
  the first course is traditionally * [ escudella de galets i carn d'olla ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/escudella_i_carn_d%27olla ) * ( soup with christmas pasta and stew , [ pic ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/ba/escudella.jpg ) ) . 
  the second course is stuffed turkey or chicken or capon or sometimes veal . 
  for dessert we eat * [ torrons ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/turr%c3%b3n ) * and * [ neules ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/neula ) * . 
  after the lunch , the children beat the * [ ti\u00f3 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ti%c3%b3_de_nadal ) * ( christmas log ) with sticks and make him shit . 
  sometimes you make small children recite a christmas poem standing on a chair , or you make them sing christmas songs . 
  the next day , 26th december , is st. stephen 's day and there is a family lunch as well . 
  people eat * cannelloni * and all leftovers from the previous day . 
  i forgot to add that children get their presents on the 6th january , given by the three wise kings from the east . 
  this is the day that ends the holiday season and features a family lunch as well . 
  usually there is also a family lunch for the 1st january and a family supper for december 31 . 
  okay ;-) i am sure other people will also find it funny that you are actually catalan and polish :-d, 
   it seems to me the catalan demand for secession/independence has gained momentum from the economic crisis , how much would you agree with this ? 
  not really , the main reason for the current boost is the 2005-2006 negotiation of the catalan statute and the 2010 sentence of the constitutional court on that affair . 
  especially the way it was considered by the spanish media . 
  i guess an economic crisis means that people are generally a bit more interested in politics , but the criticism of our fiscal imbalance has been widely accepted by the catalan public for the last 20 years . 
  the feeling that all `` our '' proposals have been useless is what has driven most people into separatism . 
   do you think there is an element of selfishness that feeds the movement ? 
  yes , but i would rather call it `` not liking being ripped off '' . 
   by this i mean that surely disenfranchised catalans who are unemployed should feel they have more in common with striking miners and struggling galicians and castillians rather than their respective ruling class which arguably has not really felt the brunt of the economic crisis . 
  i guess so ... but why would they feel have more in common with struggling galicians than with striking greeks ? 
  many places in europe are in a tough situation . 
  i am not sure what you mean in here . 
   to what extent are you concerned with the way a catalan secession would affect the rest of spain ? 
  it will force them to change their unchangeable constitution and their inefficient government system , and i hope that they will move towards a more democratic and transparent system . 
  with the current discontentment towards politicians , taking a different path would create an unbearable situation of public unrest . 
   would you accept full federation as an alternative to independence ? 
  personally i would not , but a decent proposal would probably be supported by the majority of the catalan population . 
  however it would need to imply real power for catalonia and right now it seems impossible to get a proposal like that from the spanish government . 
  catalan polish ? 
  do you mean from the actual poland or are you simply a catalan ? 
  this flag is the standard catalan flag . 
  the flag of the independence movement includes a star ( like [ this ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:estelada_blava.svg ) or [ this ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:estelada_roja.svg ) ) , so the flair should not imply that , but yes i support independence . 
  i think it is likely to happen , as i have written above .

  [ en ] ( http://elpais.com/elpais/2014/05/16/inenglish/1400232016_588758.html ) * talks about our underground economy , due to things like this : * police in valencia enter a small , shabby workshop in the old quarter of callosa de segura , a small town in the south of alicante , a region traditionally known for shoemaking .

  [ en ] ( http://www.typicallyspanish.com/news-spain/national/the_national_police_have_arrested_740_people_in_their_largest_operation_against_fictitious_companies.shtml ), 
   i feel like that 's what the eu ( as in countries individually ) should focus on than - more wage equality . 
  we are moving in the opposite direction to increase our competitiveness . 
  [ this is the variation between 2008-2011 ] ( http://i.imgur.com/aa9kpfe.png ) by deciles . 
   have any countries outside estonia and maybe slovenia had an increase in the average wage ? 
  poland , slovakia and germany have been doing ok . maybe them ? 
  the actual salaries for unskilled jobs already out-do university degrees jobs in eu countries . 
  check some salaries [ unskilled retail job ] ( http://www.payscale.com/research/ch/industry=retail/salary ) , compare with [ skilled jobs in romania ] ( http://www.payscale.com/research/ro/country=romania/salary ) . 
  even taking care of purchasing power there are salaries in unskilled jobs in switzerland higher than what skilled jobs earn at part of the eu . 
  90 % of the workers earn more than the proposal in switzerland . 
  it would be a high minimum wage for their economy , but it would n't be so extreme as some people say . 
  when is the vote ? 
  i am tired of hearing about this without real resolution . 
  edit : tomorrow , and it 's at the link . 
  in my defense : this has been sent a dozen of times without the date i expected that would be an article without date like all the others . 
   berlusconi was a danger berlusconi is going to be a danger until the day of his death . 
  this elections are about national politics and the future of spain ( or if it has a future ) . 
  european policies are in second plane . 
  some of the new parties that have these elections as their first serious national elections do n't even mention eu affairs . 
  what about crosspost to / r/mapporn ? 
  edit : probably unneeded given the answers . 
  a polish has called compatriota a spaniard . 
   just adding a bertolli label to a bottle of virgin olive oil from greece and spain , doubles its price . 
  and that despite the fact that [ italy is a net importer of oil ] ( http://www.olivarsantamaria.com/?blog=6&amp;articulo=30 ) . 
  most of the olive oil sold in the eu is from spain usually . 
  i think that romania is n't being so relevant as the media portraits . 
  we may have had a report about that here already , i think that the more relevant sources inside the eu were ( sort of random order ) : * poland * spain * italy * lithuania * ireland * portugal, 
  you can see the list of jobs [ here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/25di5p/isabel_carrasco_a_top_female_politician_in_the/chgaewl ) . 
  it includes being an * advisor * of two real estate agencies and being in the assembly of the regional saving bank that loaned to the agencies . 
  i would n't frame it like that because we know that she was killed [ by a member of her party ] ( http://elpais.com/elpais/2014/05/13/inenglish/1399970219_342953.html )  the younger detainee , triana mart\u00ednez , who was a member of the le\u00f3n popular party , was included on the party 's slate for the municipal elections in astorga in 2007 , but was not elected as councilor . 
  that same year she began working in the provincial council of le\u00f3n as a telecommunications engineer , assessing councils on matters related to high-speed internet and digital terrestrial television . 
  the suspects are this woman and her mother . 
  she lost a job that she had provisionally for the province during 7 years , becasue the council finally had to make a normal procedure to hire somebody permanent for the job and the more qualified candidate got the job , that was n't she despite being a party member and doing the job provisionally until the entrance exams were celebrated ( with a delay of years ) . 
  and the father/husband of the family is also a high officer of the police with strings to the ruling party . 
  the family is sort of wealthy and well connected . 
  not exactly common people . 
  it seems like a revenge , but like the less apropiated revenge ever . 
  -- edit : a more valid revenge would have been by the relatives of an 85 years old man that died because the leon municipal firefighters got instructions of no operate outside the limits of the city because the province is n't paying the service . 
  the provincial council of leon has cut its firefighters because austerity , despite its resposible of the service in all the populations with less than 20,000 inhabitants ; and there are only two as big . 
  and it 's not even paying municipalities for the services that their firefighters have done since then .

  the regional saving bank was ruined with shady operations in real estate that had her support . 
  i think that her corruption is very likely . 
  that 's supported by the right in spain , and opposed by the united left . 
  we have strong family networks at spain . 
  my uncle 52 years old uncle is living with my grandparents and if/when they die he will probably move to live with my parents that are employed ( for now ) . 
  there is social unrest , of course , but the situation would have to become way worse to be serious . 
  i have said :  i have n't seen the underground economy growing , more like the opposite actually , like all the economy . 
  it maybe it 's my english , i am saying that all the economy tanked including the underground . 
  i have n't seen growth . 
  valencian here . 
  i am spaniard , and i have n't seen the underground economy growing , more like the opposite actually , like all the economy . 
  it was bigger 6 years ago . 
  edit : i know that it exists but fuck , it has been always there . 
  my grandmother made trouser illegally in dictatorship times . 
  with full-employment . 
  i also heard that explanation often . 
  the submerged economy exists , but it has a similar size or even smaller than 6 years ago . 
  all that illegal construction activity is n't here anymore . 
  the same problem as 6 years ago when we had 8 % of unemployment . 
  the underground economy is also depressed . 
  why is so fucking popular denying that there is unemployment in spain ? 
  can you back those statements ? 
  i am getting tired of the people that insist that in that there is n't real unemployment in spain . 
  it is not a problem that was a joke . 
  obvious problems of this submission , * op is lacking a flair ( i encourage you to get one ) * you should indicate that it 's in spanish and provide a translation or a link to google translate . 
  * i know that it 's the original headline . 
  but , we also know that the press lacks ethics . 
  that 's the number of jobless that do n't get unemployment benefits . 
  but , 600,000 of them get other benefits according to the government . 
  beside that . 
  is 4 millions high or low ? 
  that 's low for a country like the usa and impossible for estonia , and an international reader may ignore details about the demographics features of spain . 
  a think that a better headline would be that only a third of the jobless get unemployment benefits ; or that less than half of the jobless get any benefits . 
  maybe i think too much . 
   the younger detainee , triana mart\u00ednez , who was a member of the le\u00f3n popular party , was included on the party 's slate for the municipal elections in astorga in 2007 , but was not elected as councilor . 
  isabel carrasco is also a member of that party . 
  she has been probably killed for reasons related with her actions as overlord of le\u00f3n , but it 's not for ideological reasons , that for sure . 
  that happened this week , this monday . 
  it was a massacre . 
  they 've just killed : * leon 's popular party president . 
  * leon 's provincial council president . 
  * leon 's culture institution 's president . 
  * leon 's provincial garbage management consortium 's president . 
  * a leon 's town councilor .

  * a caja espa\u00f1a 's shareholder assembly adviser . 
  * an adviser for 2 real estate agencies .

  there are politics around it , about separation of church and state and certain conflicts . 
  the building become property of the catholic church paying a fee of 30 euros , because the church has been using the building the last 700 years but they were 'n' t the owner until 2006 .

  pushing the catalan independence agenda is in the other door , not this one .

  i 'm not talking about the dictatorship , but current-day guardias civiles and current-day opinions among some part of the society . 
  there 's nothing wrong being a guardia civil today , they 're not `` opressive forces '' or anything like some people say . 
  i doubt it . 
  madrid has been systematically the biggest * in the world * for a few years now , and this year it was the world pride in madrid , so even more people came this year . 
  6 million people demonstrated in all the country , in their respectives cities/towns . 
  in madrid there was 500k to 1 m , which is a lot but nothing we are not used to see from time to time . 
   - bicycle  - madrid pick one . 
  killing guardias civiles is n't good , either . 
  i say that because some people still think it was/is ok .

  just protect your coasts from thirsty real estate spectulators and greedy politicians that recalificate/rezone every single protected natural space . 
  and do n't build too close to the coast ... and you 'll be fine . 
  trust me , you need to do it . 
  the mediterranean coast is nothing compared to what it used to be in spain . 
  before it was probably among the most outstanding/paradise places in the world . 
  now it 's just a theme park .

  edit : former prime minister of spain or * president of the government * of spain . 
  we do n't have a president , our prime minister is called `` president '' because of the title of `` president of the government '' though . 
  we never use `` primer ministro '' though , it 's only reserved for foreign media and english-speakers .

  we seem to get everything there . 
  to be honest that was an unusual week in terms of temperatures . 
  we were at 42-43\u00bac at the beginning of june , then at 15\u00bac , now at 30\u00bac ( the usual temp for this month ) . 
  crazy month , it 's like a roller coaster . 
   catalonia has been working in creating a `` new country '' for the last years/decades you 're the only one lying here , and you try to depict the idea that everyone follows you with your fake relate . 
  or you really do n't know what 's been happening in the last decades - as you say - where you live . 
  but the truth is different , and you are just going to see it after this new 9-n happens ( and then nothing , because there wo n't be independence ) . 
  want to bet ? 
   ps : i do n't need your help , i 'm well-informed enough , you do n't even know me or where do i live or lived , or where my family and friends do . 
  so do n't try to disguise your political opinion as `` hey , i just want to help ... '' . 
  no , you 're just trying to push your political agenda , period . 
   everything he said is either wrong or lacks information . 
  not really . 
  you just do n't agree with it . 
  he raised some points you do n't even entered and countered with your own arguments . 
  but s/he 's totally right and what s/he talks about is also perceived by many many catalans ( not just non-catalan spaniards ), 
  i can tell you that the rest of spaniards do n't have strong opinions on the issue ... obviously always speaking about my surroundings , but with full knowledge of their political opinions . 
  all in all , the rest of spaniards do n't really care that much , besides the established idea that most think that catalonia is part of spain and we should remain united ( and this goes independent of thinking that they should have the referendum or not btw ), 
  catatonic . 
  because that 's how it 's going to end all this `` prus\u00e9s '' . 
  the fact that a danish is able to see this much better than any of the catalan independentists that populate this subreddit amazes me . 
  but hey , when we - as non-catalan spaniards - tell them this they would call us literally franco . 
  even if i fucking voted a pro-referendum party in the last three elections . 
  naisuuu .

  there really is not a better way of travelling than a high-speed train ... it 's so fast and convenient , you do n't end up tired at all because it 's half the time than car ( plus you do n't have to drive ) .

  we have one awesome high-speed network with ave.

  again , indulted ** by the republic ** , against whom he commited treason . 
  if you already know french wines are better , why should taste anything else , right ? 
  a friend of mine lived for some years in toulousse , and her advise was : never argue about wine with french people . 
  they may never have tasted a spanish wine , but they are absolutely sure that french is better in every aspect . 
  even in price/quality ratio where the difference is huge . 
  btw , he declared independence during the spanish republic , so the catalan autonomy had to be temporally suspended and he was judged and sentenced to prison , ** before the start of the war ** . 
  he was later indulted , i think , i do n't remember exactly . 
  there is no need to secularize the schools . 
  in spain , catholic schools which get money from the state have n't a word about admittance . 
  they must accept who the state sends to them . 
  it 's obvioulsy rare that muslims take their children to those schools , but it happens . 
  depending on the region , they can still discriminate by sex , though ( only boys/girls schools ) . 
  this is because hate clouds your reasoning abilities . 
  it 's not a day for glorifying the spanish empire , but for celebrating the cultural ties among iberoamerican countries , spain included . 
  it 's only the national day of spain since the eighties .

  1808-1814 [ spanish war of independence ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/peninsular_war ), 
  do you need to troll every thread that mentions spain , even if has nothing to do with catalonia ? 
  how mature . 
  is ugly as hell but very informative . 
  thank you !, 
  your president wanted to negotiate about something that 's way way outside the legal framework , in the middle of the worst financial crisis of the 50 years . 
  this was 3 years ago , until then he was asking for a different tax system for catalonia , never independence . 
  then junqueras threatened with declaring independence unilaterally , block spanish trade to france and not pay the part of the spanish debt proportional to the size of catalonia . 
  artur mas lately acquired that discourse . 
  i wo n't discuss about the rest of your comment , because this was about who threatened first , and in which circunstances , not about the threats . 
  you seem to know everything about such an uncertain scenario , makes me envious . 
  it was an example which i thought representative , there are obviously more , but my time is limited . 
  i could have reminded how the els segadors was played together with the spanish hymn in the olympic games . 
  i remember that , i 'm that old . 
  in those days it seemed that the catalan problem had been cordially solved at last to the joy of everyone , in contrast to the basque one . 
  you seem to prefer hyperbole and outrage to actual conversation . 
  say which part you do n't agree , and i will try to rebate it or concede , but lol is n't an argument . 
  [ artur mas in 2010 ] ( http://www.lamarea.com/2015/09/23/artur-mas-en-2010-jamas-iniciare-un-proceso-de-independencia-dividiendo-en-dos-mitades-a-cataluna/ ) * i will never start a process of independence in catalonia which divides the country in two halves * are you really so young that you do n't remember how things used to be ? 
  jxsi : sit to negotiate with me what i have no legal right to do , but i think i deserve , or you will be pretty fucked up . 
  gov : you will be pretty fucked up also , and even with an agreement , it wo n't be pretty ( = out of the eu ) . 
  jxsi : omg !!, 
  are you threatening me ? 
  you so fascist !!, 
   we 've tried for 40 years to negotiate with the spanish government and they have said no to everything . 
  how can you lie so blatantly ? 
  the spanish constitution was redacted also by catalan nationalists , and only 5 years ago mas was strongly against building a independent catalan state . 
  imho , a bank run is a pretty probable scenario in case of a unilateral declaration of independence , but certainly not only limited to catalonia , but the whole spain . 
  also , junqueras and mas have played strongly the card of not paying the debt and destroying the spanish economy by blocking spanish trade . 
  that question has a lot of responses . 
  i will try to offer mine . 
  the strictly legal . 
  the spanish constitution says that the sovereignity resides in the spanish people as a whole , and every spainiard has the right to vote on the matter . 
  someone from toledo owns as much of barcelona as the other way around . 
  in my opinion this is not arbitrary . 
  a country in which any part of it may leave at any time is severely handicapped . 
  for example , the only olympics games that spain has hosted have been in barcelona . 
  if people of the rest of spain have imagined that catalonia could leave , they would never have supported it . 
  but also , may be other spanish cities would n't have been so well suited to host the olympics and would n't have been chosen as a host , so the net result is a lose-lose . 
  apply that criteria to any decission in which the goverment must favour one region in detriment of another . 
  we are in the middle of a high unstability period . 
  spain is just recovering of the worst economic crisis of the last 50 years , and coincidentally with the worst years , independence support has gone from < 30 % to aprox 50 % in 4 years . 
  such reivindication should show that the support is sustained in the time , and be settled in a period of stability , and not a product of populism in a period specially sensitive to it . 
  specially given that the catalonia has a very high level of autonomy already . 
  in summary , i 'm not oppossed to a referendum , but the timing and the way is being handled is completely unfair . 
  the spanish goverment is also performing pretty poorly , but that 's obvious to anyone and probably has been analyzed already . 
   just check the votes in the catalan parliament of cs and pp . 
  not a single time have they disagreed . 
  [ counterexample ] ( https://www.ciudadanos-cs.org/prensa/ciutadans_cs_condena_el_fascismo_en_una_propuesta_del_parlament/6255/ ) , and not a trivial one . 
  * we support it , because nobody has n't still explained why calling it marriage should be a problem for the rest of the citizens . 
  a heatmap with intensity linked to population density would be still more insightful . 
  i would like to try to make one , but i do n't know where to get the results with the right granularity . 
  btw , there are [ some guys ] ( http://www.bcnisnotcat.es/ ) who argue for making a different spanish region with the greenest areas ( barcelona and parts of tarragona ) . 
  government guarantees are useful when a single bank has problems , but not in case of a generalized bank run . 
  if the catalan goverment declares the independence , and it 's not just a rethoric one but actually retains the control of the police forces and tries to push forward , the spanish state will have to declare the state of exception ( or suspend the autonomy , but i do n't think that can be enforce alone ) until seizes their funds , arrests the sublevated policemen , etc. . . that massive instability could end in a bank run for sure , and not limited to catalonia . 
  a bank run in catalonia will trigger one in the rest of spain , or at the very least , in its surrounding areas ( where i am ) . 
  yes i think that the situation is that bad . 
  may be i 'm being conspiranoic , but i think the possibility is real . 
  btw , i was thinking in getting a couple of thousands or a similar amount ... by now . 
  i think that a bank run it 's not impossible if the government has to declare the state of exception or something along the lines . 
  they are going to declare independence . 
  they are too invested to withdraw a millimeter . 
  it will work or not , probably not , but they do n't care about the consequences . 
  i 'm thinking on putting some cash in a safe place , just in case . 
  i 'm not kidding . 
  edit : spelling and ... why the downvotes ? 
  i 'm not and mostly agree . 
  fair enough, 
  they are against an unillateral declaration of independence . 
  they have been very clear about it . 
  may be , but if a social media company with a dominant position starts to censor what they find offensive under an arbitrary framework we have a problem ... 
  yeah , allowing them to play the victim 's card surely will help a lot . 
  they will blame the hypocrisy of the system which apparently promotes the free speech only in one direction and they will right . 
  and then is when they will start to be dangerous . 
  free speech has to have well defined legal boundaries , applied by judges , not by corporations . 
  ahem ... * i disapprove of what you say , but i will defend to the death your right to say it . * ... 
  is that something of the past ? 
  afaik , coordinated manoeuvres between different armies may and have taken place , but the troops keep their structure and only the very high level ranks of the armies have to interact .

  they 've been using a boatload of government power , media , etc. 
  at their disposal to do it . 
  now , the majority of the population has been incited this way , but it 's only getting worse as the madrid government does n't know how to respond without worsening the situation .

  i 'll do it : the minor , of maghrebi descent and whose large family has lived 19 years in spain , forced entry into the granada beauty salon after breaking through the outer shutters and smashing the glass door , according to the court .

  what we do is to help them mature . '', 
  yes , this is true given appropriate government , regulatory , and economic environment . 
  but just because it 's possible to do so does not mean that greece could have achieved this . 
  quite the contrary ; it has widely been thought in economic and political circles that greece would not be able to achieve a primary budget surplus without a significant reduction in total government spending . 
  greece is not in a position where additional government spending will lead to an increase in tax income with a multiplier  1 . 
  current policy and economic reality means that increased government spending in greece would lead to increased government debt . 
  having the reverse be true is possible but very difficult in such scenarios , and the policies of this greek government and those before it have not led greece to be in a position to achieve this . 
  even the imf , which , as you mention , has voiced concerns with austerity alone acknowledge that greece would not achieve a budget surplus without drastic government reform unless they reduce spending . 
  the imf has suggested a path for greece with several different components , such as debt restructuring and forgiveness , bureaucratic , political , and tax reform , etc. 
  but greece is not pulling off the bureaucratic , political , and tax reform and it is in no position to achieve the imf 's ideal plan in the current environment , which means even by imf analysis to achieve a surplus the only open alternative without other external changes would be in working with significant reductions in government spending . 
  but that 's not true . 
  had there not been a reduction in government spending ( austerity ) , government spending would not have reached a primary surplus . 
  the surplus does not exist despite the reduction in government spending ; it 's a direct consequency of the government spending less to the point where now the government spends less than it takes in . 
  to suggest that the government would be in such a position without having reduced spending would be crazy . 
  i mean , here 's the thing ; until very recently , greece did n't have a primary budget surplus . 
  meaning that even if it had refused to pay back any of the money it owed and declared itself bankrupt , starting afresh , it still would n't have the money to maintain current spending without starting to borrow more money . 
  recently through austerity it has started to maintain a primary budget surplus , but this is a recent change , and is still quite vulnerable to slipping back into a deficit . 
  sure , but turkey is not a signatory county , so that does n't apply to them . 
  they can do whatever they like and whatever is convenient . 
  i mean , most of europe is already in one . 
  it 's just a matter of whether or not the uk decides to leave it . 
  just fyi it 's allowed * . 
  hunting and raiding i can see . 
  but you farmed each other ? 
  curious . 
  was n't that just a parody by some left-leaning people on twitter that wanted to poke fun at what they thought trump supporters were like ? 
  yeah , spain is the eu leader in high speed rail , and prices in spain are below similar trajectories in england and france . 
  i think it 's one of our strongest points actually . 
  but just because distances are so great to other european capitals , we have n't invested in such connections as much as internal ones . 
  there 's a high speed rail line being built right now to lisbon , and they 're improving the foundations for a future line to paris , but there 's not really many other places to go externally . 
  yes and no . 
  population replacement was of course practiced throughout the ottoman empire 's history , and what you say is totally true . 
  but at the end of the day , significant as the population replacement was , genetic studies have shown that the majority of modern-day people living in turkey have genes primarily derived from pre-turkish groups . 
  in effect , most of the genetic makeup of anatolians has it 's origins in that of pre-ottoman anatolian peoples . 
  populations have changes over the years , many times as directly called for by the government , but still , most people in anatolia have a primarily pre-ottoman anatolian genetic makeup . 
  last time i looked into it i believe the first cro-mangons were not r1b but their descendents were actually pushed out by r1b and others . 
  but yeah , celts spread as a ruling class and culture , not as much by population replacement/migration as people might expect . 
  `` celtic '' peoples in wales , ireland , etc. 
  have very little `` true '' celtic blood from the celtic homeland in germany and czechia . 
  just language and cultural influences . 
  fun fact : though it overlaps nicely with celtic-speaking regions of the last two thousand years ( spain , france , germany , portugal , and the british isles ) , r1b is not related to the celts , but rather to * much * older peoples . 
  like ** way ** older people groups . 
  they might have been the ones the celts replaced , actually , though it is likely that they are even older than those originally . 
  it 's up for debate . 
  it 's actually * very * contentious right now . 
  two theories prevail : there were native peoples in far western europe that may have originated in northern spain or thereabouts and spread throughout spain , france , and the british isles ( and beyond ) or that at a very different point in time/history , there were invaders from the east ( interestingly enough , though gone now some of the oldest traces of r1b are from russia ) that conquered western europe and simply were not replaced as effectively in the far west as they were elsewhere in europe , especially in the east . 
  there were massive moorish populations ( in addition to native converts ) that came in and retained their culture , language , and seperate ethnic identity though . 
  they and their descendents ( including mixes ) were pretty effectively eradicated and expelled , however . 
  i mean , greece and anatolia had basically a stratum of similar population groups within them for a very long time . 
  the anatolian peoples were conquered by the turks and turkified , but genetically are mostly not `` turkish '' in the sense that the invading turks had mostly a cultural and linguistic conquest , rather than population replacement of the natives . 
  it 's like converting non-greek anatolian peoples ( cousins of greeks ) and some greeks until they adopted a language from far away in central asia and changed cultural attitudes and religion . 
  it 's complicated . 
  austerity is n't seen as being that much of a eu issue for spain , but rather a national issue . 
  so it affects rajoy and the pp , but not any other european leaders ' popularities . 
  also the pp has been suffering lately for a great many other things ( corruption mostly ) so that 's dropped their popularity far lower than merkel 's could ever go ( unless she did something crazy with immigration , mind ) . 
  no , technically [ majority ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/majority ) means a group of the `` majority '' ( ergo more than half ; the major portion of the whole ) so 50 % + 1 . 
  absolute majority most often refers to a majority that includes not just all votes , but also abstentions . 
  so if 52 % of votes went to a and 48 % to b , but abstention was 20 % , there would be no supermajority . 
  however , a would still have a majority . 
  a plurality is the greatest group , and not necessarily formed by a majority but rather by being the largest of all options . 
  so a plurality for ` a ' might be 33 % if ` b ' and ` c ' were each 30 % with the remaining 7 % going to 'd ' . 
  to be able to plan escape routes if the need should ever arise . 
  would n't it be a priestess , not priest as that 's a word with gender in english ? 
  like cow/bull , lion/lioness , actor/actress , etc. 
  precisely what that map shows is what i mean . 
  turkey might be doing okay under erdogan economically , but its economy is still mediocre . 
  not bad , but also no western europe or scandinavia . 
  this means the economy would be an important reason for turks to emigrate to other eu countries and one would expect relatively little reverse immigration in turn . 
  their economy is insufficient to keep turks in turkey should freedom of movement be granted . 
  and that 's a major concern for current eu member states . 
  i mean for all the growth they might have , they 're no denmark or ireland . 
  their economy , when compared with the rest of the eu would give many a reason to emigrate which is the problem . 
  or do you think they 're strong enough to be a net immigrant destination rather than a net emigrant source ? 
  if so , i 'd disagree . 
  * crickets * yeah , they 've got no chance . 
  no one wants them , they are enemies with all their neighbors who would veto them and their large population + middling economy ( implying potentially massive emigration rates ) would worry all of the west and north should they be admitted . 
  they 've got no chance unless overnight they drop erdogan , change their constitution/government , leave cyprus , improve their governance and economy , and magically change some deep cultural aspects . 
  so , yeah , zero chance in today 's political climate . 
  the effects ( cut scenes and cgi ) look just like ones in spain . 
  also , bravo , newsanchor . 
  did n't expect to learn about tourism in aveiro , but i ended up hooked wanting to know more about it despite having no plans to visit yet . 
  you could team up with italy , norway , iceland . 
  maybe even disenfranchised danes , poles , hungarians etc. 
  would given the right circumstances be willing to leave the eu . 
  and you could start an economic union with them . 
  a free single market with them even . 
  maybe even call it a union . 
  i think i 'd rather be cooler than warmer , thanks .

  our high levels of corporate tax means they are forced to avoid to not lose revenue . 
  it 's much easier to say it than to do it . 
  you 're trying to outfox the slyest group of people in the world with most of the worlds resources and most politicians and countries in their pockets . 
  aka will never happen . 
  what ` lost revenue ' ? 
  large corporations have never and never will pay corporation tax . 
  ( which is why many support lowering it , as it is pushed to the consumer and worker ) the government never had that to begin with . 
  well no , the f35 was supposed to be a cheap jet , cheaper than the f22 which was the expensive one . 
  so , complete failure as it costs quite a bit more .

  actually in recent polls it 's the psoe who loses the most votes , with ciudadanos bouncing up to 17 % and podemos taking the lead from psoe, 
  hey buddy !, 
  ive been following your comments for a while , how 's your job going ? 
  did you get fired from the petro industry ? 
  its just that you 're the only other centrist-liberal spaniard on this sub and we need to look after each other 's back . 
  it 's in the very early process of investigation , charges have n't been brought up . 
  and im sure the ` pablo iglesias started his career as a pawn of iran 's conservative islamic anti-women 's party ' will have some sort of effect . 
  aside from the fact that the legal charges if approved could of course have whichever effect the courts decide . 
  no , it 's a crime for it to be from a corporation , a foreign power , especially one done with a ` bad ' intent like the destabilisation of the west , is doubly bad . 
  this is very different . 
  it 's the money of a foreign power at a time when there was great enmity between the west and iran . 
  also , this has potential legal repercussions as well as political repercussions . 
  by this i mean the moderate psoe voters that seem to be thinking of switching to podemos . 
  i know !, 
  i saw your comment and i replied to the guy , it 's great to see both you and i knew they were extreme , but not just straight make shit up . 
  just here to update you . 
  you are right , of course , as abc news on podemos are mostly bollocks . 
  i started to believe that too and left this story to be one of those ` one off ' scandals abc likes to make up . 
  ... buttt just today elmundo published an article on the leader of hispantv and his links to the iranian government as well as a substantial amount of other facts . 
  quick , short summary of events : a few days ago there surfaced on abc.es a leaked document of an investigation by the spanish police on pablo iglesias earning over 90,000 euros and not declaring it on the official ` transparency ' podemos website as it should have been . 
  later , another document pertained to over 2 million euros being given indirectly to podemos through hispantv from iran . 
  this is illegal as no party can be financed by a foreign power or foreign donor . 
  adding to the feeling of ` this shit is shady ' is the fact that the money went through a marathon of sham companies , and ends up with this guy , mahmoud alizadeh , who ` never wanted to be photographed ' . 
  this article is extremely important , as previously this story was only published on abc , a monarchist , right wing website which clings to the pp . 
  however , elmundo has an excellent reputation of fucking with pretty much everyone , and is a kind of chaotic neutral , if anything leaning towards ciutadans . 
  the police report ... 
  i never said it was black money . 
  he never declared it on his online ` transparency ' page which is meant to list all his income . 
  the illegality commited is due to the possible use of the money to finance podemos . 
  in spain it is illegal for foreign countries to sponsor national aprties , directly or indirectly . 
  it is also a huuuuge deal if completely confirmed , which it seems to be . 
  abc might be a horribly biased news site , but it is legit . 
  crypto fascists ? 
  get the fuck out of here you muppet . 
  a liberal pro-weed , pro judicial reform and pro free markets with catalonians leading the party which have nothing in common with fascists . 
  typical , labelling anyone who does n't agree with you ` fascists ', 
  i think so , around 40 to be exact . 
  update it mate , pp have 123 , psoe have 90 now . 
  hardly terrible for c 's . 
  i 'd say disappointing . 
  never , we 're a civilised people after all . 
  this is political dick waggling , and that 's all it will ever be . 
  a half dead frog is more competent than corbyn . 
  trump is a fucking mastermind . 
  he 's not stupid or ignorant , he just pretends and its going fucking great for him . 
  the us in the top 5 of most wealth and income per capita , the rest being oil rich or tiny nations . 
  what are you on about . 
  the us is fucking amazing in that regard , sure healthcare is bad but if you have a regular job you will get coverage as part of the package , and its usually better than european care where its just ` ma\u00f1ana , ma\u00f1ana ', 
  in most countries it 's like that . 
  you want direct democracy ? 
  let only the elite vote . 
  sadly , the upper and upper middle classes have historically been less demagogic and more forward thinking than the lower classes . 
  ` the best argument against democracy is a five minute conversation with the average voter ' winston churchill, 
  the eu and your country gives loans and scholarships . 
  you just have to be aware of its existence . 
  ` or you can take a loan out ' . 
  and unis in the uk are cheap , if you go to a good one . 
  did you just seriously mis-quote george bush 's mis-quote ? 
  exactly , in fact scandinavia is one of the most capitalist regions in the world . 
  london business school ? 
  harvard ? 
  i 'm talking about eu universities which are either free , or you can take a loan out . 
  what do you mean, 
  itt : people making excuses of why they 're not going to a top 10 university, 
  how is that proud ? 
  much more civilised and better countries than us have it legalised ... 
  i 'd say i 'm glad , because spain is a country filled with so much scum , which would rise to the top with gun legalisation . 
  guns in canada are as easy to get as in switzerland , or a bit easier . 
  mate , i 'm a liberal . 
  that whole demontando ciudadanos is pointless , because most who vote ciudadanos actually understand and know that they are a centre right party . 
  the pp used to have a great message , but its gone to shit due to inner party bureaucracy and infested with cronies . 
  did n't you read what i said , of why it is a victory ? 
  politics is not as straightforward as you think it is . 
  just to let you and everyone else know ; this is actually a very important victory . 
  looking at things from a default angle wo n't help as this is a specific situation . 
  the election was treated like a plebiscite , which came out against secession . 
  most importantly , c 's became the ` voto util ' , which everyone expected the pp to be . 
  this means that c 's has a chance at becoming the main centre right party in government , and stands to gain tremendously from the pp 's disenchanted voters . 
  literally a stereotypical american . 
  i mean they are in favour of a reform , just not one so extreme that would allow the catalans to secede . 
  as an independendista you must recognise that if any party will work towards solving the problems of catalonia in relation to spain right now in the madrid government it 's them . 
  i mean read up on the political situation in spain before making harsh statements .

  however , they ended up having a son so the crown would go to him in the end ( alfonso xiii ) in the mean time the queen ( future king alfonso xiii 's mother ) would act as regent . 
  in fact that was n't the only regency during the xixth century , as king fernando vii also died with very young children ( iirc the next queen , isabel ii was 4 years old or so ) . 
  that regency was a bit more convoluted due to a civil war though . 
   also what would happen in general if the monarch died without an heir ? 
  presumably a new republic would be born in its place ? 
  in theory no . 
  if the king dies without a heir , the crown is passed to his oldest brother ( if they exist ) . 
  if none exist , it goes to the eldest sister . 
  if he is an only child , i do n't know , but it 'd probably go to some uncle or cousin . 
  if everyone closely related to the king dies , then parliament decides on his successor ( though hopefully they just reform the constitution and switch to a republic )  do all of our monarchs have the same inheritance laws ? 
  do we all have primogeniture ? 
  pretty sure all european monarchies have primogeniture . 
  the main difference seems to be whether men are favoured over women . 
  here they are , though in a real life situation where an older sister gets screwed we 'd most likely reform the constitution anyways . 
  that was briefly a matter of debate while the current queen ( then princess ) was pregnant with her second child , but since she had 2 daughters , the debate was quickly shut down . 
  specifically , our constitution says this about inheritance : ** article 57 **  1 . 
  the crown of spain shall be inherited by the successors of h. m. juan carlos i de borb\u00f3n , the legitimate heir of the historic dynasty . 
  succession to the throne shall follow the regular order of primogeniture and representation , the first line always having preference over subsequent lines ; within the same line , the closer grade over the more remote ; within the same grade , the male over the female , and in the same sex , the elder over the younger . 
  the crown prince , from his birth or from the time he acquires the claim , shall hold the title of prince of asturias and the other titles traditionally held by the heir to the crown of spain . 
  should all the lines designated by law become extinct , the cortes generales shall provide for succession to the crown in the manner most suitable to the interests of spain . 
  those persons with a right of succession to the throne who marry against the express prohibition of the king and the cortes generales , shall be excluded from succession to the crown , as shall their descendants . 
  abdications and renunciations and any doubt in fact or in law that may arise in connection with the succession to the crown shall be settled by an organic act . 
  here in spain i really have no idea . 
  the most common newspapers are el mundo and el pa\u00eds , so i 'd say those . 
  maybe tve as well ( though they 've decreased in quality drastically since 2011 ) . 
  surprisingly , telecinco has great news reports as well , but outside the usual 15:00 and 21:00 reports , they do n't have anything else . 
  ( it 's the tv thrash channel , owned by mediaset ), 
  canary islands here , we have the same minimum wage as the rest of the country ( roughly 10k $ a year ) , but a lower vat ( 7 % as opposed to 21 % in the mainland ) on the flip side though , we have to pay tariffs whenever we bring something from literally anywhere else in the world . 
  yeah , but there are also tons of parliamentary systems working just fine , like germany . 
  though i personally prefer presidential systems , because of their better separation of powers, 
  we also increased minimum wage from 650 to 710 $ a month or something like that, 
   since vox is a fucking joke . 
  to be fair , they came close to getting seats in the eu parliament election in 2014 ( they got 1 % of the vote then , as opposed to the 0.1 % they have now ) . 
  had they managed to get a seat i guess they might have been more popular , not unlike podemos ( ok , maybe not quite that popular , but i guess a result for the last election would have been pp 25 % psoe 22 % podemos 20 % cs 13 % vox 5 % or something like that ), 
  yes there are , but they are not very common . 
  i guess the more time passes the more coins with felipe vi there will be . 
  for all what 's worth , they look like this : http://ep00.epimg.net/economia/imagenes/2015/02/02/actualidad/1422901384_870205_1422960645_noticia_normal.jpg, 
  first of all , keep in mind i might be biased as i 'm from the canary islands , where the only reasonable way out is by plane ( there 's a weekly ferry crossing to cadiz , but it takes 2 days or so and is n't much cheaper than flying ) . 
  think of hawaii for example . 
  anyways , flights here are more or less popular . 
  they are n't the main way of transportation though unless you are flying most of the country or are flying to some of the archipielagos ( canary/balearic islands ) . 
  they have also decreased in popularity reciently because of the rise of the high speed ave trains . 
  as for the route you requested , here would be your options for a barcelona seville route in 2 months ( first of march ) * flight ( ryanair ) : 33 $ ( plus all the extras to rip you off , it 's ryanair after all ) . 
  1h 45 min * high speed train ( ave ) : 70 $ , 5h 30 min . 
  * standard train : 38 $ 11h 30 min !, 
  * driving : 118 $ ( includes gas ; estimated consumption 6.2 l/100km ; estimated price 1.3 $ / l ) . 
  10h * driving ( avoiding toll roads ) : 86 $ 12h * bus ( alsa ) : 88 $ , 15h as you can see flying is the superior option if you can get your tickets for cheap . 
  if you fly with a mainstream company ( like say , iberia ) , tickets cost twice as much . 
  yeah , but i think the `` puente aereo '' has become a lot less popular reciently because of the ave train ( it used to be one of the most flown routes in the world actually ! ), 
  iirc they actually did a referendum which was rejected 99-1 or something like that . 
  same thing in gibraltar . 
  2 referendums ( one in the 60s and one in 02 ) both rejected joining spain by like 99-1 and 98-2 or something like that, 
  yeah , it seems way too high for me as well . 
  i 'd say a more realistic one is probably 1800 $ a month or so i guess . 
  then again i do n't know anyone who is an aerospace engineer . 
  all the others seem accurate though . 
  it varies a lot depending on your degree , but anyways , according to [ this website ] ( http://blog.jobandtalent.com/sueldos-de-recien-licenciados-espanoles/ ) it 's : * for architects it 's around 1400 $ a month * aerospace engineer : 2500-3000 $ a month * doctor in practices ( ie medicine ) : 900 $ a month , increases during the first 5 years up to 1550 $ a month * economics : 1500-1800 $ a month * law : 1200-1400 $ a month * journalism : nothing ( unpaid internships ) -200 $ ( paid internships ) - 800 $ a month ( actual jobs ) * teacher ( public school , civil servant ) : 2000 $ a month * teacher ( private school ) : 800-1000 $ a month, 
  there 's already a right wing government in the eu though . 
  the president of the european commision ( junker ) belongs to the epp ( whose polish parties are apparently platforma obywatelska and polskie stronnictwo ludowe ), 
  [ relevant xkcd ] ( https://xkcd.com/1357/ ), 
   do you know what are the only two countries that do n't have any xenophobic party at their national parliaments and at their regional parliaments in all the e.u. ? 
  spain and portugal . 
  to be fair , we are not the only ones ( i think luxenbourg and malta do n't have those either , alongside some of the baltics ) . 
  we are just the largest by far :p, 
  basically never . 
  i have played online at chess24 sometimes , but i always played with a friend , never alone against a random person . 
  i also am terrible at chess :p, 
  i 'm a student , but whatever . 
  las palmas de gran canaria , spain . 
  my university is 10 min by car , 45 min by foot or 30 min by bus ( i take 2 , it depends on how well i can coordinate them ) . 
  as for leisurely activites , we normally just hang out in the city centre , but you can also go to the beach , watch movies , etc. 
  there 's a good variety of activities you can do here . 
  there are barely any refugees in spain . 
  i 'd be very surprised if they even reach 500 . 
  so , other than appearing in the news , not much . 
  we 've got a lot more to worry about than that . 
  ok , here are ours ( i think i went too much into detail lol , but it 's fine for the sake of completeness ) : * major parties with national representation in both houses * * pp ( people 's party ; 137/350 seats in congress , 146/266 senators ) : classic right wing conservative party . 
  one of the 2 only main parties before the 2015 election ( we had essencially a 2 party system before that ) they have been in government since 2011 . 
  pm mariano rajoy is their leader . 
  their last government was pretty unpopular , but not unpopular enough for them to lose the election . 
  also , the way we elect our senators vastly benefits them , as they easily win small provinces . 
  however since our senate is useless , that 's not a huge deal ( they had a majority in the senate back in 04 but psoe leader zapatero was pm . 
  only effect was laws having a 2 month delay or so ) * psoe ( spanish socialist workers ' party ; 85/350 seats in congress , 62/266 senators ) : classic centre-left party . 
  last time in government was 2004-2011 . 
  they currently have no leader , as their last leader , pedro sanchez , was ousted by party leaders in a coup . 
  currently in free fall as their last government was a disaster and they have a lot of internal infighting . 
  against catalan independence , but of the 3 parties against it they seem the one with the most flexible position , and the most open to reforms . 
  * unidos podemos ( united , we can ; 71 congressmen , 21 senators ) : new anti establishment left wing party . 
  only major party in favour of a referendum in catalonia . 
  current leader is pablo iglesias , but they also have a lot of internal fighting currently , but it will be resolved in the party congress in february iirc * ciudadanos ( citizens ; 32 congressmen ; 3 senators , none directly elected ) : centrist liberal party ( liberal in the european sense ) . 
  halfway between pp and psoe . 
  against catalan independence . 
  current leader is albert rivera * minor regionalist parties with representation in both houses * * erc ( republican left of catalonia , 9 congressmen , 12 senators ) : left wing party , more comparable to podemos than to the psoe . 
  greatly in favour of catalonia 's independence . 
  * cdc ( democratic convergence of catalonia , 8 congressmen , 4 senators ) : right wing party ( comparable to the pp ) in favour of catalonia 's independence . 
  they reciently changed their name to something else , but everyone calls them by their old name anyways . 
  * pnv ( basque nationalist party ; 5 congressmen , 6 senators ) : right wing party ( between the pp and ciudadanos ) , from the basque country . 
  used to be in favour of independence , but they have moderated their position to just keeping their priviledges . 
  * eh bildu ( 2 congressmen , 1 senator ) : left wing party ( comparable to podemos ) , greatly in favour of basque independence , they had trouble being legalized due to possible ties with the terrorist organization eta . 
  they are to the basque country what erc is to catalonia * cc ( canarian coalition .

  samw gender and you probably either high 5 ( informal ) , or shake hands ( formal ), 
  whenever an american mentions an stereotype of minessota i always think they are a part of canada that somehow ended up in the us xd, 
  well , greeting with hola , que tal ? 
  ( hello !, 
  how are you ? ), 
  ( what 's going on ? ), 
  like in the us is not that rate here . 
  you sometimes answer with bien y tu ? 
  ( fine and you ? ), 
  and then continue the conversation normally . 
  others you just tell what you are doing like in europe , but almost always a short answer, 
  pretty sure we would never reach a 2 last people in the country scenario . 
  at one point the state will collapse and birthrates would go up automatically ( i 'm thinking of a mad max-esque scenario , sans the destruction and the awesome cars ), 
  why is having low fertility rates = population death ? 
  sure , the population will shrink , but very slowly over time and approaching 0 in infinity ( ie never ) a fertility rate of 1 would mean the population would be divided by half after each generation , but by the time it reaches critically low numbers it will probably be like the year 2500 or so , at which point we 'll probably have a solution, 
  yeah , though to be fair when i think of that kind of places , cantabria is definitely the first place that comes to mind, 
  / r/exmuslim relevant subreddit for that, 
  yeah , inmigrants from `` western minded '' countries ( usa , australia , etc ) and most asian countries ( thinking mostly on china here , but also japan , worst korea , etc ) have little to no difficulty integrating . 
  latin americans also have almost no difficulty integrating as well ( i might be biased here for obvious reasons , but still ) . 
  eastern europeans also integrate mostly well . 
  african and middle eastern migrants should look at a mirror and ask why they are the only ones that do n't integrate . 
  maybe they should adapt to the customs of the new place they are in ? 
  did they never learn `` when in rome do as romans do '' ? 
  would n't it be a better idea to vote strategically in the 1st round for macron ( or melenchon or hollande maybe ) to get a leftist or centrist you like better in the 2nd round instead of voting someone who does not have a chance ? 
  would it be a good idea for the ps to include a `` not put a candidate '' option in the primary and if that succeeds endorse macron ( or melenchon if they are willing to go fat left i guess ) in order not to split the left further ( as their candidates are polling terribly ) and get a leftist on the 2nd round ? 
  i think what you describe are capped countries like you and us . 
  i can still use the internet with my phone after my data cap is gone ( in my case 1 gb :( ) . 
  it 's just that the speed is so slow that loading any website is an exercise in frustration . 
  it 's basically only usable for whatsapp after the cap is reached . 
  i wonder how a melenchon vs le pen would look like xd far left vs far right . 
  the battle of the extremes, 
  yeah , spanish urban planning tends to prefer large appartment buildings instead of ( semi ) detatched houses . 
  not in vain spain has the largest percentage of people in the eu living in flats [ according to eurostat ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/images/7/74/distribution_of_population_by_dwelling_type%2c_2014_%28%25_of_population%29_yb16.png ) . 
  coincidentally we also have the largest amount of elevators per capita . 
  the article is actually very good and explains why we live mostly in flats as opposed to houses : http://qz.com/273214/how-spains-bloody-history-gave-it-the-worlds-highest-concentration-of-elevators/ barcelona 's case is even more extreme , as it 's surrounded by mountains , so big urban sprawl is out of the question . 
  here 's for example a random street in the outskirts of madrid : https://www.google.es/maps/@40.370732,-3.7490174,3a,75y,245.98h,90t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1smgex2bio0fni0nt9vxmima!2e0!7i13312!8i6656, 
  to be fair , spain at least has 2 big cities , not just 1 ( madrid and barcelona have roughly the same importance economically , with madrid having an edge due to being the capital ), 
  yeah , maybe sweden . 
  portugal if i understand correctly has a right wing president but a left wing prime minister . 
  i think the prime minister is the one with the most power though . 
  yeah , forgot about them ( i actually talked about greece in another reply ) i was not sure whether sweden had a left wing or a right wing government , that 's why i did not include them, 
  oh , sure , i just thought it was smaller . 
  til valencia has more than 2 million people . 
  i thought they would n't even get to 1.5 million . 
  do n't the individual states have the most control over people 's lives though ? 
  well , yeah , in that case there 's no left wing prime minister/president in europe right now . 
  i guess tsipras in greece was one for like 4 months before finally surrendering to the troika, 
  which countries even have left wing governments right now anyways ? 
  i can only think of italy and france , and there 's a 0 % chance of hollande winning reelection . 
  the infamous in the opinion of the alt-right merkel is a right wing politician . 
  to be fair , hungary does n't seem that bad . 
  a bit stagnated , but at least they are on the positive side of things . 
  ( unlike , say , greece , currently at 90s levels ), 
  according to / r/the _ donald 's bot , it 's going to be built all the way up to space a tunnel is probably a better idea :p, 
  til dublin has a subway system or is it a tram ? 
  yeah . 
  i mean , sure , losing denmark + sweden would n't hurt as much as losing , say , france or germany ( or hell , the uk ! ), 
  but they are still net contributors after all . 
  much more `` sane '' pricing imo, 
  damn , why is hatton cross so cheap when compared to the rest of the city ? 
  i guess it must look like a warzone or something ( plus , being near a busy airport must hurt a lot ) also , with our pricing standards , the only sane areas seem to be elm park and redbridge . 
  i guess those are the infamous `` no-go '' zones ? 
  xd ( granted , crime there is probably overestimated , but i guess they are pretty bad to live in ) here paying 4 digits is very rare . 
  only if it takes place on a car and you are not on the drover 's seat :p, 
  fernando vii was not a liberal at all . 
  he did have like 3 liberal years , but called france to invade and liberate us to get an absolute monarchy . 
  he even killed the cadiz constitution of 1812 !, 
  apparently reddit itself has gone to shit . 
  just look at / r/all right now, 
  tradition . 
  franco put in place the 14 payments system , one for christmas , and another to conmemorate the `` glorious national uprising '' ( ie his coup ) . 
  when democracy came , we kept the extra payments , and just changed the conmemoration of the second to the king 's birthday . 
  i think now it just celebrates the middle of summer . 
  ok , those are the syrians . 
  everyone else ( afghans , pakistanis , etc ) is deported to their home country . 
  it 's not that hard, 
  why ca n't we learn something from the us in this issue ? 
  their states have powers which are respected by washington . 
  we should do the same here . 
  so , only for 2 years and not even the entire country ? 
  for all what 's worth we sold a couple useless islands to germany in 1899 , but they lost them after ww1, 
  not even that , iirc was n't it like 2010 or 2011 for legal abortion ? 
  spain is wrong in that map . 
  we did legalize abortion in cases of rape , incest , danger to the mother and the like in the 1980s , but abortion on demand was legalized in 2011  . , 
  what happened to juppe ? 
  i thought he was the favourite ? 
  actually , fun fact : you may have noticed that here instead of having a pp-cs coalition like the uk had , we have instead a minority pp government . 
  one of the main reasons is the collapse of the british lib dems after the coalition . 
  cs leader albert rivera is personal friends with nick clegg , and learned from his mistake . 
  ( the other main reason is that here minority governments are quite common , though they usually have many more mps ), 
  for all what 's worth the last polls i saw had a hypothetical hollande-le pen 2nd round as a virtual tie , with le pen slightly ahead !, 
  of course that requires hollande to somehow get to the 2nd round, 
  also a fitting acronym xd, 
  yeah ; suarez also served for only 2 terms ( though he did run several times after that ) . 
  i 'd also expect rajoy not to run for a third term if this government lasts for the full 4 years ( unlikely ) . 
  gonzalez is really the only person who got more than 2 terms . 
  not really , he had mediocre approval ratings . 
  in [ late 2003 ] ( http://www.cis.es/cis/export/sites/default/-archivos/marginales/2540_2559/2541/e254100.html ) for example , he had a 4.56 . 
  for reference zapatero had a 4.47 / 10 and rajoy a 4.63 / 10 at the time . 
  zapatero was indeed incredibly unpopular in [ 2011 ] ( http://datos.cis.es/pdf/es2915mar_a.pdf ) though , as he had a 3/10 .

  a bull can reach speeds of 60km/h and weights between 300 and 500kg , since the sanfermines run never ends with hundreds of trampled bodies , maybe those bulls have not been tortured and are more scared than angry . 
  incidentally , that 's why touching or distracting the bulls is dangerous , if one of them gets separated from the pack it becomes much more aggressive , they feel safe in packs . 
   running of the bulls bulls are not killed or mistreated .

  it 's been so long since i got mine i 'm not really sure i could pass it tomorrow again , and everyone tells me that i driver very well . 
  we adopt bad habits and tell ourselves it 's the correct way , a test every 5 years will help to correct a lot of problems . 
  about the driving is a right or privilege debate , there 're people who really need cars for a variety of reasons , like living in the middle of nowhere . 
  but i think that a middle ground could be reached by punishing offenders with speed/power limiters , gps monitoring or pedal powered go-karts . 
  do you mean the people who went to school together , to university with , that go to the same clubs and trips ? 
  no way , that 's crazy and illegal , like corruption . 
   he 's talking shit , our active population is increasing constantly i wish , [ it has dropped like a rock in the last two years ] ( http://www.ine.es/prensa/epa_tabla.htm ) it always rises in the second quarter just to drop in the third . 
  last year it was +.17 % and -10 % , this year is +.34 % , let 's hope we keep half of that , we fell in a bad trend . 
   he just does n't look at the dates no , i look at the methodology , the one i posted is from the * ministerio de trabajo y seguridad social * , it 's hard statistical data . 
  if you look at the one you posted , in the methodology section it says  la encuesta de poblaci\u00f3n activa ( epa ) es una investigaci\u00f3n por muestreo and while [ it 's very precise ] ( http://www.ine.es/daco/daco42/daco4211/epa0115.pdf ) , i do n't like it , so i do n't use it . 
  work related accidental deaths tend to skew those statistics , pretty much all are men , i thinks its 20 to 1 . 
  edit to add a source : http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/accidents_at_work_statistics  men are considerably more likely than women to have a non-fatal accident or to die at work . 
  in the eu-28 , almost four out of every five ( 78.5 % ) non-fatal accidents at work and 19 out of every 20 ( 95.6 % ) fatal accidents at work involved men . 
  lol , worst spammer ever . 
  i know they do n't have any other chance , and it 's even worst , most of the people leaving are young and with a degree , and statistically most of them wo n't come back . 
  also , you forget the people that is not looking for work , working illegally , or retirees , those areas are still growing . 
  anyway , the main problem is that governments tend to completely ignore those numbers because it makes unemployment rates look better but the baseline expenses keep increasing while the revenue drops . 
  so yeah , we should be worried about that number too , but it 's being actively ignored . 
  in spain it 's people actually working or looking for work .

  in spain lepers were sent to [ lazarettos ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lazaretto ) which in spain doubled as isolated hospitals for infectious patients or sent to leproserias , specialized leper hospitals/colonies like the sanatorio san francisco de borja [ * spanish wikipedia * ] ( https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/sanatorio_san_francisco_de_borja ) / [ * google translation * ] ( https://translate.google.es/translate?act=url&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=utf8&amp;prev=_t&amp;sl=es&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/sanatorio_san_francisco_de_borja&amp;sandbox=0&amp;usg=alkjrhgnjc1sqlm0lg-9f63llac71mhnea ) which while isolated were decent places to live , apparently . 
  edit to add some more info : *** leprosy in spain *** , * by felix contreras duenas * , medical director of the san francisco de borja sanatorium-colony in english * [ pdf version ] ( http://ila.ilsl.br/pdfs/v15n2a07.pdf ) and [ pastebin version ] ( http://pastebin.com/ruc4qwzi ) * , it 's short but interesting , contains a list of leproserias starting from the 9th century . 
  [ a homemade video of the sanatorio ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6rwwujbwqu ) [ leper in the philiphines ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/culion_leper_colony ) , back when it was spain 's colony . 
   the first known origin of leprosy in the philippines dates back to time of the first spanish exploration of the philippines . 
  in the sixteenth century , franciscan friars established a shelter for the care of those afflicted with leprosy close to their monastery in manila , where the hospital san juan de dios is located . 
  [ 3 ] in 1632 the emperor of japan , knowing that the spanish catholic church had an interest in caring for those afflicted with disease , sent one hundred and thirty four japanese known sufferers of leprosy by ship to manila . 
  the spanish franciscans , initially reluctant to accept the shipment from the emperor , eventually took in the japanese patients and housed them in the hospital of san lazaro in manila . 
  [ 4 ] however , the emperor 's shipment of japanese citizens infected with leprosy is not attributed as the main source of leprosy in the colonies , as the philippines is known to have had commerce with other asian countries known to have been afflicted with the leprosy . 
  [ 5 ]  by 1830 , approximately four hundred lepers were patients in leper colonies established by catholic priests at manila , cebu and nueva caceras . 
  [ 3 ] those afflicted with leprosy were segregated from the rest of the population but still allowed to have contact with family , inhabitants and other members of the island . 
  [ 6 ] the purpose of the hospitals and leprosy establishments on the islands at that time was n't to eradicate the disease or segregate it from the rest of the population but instead to provide humanitarian aid . 
  [ 5 ] the hospital of san lazaro in manila was run by franciscan friars until september 1898 , when it was turned over to the american authorities . 
  [ 7 ] the other islands , cebu , palestina , and nueva c\u00e1ceres were ordered abandoned by general leonard wood .

  probably not , so everywhere we have to be careful , but germans know they have the seeds inside and so must be even more careful . 
  do you think there should be a border between manhattan and albany ? 
  if there is no border then there is a commonality of laws . 
  yes , especially when you know that is not limited to a few individuals . 
  and observe that it is not dependent on real acts , but only on claims . 
  free speech as understood in the usa is claiming flat earth is real .

   they also want to keep receiving spanish pensions , but of course they wo n't contribute to the fund anymore . 
  they have paid into them for a long time , and about a third are as spanish as a castilian ^ ( 1 ) .

   to the question : `` are you for or against religion ? 
  '' , as an atheist i 'm not a believer , but i believe in freedom of religion . 
  in that case , that 'll put me in the same camp as isis , since they are religious too . 
  _ that _ is a load of nonsense . 
  what problem do you have if you 're in the same camp as isis in a topic ? 
  you can be for religion , which puts you in the same camp as isis , and for freedom of religion , which does not . 
  what you can not do is be `` middle ground '' in favor of religion ( how ? ), 
  or `` middle ground '' in support of freedom of religion ( how ? ) . 
  you made _ exactly _ the same politician 's fallacy as the above poster . 
  please think logically a bit before answering . 
  in fact , taxation is exactly what i had in mind when saying that `` most '' issues have no middle ground . 
  however , this is hardly frequent . 
  it 's more common to ask for specific projects such as `` i want esa to have budget for a mission to mars . '', 
  or similar , in which case , what use is `` half the budget '' ? 
  and please note that even if there 's a natural gradation , it still does not mean that there 's a middle ground !, 
   that 's the reason there is a certain limit on the amount of alcohol you 're allowed to have in your blood when driving . 
  yes , the _ necessary _ so that your driving ability is not compromised . 
  what use would be a `` middle ground '' here ? 
   abortions can be allowed under various conditions , ranging from `` always '' to `` only in cases of rape '' to `` never '' but that was exactly my example !, 
  how is that a middle ground ? 
  that 's just another position !, 
  so you 're allowing immigration then ... 
  and there you are , with the usual pollitician 's fallacy . 
  campaigning for `` drinking coke '' _ does not mean _ that you have to drink _ nothing else _ . 
  that is one of the type of lies i had in mind when politicians manipulate public opinion and try to create a mythical `` middle ground '' that does not exist in reality . 
  notice that the middle ground that you propose , `` drinking coke and something else '' , is actually exactly what camp b ( aka those who favor drinking coke ) wants . 
  it 's funny that you yourself created an example where the middle ground was an illusion that favored camp coke . 
  if we center on the actual issue of whether we need to _ drink coke _ or _ not drink coke _ , where is the middle ground ? 
  if you _ drink coke at all _ , even a bit , you 've already put yourself into one of the camps . 
  and if you do n't , and instead do e.g. , drink soda , then you 've also position 'd yourself in one of the camps . 
  there 's _ no middle ground _ for most issues . 
  a practical example of how the `` middle ground '' is used to manipulate public opinion is , for example , when the legislative body creates a law allowing ( or banning , depending on your political leaning ) abortion _ for everyone _ no questions asked . 
  there 's a public outcry , and thus they settle `` for the middle ground '' and allow/ban abortion only for +18 people , with father consent , etc. 
  ... which _ is exactly what the legislative body actually wanted to do in the first place _ . 
  the `` middle ground '' is , most of the time , an _ illusion _ . 
  it does not exist if you think of it rationally . 
  how do you define the middle ground ? 
  you do a on mondays , wednesdays and fridays and \u00ac a on tuesdays , thursdays and weekends ? 
  generally , the people who use the `` middle ground '' , `` centrist '' , etc. 
  arguments are just carefully moving the overton window right to where they want it .

  to sum it up very quickly , the law allows for a `` suspected '' terrorist to be detained for _ no reason _ up to 3 weeks . 
  during this time , the suspect has no right to know what he is being accused of , or if he is at all . 
  he has no right to legal counsel ( no lawyer for you ! ), 
  or any other type of external communication whatsoever ( no phone call to family , no internet , nothing ) . 
  after the 3 weeks are over , a judge may even call for additional `` preventive '' prison time . 
  officially , this may only be invoked in cases where there is a `` proven '' membership to an `` armed group '' with the goal of `` disturbing constitutional order '' . 
  in practice : * it 's been used to detain lawyers of eta terrorists long enough to ensure they would _ miss _ their own trials !, 
  http://www.20minutos.es/noticia/2344497/0/guardia-civil/detenciones-abogados/frente-carceles-eta/ ( spanish ) * `` problematic '' trade union members because they `` broke a security camera '' http://www.europapress.es/noticia.aspx?cod=20070219163720&amp;ch=294 ( spanish ) * a newspaper had all of its journalists `` detained '' until their newspaper went under : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/egunkaria . 
  all of them were later found not guilty in court . 
  rumors of torture . 
  * having a `` funny '' hairstyle https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/caso_4f ( spanish ) . 
  yes , this happened . 
  poor girl suicided right after she got out of prison . 
  there 's even a documentary series about it : https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/ciutat_morta ( spanish ) . 
  * pgp users ( off-the-shelf cryptographic software ) https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/01/security-not-crime-unless-youre-anarchist put yourself on their shoes : you 're using pgp and suddenly swat team rushes in , puts bag on your head , throws you into prison . 
  they do n't tell you what you 're being detained for . 
  they do n't tell your lawyer . 
  in fact , they do n't let you contact your lawyer or anyone else . 
  weeks start passing by ... 
  this is not science fiction . 
  this _ has happened _ on this country in the 21st century . 
   update : source https://muslimstatistics.wordpress.com   that 's not a hateful thing to say , just the truth . 
  how come you call the `` truth '' a pamphlet whose main source for the first article is literally whisper ( `` police rumors '' ) , whose secondary sources are interpolations from decade old polls whose own authors have said not to use the data for that interpretation ( which the article itself refers as a `` coverup '' ) , whose title is clearly chosen to send a broken message ( `` 100 % of rapes commited by less than 1 % of the population !, 
  '' ) , even if we assume that the data is true , and whose assumptions are completely thrown away by a single counterexample -- france -- right in the comments ? 
  show all the data you want and we can discuss it , but stop calling random musings the `` truth '' . 
  not really . 
  if you 're talking about youth unemployment , all that does is delay the average patterning age ; people have children later in life ( late 30s is not rare ) . 
   how do spanish people deal with their small children ? 
  one word : grandmas . 
  ( sigh ) . 
   think not that i am come to send peace on earth : i came not to send peace , but a sword . 
  please read your bible again before you come to the conclusion that he is advocating to turn the sword on your relatives . 
  gandhi is well-know to have said that it is better to be violent than to do nothing , i.e. 
  he 's never encouraged `` to roll over and die '' as someone above put , but that 's too much for this conversation already . 
  certainly , i never doubted that . 
  in fact , to quote a rather poor movie that had a similar ideology , `` the only winning move is not to play '' . 
  that is at the core of pacifist ideology . 
  consider that the objective of the people that follow that strategy is to avoid killing others , not `` winning games '' . 
  it 's hard to argue that `` not killing anyone , period '' is a bad strategy for that . 
  if you had to kill anyone to win , it was not a victory . 
   you have no idea of gandhi , nor satyagraha of course not .

  should we * blame * the agenda 2010 for this ? 
  germany was ages without minimum wage and without a significant problem of working poor getting welfare or not earning enough to live before these reforms . 
  i have heard that these reforms helped to make germany more competitive , but it may have had other effects . 
  most of them , i am going to write the things that i have heard from : andalusia : * corrupt . 
  * full of gypsies , * socially conservative , bullfighting loving people that has voted the socialist party 36 year and counting * subsidized * they are lazy and live from welfare schemes * they work 60 hours/weeks in the submerged economy to live in poverty ( both are true for different people ) * corrupt : eres , marbella , jesus gil , sandokan ... basques * privileged fuckers , still with the old laws ( fueros ) . 
  their corporate tax is always 2 % lower that the rest of the country . 
  * terrorist * unsupportive , they are the richest part of the country and they do n't contribute to the national solidarity framework ( because they supported the right king in a civil war 300 years ago ) * brutes : because terrorism and basque sports . 
  and not only to gypsies and black people like everybody . 
  to the spaniards ( maketos ) . 
  they believe they are special with their old language , their old traditions and their odd surnames . 
  therefore the successful comedy [ 8 apellidos vascos ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ocho_apellidos_vascos ) ( 8 basque surnames ) catalonia : * believes that is better the others . 
  * wannabe rich * they waste their money in promoting their language and trying to have a regional foreign policy and stuff like that . 
  * they should accept that their language is useless and the immigrants from of other parts of spain to learn it . 
  * edit : this was important . 
  the worse thing that you can be ** polacos/polish ** . 
  [ there is even a catalan show called polonia due to all the jokes ] ( http://www.tv3.cat/ptv3/tv3totsvideos.jsp?idint=200292966 ) galicia * corrupt ( feijoo & dorado , clan of the baltar , case pokemon , case beb\u00e9 , case muralla , case campeon ) * drug dealing : most of the drug cartels are based on galicia ( marcial dorado and his friends ) . 
  madrid : * fucking capital bastards , they live from use they are ruling us ... the rest of the country hates them . 
  * madrid would be nothing if the government stopped favouring them . 
  ** valencia ( my homeland ) ** * full of corruption ( ghost airports , ghost cinema studios , highways to nowhere ) * it has a weird relation with catalonia . 
  * it has always to try to show that is better than catalonia . 
  if they build port aventura , we build terra m\u00edtica . 
  they have formula-1 circuit we had to have an urban formula-1 circuit . 
  but it always ends badly and costing a lot of tax payer money . 
  :( * the spanish nationalist identity is stronger than the local ( the catalans look down on us for that ) . 
  * ceuta & melilla * full of moors * isolated * they live from public money and i think that i could keep going .

  [ duke of alba , never forget ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fernando_%c3%81lvarez_de_toledo,_3rd_duke_of_alba ), 
  you 're worse ~ ~ slave ~ ~ slav . 
  let 's be honest . 
  10 years ago the republicans , the opposition to the establishment , catalan independence movement , anti-corruption movements , chavist left ... were very small . 
  if the living standards were improving instead of falling most of the people would be happy the rotten country . 
  even now , rajoy was elected with an absolute majority in 2011 despite financing illegally his 2008 campaign . 
  and everybody knew it since 2009 . 
  but he promised higher salaries , more jobs and less taxes and who cares about anything else ? 
  ( he has given the opposite , and that 's why he is n't popular anymore , no all the corruption and authoritarian behaviour ), 
  germany always has too much ambition . 
  the next thing is wanting siberia . 
  before cameron all the left ( at least the spanish ) was opposing to juncker . 
  the republican furor is more like a signal of increasing social unrest . 
  the king has been used by the establishment as a symbol of itself . 
  and the more unpopular becomes the establishment the more unpopular will be the king . 
  therefore , if the things do n't get better for the population the monarchy will become more and more unpopular . 
  it 's not the fault of the king ; he does n't get involved in politics ; he has been drinking , whoring , hunting and doing tourism full time the last 20 years and 10 years ago the monarchy was very popular . 
  the new king does n't have the powers to take action about any of the problems of our society , and a king ca n't denounce a government . 
  and if the openly corrupt government wants to use him as a shield he ca n't avoid it . 
  the coronation has been used by the conservatives and the catholic church and he ca n't do anything about that . 
  the furor against the monarchy will probably calm down . 
  but it may appear against the mortgage law ( again ) , against the lack of separation between church and state , against the corruption , those small outbreaks there and there were the government tries to do a shady construction project and a group of people ends fighting against the police to stop the project ( they succeed in gamoral and barcelona ) ... 
  the pressure is growing . 
  this country ca n't continue forever as it has been these years . 
  it may fall apart literally as yugoslavia , or reform peacefully , or go chavist ( a newly created party [ podemos ] ( http://i.imgur.com/2yx35fm.jpg ) got 8 % of the vote at the eu elections and was created 100 days before by the university professor and tv showman at the picture ) . 
   that does n't mean warsaw is poor , average wage , after taxes , is something like $ 1750 . 
  that 's higher than my home city ( valencia ) . 
  it would be $ 1,500 and valencia is more expensive than warsaw . 
  ** spain ** the big news are the world cup elimination and the new king and you know both . 
  * felipe vi has become the new king with a surprisingly strong republican reaction . 
  * spain has been eliminated from the world cup . 
  * the government is working in a fiscal reform to reduce income taxes to middle and higher earners , but [ the severance pay tax exemptions will fall to 2000 euros/year ] ( http://www.abc.es/economia/20140620/abci-despido-pago-irpf-201406192125.html ) ( before the severance pays were tax free , and at this country some years 3 % of the gdp has been severance pays ) , reducing the corporate tax for big companies to the same rate as sme ( 25 % ) , and a flat rate capital gains replacing the current progressive one .

2 months later and your figures have doubled . 
  and more interventionist wars started in the name of preventing these attacks create more chaos in the middle east , which leads to more immigrants , which leads to more sleeper cells , which leads to more terrorism , etc. . . and all of those immigrants will be voting left to give themselves free money , which will encourage new immigrants , who will vote left to give themselves free money , etc. . . and everybody loses because the left tax the middle class while the terrorists blow them up . 
  shut your mouth , your government brought this on you . 
  isis 's claim of having sleeper agents amongst the migrant groups are terrifying . 
  i 'm worried that things may become very bad for * everybody * in europe . 
  maybe they 'll swim across to canada ... 
  all these ~ ~ syrians ~ ~ * new swedes * will be voting for the left-wing parties in the future though , so they can get more free shit . 
  once these welfare migrants start voting sweden is screwed , because they 'll just vote to give themselves more free stuff . 
  i just went a few weeks ago , it 's awesome, 
  yeah , 2015 is only 3/4ths over .

  what the fuck is wrong with german voters ?? 
  most people wo n't be able to afford to bribe fisherman to take them to the mainland , where they wo n't even be able to travel anyways . 
  having a different opinion than you makes me sound childish ? 
  believing that people should be free to destroy their bodies and their lives as they see fit is childish ? 
  i do n't think so . 
  no , we do n't need more vigilante violence to solve this problem . 
  interference in saddam hussein 's iraq is what allowed isis to form in the first place . 
  he was an evil dictator , but at least he was secular and killed terrorists . 
  hahaha !, 
  those stupid fuckers . 
  i 'm actually laughing at them . 
  i do n't know why it is . 
  i do n't think it should be . 
  killing people is worse than getting them fired . 
  yes , and he probably was screwing her too, 
  stop importing terrorists pls,

  they do n't kill people, 
  it 's ok to be attracted to younger women , but if they 're not finished with puberty then it 's disgusting .

  you make vague nods to other forms of slavery , but how does working in exchange for profit needed to survive constitute slavery ? 
  \\  citing marx unironically the argument is n't about alienation , it 's about how working to survive is not slavery . 
  [ exchanging labor for commodities/payment is not slavery . 
  it 's a religion packed in with an ideology ( sharia ) .

  i do n't speak german , but here 's a ( terribly ) google translated version of the article . 
  if a better translation is posted please upvote that to the top . 
   cologne ( ots ) - prosecutors and police cologne announce  the investigating authorities ask the population urgently to assist in the search for an approximately 45 - 50 year-old man . 
  the stranger , who is described by employees of the market from the appearance as `` from the middle east to arise '' , has bought last friday ( january 22 ) in a hardware store in pulheim chemicals , from which one can produce an explosive mixture with appropriate knowledge . 
  an employee of the construction market informed the local police the next day . 
   intensive investigations of police state security police k\u00f6ln have not led so far to identify the man . 
  the 170-175 cm tall , slim stranger spoke good german . 
  he 's got a pointed nose and high receding hairline . 
  he is wearing a short dark beard , in the chin area slightly gray . 
   according to previous investigations , the unknown has left at 16.20 clock the hardware store at the siemens road towards pulheim walk . 
  images of the construction market show the fugitives . 
   important additional :  there is no guarantee that the purchase of commonly given for purification measures chemicals is linked to a suitable third party , criminal motivated use . 
   prosecutors and police take the hint very serious particularly in view of the current security situation and the responsibility of citizens . 
  insofar as the wanted man himself recognizes , and the chemicals were intended for domestic use , the police asks for immediate contact with a law enforcement agency . 
  witnesses who know the man are asked to turn over to the police emergency call 110 .

  is this sort of bavarian mentality similar in austria ? 
  apparently the least discriminatory place were the eastern cities like leipzig . 
  i always thoughts that 's where racism was more rampant , no ? 
  right , i 'm not saying they should be banned from protesting . 
  but i 'm asking for the logic/reasoning behind the protests . 
  good news . 
  i do n't understand why people protest against deportations if that 's the law of the country ? 
  i mean , you 're going there in hopes of being granted asylum but you have to recognise that there 's a good chance it will be denied and you will be sent back . 
  that 's what the process is about , it 's not like once you reach german territory you 're free to stay and do whatever you want for how ever long you want . 
  also , apparently the deportees were identified as criminal offenders , possible attackers and individuals who failed to identify themselves . 
  those reasons are more than enough to justify deportations , honestly . 
  and then people continue protesting at the airports ... why ? 
  also the village liqian , which has a lot of people with ` caucasian ' features like light coloured eyes , european noses and light coloured hair . 
  some people hypothesise that the roman prisoners of war settled there and the name comes for the latin word for legion , ` legio . ', 
   the event was sanctioned by the town hall and welcomed by mayor francisco cuenca as an act promoting granada as a `` city of co-existence and tolerance . '', 
  it was promoted with signs saying `` come and know ramadan '' . 
  because the city promoted it . 
  yes ... and it 's only going to get worse . 
  and it 's going to be 40 degrees here on saturday !, 
  holy shit , the rise in syrians from 2010 to 2016 is astronomical,

  what ? 
  where is this true ? 
  at least in madrid and barcelona , it 's really not close at all . 
  persians are not arabs . 
  i have nothing against either group of people , but you ca n't compare them with such a blanket statement by simply classifying them all as muslims . 
  the polish people in this sub mostly complain about arab immigrants from places like syria , afghanistan , iraq imagine calling portuguese and armenians the same because they 're both culturally christian . 
  a lot of persians i know would actually be offended if you call them arab . 
  i think he 's referencing a user on / r/europe whose name is aleix and is very pro-independence on the sub, 
  what a joke, 
  at least we can explore dank memes, 
   i am very , very pro eu , but things like this , and this can be said about greece and portugal as well where i notice the same attitude to smoking , makes me thing that uk is so far ahead in some areas we might be better off with a brexit lol !, 
  just stay in england next time mate , you do n't need to punish yourself by coming to our little backwards country . 
  a bit ironic that the people you had a problem with happened to be british .

  it 's going to be interesting to see how many people participate this time . 
  even though i 'm against independence i will certainly vote . 
  if labour somehow win , i would pay a lot of money just to see may 's reaction as the results come in .

  it 's clear to us but new generations who are learning this part of history for the first time might think these camps were run by poles, 
  this sounds like something fn would do . 
  i 'm loving every second of it . 
  i loved that film, 
  how professional of them, 
  today is a good day to be european lads, 
  one thing i 'll certainly enjoy is your tears, 
  ahhh i 'm so happy,

  jajajaja le pen al carrer, 
  i really like big elections , there 's something about staying up late looking at results and news that really entertains me . 
  hopefully we 'll have a good result tonight !, 
  god i wish we ( europe ) sanction the shit out of putin and his regime . 
  those e-mail leaks do n't seem to have much damning content but the fact that he keeps interfering with western elections is very concerning . 
  le pen has become even more pathetic by turning into another russian puppet in the west , and the sad thing is that there are many who do no see through that . 
  here 's to a macron victory and here 's to the end of the putin regime . 
  no offense but i have more faith in the french than i ever did in the americans . 
  please do not try to paint trump or his party as a more liberal candidate than clinton . 
  reddit backed clinton because most of the people here are left leaning and are against right wing candidates . 
  it 's honestly not hard to figure out . 
  it has nothing to do with anti-establishment shit , trump and clinton are both very establishment . 
  reddit has never been a fan of the far right . 
  seeing most of this site support a more leftist candidate is not surprising at all . 
  how delusional do you have to be to think that the majority of a liberal site like reddit would support far-right populist politicians like trump and le pen ? 
  honestly , i ca n't believe how pathetic they are . 
  i wish i could see the faces of all these idiots when le pen gets defeated in a couple of days, 
  hahaha go back to 4chan mate, 
  and yet , the daily mail is still 10x worse . 
  lmao , let the alt-righters have a little bit of hope at least . 
  ( not really ),

  i mean , redditor for 0 days ... 
  even the troika said that , that is why they spoke about debt restructuring some years ago , but finally it never `` came live '' . 
  the decision was never `` will greece pay half or the entire debt ? '' . 
  there was and there is no scenario in which greece can pay all the debt . 
  it is just utterly impossible . 
  however , you can not sell that to your voters so the plan was to keep kicking the ball forward so at least `` we '' wo n't have to deal with it . 
  they only way greece can pay a fraction of its debt , is through real growth and debt restructure . 
  then , debtors will be able to collect some of the money . 
  if this is not the case , they wo n't collect any , because a bankrupt country , as a dead man , can not pay back . 
  i answered the same to another redditor in the comment below . 
  sure , you are right . 
  however , i think that i have never seen the eu so anti one government as in this case . 
  i understand that the work is twice as hard . 
  about the local policies ? 
  i do n't know , we will have to see . 
  as i said before , it is more about being honest than about other things . 
  i guess that living in spain for so long , i expect very little to politicians ... 
  on the other hand , they have achieved many favorable things in the agreements . 
  other greek government would have accepted 4 months ago , with even worse conditions . 
  given the little amount of power they had in negotiations , they have the whole continent pending on what they are going to say on sunday . 
  do you think with other politicians it would have been possible ? 
  i do n't think so . 
  i think he has a very clear idea , either correct or not , and he seems to have a plan . 
  and he is brave enough to just say i would cut my arm before singing something i do n't agree with . 
  and so far , he has n't done it . 
  i compare him with our ministers , and i could not be more envious . 
  just because of the honesty , not because of personality or even ideas . 
  oh , i am definitively considering to vote for podemos . 
  watching the alternatives , it is for me either podemos or iu , and i think that a good shake in the table is what this country needs . 
  psoe has sold itself and pp is just a cancer for the country . 
  i still think that there is no figure like varoufakis among podemos , who is available for the econmin . 
  edit : grammar corrections . 
  i can not find the exact article i read back in time , too many things have been written about the whole issue , but i find a nice gathering of broken promises in [ video format ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoy3uipo13c ) ( i do n't know if you are good enough to understand it , but do n't worry , sometimes i too can not understand rajoy ) here an [ article ] ( http://economia.elpais.com/economia/2012/11/30/actualidad/1354283253_940492.html ) about rajoy breaking his last promise , almost exactly one year after the elections . 
  no , you do n't have to . 
  politicians say that , even if it is not true , so at the end , the people who do not know about the topic , believe it . 
  you can not lose it , but you can renounce to it . 
  thank you for the information anyway , i was not aware of that clause in the constitution . 
  according to the eu , the best prime minister would be the one who lied in the books for greece to enter in the euro . 
  or at least that is what they were saying during the past elections . 
  i think you are all treating greek people like if they were kids . 
  greek people who plans to vote no knows that no means that it could be a worse situation for a certain amount of time , but a light at the end of the tunnel . 
  i think that the troika are the ones making it look like praising the moon . 
  would you imagine that ? 
  it would be a political tsunami . 
  however , as varoufakis says , the rest of europe is basically the only player who do n't agree with reality , because we are an interested part in the issue . 
  i go into the internet an i only see experts and governments from other countries ( in the opposite positions of the political spectrum sometimes ) saying what varoufakis says . 
   i just hate the way he says it . 
  he only has one gear . 
  he does n't know how to be calm and express himself in a way that is n't so damn defensive . 
  because he is not a politician , but a professor . 
  i agree that i would like him to be able to modulate his speech , because he probably would attract much more people to a speech i mostly agree with . 
  i know it is not a popular opinion here , but if we had more varoufakis in politics , europe would be a better place . 
  not because of his personality , but because he knows what is he speaking about and he is honest with his own believes , which is something i appreciate in a politician , of any position in the spectrum . 
  is this allowed ? 
  i am asking it seriously . 
  as far as i know , the human rights prevent you from taking people 's nationality . 
  however , i think it is the case to prevent them being stateless . 
  so i am not sure how it would be in this case . 
  yes , that is why i put the `` europe '' between quotation marks . 
  there are many courts in europe and i am not an expert , so i think it can be done , i am not sure which path would be the best . 
  i saw him in `` salvados '' ( a spanish tv show which i love ) and i found him very reasonable . 
  i wish i could have politics like him , despite we may not agree in all the ideas . 
  still better accent than in spain , if we could speak english , of course . 
  comparing yourself to extremadura is like playing football poorly and saying that you did better that the guy without legs . 
  the name of that region is not a coincidence . 
  he is telling you that it is an statistical trick , what you have used . 
  i would say it took longer because of the foreigners who came here , because they were more structured than the republican militias . 
  surely republicans fought until the very end and the help of other fascists helped franco to win . 
  the artillery and war-machines were really helpful . 
  however , i think the the major flaw in the republican side was , indeed , the distinct factions that had a lot of internal fights . 
  `` de riesgo '' means `` of risk '' or `` risky '' ( situation de riesgo , risky situation , for example ) prima is the name for the daughter of the siblings of your parents , so your cousin . 
  but also , is the term for primes and premiums . 
  and the exact terminology for the case . 
  a government that try to undermine the rights of the people through terror is using terrorism . 
  the problem is that we are too used to associate it only with bombs or assassinations . 
  terrorism is much wider . 
  as far as i know , if it is against the human rights , like it is in this case ( since , for example , you are negated a fair trial ) , the eu can overrule it . 
  `` do n't be evil '' would be translated into spainish as `` roba lo que quieras y l\u00e1rgate con lo que puedas '' ( `` steal all you want and get away with what you can '' ) to keep the traditions of spain 's rulers . 
  i am not sure how they would translate it into the other spanish languages or portuguese , but i guess that something similar . 
  that is sadly true , as i said , it is like a football match . 
  `` i do n't want psoe to win , so i will vote pp '' instead of `` psoe failed my expectations , i am going to pick up a party that remains closer to my vision of the situation '' . 
   and the king do you know that ciu was funded , and still is , a monarchy party , right ? 
  they push for an independence , but to remain under the same king . 
  for the rest , i am not going to defend pp , because they are even worse than what you described . 
  but i think that ciu is a cancerous party itself , just like pp . 
  actually , yes . 
  two of the best things done by the previous government . 
   they only ban unauthorized protests , do you know what is the funny part about this bit ? 
  in spain it does not exist an `` unauthorized protest '' . 
  protest are always legal , according to the constitution itself , and only can be dispersed or banned afterwards or in foresight of a dangerous situation by a judge . 
  if tomorrow we start a protest for whatever reason in the middle of madrid , we do n't need to ask permission or give any information to anyone . 
  you probably want to , for logistic purposes , but not for legal reasons . 
  it is just an example of how repeating a lie one thousand times in politics , it becomes a fact . 
   it may be me but i know a family that lives in `` their '' house after an organization stopped their eviction . 
  they were disconnected from the electric grid and the activists reconnected them . 
  nobody talks about how they drove around in bmws ( several hundred meters to the bakery just so people could see them in the cars ) and their `` i 'm better than you attitude '' they had while they were spending the money they loaned but hey , i 'm not bitter they got their cake and ate it and my family only spends what we have . 
  what a demagogic piece of **** is your comment . 
  now , people who is going to be evicted in a country with 25 % of unemployment is because they want . 
  and they have bmw !, 
  and they are arrogant !,

  yeah , i have a hard time believing ukraine , a country actively at war , has a similar amount of guns as the uk . 
  granted i 'm sure most of the uk guns are way old hunting shotguns , but still . 
  that 's because it 's a multi party system . 
  the way the us system works where you have to win within your party means lots of pandering to the loudest groups . 
  of course us elections are classically start extreme and then move to the center for the general election and when the more extreme candidate wins the party , it 's generally a disaster because of how the voting system is . 
  ( that 's why i laugh about reddit 's sanders ' obsession thinking he wo n't be like george mcgovern or walter mondale ) . 
  in a well-made multiparty system , each little faction gets their own party and then they make the appropriate concession to each other to form the coalition roughly in proportion with how they were voted . 
  usually this means the more centrist groups are able to form a coalition and government competence results . 
  i bet it 's that most people do n't know the estadela vs. not estadela thing with your flair . 
  do n't worry , i appreciate the joke . 
  for spain it 'd definitely be ourselves . 
  we 're all about debt in spain . 
  lots of historical inflation and random devaluations helped that . 
  also worth mentioning that ohl is involved in a big corruption mess in mexico as well . 
  does n't mean he 'll be able to do it . 
  but he 'll almost certainly drag out the process to make it so new elections will happen if he fails . 
  my company is militantly against this . 
  it 's maddening . 
  we got one as a gift once . 
  it was huge and kind of pointless as i was n't actually going to use it for anything so i just took it to the bank . 
  was definitely novel , though . 
  i do n't think i 've ever actually used a 200 $ for a purchase either . 
  i do like using my credit card for everything . 
  is n't that like 30 $ a day just in tolls ? 
  and i bitch about having to pay 70 $ for an unlimited transport pass to commute . 
  yeah , i have to say , i do n't really like the idea of ruling that a private company does n't have the right to limit terms like that based on a non-discriminatory reason . 
  it would be perfectly legal for a website to host only nude photos and say any others wo n't be accepted and the reverse should be true , as well . 
  it 's not like facebook is anywhere near a monopoly on photo sharing either , so there are plenty of options . 
  the news here said 100 $ per day . 
  around 400.000 $ which seems very low to me . 
  he also had to sleep in a church last night . 
  they could n't even get him a hotel . 
  and germany only cared about not allowing ussr more influence . 
  same reason spain got into nato . 
  nobody gave a fuck about the people involved . 
  the war ended up as a proxy war between fascists and communists . 
  by the end the same could have been said about the ussr . 
  by the middle of the war , the country was going to be fucked for decades regardless of the outcome and there was no good way out by that point . 
  i honestly thought the place was really creepy in general and being there has a sort of intangible feeling that 's hard to describe but i definitely consider going there as something that really helped me understand spain when figuring it out when i got here . 
  it 's worth mentioning that all of scariest cases are cases that the companies have n't actually won . 
  i 'm all for the ability for everyone to actually sue if they believe they actually have a case . 
  else there is no way to actually challenge things . 
  but the process does tend to work and nobody gives crazy examples of cases that have actually been decided . 
  there 's a reason for that . 
  so far we have a quote of a statement of fact that looks pretty bad out of context and a leader that sucks at presenting information . 
  i basically would like to see the context of that . 
  it sounds shitty to me but not `` grab your pitchforks '' shitty . 
  rather a large organization trying to change course but coming up short due to the typical things that happen in a large organization . 
  it 's really not acceptable and this needs to be fixed but i 'd like to see the context of the document . 
  and it 's sadly true that even the worst case this prevents is certainly an improvement on the absolutely shameful way the church handled the abuses cases by actively hiding problems . 
  i hope i 'm not coming off as a defender of the church here , but i think honest assessments are necessary rather than everything being absolutely terrible no matter what . 
  negligence is better than malice but it 's not good enough for what they need to accomplish and i think actual constructive criticism of why is the way to make sure that 's understood . 
  not that i do n't trust the guardian to be totally impartial on matters regarding the church , but is there a non-guardian source on this ? 
  i 'm perfectly willing to say that , as presented , it 's horrible but i suspect there may be some nuance in the original statement . 
  the damning quote is just a statement of fact and is in no way presented as guidance . 
  it could very well be followed with the fact that they are morally obligated even if the corresponding laws make it not obligatory . 
   business can run profitably even with decent salaries , its the profit margin that would be lessened . 
  there still would be profit just not as much . 
  you have to compare that risk to the risk of just taking the money that you would make and investing it and long term market gains are close to 7-8 % so being profitable but slightly less profitable is n't good enough if the money it takes to make that profit would be better spent just giving it to a bank . 
  adding risks of activity , your margins really need to be 10-15 %, 
  yeah , i 'd be all for more freelancing . 
  it 's really a good way to get more money if you are okay with less security . 
  but you 're right that the market is unfortunately much smaller than it could be for it . 
  here it 's very common to have engineering subcontractor companies that give you an indefinite contract and subcontract you out to the other companies . 
  the salaries do tend to be slightly lower than the direct hires but that 's because it basically means that you wo n't have to fire direct hires because you can cut the costs by means of not keeping the subcontracted engineers . 
  that said , the salary differences are much lower than people seem to think and everyone just imagines that they could pocket the difference that the subcontracting company takes if they worked directly but it just does n't work that way . 
  cost of living and taxes are also much lower in germany . 
  i used to live in the us and made almost double what i do in spain . 
  but at the end of the day , i live a similar lifestyle ( probably slightly better in madrid , honestly ) and save more in absolute terms because the costs are so dramatically lower . 
  it really cuts both ways though . 
  i 've been on the technical side and now i 'm on the business side of engineering . 
  you really just ca n't compete in the global marketplace with crazy salaries , especially when korea is a thing . 
  and engineering is a global business . 
  so basically the truer statement is that there are n't enough engineers to fill positions at a salary level that allows for market competitiveness and a business that can actually be run profitably . 
  it 's a much subtler point but it really is true . 
  and yes the us can have much higher salaries but that 's because they basically have no protection from being fired . 
  knowing that you can get rid of that cost instantly and for no extra cost lowers the risk a lot and risk ultimately translates to money . 
  that 's not how bonds work . 
  it 's not a variable interest rate . 
  there is a secondary market where the prices change , but the initial coupon is fixed and people are willing to accept bonds that pay less than their price right now just for the security of knowing they will be paid that much . 
  `` free '' money is just 0 % interest rate and it 's not particularly special on a continuous line that also includes negative interest rates . 
   all this also makes me very skeptical of these so called self-driving cars that are supposedly around the corner . 
  i do n't see self-driving cars becoming a thing anytime soon , but i do like the tesla approach of making it similar to an airplane . 
  it 's still the human with ultimate control ( and legal liability ) but they have basically autopilot features that allow you to cruise without much though . 
  that said , as people do n't have management and quality procedures and obligatory rest periods , it could very well end up with a lot of crashes . 
  or they will have to install something like the dead man switch where you have to push the button every 2 minutes or something . 
  quite honestly that can be budgeted for relatively easily . 
  at least from an accounting perspective . 
  maybe a bit harder politically . 
  there 's clearly a balance but when people are literally paying you for bonds , it seems to me to be pretty clearly on the side of `` spend now '' . 
  i 'm shocked the germans are on board with this . 
  i might actually be cautiously optimistic that inflationphobia might actually be dealt with if this were to happen as they 'd have to actually account for more than just germany/netherlands in reality . 
  i still say thank god an italian runs the ecb . 
  seriously . 
  even isis runs their budgets in usd . 
  i think that 's probably it . 
  baleares/andalusia/valencia / canaries all have a fair amount of people to balance out the odd barfight gone wrong . 
  ryanair bringing in loads of drunken brits that get out of hand . 
  this is just fucked up from all sides . 
  this just reinforces my view that especially at the municipal level ideology really is n't anywhere near as important as basic competence .

  the power of taste . 
  munich water is completely safe , yet the taste of calcium if very annoying . 
  if you drink a lot like me , it can cause a nausea . 
  we have to decalcify the water boiler at work every week . 
  i guess that if you are used to it , when you go abroad for a shorter period of time , it is a custom that you may maintain . 
  in germany there are also plenty of flower fields without fence or guardian , where you will also find a balance , a box and a sign with different prices . 
  basically , you go there , pick the flowers that you want , weight them and put the money in the box . 
  there are plenty . 
  i have seen some men wearing different kinds in the streets and they looked very nice . 
  i have been looking for one for myself , but damn if they are not expensive ... 
  godamnit , spain , put a damn antenna like everybody else and enter the top 3 . 
   extremely thick skin i guess that donald trump is the exception to this rule . 
  they have been legal in the entire country since more than a decade , if i am not wrong . 
  the basque country was the first region to allow th creation of clubs . 
  what was done in catalonia is to allow these clubs to be larger and to allow them to move and distribute the cannabis , because now they are restricted in size and the cannabis can only be consumed inside the club 's location . 
  for the people on the top ? 
  of course : these are not their children . 
  you can do a lot of things with a rotten heart and no moral standards . 
  as far as i know , having your plants and consuming them inside your private property , away from the sight of public is as legal as drinking alcohol or smoking tobacco . 
  the only problem is that the threshold amount is not set anywhere , sonot depends on circumstances , etc. 
  it is only mentioned that the amount should be not more than for moderate personal use . 
  i do n't smoke and thus i have only check the status for the sake of curiosity , but there are plenty of legal cannabis associations all across spain , so interested people should ask them . 
  not in spain , for personal use . 
  although with the gag law of the pp , what personal use means has been very restricted . 
  it is still legal , but you have to grow your own plants ( no selling , no gifting , etc ) and the cultivation must be in your own property and it must not be visible to the public . 
  edit : you can also be a member of a cannabis association ( there is a legal process , etc ) , in which all members are allowed to grow it together and shar it among themselves . 
  but i am not sure if this is legal or based in a loophole , however it is not illegal . 
  it is only illegal to possess or carry enough they it can be considered that your intention is to provide or sell it to someone . 
  there are plenty of shops , however , that will sell you all the equipment and the seeds required . 
  they have a lot of imagery of marijuana , but they advertise as natural shops , etc. 
  at 20 my girlfriend wears a summer jacket because it is chilling . 
  in the spanish congress this happened the 23 of february of 1981 , better known as [ 23-f . ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcc0_8i0cys ) probably the longest night of the , at the time , new born democracy . 
  sadly , during some workings on the roof for a water leakage , some of the bullet holes were mistakenly removed . 
  i think they are an important piece of spanish history , so i hope they put special effort taking care of the remaining . 
   if civil union gives same rights as marriage than its the best outcome . 
  it never does . 
  that is why the fight about the name is so important . 
  well , it depends . 
  there are plenty of things i like about spain and there are plenty of things i do n't like about spain . 
  and , besides that , there is the big if , as you called it . 
  immigrants and foreign born population are two different things . 
  if you get a nationality , you are no longer an immigrant , but you are still foreign born . 
  and , besides , i am talking about the legal terminology and what statistics usually mean , not what some people might or might not think about the topic . 
  you are just mixing a lot of things up , i fear . 
  oh , come on . 
  they criticize themselves extensively . 
  that is how they got somethings very right . 
  it is not like that magically appeared out of nowhere . 
  the difference is that people from the north tend to be less self-loathing ( in spain , people love to complain about almost anything but would n't change a thing to solve it ) and more about active application of the self-criticism . 
  it does n't mean that everything is perfect here , but saying that they do not criticize themselves is displaying a clear ignorance about the topic . 
  that influence can be felt in granada perfectly nowadays . 
  el barrio de las teter\u00edas ( tea shops neighbourhood ) could be called `` little morocco '' and it is one of the most popular places to go out with friends . 
  if you have a secured job and funding , spain is not a bad place to live . 
   i think that they are counted as immigrants even if they get the nationality . 
  in legal terms , an immigrant is short for `` foreign nationals with temporal or permanent residence permit '' . 
  once they are spanish , they are not immigrants anymore in the statistics . 
  then there are other type of data , such as naturalized citizens vs born citizens , bloodline , etc. 
  people might bunch all of that together and call it `` immigrants '' but that does n't make it correct . 
  the `` facebook '' law has been debated for long and agreed before the voting . 
  this result was known beforehand . 
  for the gay marriage law , they needed all the votes of the supporters to get the majority . 
  it was not agreed beforehand what the result should be . 
  voting is very predictable . 
  you will only see most of the mps whenever the result has not been decided before . 
  disclaimer : i am not defending the censorship law . 
  i am just saying that this picture is what i would have expected . 
  well , thankfully merkel is just the chancellor of germany and not its queen . 
  at least this time the blitzkrieg tactics were used for good . 
  she wanted this to be voted on the next parliament , because she was betting on the good results of the elections . 
  she did slip in the sense that spd took her words , and reading the play , decided to push it known that the majority of the bundestag supports this piece of legislation . 
  she voted no because she is very conservative . 
  nobody expects the german legislation . 
  this recalled me to the fall of the wall . 
  one day , a politician slips in a press conference , and in less than a year , the wall was taken down . 
  those were lead pipes ( now iron pipes , if am not wrong ) , but i even that does n't make the statement misleading , because the pipes do not constitute a gluing material of the structure and they do nothing to improving the structural stability . 
  i wonder how this is calculated . 
  in many countries , the differences between regions are very big , even more taking into account that some of those regions are not even in the european continent . 
  i think that a heat map ( very appropriate name this time ) to at least nuts 2 or 3 would be the best way to visualise this kind of data . 
  it is not misleading . 
  there is no gluing material and the only thing that it 's keeping the structure in place is gravity . 
  he has two accessory slots . 
  he looks a bit like a younger christopher waltz . 
   a national socialist he declared to be does n't make him a nazist per s\u00e9 . 
  yes , of course it does . 
  it literally does exactly that . 
  nationalsozialismus ist german for national socialist . 
  i would say that the * worst part * is the part in which he declares himself shamelessly a nazi . 
  maybe helping people with chronic unemployment in a different way that do not reduce salaries is a better solution , i would say . 
  for example , if you are 50 , in my opinion it is better that you can go into early retirement with a living pension than the other option , which is to use you to replace a better-paid job . 
  you said it yourself : if you are in chronic unemployment is because you do not have any employable skills . 
  the only reason why companies would contract a person like that is because they are so much cheaper that the reduction in the cost will compensate for the lack of skills . 
  op pointed that macron was looking at denmark , which gdp grew three times less than france in the last decade . 
  is it better to have 10 % unemployment and good quality jobs or 5 % unemployment with lower quality jobs for a large segment of the previously employed population ? 
  for me , other aspects of the labour market such as jobs quality , chronic unemployment , etc. , are a much more important numbers than raw % of unemployment , unless it is something extremely high , like in greece or spain . 
  france 's gdp has grown much more than denmark 's in the last decade . 
  while i am not saying that it makes french model better , i am not sure why everybody thinks that it is so much worse . 
  i do n't like using gdp either , but since everybody in the thread seems to mention it , i think i should point out the faster growth of france . 
  p.s : and , by the way , i live in germany , i have worked here , and i know too well what the 3 % unemployment means . 
  i do n't know how other countries work , so i wo n't tell anything because i do n't want to be wrong . 
  but , in my opinion , issues like minijobs or 0 hours contract are not employment , are just make-up to present the numbers to the public .

  leave italy alone !!!, 
  lol your flag & flair combo . 
  spain  france . 
  all is well . 
  sure , we 're not denmark ( most transparent country in the world ) , but we 're not much different than france or the uk in that regard . 
  there 's a higher corruption ** perception ** right now but if you look at most indexes we appear to be very close to the rest of big eu countries being italy just a bit below . 
  you do n't go walking around the streets bribing the police forces so you do n't get fined or stuff like that . 
  that 's how you tell a country is extremely corrupt . 
  spain has problems with corruption but they 're not that different from the rest of w. europe . 
  otherwise we would n't look good in any index , including this one . 
  what 's going on with per\u00fa and what does it have to do with the finnish far right ? 
  also , i could play tennis on that guy 's forehead . 
  take that japan !, 
  or spain is not as corrupt as this subreddit and many spaniards think . 
  which is much more plausible than just giving a `` it 's the exception '' non-reason . 
   sorry guys you never apologize for saying the truth . 
  never . 
  brother !, 
  holy shit that parking gore . 
  yeah , no need to dox me , thanks . 
  trust me , it 's the first time we see it in a while . 
  here at least . 
  [ just a few kilometers north the city of madrid ] ( http://i.imgur.com/vtaumke.jpg ) 6\u00bac outside , but sunny after many days of cloudy/foggy/snowy / rainy/shitty weather . 
  fuck you , pirineos , you only had one job ... 
  til, 
  does n't look like a terrible place from the photos i 've seen . 
  i bet the gdp per capita is higher than here . 
  nah , that 's illios . 
  morella was in the national news three or four weeks ago because it snowed so hard [ they got like 100 l/m ^ 2 of snow in a couple of days ] ( http://www.levante-emv.com/castello/2017/01/22/nevada-morella-intensa-ultimo-siglo/1518808.html ) . 
  all the valencian coast and interior ( and even murcia , cartagena ... etc ) got their good share of snow in that front . 
  a couple of vids just to show how it was : - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gw8-xzzo6bu - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ehdd-unqcki ps : driving from ireland to cartagena ? 
  niiice , was it as cool as i imagine ? 
  i have all the books from \u00c9rase una vez el hombre xd, 
  i do n't share your point of view , you start from the premise that there 's nothing else you can do , and every story is a failing story ... that 's a pessimistic way to see it , not a realistic way . 
  being realistic you would have considered all the attempts made by people , companies , governments , ngos ... that precisely look for them and try to avoid things that you describe . 
  but you did n't consider them , you only presented a scenario where they are `` left '' with nothing , no help , no integration programmes , nothing . 
  precisely that 's not how it works in spain , there 's shit going on , although the central government is n't helping ... luckily some regional and municipal governments are . 
  if poor , uneducated/unskilled native people in risk of poverty in spain can get benefits , then they can too because it fits that criteria . 
  ps : we have a muslim population , and they 're ** very ** well integrated actually . 
  they cause much less trouble than the gypsies that ironically have been here for centuries and there 's still a shit-ton of work to do with that . 
  how can you not find more prosperity in spain than in syria ? 
  by that rule , you wo n't find more prosperity in the netherlands than in syria . 
  i said that for someone that 's leaving a place where you simply ca n't live anymore any country in europe is and will meet the following criteria : - is at peace . 
  - will find more prosperity than the land they 're coming from . 
  that 's what i said and it 's exactly the case of spain and portugal , too . 
  they 're safe , rich countries where you can live and develop your life in peace . 
  the criteria is met for what i said . 
  what 's the misconception ? 
   most pp voters are pro-referendum are n't they said by who ? 
  or the contrary to that because of the sarcasm . 
  as i said , your top argument was a downvote . 
  i stand by what i said . 
  no , people do n't agree 100 % in everything whatever the party they vote have to say ... that 's dumb and simplistic . 
  but this is one of those * traditional independentist * law : simplify it , so you can ridiculize it . 
  spain is the most pro-refugee country in europe . 
  sadly ** the government ** is not . 
  holy shit xd, 
  they only want to go to some selected areas , but there 's a lot of ignorance and this is the reason why there are so many news relating how some refugees felt `` disappointed '' when they settled in germany and claimed they wanted to leave . 
  they are told they will have x but when they arrive they find y. 
  it 's common to find disappointment when you live something different to what was you expecting . 
  with spain there 's something similar ... maybe they expect much less so it 's not a priority destination . 
  but honestly if you have got to the point that you have to leave everything behind ... any country in europe can and will be enough for someone to try to live in peace and with some prosperity , really . 
  that 's what he does on almost every issue whatsoever . 
  just have a look at his reddit history . 
  you are talking about pp voters , not pp , so you switch to `` pp is this , pp is that '' when someone points out not all the pp voters are literally hitler and think the same . 
  but i see that your top argument is a downvote so i 'd rather leave it there . 
  there 's no reasoning behind someone that do n't want to be reasonable . 
  believe it or not , not all pp voters are literally franco . 
   it seems that every issue can be used to push for the independence agenda . 
  the few statistics i 've seen about this show that spain is the most pro-refugees in eu . 
  so i would n't say that . 
  like if catalonia was n't spain or something . 
  good to see catalonia is the vanguard on this issue , together with madrid . 
  well they 're very different . 
  toledo ( ohio ) is a typical modern-looking city while this one is millenia old . 
  toledo ( ohio ) might not be very touristy , but i bet it 's also a very good place to live . 
  that photo is depressing . 
  we get it , you lake, 
  i thought it was going to be higher . 
  oh you call it napolitana too , nice . 
  we should just unify our countries , this is the ultimate proof that we are the same fucking people . 
  napolitana is exactly how we call this `` pain au chocolat '' in spain, 
  no u, 
  yeah , medieval cities were n't made thinking in today 's private transport . 
  that 's why american cities are so different to european ones , like this one . 
  toledo could be the most representative example of a typical important medieval european city . 
  yes , you can actually drive through its streets , like [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utndoufkya4 ) . 
  [ spain is far more than just a beach resort ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhus5bps65y ) . 
  that 's exactly what pedro s\u00e1nchez did ... before losing the elections ( and the control of the psoe ) lol . 
  good luck , jamoncito . 
  gibraltar comes right after that . 
  and andorra . 
  i 'm a republican but saying that being a republic means you get rid of corruption is just false . 
  also , i 'd vote republic in a referendum , because that 's just how i feel , but you also have to consider that a parlamentary monarchy is not entirely bad : look at norway , denmark , sweden , netherlands , uk ... 
  i do n't think they 're shit countries . 
  spain enjoys some advantages as well ( like a recognised long-lasting international `` vip '' ambassador to the world ), 
  bilbao covers them all , m9 . 
  if you want something similar ( and probably cheaper ) in spain try the provinces of cuenca , teruel or guadalajara . 
  lots of natural things to see , very low densely populated areas , beautiful scenary and fauna . 
  perfect rural places with no tourist massification at all ( just inner tourism , aka other spaniards visiting it and spending a week-end ),

  then deport them once the war is over ? 
  or alternatively pay one of syria 's neighbours for the costs of the camps there ? 
  well , is n't dacia a romanian car company and skoda a czech one ? 
  also , was n't skype designed by estonians ? 
  not much sure , but still . 
  poortugal can into east ftfy :p, 
  i found 2 : * retirement age is kept like it is now , but money thrown at pensions is fixed at current levels forever . 
  has the disadvantage of ever decreasing pensions ( say hello to 300 $ pensions in 2100 , which considering inflation will be nothing ) . 
  * we only allow a certain amont of people to be retired at once ( say , 20 % of the population ) . 
  has the disadvantage of ever increasing retirement ages ( say hello to a retirement age of 80 in 2100 ) . 
  imo , one of these 3 things will happen no matter what if population declines : * money thrown at pensions will increase forever * retirement age will keep increasing * pensions will become lower and lower probably all 3 at the same time . 
  imo we could solve the pension system without increasing inmigration . 
  there are tons of ideas . 
  i personally favour what i call a `` variable retirement age '' . 
  so say , allowing only x % of the population to be in retirement and receiving a pension . 
  of course this has the disadvantage of ever increasing retirement ages . 
  another could be one where pensioners always get x % of the budget , but no matter the number of pensioners , that number stays fixed . 
  again , this has the problem of ever decreasing pensions ( so by the end they are just a help , probably being impossible to live off your pension ) . 
  probably with a system where older pensioners get more than younger ones since they can take better care of themselves . 
  except greece has an unemployment rate of 23 % and spain an unemployment rate of 19 % . 
  so why not get spaniards or greeks instead of african and middle eastern so-called refugees ? 
  and even then automation can probably solve the problem just fine . 
   how do microstates ( liechtenstein , malta , monaco and the like ) survive these days ? 
  economically speaking of course . 
  they seem to be alive and kicking with no sign of disappearing any time soon . 
  what 's the secret ? 
  i do n't know about the others , but andorra is basically a self governing ski resort these days , that doubles as a tax heaven . 
  liechtenstein is also a dual tax heaven and ski resort . 
  as for the rest luxenbourg is also probably a tax heaven , while malta probably lives off tourism . 
  vatican city has the pope and monaco is full of rich people for some reason . 
  plus probably tourism the only one i 'm really baffled as to how it survives is san marino . 
  to be fair , had the republic won the war there was quite a high chance of spain becoming communist ( or maybe anarcho-syndicalist ) . 
  then again there was a big chance of hitler invading spain as well , turning the argument worthless . 
  a communist spain probably declares war on germany when they invade the ussr , and germany either blitzkriegs its way through spain ( turning it into a pile of rubble after 2 wars in less than 5 years ) or gets stopped by spain somehow . 
  for all what 's worth even though the crisis hit us hard , we seem to be safe . 
  our politicians might be corrupt , but at least they are not authoritarian  although catalonia is pulling some authoritarian moves because of the independence movement , in a `` the end justifies the means '' way , but that 's another story, 
  well , our salaries * are * quite low indeed , with the median salary probably being below 20 000 $ anually . 
  however we also do have good vacation time and benefits , definitely more than americans do . 
  other than the local , i only know 2 others that are banned : breitbart and buzzfeed . 
  if i had to guess i 'd say infowars is almost certainly banned as well . 
  for all what 's worth i just checked the spanish version of the local and it was pretty good . 
  it covered most of the news more or less fine . 
  and while sure , it has some clickbaity articles or headlines , it did n't feel like `` fake news '' to me . 
  for all what 's worth i do n't think we have that many outlets covering spain in english . 
  the only other one i can think of is [ el pais ' english edition ] ( https://elpais.com/elpais/inenglish.html ) which leaves out lots of stuff from the spanish version , sometimes important stuff ( like the firing of some catalan ministers for example ) . 
  yeah , they are extremely clickbaity , but on the other hand many times they are the only english outlet to cover a national story . 
  granted , since / r/europe does allow for submissions in languages other than english this is not as big of a problem but it 's still an ok outlet if you want to cover a certain story and do n't want to give people the link in your language . 
  so we should be mailing us senators against net neutrality so it gets passed out of spite ? 
  to be fair if you spend your data cap your speed does get throttled a lot . 
  so unless the zero rating services are also throttled i still view it as unfair . 
  zero rating in general is anti net neutrality really . 
  same way as any other part of spain . 
  still eu territory for 95 % of things . 
  the hard part would be getting a job ( 2nd or 3rd highest unemployment in spain , with an economy extremely dependent on tourism ) . 
  but it 's no harder than moving to say , madrid , other than flights being longer . 
  / r/mapswithoutcanaryislands ? 
  anyways , we are not lava thankfully  max of between 21 and 31 depending on the area . 
  rip / u/mr _ ziggler :( press f to pay respects, 
   both major parties in parliament called for mps to vote based on what the party wanted and not how the mps wanted to to be fair , is n't that the standard procedure in many places ? 
  at least over here voting against your party is an easy way to get yourself expelled , thus almost certainly losing your seat on the next election unless you know what you are doing . 
  apparently it 's recognized by more than 100 countries as well as the 28 eu member states for a total of at least 129 countries ( 28 + `` more than 100 others , ie 101 ) , but no real number is given . 
  if it was recognized by 129 countries and all those 129 allowed visa free access it would be somewhat powerful actually , ranking at 25th , just below uruguay and just above the united arab emirates and saint kitts and nevis . 
  for all what 's worth here in spain the big divide between old and young voters is not just pure political preference ( left vs right ) , but more of a preference for old parties ( pp/psoe ) or new parties ( podemos/cs ) , with young voters prefering the new parties and old voters voting for the old established parties . 
  then again considering that on the left-right spectrum podemos is further left than psoe and cs is further left than pp you could argue that young voters are slightly more leftist than their parents , but i 'm not totally convinced, 
  for all what 's worth here in spain we only really learn spanish history in detail ( and even then only really since the 19th century up until the mid 80s ) . 
  in late years ( years 11 and 12 ) world history is optional . 
  as for all other years , well the only other times we learned about modern history were year 10 and year 6 . 
  in the first we got up to ww1 or so ( though that was partially because of the teacher but even then i doubt we 'd have gone much further than the early cold war ) . 
  in the second case we got a bit further but still only to the aftermath of ww2 . 
  does reddit even allow for temporary bans ? 
  ( other than maybe the mods putting a note saying `` remind me to unban this person in 3 days '' or the like ) all bans i 've received have been perma-bans . 
  though only twice i 've received the `` you have been banned '' message . 
  most of the time it 's just me being unable to post because i dared to post in another unpopular subreddit . 
  worst offender seems to be / r/offmychest but there are probably many others , and many i do n't even know i 'm banned in !, 
  as of 2017 . 
  you do n't see pnv arguing for independence these days like in the mid 00s , and bildu is small-ish compared to it . 
  yeah , but not on the same scale . 
  catalan nationalists ( terra lliure ) killed one man apparently . 
  canarian nationalists ( mpaiac ) also have killed one once . 
  but nothing on the scale of eta with hundreds of dead, 
  to be fair that was only basque nationalism . 
  all other nationalists have rarely if ever killed people . 
  catalan nationalists are the most radical they 've ever been and still not terrorists . 
  same goes for canarian , cantabrian , valencian , etc nationalists, 
  so , pensions are a ponzi scheme . 
  got it, 
  thanks obama . 
  nah , those are forced to drive on the [ swindon magic roundabout ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/staticarchive/e4f1fc1f25b0b67060fb30615bbcd2fc52e4a4bb.jpg ) for eternity , literally the incarnation of the circles of hell . 
  [ this but unironically ] ( http://i1.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/022/019/most.jpg ), 
  to be fair , maybe a communist spain gets invaded by hitler and liberated by the allies later ? 
  that would lead to a happy ending in 1945 , albeit at the cost of literally a decade of war turning spain into a pile of rubble . 
  does n't sound too bad to me . 
  then lybia deports them to whichever country they belong to . 
  ( bribe some guards if necessary ) . 
  even cheaper than detention centers handled by the eu !, 
  why has n't that idea been offered before ? 
  illegal inmigrants go to prisions in lybia , who then deports them . 
  eu bribes/pays the adecuate people to do so . 
  yeah , iirc only now are the richest eastern european countries catching up to the poorest western ones . 
  iirc the richest eastern european countries are now roughly as rich as portugal .

  workers out of the market , retireement ages , labour market participation , purchasing power ... 
  i said in the eu in my original comment . 
  there is more organized crime than in greece in those places . 
  and ukraine makes greek politics seem clean . 
  eastern europe does n't have those levels of unemployment . 
  the people simply works and lives in poverty . 
  a lot of jobless people with politcally extremist ideas can generate a difficult situation . 
   who are creating these new terrorist generations even thought it should be obvious after the fall of the ussr that communist and socialism died as ideologies . 
  social unrest , high poverty and high unemployment . 
  we are ready . 
  [ we will fight the fire with more fire ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxdwb1sg4ri ), 
  there is a controversy in belarus , almost everybody else does n't care or is looking forward to see something fun/weird . 
  that 's not questionable at all . 
  it 's more gay than a gay musical called ` gay ' . 
   you could just send a good song ... what 's the fun in that ? 
  spain already won eurovision in the past and it 's not worth it . 
  you even have to waste money organizing the show the next year . 
  do they have consonants ? 
  spain is a big country . 
  you are partially right . 
  the spanish galicia and portugal are very similar and [ their language was the same ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/galician-portuguese ) ( check the map ) until 2 days ago and for political reasons . 
  italy has influenced a lot spain , since the renaissance . 
  we even listen to some of their music nowadays i do n't know any portuguese musician . 
  [ berlusconi owns also a tv channel here ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/telecinco ) and he has been meddling in spanish politics also . 
  it feels closer . 
  however , i am from a catalonian speaking area in the mediterranean spain and [ we have looking towards italy more than to portugal . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/crown_of_aragon ) ( check the map ) . 
  my area has influenced a lot italy and the other way arround , specially the south ( oops ! ) . 
  for me italy is more similar than portugal . 
  i am even able to understand mostly the language . 
  maybe people from galicia would say the oposite , but you can feel the italian influence and presence in the spanish society while we do n't care about portugal . 
  without the italian invasion of greece that needed german help , nazis could have been in moscu before winter changing the course of the war . 
  we owe them a lot . 
  sadly , they did n't participated enough in the spanish civil war . 
  whereas the germans [ destroyed the basque cultural capital ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bombing_of_guernica ) the [ italians tried to conquer madrid ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_guadalajara#aftermath ) : they were defeated completely and they lost equipement that was badly needed by the republic because the rebelion got the bulk of the spanish equipement . 
  without italy the spanish civil war could have ended more quickly . 
  after that they were aside giving logistic support and weapons to the rebelion . 
  the country has lost 20 % of its gdp has destroyed education , health care an a lot of long term projects . 
  it seems like reestructuring . 
  they are qualifying for cohesion funds again . 
  in ten years we will have a greece that has lost a big chunk of their young and skilled labour has an aging population that ca n't afford , has extremely high taxes , deteriorated infrastructure , weaker university system ... 
  the structural situation is going to be worse than now . 
  * probably the most similar country in the eu to spain . 
  * has a big variety of latin languages that its government is slowly killing * has an aging population and a below replacement birth rate . 
  * they are more conservative and catholic than us , but then italy elects berlusconi . 
  * they have berlusconi and before him they had andreotti . 
  these guys make almost everybody else seem a saint by comparision . 
  * it 's a nice country full art and historic buildings . 
  * italians drive like crazy even for my low standard . 
  [ the report ] ( http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/cache/ity_offpub/ks-ra-11-019/en/ks-ra-11-019-en.pdf ) from 2011 . 
  i am sure that there is more updated data somewhere , but i am not able to find it . 
  [ here ] ( http://www.ine.es/en/prensa/np784_en.pdf ) is the spanish data for 2012 . 
  lower fertility for everybody : * spanish : 1.28 * foreign born : 1.54 * total : 1.32, 
  the birth rate is higher than the german born population , but it 's still bellow replacement levels . 
  [ eurostat document ] ( http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/cache/ity_offpub/ks-ra-11-019/en/ks-ra-11-019-en.pdf ) [ table screenshot ] ( http://i.imgur.com/rdmwldf.png ) that 's true in some countries like italy . 
  but even immigrants have low fertility in germany . 
  france and uk do n't publish these figures . 
  but they seem to be similar to sweden . 
  can you tell more topics about countries that you do n't know ? 
  * [ spain is one of the bigger producers of vehicles ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_motor_vehicle_production ) * [ exports of spain ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e1/spain_export_treemap.png )  because chinese producers have taken over their markets , for example textile and clothing manufacturing has taken a large hit in south and as those economies are very rigid , they have n't been able to create new industrial sectors and jobs from them . 
  what about the construction bubble ? 
  spain built more new homes per year than uk , germany and france together . 
  5 years ago like 20 % of the spanish workers were employed by the housing sector , \u00e7 that was financed by crazy levels of private debt ; those levels were posible to lower rates to support german reunification and capital flowing also from german and french banks . 
  the eu meant that spain was n't able to raise the interests . 
  [ just saying : productivity figures ] ( http://www.eustat.es/elem/ele0002500/tbl0002544_i.html ), 
   berlusconi would mean progress compared to current political scene . 
  you do n't know what you are saying, 
   i do n't claim to be an expert , but i remember reading somewhere that the unofficial sector in spain accounts for a large share of the economy . 
  it might be possible for people to find occasional jobs that supplement the benefits . 
  am i wrong ? 
  the shadow economy is big , [ but it is n't so big ] ( http://i.imgur.com/avkjzav.gif ) . 
  as you see is in the eu average . 
  it has been in a similar rate since forever when we had full employment had a similar size . 
  so , so . 
  most of the underground economy is handled by people that has a steady source of income . 
  doctors in the public health care that have also a private practice that hides his profits ( my uncle does this ) , software developers that do freelance work under table , people that works for the construction companies that do public works doing freelance stuff on weekends ... people prefer to hire somebody able to keep a job even in the shadow economy . 
  the shadow economy for jobless is mostly picking oranges and cleaning houses . 
  that can work in germany , but i do n't expect it to work in romania or bulgaria . 
  and even the immigrants from outside the eu have a low birth rate in germany . 
  the low birth rate will reduce the unemployment by then , probably . 
  i edited part of it . 
  but i got tired when i was in the * human * part . 
  * translation : * while unemployment continues to grow , collecting unemployment benefits or a pension is getting more difficult after each reform . 
  thousands of young people are choosing between emigration and permanent precariousness . 
  for jobless over 50 those options seem to be denied also . 
  talking about employment in spain is talking about outrageous figures and percentages . 
  the registered unemployment at the inem is approaching to 5 million of jobless , whereas the labout force survey ( epa ) registers 6 millions of spaniards unable to find a job . 
  one in three adults is jobless in certain autonomous regions . 
  however some figures are more than numbers , it is easy to imagine the personal histories that they carry . 
  like that figure that tells that there are about 1,821,000 households with no member employed . 
  or the two million people who have exhausted unemployment benefits and have been left out of any help . 
  in recent years , as unemployment grew , support for the unemployed was reduced in each new labor regulations . 
  the cuts begin from the moment of being unemployed : the latest labor reform reduced most usual severance payment from 45 to 20 days ' salary per year worked . 
  the jobless only get 50 % of their last salary after six months , instead of the 60 % that they got previously . 
  and when you run out of unemployment benefits , the restrictions for getting a subsidy of 426 euros after exhausting unemployment benefits are harder than never . 
  furthermore , the other options to the miracle that getting hired has become have n't improved . 
  there are n't measures to support people who try to create a small business or being self-employed ^ ** 1 ** . 
  on the other hand , the pension reform adopted by the previous government is extending the age of entitlement to retirement . 
  the age is increasing progressively to 67 years in 2027 ** off the map ** * not edited * but there are realities that do not fit in any figures . 
  the helplessness of young people forced to choose between precariousness and exile .

when i visited barcelona one day was about 35c . 
  it was nice because i was on holiday . 
  after finishing the first year of no mandatory high school , one of my friends , 17 years old , took a job in construction for the summer . 
  he had to work many days under the sun at +30 c. 
  he dropped school and became a full time construction worker . 
  and he had good grades . 
  now he is jobless , unskilled for anything else and living with his parents , of course . 
  secret ? 
  besides the already shameful knowns ? 
   out of interest , how accurate are opinion polls in spain generally ? 
  they are accurate to a certain point . 
  they sort of agree in the raw data . 
  but the cooking is varying a lot . 
  and it 's logic as we are in uncharted waters , from the government poll the one that favours more the ruling pp ( [ official 38 pages pdf in spanish ] ( http://cdn.20minutos.es/adj/2014/11/05/3009.pdf ) ) : * pp : 11 % of the polled people answered that would vote them , 27.5 % after cooking . 
  * psoe : 14.3 % of the polled people answered that would vote them , translated to a 23.9 % in elections . 
  * podemos : 17.9 % of the polled people answered that would vote them , translated to a 22.5 % after cooking . 
  * united left : 3,7 % of the polled people answered that would vote them , translated to a 4,8 % . 
  * upyd : 2,1 % of the polled people answered that would vote them , translated to a 4,1 % . 
  it 's hard to work with this material , the people that declares that will vote to the pp is disappearing at a pace even quicker than podemos is growing ; podemos is mostly growing from the left and centrist mostly people that did n't vote in the last elections or psoe or iu . 
  it 's hard to see what the conservative voters that declare that the wo n't vote again to the pp will do . 
  upyd , that party founded by rosa d\u00edez , when she lost the internal elections to the psoe , is trying to target them without the same level of sucess as podemos . 
   when is the next real electoral test that podemos will face ? 
  25th of may of 2015 : municipal elections in all the country . 
  and regional elections in ten autonomous regions . 
  the party is n't going to trust its bases to participate in the local elections . 
  but , it 's going to encourage the participation in voters associations candidatures . 
  in fact the mentor of the leader , may become the candidate to the municipal elections in one for madrid . 
  [ pablo iglesias announced that he would back him ] ( http://www.publico.es/552290/iglesias-propone-a-monedero-como-alcalde-de-madrid ) [ the party got 200,000 members in almost no time ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/podemos_%28spanish_political_party%29#membership_history ) , becoming the second biggest party in spain by membership . 
  however , the leadership does n't trust them ; they do n't have to pay membership fees and many come from other parties with their own agenda . 
  they had problems in galicia with the influx of left wing nationalist ( mostly former members of anova and bng ) that took over local circles and ignored the official party line  the success of podemos was extremely surprising in that election , to outside observers ) . 
  there is a lot of left leaning people at spain , and the official left is corrupt , pro-austerity and disorganized since the lost of the 2011 elections.and united left was in a bad situation , with a very unpopular candidate that later was discovered using luxembourg for tax avoidance ( legally ) . 
  edit : [ english article about the government poll ] ( http://elpais.com/elpais/2014/11/05/inenglish/1415191449_131878.html ) , and [ metroscopia puts podemos first ] ( http://elpais.com/elpais/2014/11/03/inenglish/1415011542_341454.html ) edit2 : and these polls are missing another 80 pp and psoe elected officers charged for corruption of the last week . 
  what would happen with rajoy and the leadership of the conservative party if they lose the control of the justice and the government before their illegal financing and other accusations expire ? 
   podemos with pablo iglesias is doing the discourse of we are the decent people that will recover the country from the criminals that robbed it . 
  and it 's working according to the [ polls ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7d/electionmonthlyaveragegraphspain2015.png ) ( purple ) and the eu elections . 
  edit : we had threads about them : http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2l1e3r/podemos_european_left_largest_party_in_spain/ http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2l56u4/new_leftwing_party_podemos_overtakes_major/, 
   narrative of the old struggling a losing battle against the new . 
  i would say that the narrative is that after being decades looting , the corrupts of all the establishment ally to get some extra time to steal whatever remains and keep themselves out of prison . 
  because if they lose control of the government they will go to prison . 
  maybe i am projecting my country . 
  but , i think that sadly greece is similar . 
  italy has also lived similar situations . 
  edit : if berlusconi would have quitted politics 10 years ago he would have gone to prison . 
  i would say that the guys from new democracy and the pasok are in a similar situation . 
  ^ ( and my government ), 
  are you feeling spanish ? 
  i think that it 's not about border conflicts . 
  the south is poor and full of unemployment . 
  the most conservative city is ~ ~ fachadolid ~ ~ valladolid the capital of the region castille and leon . 
  all the region except the province of leon is very conservative . 
  galicia and murcia are also very conservative . 
  catalonia big right wing party is the only liberal party in spain . 
  that makes catalonia having a different center than the rest of the country . 
  aragon ( zaragoza actually , the rest is empty ) and asturies would be more progressive than average also . 
  madrid is more conservative than barcelona , but not the most conservative city ( but ruled by conservative mayors 20 years that have ruined the city with not really needed public works and olympic bids with associated constructions ) . 
  i probably should n't have put this in territorial divides . 
  22.2 % of unemployment for 2016 at spain . 
  they do n't even pretend to be believable . 
  or they expect a lot of people to leave without destroying many jobs with their absence . 
  if you are talking about the psoe , they are corrupt . 
  and that 's the government that i was meaning with half of the previous one deserves prison . 
  the corruption of the pp ( conservatives ) is higher , because they are better organized . 
  i mean schemes where the national leadership gets a percentatge of the black money in exchange of protection of the national leadership and their power over the justice . 
  building ghost airports ? 
  nuns varrying old people with dementia to vote because the party gives public money to the catholic church ? 
  ghost cinema studios ? 
  the psoe has a lot of corruption also , like the irregular employment regulations in andalusia ( that were used to pay full pensions to party members , that did n't deserve them ) , participation in the looting of some regional saving banks , training funds fraud with the collaboration of business and workers unions and suspicious public works contracts . 
  and they wo n't be acceptable in a normal country . 
  and that 's the reason why i would prefer podemos to the psoe despite that in ideology i am closer to the last one . 
  the pp has a corruption level so high that may make seem the psoe normal , but nobody should think that what the psoe has done these years is acceptable or they should go back to the government because the pp is even more corrupt . 
  edit : they do n't ask for money to the eu , only to the eurozone to perform quantitative easing to the spanish finances , or something similar where the ecb funds the spanish government . 
  you can ask them in their official forum / r/podemos . 
  it 's the official forum of the party . 
  linked from their web http://plaza.podemos.info/ i would like to see a foreigner asking those questions in their forum , i have the feeling that if i am the one to ask i wo n't be taken seriously or they will think that i am trolling . 
  however the answers that you would get are n't official or anything . 
  looking about information about them in english i found [ an article of the wsws ] ( http://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2014/05/01/pode-m01.html ) angry because their program was n't enough socialist . 
  i am going to vote to a social-democratic valencian nationalist party , but i expect and want them to support podemos instead of the criminals that are ruling the country right now if they have to make the choice . 
  no for the economic policies , only because all the current government and half of the previous one deserve prison ( maybe the others also for complicity ) . 
  that 's usually included in the first one . 
  the progressive spain against the conservative . 
  the fight is represented by the picture to the right in the [ wikipedia article ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_two_spains ) . 
  no , if you ask our pm . 
  the reality ... :( * the two spains . 
  * catalonia * basque country * madrid against the rest . 
  * the rich against the south . 
  what am i missing ? 
  state intervention in the economy , nationalizations , a strong raise of the effective corporate tax , blockade to fiscal heavens , quantitative easing , strong rise of the minimum wage , basic income ... 
  i am against . 
  catalonia still wants it , even more . 
  the reaction of the spanish government to the scottish vote . 
  it was funny in a sad way . 
  they have forbidden the last version of the catalan referendum , a non-binding consultation or something like that . 
  and that reminded me this . 
   and a popular party in power and getting hit by corruption scandals on a ** monthly ** basis [ weekly basis ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2l1iyo/what_happened_in_your_country_this_week_02112014/clqsz99 ) . 
   mportant conservative topics , like small government , supporting creating new small businesses , fighting beurocracy ... 
  these points are considered liberal at spain and the only party that considers itself liberal is cdc , ruling at catalonia . 
  the poll was done for [ a spanish mainstream newspaper ] ( http://elpais.com/elpais/2014/11/03/inenglish/1415011542_341454.html ) by metroscopia . 
  they usually favour the psoe . 
  even if they have been getting subsidies from conservative administrations and you can notices in the editorial line , and the appointment of a new director . 
  edit : whatever at the end pp and psoe are together in this .

  i do n't know if you 're of the thought that homosexuality is a choice ( which is not true ) , but normalizing homo marriages wo n't increase the amount of gay people there are , they will be born at the same rate they currently are . 
  your fears are unfounded . 
  i 'm not against polyamory as long as it 's all done among informed adults , not harem style where one man buys a dozen women who have no choice but to submit because that 's their best option . 
  the downside is that polyamorous relationships are n't the easiest , and every person involved needs to be very mature emotionally speaking , or jelousy will arise . 
  divorces are hard enough when it deals with two people , i ca n't imagine what it 'd be like with multiple of them . 
   what if it is two brothers , there is no inbreed there . 
  besides just because they are married does n't mean they want to have children . 
  sure , lets grasp at straws just to argue against healthy relationships that harm no one , makes sense . 
  `` what if aliens come to earth , would it be okay to marry a goat , then ? '', 
  they may not want to have kids , but marriage helps normalize something , for good or bad . 
  in the case of homosexual relationships it helps see them as the equals they truly are . 
  in the case of incestuous relationships , regardless of them not having children , it helps normalize it and eventually we would n't mind if they do procreate . 
  in truth it does n't really matter if they get married , since you do n't lose the ability to have kids out of wedlock , but avoiding giving them a free pass helps avoid the issue . 
  it was common thing to marry children and get them pregnant as soon as their first menstruation came , but we criminalized it , and pedophilia is now despised . 
  not allowing incest to be official serves a similar function . 
   and also still the people against gay marriage usually care more about the issue than those in favour . 
  not really . 
  spanish party pp wanted to make marriage into civil union when they came back to power after socialist party psoe allowed gay marriage . 
  the backlash was enough for them not to further pursue the issue . 
   now you completely dodged the point about preventing people with genetic diseases from procreating which by that logic you also should be in favour of . 
  not really , no . 
  if you carry an illness and ca n't help passing it down regardless of who your partner is , there 's no point in denying your freedom to procreate . 
  but if it turns out you greatly decreasse the chance of passing down an illness just by choosing someone who 's not related to you , then yeah your freedom is n't the most important issue at hand . 
   i could say the same thing about you not accepting marriage between siblings . 
  and you can go further , why ca n't i get married with two people or with a pet ... 
  yes , worrying about the damage inbreeding can cause to a bloodline 's dna is in line with denying a relationship because `` a penis should n't go in a man 's butt ! '', 
  a pet is in line with having sex with a kid in that it can not consent . 
  you draw the line in relationships that do n't harm any of the parties involved , and where damage to kids can be avoided just by choosing a partner who is n't genetically related to you . 
  'cause it 's really one thing to pass an illness down just 'cause you have it , and you ca n't help it no matter who you choose to have kids with , but it is another to up the chances of passing illness down your legacy just 'cause you like your cousing . 
   i just believe you could argue that one of the primary purposes of marriage is to produce offspring and gay people ca n't do that much more openly than infertile people . 
  people who argue that are n't living in this century , imo . 
  nowadays marriage is just a symbolic union that grants you some extra rights . 
  arguing its purpose is to have children is like arguing women 's purpose is to stay at home while men work : outdated , close-minded , restrictive . 
  this also brings us to another important point : a view being traditionally held does n't mean we should just accept it . 
  at the very core it boils down to people being inlove and wanting to tie the knot and form a family , so why not call it marriage instead of civil union ? 
   then again can you explain to me why you are against incest marriages ? 
  i already said inbreeding is n't good for the population . 
  we have our example in the monarchy with charles ii of spain . 
  upping the chances of having a very ill child is far worse than not having them at all , i do n't see how this can be used as a comparation . 
  you do n't hurt that which does n't exist , but a child might suffer severe illnesses that could 've been prevented by not allowing inbreeding . 
  it 's the same reason why we have tests to diagnose ilnesses early on and give parents a chance to stop the pregnancy . 
  perhaps in a future where genetic engineering is an affordable task where we can prevent illnesses at command incest would n't have to be argued against , but we do n't live in such a world . 
  plenty of heterosexual people are infertile and nobody goes around calling them sinful and suboptimal . 
  when you are told by a person that they ca n't have children , you probably give them a sympathetic look and tell them that there 's always adoption , you do n't glare at them because they 're in a relationship that will not produce offspring , do you ? 
  and if you 're going to argue that homosexuals `` choose '' not to procreate : should heterosexual people who do n't want children for one reason or another be banned from marrying , too ? 
  i have n't seen anyone argue against these suboptimal types of heterosexual relationships . 
  have you ? 
  people are against homosexual relationships because we carry a tradition of bigotry . 
  nothing else , nothing more . 
   you ca n't marry if you 're 10 years old , you ca n't marry your closest kin you ca n't use these two examples and call it a day because these two scenarios are nothing like two consenting adults whose relationship harms no one . 
  we do n't allow children to marry because they 're not mature enough to make such a decision and allowing it to happen usually leads to an adult taking advantadge of a child . 
  we are n't fond of incest because inbreeding is n't optimal . 
  there 's absolutely no harm caused by two people of the same gender marrying , and even if they ca n't produce their own offspring , they can and will adopt children who would otherwise remain orphan because heterosexual people who can reproduce rarely want to adopt . 
  if we 're going to argue that relationships where people ca n't have children are unnatural , then a heterosexual marriage where a woman or a man are infertile should n't be allowed either . 
  if homosexual sex is unnatural , then we should n't allow people to do anything other than penis in vagina . 
  but you guys sure love putting it in a woman 's butt without anyone claiming it 's unnatural , how comes ? 
  there 's really nothing unnatural about their relationships . 
  the reasons against homosexual relationships have no real basis , whereas the other two have very solid reasons not to be accepted . 
  in other words : reasons against homosexual marriage are based on irrational opinions , the other two are not . 
  i can picture it already . 
  `` hello mr. trump , i think we call all agree that we 're feelings and we have human beings , and that americans are very americans and much american , but you have to keep in mind that i like mexicans because they do stuff . '', 
  we 're in capable hands , everyone !, 
  how early you start does n't matter much if the quality of your education system happens to be garbage and people drop out . 
  no one can be fluent if they leave school early on , and spain has a high dropout percentage . 
  i 've had a headache the whole afternoon-evening and my energy for arguments has gone down the drain , plus this is getting more and more long winged by the minute , so i 'll keep it ... 
  `` short . '', 
  since kids start school at a young age they ca n't really make the decision themselves , and keeping in mind parents will have to help with homework , it is understandable that some might get irritated . 
  this is why my mother learnt valencian herself . 
  she did n't speak it , but enrolled me on a valencian-speaking school , and since she had to help me with homework she picked it up from me and canal 9 , which i loved watching . 
  and yes , it does bother me . 
  that we get no recognition and are mostly forgotten , yet we give more money than we receive , that they took our channel from us ( right after knocking off the antenna that allowed us to watch catalan channels ) which even if it was n't the best , plenty of people enjoyed it and it was a reliable channel for good kids content ( and perfect to familiarize them with valencian ) , that i have to travel 5 hours by train to barcelona , etc. 
  part of what irks me about the independentist flag is that it 's a reminder that we could lose a good neighbour , and that relationships that could 've been very friendly will turn sour quick if secession were to happen , because i truly believe spain will make is as ugly as possible . 
  i would love nothing more than to be in good terms with catalonia and be sister regions to the best of our ability , but pan-catalanism paranoia and spain 's francoist ppast got in the way . 
   however , spanish nationalists ( namely pp ) do n't even let thousands of your kids to learn your own language in school ( and before you mention the immersi\u00f3 in catalonia - we learn spanish and have grades above average in the country - and only 20-something families have requested `` only spanish '' at public school ) . 
  they do n't want kids who do n't speak valencian home to be forced to learn it , that 's true , and are bent over on preventing any priorization of valencian over spanish on behalf of their parents freedom to choose , which is pretty bad , because some region 's quality of education when it comes to the language is just terrible and their tantrums just makes the issue worse . 
  but have they really banned a school from outright teaching the language ? 
  i 've never heard of it . 
  the issue about people who do n't speak valencian at home being forced to learn the language is delicate . 
  while i do n't want it to disappear , i 'm all for `` live and let live '' . 
  a compromise for freedom would easily mean we 'll be overtaken by spanish in some regions , as most people see it as a useless thing even if it opens more job opportunities here within the community . 
   valencia is probably the most hostile region for a catalan , not only because the nationwide propaganda against us , but also because the added regionwide propaganda about how we want to invade you and eat your babies . 
  perchance you 've fallen prey of the same evil that makes some valencians think you want to invade us . 
  i do n't think there 's more hostility here than elsewhere , and given that there was more support of podemos here than in most other regions , with the referendum being on their program , i do n't think propaganda catches on as much as they want , 'cause the voters here sure did n't seem to mind the fact that pablo wanted to support your choice . 
  what i 've noticed is tiredness about an issue that as neighbours affect us , yet our opinion does n't count at all , but some feel free to come over here and hang flags wherever which just adds insult to injury . 
  we 're kept out and at the same time we 're dragged into the problem first hand . 
  it makes people more susceptible to snap when confronted with the issue , but it does n't mean they hate you . 
  huh ? 
  independentists are comfortable enough here that the cup hung the estelada in the torres de serranos ( valencia ) and other than taking the flag out , there were no incidents . 
  the way you speak about us , you 'd think we would 've tracked down , kidnap whoever did it and killed them . 
  i guess vicious valencians are n't living up to expectations ... 
  well then , whatever brought neo nazis here is n't valencia 's people complacency to racists or support from us , 'cause we confront them whenever they rear their ugly head . 
  i live on a poor neighbourhood surrounded by people from various regions of africa and there 's never been an ugly confrontation with racists here , either . 
  everyone walks around safely , no swastika to be seen . 
  you make it sound like immigrant hell , but reality does n't check out . 
  not saying it 's perfect either , and sure there are racist paintings here and there , but they 're crossed out whenever someone spots them . 
   i feel about you like our brothers , but it would seem you think we 're backwards and are ashamed of our common roots . 
  i do n't think anyone here thinks you 're backwards . 
  pissed that you want to secede , yes . 
  but feeling you 're backwards , not so much . 
  we 're not ashamed of our common roots , mostly nationalists pushed the fear that you want to swallow our culture whole and together with spanish propaganda , it put some people in the defensive .

  originally it was an actual hat strap - to hold the hat in place . 
  but in combat , it turns out it was a hazard ( the hat could get stuck in something and the strap could strangle you ) so the soldiers wore it too short , making the strap fall in front of the chin . 
  some time later , it is a tradition . 
  they all died , so they do n't count . 
  ok , that 's it . 
  we are re-forming the tercios . 
  nothing personal , guys , it 's just that the heat wave is not leaving until next week , we need some lebensraum pronto . 
   people from outside coming to barcelona might not be used to this humidity . 
  wait , people from outside come to * barcelona * in summer ? 
  you are talking about foreign tourists , do n't you ? 
  what 's next , a nice weekend trip to seville in august ? 
  why are you worrying ? 
  even when it retires , it will end up in the iberian peninsula anyway ( well , that or florida , but since it flees florida as far as it can every year , it probably does not like the place ) . 
  it 's the brits and scandinavians the ones who need to worry . 
  you mean gibraltar , do n't you ? 
  then in winter you let the shutter open , like we do ? 
   and you better not have said sagrada fam\u00edlia was in madrid ... 
  it 's our long standing secret plan . 
  we are waiting until barca gets to a champions final again ( and real madrid is not playing something ) and steal the church when you are all distracted . 
  have you seen the spanish cathedrals ? 
  do n't worry , as soon as they put the last brick they will have to build a scaffolding somewhere to start the restoration project . 
  do n't worry , majorca is still there . 
  he means actual blond hair , you know , the one that does not need chemical help . 
  see ? 
  if they had started discussion with this instead of trade and brotherhood of men and peace , brexit would have never happened . 
   there 's no evidence that this was the case , and i see no reason to suspect it to be more likely to be true than the simpler case of a bias doc committing literal , if not legal , malpratice . 
  when a * professional psychologist * states that one of their patients is on actual suicide risk , you act on their advice and if you have reasons to think they are wrong , you ask for a second opinion . 
  which is what happened here . 
  what you do n't do is to simply * ignore * the professional warning you of a risk for life because you may have `` reason to suspect '' they are biased due to their religious beliefs . 
  because maybe , just maybe , this time you may be the one biased , and after the girl has killed herself is too late for second opinions . 
  but we can still get the badass cathedral spaceships , right ? 
   if it 's true that the girl was found to be depressed , could it have been that her depression was induced by inimical adults in a position of authority ? 
  unwanted pregnancy at a young age is already a heavy burden by itself . 
  the cause of the depression may be important for a future successful treatment , but when she is literally having suicidal thoughts , that is a very secondary question opposed to `` let 's stop her killing herself tonight '' the court rules in her favour , not she can get a proper treatment and maybe even sure the original wrong diagnosis if she wants to . 
  if the first doctor had been right , but let her go , and then she killed herself , it would be far too late for `` second opinions '', 
   because what happens to my body and life is not yours to decide what happens to it . 
  how can you `` not get '' something like that ? 
  what has to go wrong to end up not getting something like that ? 
  because the point of the pro-lifers is that * it is not your body * , it is the body a a second person you are killing because of a few months discomfort , because it 's not as if you can not put the child up for adoption . 
  what has to go wrong to end up not getting something like that ? 
  i am generally pro-abortion , but people should really try to understand the other side 's point of view in important matters . 
  please , we would not be proper europeans if we were n't plotting to destroy france . 
  i agree . 
  and since the netherlands is rightful spanish clay , this means france is ours . 
  let 's start a two-pronged invasion , we can let the endless arguments ( as proper spaniards ) about who exactly keeps what fro the time when we meet in the middle . 
  they got lucky the old king was chill and just decided to up the ante , we have sacked rome on lesser provocations . 
  that said , in francisco dares to retire before benedict kicks the bucket , all bets are off . 
  have you * seen * the retiro pond ? 
  the only wonder is that he did not bounce like he had fallen in the ankh river . 
  wait , that 's a dangerous path to follow . 
  because while i am all for being german , ofc , that means that the french , who come form the franks , are german too . 
  do we have to accept being related to the french ? 
   but rural life is tied into the european identity strong enough that some concessions are necessary . 
  some concessions from rural people would be nice , too . 
  in my parent 's rural county there is a city of 70,000 people , with two highways that more or less cover the whole region . 
  it has a big hospital , plenty of high schools , even a small university campus . 
  you are only 20 minutes by car , 30 at most , from any village in el bierzo to ponferrada . 
  it took me longer to get to my job when i lived in leon , even though my job was also in that city . 
  yet every single town hall , even if the whole municipality has only 200 people scattered in four hamlets , is constantly whining about how much they need the new doctor office , the new school , the new industrial area , and so on . 
  yes , i understand that many people in these villages are elderly , but plenty of elderly people living in big cities are also 30 minutes away from a hospital . 
  money is not endless . 
   you only know two and thats because they were so well publicised . 
  those two are the only policies we need to know about him to want our leaders to keep as much distance as it is diplomatically possible with him . 
   lmao , can you link me one of these multiple interviews ? 
  sanchez follows similar politics to zapatero : `` yes , yes , of course , i agree with you . 
  * votes the opposite when the time comes * what do you say ? 
  what vote are you tasking about ? 
  of course i agree with you , next time i will totally give you what you wanted '' and then they are surprised they keep losing votes . 
  you can love or hate parties like pp or erc ( to put two on opposite sides ) but they usually act in what they claim to want to act . 
   everyone likes moni  everybody also likes winning elections , and the problem with those politicians to claim `` they wo n't veto , it will hurt their money '' is that with 28 nations , there is always an election going on somewhere , and `` caving to foreigner demands '' when the opposition is doing otherwise and `` protecting our national interests '' is a risky proposal in an election . 
  wait , but let 's do it in november , when the central meseta temperatures are back to human-bearable levels . 
  london - a city of 10 million people - has its forensic department swamped by 8 deaths ? 
  i am fairly sure santander is buying the bank * and * the debt , since that is usually the way these `` buy some company for 1 $ '' thing works . 
  madrid in summer is only part of spain because we feel pity for them , it is actually a slice of hell that got struck in the last dimensional alignment . 
  i love the small diagonal streets - not the big avenues , these look planned , but the ones like the lower left corner . 
  you stare at the aerial view and wonder why is that street there cutting the block , what happened ? 
  and the political union ( compared to the way it was back before euro ) is doing pretty fine , too . 
  i 'll be honest , every time i see a night image of this tower , i think the same . 
  vegas is not on the list , either . 
  like op , i find this suspicious . 
  you mean the guys that conquered and ruled under a dictatorship the areas they `` liberated '' for 40 years ? 
  yes , i am sure eastern europe is very grateful for their freedoms under the soviets . 
  what ? 
  and wait 5 extra minutes for lasagna ? 
  while we are on it , if you are buying subpar pre-made lasagna ... why the hell do n't you buy the microwave version , which is equally good * and only needs five minutes ? 
  * for a certain value of `` good '' . 
  they do n't even need to change the name too much when they make the xxx version . 
  china has a huge problem with islamic terrorism , mostly in xingiang , although in its case it could probably be fair to say the the problem is more ethnic than religious . 
  til argel and tunis are european cities . 
   such cities are relatively abundant in europe compared to other regions . 
  such cities ' urban planning collapses when there is actual snow on the city streets . 
  the only thing that works properly is the subway , and that is a very expensive infrastructure that most cities do n't have . 
  king charles iii . 
  that picture is the throne room , actually , but yes , it can be visited . 
   the actual one is a leftover of the fascist times . 
  the actual one is a `` leftover '' from 1785 , when the red-yellow-red flag was chosen by king charless iii . 
  if you are curious , that was 107 years before francisco franco was born .

  can you read ? 
  it 's kinda working . 
  i mean we are n't stopping the ukraine thing . 
  i disagree . 
  for example , i feel like i 'm a bit opressed by the central government and some spanish people . 
  so in order to show my identity , i own a small estelada and i bring it to demostrations when i go to one . 
  i mean people carrying the flags have a bad connotation for me . 
  thus i 'd never do it . 
  not because i do n't feel spanish . 
  i do . 
  i think t was a great thing . 
  it feeds the flames . 
  eh it 's kinda like the spanish fiag . 
  sure , i do feel spanish . 
  but the kind of person that goes around with one is not one i 'd like to be associated with . 
  damn spaniards ruined spain . 
  define vary wildly . 
  i 'd like to see some sources . 
  i mean , can it double or get halved ? 
  plebiscitary ( sp ? ), 
  elections most likely . 
  i had an early nokia smartphone and it suuuuucked a lot . 
  eh , calories out  calories in . 
  it 's basic thermodynamics . 
  eh our minister of health knows nothing about medicine . 
  she studied sociology and politics . 
  fun fact : she once said that kids in andalucia ( spanish region ) are practically illiterate . 
  so i 'll take your minister if you do n't want her . 
  it 's very easy to eat an hypocaloric diet . 
  i mean , unless you are addicted to food , which i can understand . 
  but there 's no blaming childhood . 
  it plays a role , and probably her parents sucked for that . 
  but you can fix it if you want . 
  i know . 
  but that means changing the habits of people , which they would have to do voluntarily . 
  you ca n't force them . 
  but nuclears require no effort . 
  what do you mean use wind ? 
  also , going nuclear does n't compromise our eating habits . 
  it 's not the money . 
  it 's all the co2 avoided . 
  which also means more money , more deaths and climate change . 
  but let 's keep burning coal . 
  it 's terrible, 
  i 'd say it 's a tie-in between castilla la mancha and castilla le\u00f3n . 
  i even felt a bit awkward when i visited valladolid . 
  i saw some bullfighting and heard some truly ugly stuff . 
  but the food was great !, 
  ouch that 's a good one, 
  i do . 
  we are celebrating genocide , it 's terribly wrong . 
  eh you can come to catalunya and have some churros . 
  tapas are n't that good or that cheap here , got ta admit . 
  they are very diferent . 
  for example the eu does n't forbid avortion . 
  portugal and spain will have a fusion when rajoy publicly supports catalan independence . 
  i bet failing is n't a new thing to you . 
  cherish , my compatriots . 
  for today we celebrate genocide !, 
  hooray !, 
  they downvoted because it is literally wrong . 
  there 's no reason to upvote something like this . 
  it 's not because they disagree . 
  which they do alright . 
  i upvoted so more people can see how ridiculous the anticatalanism is in the rest of spain . 
  have you been to a middle school in vietnam ? 
  i swear they eat the pinky toe of everyone with blue eyes !, 
  especially in rural parts . 
  it was n't me . 
  do you read usernames before acussing people ? 
  also , think about all the poor indians that got ruined because the colonias separated . 
  horrendous stuff , they should make a movie . 
  i guess you could call it interesting . 
   the airport of barcelona is physically super big , one of the 50th biggest in the world when barcelona is not by far in top 50 cities by population , specially after the construction of the t1 terminal . 
  the reason behind madrid taking all the transatlantic flights is mainly logistical , not some sort of petty revenge . 
  maybe because it has a big volume of passengers ? 
  the population matters little . 
  how stupid , lol . 
  and the problem with the constitution is not that we do n't want to follow procedure . 
  it is that , that way it is n't going to get changed , because the rest of spain has a majority that is anti-separation . - but we ( or at least i do ) believe that it is immoral that the rest of spain has a say on wether we have to stay or not . 
  what do you mean with the relations ? 
  trains ? 
  there 's families in diferent nations ( oh the horror ) ? 
   it did happen , in the 2nd republic , in 1934 , the catalan republic was proclaimed by the president of the generalitat . 
  it was a personal more a personal move by him that an institutionalized act that the majority of the catalans wanted . 
  this is simply not true , you just have to see what happened in the civil war to understand . 
  you are also trying to make someone believe that there 's an elite here controlling things . 
  this is not russia . 
  polls have shown what we want . 
  in fact , the elite ( think pujol ) do n't really want independence , because they have a lot of money to lose . 
  what do you mean ? 
  you are not proving the brainwashing , because it 's simply not there . 
  you might consider bringing little kids to demonstrations brainwashing , and i quite agree , but everybody and their mother does this . 
  it means nothing about the nature of the independentist movement . 
  it 's not that i 'm happy or not . 
  it is that you are giving factually wrong arguments . 
  a lot of them . 
  add in it some logical phallacies and you have this completely shit post masked as an historical explanation of how we got here .

  greece is n't that anymore , but that law stayed with them . 
  removing that make sense nowadays . 
   vacation for working with a computer this happened in more countries like spain 30 years ago . 
  they had an excess of employees when they computerized the public administration . 
  they agreed in increase the number of vacation days in 5 to the affected departments and freeze the salaries one year . 
  the government increased the number of working days in spain recently for those public servants and has a program for replacing only a 10 % of the ones that go to retireement . 
  everybody seems to think that the solution is make less people work more hours . 
  it 's an interesting consensus with 27 % of unemployment . 
  translation : the number of days that most of the public servants have to work has increased . 
  that in a society with 27.9 % of unemployment . 
  there is high unemploymeny . 
  let 's fire more people and increse the number of working days for the rest . 
   galicia yep , they also . 
   generally it is common knowledge that unemployment lags economic growth depending on the flexibility of the labour market . 
  but , greeece is still in recesion and the economy is so bad that is n't considered a [ developed country anymore . 
  ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/economics/comments/19kdkg/greece_reclassified_to_emerging_market_from/ ) what economic growth are you talking about ? 
   it 's either a choice between job cuts or longer working days or everyone loses their jobs . 
  i do n't have an answer for that . 
  but we are getting the three things now . 
  longer working days . 
  lower salaries and lay-offs . 
   same thing , decent housing for all sounds nice there are three millions and half of empty house ready to be inhabited . 
  a lot of them in cities . 
  spain does n't have a problem of lack of housing . 
  the problem is that there is n't people that can afford to live in those houses . 
   if someone loans another persons money to buy a house but can not pay the loan like agreed it is more than logical to let the lender have the house . 
  that 's the reason why the number of empty houses has increased in half million since the end of the construction bubble . 
  spain is the country of the houses without people and people without houses . 
  and it 's not only mortgages , with a 27 % of unemployment many people ca n't pay the rent or the utilities . 
  we are paying energy companies to maintain energy plants that are not used because the economy that used them disappeared , we are giving bailouts to banks that own the houses where nobody lives . 
  we are asking to evicted people to keep paying mortgages when they do n't have a house or anything . 
  i do n't think that this nun has a solution , but the things are happening at spain have to stop . 
  btw , if i have to choose between a party that supports the current policies and a populist party i will vote the populist party even if i do n't think that they are going to solve the situation . 
  i forgot aragon , that shared had the same crown in the past with the catalan countries . 
  [ their language ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/aragonese_language ) is almost death . 
  there are mores speakers of catalonian that of aragonese in aragon . 
  asturias and leon had the [ asturian language , ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/asturian_language ) that is not official . 
  leon is almost completely assimilated and is sharing regional government with north castilla ( castilla y leon ) andalusia does n't have its own language , they have a characteristic dialect , but that 's all . 
  they have a strong self-government nowadays . 
  it was the core of al-andalus but they where conquered by castilla . 
  they have been the region that has retrieved the worst treatment from spain until recently ( less investment , giving all the farmland to the grandee like house of alba , ) . 
  the highest poverty rates of spain and some of the richest spaniards also live here . 
  canary islands : spanish [ african islands ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/guanches ) . 
  they used a berber language , but it was killed more than a hundred years ago . 
   how equitable is the relationship seen in spain ? 
  here it 's rather england centric which upsets everyone els . 
  * seen * . 
  more hate towards catalonia than it 's healthy , but basque country and navarra have privileges and they are acception . 
  the capital is obviously privileged also , and castillian/andalusian culture is promited as the mainline spanish culture . 
  many people supports the status quo except in catalonia , and many people in castilla wants to reduce the power of the autonumus governments with the current political situation . 
  it 's an interesting situation . 
  spain contains : castilla ( inlcuding asturies , leon , andalusia and canary islands ) , catalonia , balearic islands , valencia , basque country and navarra . 
  that 's plenty of nations . 
  a lot of people has tried to fix their countries . 
  and now those countries are emiting more immigrants than before . 
  many people has given up with their countries . 
  i ca n't take seriously what you are saying . 
  can you say simply hat you do n't want more immigrants in your country and if they are in a bad situation it 's their problem ? 
  it does n't work like that . 
  all the developed countries are restricting legal immigration . 
  te obvious conclusion is that you have to immigrate illegally to somewhere . 
  what other country ? 
  most of the developed world is very harsh to illegal immigrants . 
  spain puts the ones that catch and can not deport in concentration camps and we forbid providing them public health care . 
  how far would you go ? 
  and you can expect to have a big population in poverty , no integrated and without access to education or health care . 
  this going to be great . 
  honestly . 
  that would n't stop me . 
  if i was from certain countries and i was unable to leave legally i would leave illegally . 
  if you act like that the only visible effect would be a big number of illegal immigrants , like [ in the us ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/illegal_immigration_to_the_united_states ) . 
  montenegro and kosovo are using euros . 
  there is oil in canary islands , but the regional government is blocking the prospections . 
  and there is olive oil in the rest of spain , that should be close enought . 
  but , nobody wants to bring freedom to spain . 
  never !, 
   an additional 15 to 25 million people across europe could face the prospect of living in poverty by 2025 if austerity measures continue . 
  the support for self-determination is higher that the support for independence . 
  in addition , there is a lot of people that does n't support any side . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/catalan_independence#polls the problem is the lack of a spanish project that normal people can like . 
  i given up with my country and i feel completely spaniard . 
  the country is broken . 
  and there is n't a plan to fix it . 
  nobody offers a good alternative to the independence . 
  only more of the same shit . 
  we 're everywhere . 
  the local culture is dying in valencia and we have a spanish mainline conservative government . 
  i find the official spanish figures very hard to believe . 
  we have destroyed 25 % of the employment but the gdp per capita is the same . 
  * [ source-portugal ] ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/portugal/gdp-per-capita-ppp ) * [ source-greece ] ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/greece/gdp-per-capita-ppp ) you can check more countries changing the url . 
  we can see two different evolution : the greek bubble and portuguese stagnation . 
  other countries have analogous patterns ( spain like greece and italy like portugal ) , but i choose this two cases because they seem the more extreme to me . 
  i got the idea from the eastern europe thread . 
  it 's losing population very quickly . 
  i do n't think that australia cares . 
   it sounds quite medieval , i expect tax collecting and repartition is a bureaucratic nightmare . 
  it 's a ** political ** nighmare . 
  the foral territories have it easy , they pay the central government for the services that central governemnt or eu provide . 
  the other communities have the crazy system that every government modifies . 
   it sounds like they are allowed to spend , but they are not encouraged to collect or stimulate businesses .

  no ... you actually have to have a proven link to being sephardi , not just the name . 
  i mean , it 's stuff like speaking ladino , official certifications from sephardi organizations , etc. ... then yeah it 's the language and constitutional and general knowledge of spain test . 
  it 's far more strict than just a name ... and that started in 2015 so hardly impactful at this point . 
  it 's like those accounts of when a language only has two speakers left but they refuse to speak to each other because of grudges . 
    i think most mainstream socialists have accepted her economic policies as dogma by now . 
  and only the `` populist socialists '' or communists still oppose them . 
  maybe but her name is still synonymous with satan to the left . 
  i am for third-way economically liberal but socially progressive politics that has n't really broken through as much as it could have in europe . 
  liberal economics has traditionally also been tied to religion and other social causes that i disagree with . 
  seriously , i do n't speak italian but i get by just fine in italy speaking spanish with people . 
  i understand a solid 75 % of italian . 
  it 's not mutually intelligible , but it 's not that far away from it . 
  i certainly understand it way better than portuguese and i 'd say it 's probably pretty close to catalan in how much i can pick up . 
  normally it 's not that bright , but a flare at full blast is an impressive sight . 
  i think it 's kind of like the us where people generally exercise a lot or are completely lazy with little in between . 
  this is because your country is flat . 
  madrid has quite a lot of hills so unless you have an electric assist ( the public sharing program does ) , you get tired very fast at least one way . 
  huh , i wonder why we 're so much better than our usual equivalent group ( portugal , italy , greece ) i 'm doing my part by not exercising . 
  seriously , banning them was the best thing they could have hoped for . 
  `` eu citizen '' is completely meaningless outside of dealing with other eu countries . 
  the eu is n't a state and foreign policy is explicitly devolved . 
  well , vat fraud is n't the same thing as illegal employment . 
  i think once employment gets good enough more people will insist on working with contracts and that will help , too . 
  honestly , a huge problem is benefits fraud though . 
  lots of people like to work illegally so they can work a short time legally and then get unemployment and wages at the same . 
   ( the terrorism stuff , if i ever took part in anything that had to do with child soldiers etc ) fyi , they ask those so if they find something out about you , you are guilty of lying of a visa application , which is a much easier crime to prosecute . 
  especially since it 's perfectly legal in the us to promote al qaeda or isis just so long as you are not specifically calling for imminent violence . 
  so how is greek corruption the eu 's fault ? 
  it does n't have to be the same 5 % . 
  ideally it 's a rotating among people who are out of work at the moment . 
  people living off benefits for many years are , indeed , a big cost to society . 
  ( not saying they should n't have it , but you have to recognize the costs ), 
   and how are they going to pay back their debt with the then compeletely deflated currency ? 
  they do n't ... that 's the whole idea of a default . 
  that said ... good luck running a primary account surplus on a rapidly inflating currency because nobody would lend to greece for deficit spending for a long time if they went down that path . 
  ( and they 'd still be subject to repay those bonds eventually ), 
  but we do n't create nearly as much value with those hours . 
  we measure productivity in euros and other countries are able to produce more in fewer hours worked . 
  so the goal should be increasing efficiency . 
  what you are talking about is more the employment rate rather than the unemployment rate . 
  they are both useful and obviously linked , but they tell different stories . 
  i mean , it 'd be ridiculous to count a parent staying home with their children who does n't want to work as unemployed . 
  what about someone who is independently wealthy and living off of investments ? 
  both of those affect the employment rate , but should be completely excluded from unemployment . 
  it 's the whole idea of active population . 
  ( yes , i 'm agreeing with you , just elaborating more ), 
  soon we 'll be on the trend line !, 
  honestly , it 's hard to compare because there have been lots of efforts to get people to be working legally , but there is still quite a bit of a cash economy . 
  it 's still standard , especially in things like home repair , for them to ask you `` do you want that with or without vat ? '' . 
  so , it depends how effective the evasion measures have been basically for where it should be in good times and we still do n't really know . 
  well if you want separate foreign policies , expect differing visa regimes . 
  it 's a natural consequence . 
  i think it 's because there is such a large polish community to help new immigrants in chicago . 
  there 's a tv channel in polish and polish newspapers and everything there . 
   there 's no immigration / passport / border control check of any kind when you fly from one shengen airport to another . 
  just to be extremely picky . 
  it 's entirely possible for there to be customs controls ( they are just pretty invisible ) on intra-schengen flights . 
  even domestic flights within spain can have customs controls as canary islands are outside of the vat area . 
  but norway , switzerland and iceland are not part of the european customs union . 
  americans often conflate immigration and customs since it always happens at the same time there , but obviously in europe there are plenty of examples of one or the other . 
  just like how you go through customs at your final destination , even for an intra-schengen connection . 
  i 've never been questioned at schengen control ( granted i have a residence card ) but i get a ton of questions from uk border force when i go there . 
  uk and canada are probably the strictest borders i 've dealt with ( i was detained once at us , but it was a legitimate misunderstanding and quickly worked out ) . 
  this is all on a us passport that said , if i do n't have my residence card out right away for schengen , they start to flip rapidly through the passport trying to figure out stamps and stays , especially hard since they do n't always stamp residents . 
  in fairness , the us also has massive interests in asia that are of no concern to nato . 
  also the middle east really is n't a big deal for a defensive alliance but that at least matters a lot more to nato members . 
  also , non-eu citizens are n't treated equally within the eu . 
  i have no right of free movement , for example . 
  i like the spirit of the measure but a united foreign policy has been roundly rejected as part of the eu . 
  that 's still a member state thing so i do n't think it 's as clear cut as people want it to be . 
  yeah , i think the only times i 've ever had sangr\u00eda among spanish people is in town festivals when it 's literally served out of a barrel with a ladle . 
  that 's not meant to be good . 
   jewish attorneys working on behalf of the aclu defended the rights of neo-nazis to march in illinois i hate illinois nazis !, 
  exactly , the stance is that a50 triggers negotiations . 
  the idea of planning negotiations to start negotiations is ridiculous . 
  until a50 is triggered , there is legally no difference as before so there is nothing to negotiate . 
  i agree that would be horrid . 
  but i do n't think it should be illegal, 
  i mean , there 's no right to not have your feelings hurt , and i would be out to protest against any law that tries to protect people 's feelings like that . 
  i mean , i agree psychological abuse exists , but i think it 's a huge stretch to say a terrible message on a bus is personally abusive to anyone . 
   and they apparently subscribe to the buzzfeed school of marketing well , the marketing is certainly working . 
  they are reaching a far bigger audience than they would have otherwise . 
  i do n't see how anyone 's rights are being violated by a message on a bus . 
  i agree it 's very good that the vast majority of people disagree with this . 
  i get they are horrible , but they are by no means advocating for violence . 
  i would say that falls under inciting violence which would violate rights of others . 
   just the reduction of company tax is neoliberal and not something i agree with . 
  honestly , this is something i agreed with until i really started to learn more about how businesses work from the inside . 
  basically , consumers will always pay for the taxes imposed on companies because it 's just a cost and their whole point is to make money . 
  now charging a tax on profits is just an inefficient way to go about things and puts incentives for trying to make profits appear lower , seek to add deductions , etc. . . in the tax code and make it so crazy accounting becomes a much more reasonable thing to do . 
  that 's why i think all business taxes should just be taxed with a vat and be done with it to help reduce market distortion and make `` having a more expensive lawyer '' less of a competitive advantage . 
  it makes tax collection more efficient and does n't fuck with the natural equilibrium of the market as much . 
  now , it 's perfectly reasonable to make different vat categories if you want to favor certain industries ( lower vat on food or arts , for example ) but that 's a lot better than just trying to carve out a million exceptions to a corporations tax that then get used as loopholes . 
  consumers will pay the tax whether it 's included in the price from the company as part of their costs or billed directly as vat . 
  for the us , if you have n't read the early life section of jason chaffetz 's wiki page , you really should . 
  he 's like an adopted dynasty son . 
  i mean , it could legitimately be a hormonal issue . 
  and even if not , you do n't have to be healthy to understand health policy . 
  they 're not even close to being the same thing . 
  i mean , that 's like saying the best way to find who should administer a hospital is pick someone at random from a group running a marathon .

because all the spaniards decide what spain is . 
  read the constitution . 
  how hard is that ? 
   catalunya s\u00ed que es pot they want a referendum but they want catalonia to remain in spain, 
  i know it hurts but 52  47, 
  i repeat , they are pro referendum but want catalonia to remain in spain, 
  they are pro referendum but want catalonia to remain in spain, 
   who decides what is a nation ? 
  the people of that nation . 
  so , could barcelona declare itself a nation ? 
  we are entering a loop . 
  and you do n't understand that sovereignty belongs to all the spaniards , like the spanish constitution ( voted by all spaniards including catalans ) says, 
  catalonia neither . 
  who decides what is a nation ? 
  you ? 
  would you let tarragona province to split from catalonia ? 
  let me guess ... no . 
  hypocrite, 
  and what happens if my province or my town declare themselves an independent nation ? 
  or what happens if the city of barcelona , with a large population and its own history , makes a referendum and they want to remain part of spain . 
  that would be a mess . 
  territorial integrity and law enforcement are essential for a democracy . 
  otherwise that would be anarchy . 
  moral right ? 
  enough, 
  exactly . 
  that 's what the spanish constitution , approved by all the spaniards including catalans , say . 
   national sovereignty belongs to the spanish people , from whom all state powers emanate . 
   they have the right to get out because you say it . 
  the laws that all the spaniards , including catalans , approved say the oposite, 
  navarre , basque country and madrid are richer, 
  the government will suspend the autonomy if that happens, 
  he was injured, 
  navarre is 3rd, 
  thanks to the french, 
  and salmorejo ? 
  venga , p\u00edrate ya pesado . 
  no l'entenc . 
  yes , i meant crown of aragon . 
  my mistake, 
  \u00bf lo pillas ? 
  is this increase a little artifial ? 
  i mean that if basque is being spoken now in places where it has never been spoken in history . 
  do n't take it as an attack , just curious . 
  the counties were so independent , that they were ruled by the same guy so , when phillip ii was king of portugal , spain and portugal were the same country ? 
  la primera referencia expl\u00edcita al t\u00e9rmino principatus cathaloniae se produce en 1350 . 
  ok , but each county was independent from each other and the principality of catalonia was part of the kingdom of aragon so , as usual , you are taking a historical fact twisting it so that it fits your ideas . 
   apart from the 3 republics of catalonia that have existed , of course good joke . 
  two coups that led to nothing and a civil war between catalans in which france took advantage in order to conquer the roussillon . 
  '' visca el re\u00ed d \u00b4 espanya i muiren els traidors '' '' long live the king of spain and death to the traitors '', 
  he was older than his brother . 
  maybe someone can think that he killed him to ascend the throne, 
  catalonia was never independent and andalucia was the granada kingdom . 
  this game does n't seem very good historically . 
  i believed that baku was in asia, 
  just rumors . 
  they were very happy in seville . 
  they are going to film in girona and pe\u00f1iscola next year . 
   50 countries , 230 languages , 731m people ... 1 subreddit, 
  why the downvotes ? 
  it has been changed to 16, 
   economic imbalance toward catalonia debatable . 
  if you believe in interterritorial solidarity you should be happy with the current system but i think that the problem is that you are simply selfish . 
  madrid is the most disadvantaged and they do n't complain http://www.abc.es/media/201407/25/balanzafiscal--644x800.jpg i think you should focus in your polititians , those who made catalonia to have an incredible debt . 
  catalan nationalists rejected a fiscal system like basque or navarrese in the transition . 
   catalanophobia false . 
   attacks against our language like having 25 % of hours in school in castillian and 75 % in catalan . 
  or fines for not labeling in catalan ( this does n't happen anymore )  a total rejection against all the propositions of autonomy and a referendum for catalonia and the humiliation of those that got through ( estatut ) more autonomy ? 
  the european region with more autonomy and you want more ? 
  you have education competence , health , regional police , ... the only thing you do n't have is your own fisco . 
  i think that pp made a big mistake with the estatut . 
  i am republican and i try to make my country better , not to destroy it . 
  what reason ? 
  the anthem also represents me . 
  how would you feel if i did the same with els segadors ? 
  the problem is that hate only generates rejection and you are not going to get anything humiliating an entire nation . 
  you can whistle , burn flags , say that spain steal you , etc. 
  but do n't expect that we like it . 
  what ? 
  did the republicans parties win the last elections and i did n't notice ? 
  the national anthem represents the country , not the king . 
  you can do what you want but it is impolite . 
  they booed the anthem , not the king, 
  i have n't force you to do anything, 
  very impolite, 
  and ? 
  good luck with the new barcelona 's coin, 
  the math is that 23  18 and ciu + erc+cup = 44 % . 
   it seems that it was n't neither written by a constituent assembly with this only power http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/government_of_the_constituent_legislature_of_spain http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fathers_of_the_constitution what you say is very beautiful but it is impossible to implement . 
  in your opinion , a representative democracy is n't a true democracy ? 
  is there any democratic country in the world ? 
  we have to live with a legal framework , otherwise it would be a chaos . 
  who can decide what is democratic ? 
  the laws and the judges , and the laws are made by polititians that are elected by the people so at the end the legal solution is the democratic solution . 
  it 's always good to remember that catalu\u00f1a will always be spain , it reduces the frustrations, 
  bla , bla , bla ... http://www.infolaso.com/politica1/27-elecciones-en-espana/715-constitucion.html '' democracy can not be the dictatorship of the majority '' would you respect the decision of barcelona or tarragona province if they chose to stay in spain ? 
  let me guess ... no we have the law , the army and the legitimacy . 
  what do you have ? 
  nothing . 
  '' the constitution is based on the indissoluble unity of the spanish nation , the common and indivisible homeland of all spaniards ; it recognizes and guarantees the right to self-government of the nationalities and regions of which it is composed and the solidarity among them all . '',

  had the us not gone batshit funding the talibans , they 'd died out eventually . 
  as far as i know , iran has never occupied a country in the last century , while the us has occupied - both directly and via proxy wars - several countries that have perished in millions ( in response to your `` thousands '' ) . 
  who cares ? 
  facts are facts . 
  every comment in this thread is pushing an agenda , are n't they ? 
   your firsrt paragraph is completely unnecessary and the only effect it could possible have is antagonize people . 
  you completely disregard the other side of the argument , and then you finish by calling the debate stupid . 
  yes , i see no reason why someone would downvote this post . 
  how the hell is my first paragraph unecessary and antagonizing ? 
   / u/samuel79s [ 1 ] is arguing the same thing as you , but actually listening to what / u/notaromanian [ 2 ] has to say and acknowledging the parts where he 's correct , like how the sentiment in the region is , indeed , to not get absorbed into catalan but actually have their own identity . 
  his comment when i commented was just `` too bad that la franja does n't actually speak catalan but what they call chapurriau . 
  i live there so i should know . '', 
  which is just incorrect ( and much more pretensious and `` antagonizing '' than my comment , btw ) and is the part i answered to . 
  the discussion was from the very start about linguistics , it has nothing to do with identities and feelings . 
  i did n't mean to offend anyone and i do n't really see how i come across in a bad manner . 
  what ? 
  from the institutions we are well aware that there exists a vast range of dialects which are all to be protected , i do n't know why you are syaing this . 
  if anything , the dialects of catalan have much more recognisition and power than the dialects of spanish within spain . 
  while we accept that the catalan from valencia is called and is valenci\u00e0 , the spanish spoken in the canarys is the same spanish that is spoken in extremadura . 
   hey are spanish nationalists who want to kill the language , no less !!!!, 
  well , kind of ... since these people are under aragonese legislation , which is a legislation that barely gives any attention to a language that is spoken a lot there ... you can only learn catalan as an optative subject , sort of as if it was a foreign language or something ( afaik ) . 
  of course there exists a standard catalan , just like there exists a standard language for all the languages in the world . 
  and the divide y venceras tactic is being used in every region outside catalonia where catalan is spoken ... see valencia with the relentless effort by pp & co to legally make it a distinct language ( despite the opposition of ... all the academics ) , or the balearics ... 
  i do n't know why my opinion is wrong while yours is n't , since we are stating the same . 
  thanks for the insult , appreciate it . 
  yes , it is known pp has absolute majority because millions of elders are manipulated . 
  it has nothing to do with the fact that people actually legitimately vote for pp . 
  whatever . 
  as i said , fine by me . 
  they speak chapurriau there , great . 
  one more language that i speak - as i said , fantastic for my cv . 
  also , i advise you against having this kind of discussion with a linguist nor with someone that lives there . 
  what the hell ? 
  in the very link you shared it is stated castellano is the same language as espa\u00f1ol , lol . 
  castellano being the spanish spoken in spain , that 's it . 
  it 's as much spanish as what 's spoken in south-america , albeit different . 
  fucking hell hahaha 3/4 years i 've been here and this thing still comes up . 
  corona d'arag\u00f3 is just a name . 
  the reino de aragon was the result of the dinastic union between the kingdom of aragon and the county of barcelona , that 's it . 
  barcelona was the political center before valencia took over and catalan was the official laguage . 
  you are arguing over a name . 
  if anything , catalanaragonesa is more inclusive and precise considering both of the political entities that formed the union were equal . 
  umm i disagree . 
  in terms of verbs spanish has a wider variety . 
  there is a huge variety within south-america itself , let alone within the whole spanishphere ( ? ) . 
  in valencia they say pense , in menorca they say pens and in the south of france they say pensi , but the verb is the same . 
  in argentina they say `` coger '' , in mexico they say `` chingar '' and in spain we say `` follar '' ( i 'm not entirely sure if i got the countries right , but the point stands ) . 
  vocabulary wise the diferences are even bigger ... as for the downvotes thing , totally to be expected . 
  i thought about you but to be fair a government with absolute majority from the pp does n't really stand up for the plurinationality of spain .0, 
  and what does that have to do with `` denying the identities within spain '' ? 
  and what does that have to do with `` denying the identities within spain '' ? 
  `` by the way , you mean arag\u00f3n '' , that 's what i was responding to . 
  i have nothing to say about a piece of anectodal stuff with no evidence at all . 
   i want to point out that there is a difference between castellano and espa\u00f1ol aswell . 
  no there is not . 
  i see know you are just talking out your arse, 
  elaborate ? 
  i see it is arrogant to write a toponym in catalan and not ~ ~ english ~ ~ spanish , how dare i. i bloody hope you never say londres , munich , nueva york or pekin or else you will be offending billions !, 
  by the way can you show me these grammar differences?at least one ? 
  not that two dialects need to share grammar to be so , but i want to see how you manage to transform a thing every linguist agrees is a dialect into a language on its own . 
  as i said , i 'm happy with it . 
  being a polyglot is amazing !, 
   yeah ~ ~ most ~ ~ people can speak spanish as well , though some as a second language . 
  til `` the catalan special snowflex complex '' denies the identities and nationalities within spain . 
  under what rock have you been living to not see that the only regions that have significantly pushed for the recognision of all the nationalities within spain have been the basque country and catalonia ? 
  ( valencia , the balearics and the canary islands to a lesser extent ) . 
  ** edit : so a guy right above me , / u/samuel79s says literally the same thing i do yet he is at +9 while i 'm at -2 . 
  oh well , my flair is such a burden ** hahaha i spent one summer in massali\u00f3 , well deep into `` la franja '' in arag\u00f3 and had no problem at all speaking catalan with almost everybody , but i get it , they speak a different language . 
  with this one i now speak around 6 or 7 languages : catalan , spanish , english , valencian , balearic , alguerian and now `` chapurriau '' . 
  my cv will be stacked as fuck . 
  without sounding like i am taking the piss , which i definitely was , the differences between what they speak there and what is spoken in barcelona , val\u00e8ncia or mallorca are way smaller than the differences between what 's spoken in madrid and lima , cancun , buenos aires , etc. , yet there is no stupid debate regarding what language they speak . 
  hell , the differences between what 's spoken in la franja and barcelona are smaller than what 's talked in pontevedra and cadiz ... 
  bangkok subway is shit ... 
  hahhaah been waiting for this one for a long time . 
  exceeded my expectations . 
  ( buenafuente 2 good ), 
  whatever, 
  where have i said anything of the sort ? 
  are you sure you meant to reply to me ? 
  it was n't november , but july . 
  http://www.elperiodico.com/es/noticias/politica/encuesta-independencia-cataluna-ceo-noviembre-2016-5635366 yes had 47 % while no 42 % . 
  now there 's barely 1.5 % diference . 
  and the poll from the previus month registered the highest support for independence since records exist . 
  hence the `` independentism has been shrinking '' statement is false . 
  ever heard of autocorrector ? 
  of course i know the name is pa\u00eds valenci\u00e0 . 
  the one that started the confrontation is you , funnily enough . 
   funny , i have met far more radical independentists wishing harm upon us for being spanish than i have neo-nazis living here . 
  sure mate , sure . 
   that one reason why the flag means hostility to me , btw , you types being fuckers towards us when we do n't agree with you i do n't even know what `` being a fucker '' means . 
  also , you are completely missing the meaning of the flag or you are blinded by catalan hatred . 
  no mos furtareu la paella . 
  i have nothing against you . 
  i consider you as cousins , if not brothers , culturally speaking , yet the hate you have towards us is unparalled . 
  you are so obsessed trying to make valenci\u00e0 not catalan , that you 'd rather consider it spanish than catalan . 
  as someone with andalusian family who frequently goes visit them , agreed !, 
  agreed on the viva espa\u00f1a as well . 
  que viva . 
  let us life too . 
  i 'm pretty sure this joke would 've been just that , a joke , had someone from elsewhere told it .

  which does n't make them '' be right '' in this instance , mind you , they 're certainly quite intolerant if they 're bothered by people in swimsuits . 
  but let 's not pretend harassment does n't happen , and that 's likely a big part of why renting the place out will allow them to have some undisturbed fun . 
  should we not want them to just have fun carelessly ? 
  is that not a big western value in itself that likely would help integration generations down the road ? 
  sure , but my point is that a ) surely even salaffis like to have fun every now and then ( and for them `` fun '' just ca n't be had around infidels showing their bodies ) , and b ) a waterpark seems like a rather silly place to unite for any sort of nefarious purposes . 
  i can see both sides . 
  but in the end i agree : they 're using their money to do this . 
  slightly aggressive sure , but ultimately well within the real of things that should be tolerated in any first world country . 
  i also think a proportion of them might not be doing it aggressively , but rather as a way to have fun without feeling like they have to be perpetually observed and singled out for choosing to dress the way they do . 
  because i 'd have a hard time believing the women going to a waterpark are the kind that are truly oppressed by their husbands and such . 
  still sad , though . 
  wow . 
  are you serious in that you 're unaware of any kind of analysis by mainstream economists or financial institutions ? 
  either way , [ heres a little something to get you started on your quest for knowledge on this matter ] ( https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/hm-treasury-analysis-the-long-term-economic-impact-of-eu-membership-and-the-alternatives ) . 
   it 's basic supply and demand it 's not , i 'm sorry . 
  i 'm also sorry you 've engaged in the exact same armchair economist handwaving i denounced from op . 
  uhm excuse me but what ? 
  your whole world is organised in accordance to sound economic studies . 
  do you have any sort of systematic evidence to source your claim ? 
  i 'm sorry but it sounds like your implication is that economics as a field of study is mostly invalid , speculation , and/or completely optional to the functioninf of modern society . 
  and that 's just incredibly ignorant in a `` scientologists have valid criticisms of modern psychiatry '' kind of way . 
   our privacy and consumer rights standards will be undermined or the us will sue ( note that suing has no chance to fail in the critics logic , because evil corporate judges ! ) . 
  i do n't think that 's the logic at all . 
  it 's not trivial to allow these ridiculous matters to even get to a court , and it 's not necessary for there to be a possibility for these matters to be won ( although they actually are , is that not the whole function of them being allowed to go to court ? ), 
  for such matters to be extremely undesirable . 
  please do n't discount such an important viewpoint , and do n't be so naive so as to believe that what 's `` right and just '' will always be protected despite anything , or that the ultimate sovereignty of countries would n't be threatened , even in partial manners , with these sorts of deals . 
  it takes a great deal of mental gymnastics , i think , to remain so calm on the face of these measures being introduced as part of these trade deals ( and so non-transparently as they are ) , as if the interested parties were n't doing their ( very economically and legally powerful ) homeworks before going through all the effort . 
  you seem to be right , i was misinformed on the subject . 
  i think the overall point still stands , though . 
   i am explaining why people voted this way and should n't be blamed for it , not that brexit is a good idea i honestly do n't understand your arguments though . 
  you 've argued thus far ( and not merely relayed ) : * that the rich benefit from europe * that the poor do n't * brexit not necessarily a good idea * educated tweens may have selfish biases ergo : * we should n't blame people for voting the way they did ? 
  i 'm sorry , i may be a bit too rigid , but i 'm not quite grasping what your overall argument is , and i think you engaged in quite a bit of goalpost-moving . 
  either people who voted `` leave '' have legitimate arguments and i should n't blame them , or they do n't , and i absolutely can on account of them not doing proper research on something they cast a ~ ~ legally binding ( as is the case for uk referendums ) ~ ~ vote on . 
  you absolutely can not have it both ways . 
  exactly this argument , from all i 've heard , is particularly incomprehensibke to me . 
  but if you want to make a bet out of how lower-classes britons will end up faring in the aftermath of brexit , be my guest : remindme !, 
  3 years, 
   that higher-educated people voted for the right thing because they are smarter except i did n't say that . 
  i said they 're better informed . 
  please do n't put words in my mouth . 
   this argument is brought forward a lot and i do n't buy it . 
  as compelling as your `` sounds logical '' argument is , it simply contradicts extensive consensus from the field of economics . 
  if you want to argue from facts , you 'll need to provide sources . 
  otherwise , emotional rhetoric does n't interest me in the slightest , effective as it might have been during the brexit campaign . 
  and would , from a certain perspective , likely be truthful as well . 
  i see this less as a discriminatory practise than a pragmatic one ; for a multi-year project , when you start out , would you not much rather work with people you 're reasonably certain will still be within your own geopolitical region in 2 years 's time ? 
  do n't get me wrong , this absolutely blows , and uk scientists have my deepest sympathies , for something they likely tried to prevent , but in the end they got fucked over by their own compatriots for mostly racist reasons , and this will be just the beginning of a long list of unfortunate ramifications for the uk . 
  everyone in the uk are benefitting from being in the eu , not just direct grant-receivers . 
  or do you hold , in this very narrow scope of analysis , for instance , that the population ( and indeed the economy ) at large does n't benefit from an increased ( as compared to nationally-supported ) scientific and research activity in general ? 
  op may have worded it wrong , in that it 's far more accurate to speak of the * perception * or * being conscious * of the benefits , rather than actually receiving them ; and it 'd hold true in the sense that indeed higher-educated people in general voted `` stay '' as they 're , indeed , generally more aware than the rest of the population of exactly how beneficial being in the eu turns out to be for the uk . 
  this some trump-level oversimplification here . 
   maybe i 'm too dumb . 
  i did not sugges this . 
   imminent dictatorship this was n't my claim either . 
  my claim was that he would try . 
  but just some off the top of my head : * trying to control the media ( keeping certain news orgs outside the briefings , inviting some non-legitimate yet very in-line with their narrative `` news orgs '' to them ... ) . 
  you might think these are child tactics , and to some extent they are indeed laughable ; but consider how targeted cnn has been , for instance , and the uncharacteristically enthusiastic some of their show hosts were about praising him over syria . 
  * more on the information wars/propaganda : trying to create fake news about his opponents without regard for veracity or even plausibility ( obama wiretapping him , various other conspiracy theories ) ... again , you might think this is idiotic , but he 's got huge segments of the population actually ** believing ** these things , and even the skeptics among us/the media are caught up in an impossibly past-paced news cycle that does n't allow to hold him accountable for the very egregious things that he 's been doing . 
  * disregard for laws and balances . 
  he 's tried to use all his available powers to push his agenda , and even extend them . 
  so far other parts of the government have fought back ( the judiciary shutting down his muslim ban ) , but others are just rolling with it . 
  next in this point to look out for is for him to attempt to expand his actual powers via convincing/coercing the legislative power to grant him more capabilities ( they 've already removed fillibustering for the supreme court confirmations , which is an undisputed , if indirect , reach of the executive branch 's power into the judiciary ) . 
  he literally feels he 's above the law , and has expressed it quite a few times ( shooting someone on the fifth ave. . . ) . 
  and things that have been `` common sense '' , yet not laws ( such as providing his tax returns ) , he absolutely will disregard . 
  * is slowly dismantling various government agencies . 
  * assembled his own intelligence team . 
  would n't want the agencies already in place to interfere in his matters , given , among other things , that their allegiance does n't stand with him directly , but with the interests of the country . 
  * disregard for the actual wellbeing of the population . 
  he wants to repeal and replace obamacare without so much as a study behind how much this will cost and how many people this will affect ( of course we know these things now ) . 
  reducing the bugdet not only for healthcare , but also for education directly and indirectly points towards an inequivocal trend . 
  he 's robbing the public blind with his various trips and security expenses which forces the agencies in charge of his security to take money out of the budget and pay it directly to his hostelry companies . 
  * trying to buy/win over the military . 
  the budget increase for the military has this motivation , plus having the added advantage of making it easier to institute a police state if necessary . 
  * if all else fails , he 's got an escape plan in the form of support/ties from foreign authoritarians , which is the absolute very least his russian ties are about . 
  there are more sinister possibilities , though . 
  * warmongering ( this one is self explanatory ) . 
  and there 's more , but these are the absolutely blatantly evident . 
  this man has been less than 3 fucking months in charge , what do you expect he 'll have achieved by year 's end ? 
  turn on the newscast . 
  now pick up a history book on your totalitarian of choice , get to the chapter about its beginnings . 
  compare . 
  i link them insofar as they all form a part of a global pattern where politics are moving towards the right , with a generalised overarching theme of intolerance . 
  i did not mean to suggest they were comparable in gravity at all . 
  saying `` it 's jusf a vote to leave the union '' is ignoring completely the background of xenophobic rhetoric that a large part of the campaign was based on . 
  which is not to say everyone who voted `` leave '' did it for those reasons , but they did vote for it regardless . 
  it sparked a chain of events that ended up putting may in power . 
  no , it 's not fascism yet , but it 's slowly walking in that direction , for sure . 
  are you for real ? 
  do you believe for a second trump wo n't try to go full dictator until someone or something stops him ? 
  i know what stats you 're talking about . 
  how about you link the source and i 'll explain what 's actually going on , that the sensationalist tabloid you found them in wo n't tell you ? 
   everything to do with their way of parenting which you know has ** everything ** to do with their socioeconomic backgrounds , do n't you ? 
   you do n't see many asian kids in europe making problems , even though they might not have the best financial position at first i 've literally never come across an asian family who were alone , without support , unable to get a job , and barely scraping by . 
  for better or worse , even though they do n't immigrate with tons of money , they do n't exactly come here on boats , alone , and without a plan . 
  they 're also not fleeing from anything , except worse possibilities for social mobility . 
  and everyone knows it . 
  funny , seeing as romanian and latin-american immigrants c children suffer from the issues , which are associated with the same socioeconomic problems . 
  the data does n't support your biases , i 'm afraid . 
  link to evidence of you want to convince anyone next time . 
   it is more and more difficult for white kids to grow up in the bubble that people like me ( and probably most on this subreddit ) grew up in , the bubble where we can simultaneously believe in the long-term harmlessness of immigration while being personally shielded from its immediate harm .

  that would risk wwiii . 
  any little green men would be an instant invocation of article 5 and it would be taken very , very seriously . 
  venezuela 's current government definitely would . 
  someone really needs to make a bunch of rajoy videos where the curb your enthusiasm music just when ever he has his awkward speeches or movements . 
  officially for spain they will have never left . 
   can you imagine an european union where 150,000 entities have veto rights ? 
  holy roman empire . 
  this time even holier , romanier and more imperial . 
  with extra factioning !, 
  but if one side does n't think the vote is legitimate in the first place , it 's hard to call it a fair election . 
  just like the last one that was a `` consultation '' that won over 80 % because the unionists generally boycott . 
  gdp does n't seem higher than it is . 
  it is , by definition , exactly what it is . 
  that it may not provide a complete picture is another issue and no statistic will show things perfectly so you just have to understand exactly what it is you 're measuring . 
  also , it 's not that large of an effect in the us because a ) us has shitty corporate tax law in the first place with global taxation and b ) the us population is so huge that the effects are n't as pronounced . 
  if you were just talking about delaware , you might have a point . 
  this one https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzbfzwqeoko, 
   a vote for the tories is n't a vote for hard brexit it kind of is at this point . 
  i still say eu does n't make sense for an independent scotland but efta does . 
  yeah , that 's exactly why they 've only been able to win with blair and brown ( who was basically an extension of blair ) since thatcher came into office . 
   if the conservatives fail to obtain a majority then a coalition will happen . 
  yeah , it 's them failing to get a majority that seems like crazy talk . 
  yeah , snp is in the mix , but tories are n't playing in scotland already so they have little to lose . 
  labour is going to collapse and that will likely be divided by tories and lib dems but i do n't see how tories lose any seats and only see them picking up a lot more . 
  ( a few will probably go to lib dem but hard to see it as a trend ) also , minority governments are a thing , there 's no reason a coalition has to happen . 
  i think it really comes down to if you care about social or economic policy more of where you classify them . 
  if that is actually somehow viable ... maybe . 
  but that seems so far outside the realm of possibility it 's crazy . 
  like what constituencies did labour lose that they can pick up this time ? 
  and none of all of this has actually moved into large support of the lib dems . 
  they will gain , but it will almost certainly be modest . 
  i really have a hard time seeing how this is going to be anything but a blue wave over an already blue map . 
  i just imagine uk showing up to the eu pretending like nothing at all has happened . 
  - `` what vote ? ... i 'm pretty sure if we 'd have voted out i 'd have let you know '' - `` you did , it was a big deal and we were sorely disappointed . '', 
  - `` lad , sorry , but if you 're just going to make up stories , we have no basis for a relationship . '', 
  and then everyone just forgets this whole thing ever happened and it becomes a curious footnote in history books . 
  the right thinks they 're center-left and the left thinks they 're center-right . 
  honestly , `` liberal '' is just a pretty accurate description of them without trying to force it onto the uk 's left/right axis . 
  they 're all kinds of backwards . 
  their brexit is blue , white and red . 
  except labour supports brexit . 
   coalition seems second most likely to me . 
  lib dems wo n't go into coalition with them again . 
  they may agree ( possibly with tepid snp support ) for a program of the government and vote to form a tory minority government , but they will remain in opposition . 
  they have learned their lesson . 
  that said , i do n't see how conservatives do n't win an outright majority given how little lib dems have been able to capitalize and how bad of a spot labour is in . 
  i 'm also really curious how all of this will affect the vote in northern ireland . 
  not really , plenty of people take ones they do n't use or just destroy other ones or whatever . 
  nobody counts ballots for exit polls , they are just actual polls where they ask people how they voted and correct for demographics . 
  nothing ... there are just stacks of each option so you take the one you need . 
  if people care about making it private , there are private booths with ballots , too . 
  just to clarify about how it works for people that may not have this system is you put the one you want in an envelope and then put that envelope in a ballot box . 
  same for general elections , you just put the party list you want in the envelope and enter it . 
  cue * lord of war * scene . 
  i mean , i do n't disagree , but i do n't think it 's as far of an overarching principle about diplomacy versus force projection and all that . 
  i think mattis just does n't trust tillerson . 
  it 's a lot more personal and about this state department and not the state department in general . 
  also worth remembering that a large percentage of taxes in the us are also state and local taxes and primarily property taxes paid directly or indirectly through rent . 
  then you should add health insurance premiums to switzerland , germany , netherlands ( who else uses private insurance ? ), 
  and this is why nobody in spain understands that salary is not the same as cost . 
  the amount of times someone says that an employee costs what they get in their account after taxes is crazy . 
  i agree , but trying selling `` we want the corporations to pay less tax for you and change it to income tax ! '', 
  i meant the germans had most of their manpower on the eastern front . 
  and the send wave after wave in essentially suicide attacks and just try to surround advancing armies was pretty much how the eastern front of wwi worked . 
  yeah , the actual urban warfare was new but the general idea was similar to the last generation just scaled up . 
  i guess ` divert ' implies it was n't the main objective . 
  and to me it 's not the number of divisions but rommel 's leadership that would have been the big deal . 
  no , i absolutely agree . 
  i do n't know why i 'm getting downvotes for saying english language history downplays ussr 's losses and that allied presence helped keep the germans from totally diverting resources , but whatever . 
  i never said anything to the contrary . 
  just saying that allies did n't join late in the war . 
  the n. africa campaign started in 1940 , after all . 
  well before even the us joined in . 
  but by the time stalingrad happened , the fighting was quite heavy in n. africa and who knows how it would have worked if those troops could have been sent east . 
  education is mostly concentrated at the state level in the us , so ... kind of . 
  just like we do n't talk about european education but each national system . 
  ( even then , it 's often divided even further ), 
  they were able to divert most manpower , yeah , but the us and uk were tying up german troops in n. africa working their way to the italian invasion . 
  i thought that was just a general anglo think since it was uk and us mostly pushing through on the western front and up through italy . 
  but yeah losses in ussr were staggering since they still kind of stuck with the wwi strategy of just throw more men at the enemy . 
  that does n't seem particularly evil unless someone is somehow forcing the suppliers to agree to the contract . 
  takes two to tango and all that . 
  to me , it 's because that was what the ussr was working towards as well . 
  yeah , it may not be all that useful now , but it was definitely a race to get a man on the moon . 
  but us definitely kept up after that with deep space exploration and more scientific missions that the ussr kind of abandoned in favor of more military space operations . 
  the voyager probes were a huge accomplishment for the us program , too . 
  personally i do n't think `` winning '' any of it is all that important since the time scales were all so close and it was basically developing in parallel . 
   ( a small inoffensive metal space-potato ) i mean , it was n't the potato that was the issue , it was the fact that they very publicly showed they had rockets that could accurately put the potato up there and effectively served as a show of force for icbm capabilities that was why such a shit was flipped . 
   except for the fact that the canadarm was a thing and popular culture/media this is hilarious to me . 
  not saying it was n't a useful piece of technology ... but just kind of ignoring the space race until there was a special articulated arm on a shuttle because canada !, 
  domhnall is doing quite a good job of continuing the gleeson acting tradition . 
  not that i 'm aware of . 
  maybe i 'm such a secret spy that even i do n't know about my own spying . 
  but more seriously , it was still kind of nationalistic in the sense of saying we started from behind but still managed to get to the finish line first . 
  but it was always very particularly distinguished that gagarin was the first man in space and to orbit and shepard was the first american to go up and glenn was the first american to orbit . 
  but i 've always been really into space so perhaps it was just me putting more importance and remembering it more than it was actually mentioned . 
  the true history . 
  ( i do recommend the whole video from the beginning ) https://youtu.be/jpj3sdeaoo8?t=1m14s, 
  russia is definitely the leader in manned space flight right now . 
  i grew up in the us and was definitely taught about gagarin and tereshkova and how the ussr basically beat the us in most of the important parts of the space race except for getting to the moon .

  if you did n't , then _ they are not there _ in any statistically significant way . 
  when you get to prove your case via a controlled experiment . 
   study that made such claims was debunked a while ago i really doubt it , cause `` electric cars still generate pm '' is a fact . 
  the debatable argument is `` how much when compared to combustion '' , and even the exceedingly optimistic studies show only around 10x times less . 
  i dare you find one which suggests less than that . 
  a 10x reduction would be noticeable , but not for long . 
   besides , there is much more to win in optimizing vehicles that run arround the most . 
  comercial vehicles make far more distance and are numerous enough as to start there . 
  paco going back and forth from home to work does polute , but it does polute much more when he 's driving arround dropping stuff each few blocks 8 hours a day than in the 20 minuts he spends going back and forth from home , and , for as much advanced drones we are using nowadays , i doubt they are reading the stickers from the sides of the vans to tell if they are private or comercial vehicles . 
  even if he were to drive 100 times less time as your average commercial vehicle ( i.e. 
  20 minutes/day -  33h/day , an impossible exaggeration ) there are still ( way ) more than 100 private vehicles per commercial at the road in barcelona on any time . 
  this is the magnitude of the problem at hand . 
  concentrating in improving the commercial fleet is completely futile by any sense of the word . 
  and electric cars also generate pollution . 
  not co2 , but they do generate fine particles via wheel contact with the road . 
   while barcelona is a big city and therefore there is plenty of cars , i 'm willing to bet that , while significant , the polution that come from private car usage does n't hold a candle to the polution generated by the port you 'd lose the bet . 
  cars are widely known to be the number # 1 source and with a lot of difference . 
  just google around . 
  in most pollution maps of accurate enough resolution ( drone based ) you can even distinguish the layout of the traffic grid . 
  you might argue that the `` issue '' here is that the pollution from the port quickly floats away through the sea side , and i 'd concede that as plausible . 
  but there is is just too little maritime traffic when compared to road traffic for me to believe that the port generates more pollution than private cars . 
   specially those from junk scavengers that are constantly circling arround for valuables on/next to the containers or vehicles from construction companies and those run in such a large numbers that they actually register in pollution meters ? 
  this is much like the `` but what about the buses ? '', 
  argument . 
  there would need to be at least 1 bus for every 100 cars in orders for buses to actually have a noticeable impact in pollution . 
  the actual ratio is much lower . 
  the problem is , basically , that there are too many cars . 
  and replacing cars with newer cars will not help because even electric cars still generate pm ( e.g. 
  brakes , wheels , etc. 
   my point stands : by and large hollande has been able to implement his policies because he had a socialist parliament no , it does n't !, 
  he had a parliament that was in majority against that policy . 
  which is the reason he had to 49.3 it . 
  why would he 49.3 if he had a `` socialist parliament he could coerce '' ? . 
  he could survive a vote of confidence because that 's much easier to do than getting unpopular laws approved ( even the thresholds are different !, 
  -- strict majority ) . 
  ( and this is also by `` design '' -- otherwise you get weimar germany ) . 
   le pen wo n't have any of those . 
  i do n't understand why would le pen not have a government/executive picked by herself . 
  could you elaborate ? 
   maintain diplomatic relations with religious despots in saudi arabia - bad . 
    do n't maintain diplomatic relations with religious despots in iran - bad . 
  may it appear confusing and strange to you because you look at the wrong reasons , perhaps ? 
  like the problem is not religious despots ( otherwise one would have to reexmine their relations with e.g. 
  the us ) , but rather the amount of rampant state-approved murder both in and outside the borders of these countries ? 
  i mean , palestinians do plenty of stupid things , and so do israelians . 
  not all refugees are bad . 
   he had a majority . 
  the government was his . 
  a vote would not have approved it , precisely because :  sure , sometimes his policies were so wildly unpopular and un socialist that he had to use the 49.3  but do n't forget that it 's a double edged sword : with it comes a vote of confidence . 
  do you think that a parliament not under his control would n't have voted against the confidence ? 
  oh , but surviving votes of confidence is much easier than getting laws approved ... 
   hollande had the backing of parliament why do you say this ? 
  he did not have the backing of parliament . 
  it 's the reason he had to impose it via decree . 
  it 's the reason he would not submit it to a vote . 
  at most , he had the backing of a strict minority of parliament ... 
  imagine what could le pen do with this . 
  a year long state of emergency and consequent suspension of rights _ is _ a threat to democracy , no matter how one sells it . 
  sure , sure , that worked quite well for the labour law , did it ? 
  http://www.reuters.com/article/us-france-politics-protests-iduskcn0zl0tm the truth is that , in the majority of western democracies , separation of powers is non-existant . 
  _ all _ systems that i can think of right now contain provisions for the executive branch to completely override the legislative branch , like the above one . 
  or worse . 
  and if the more underhanded ways were n't enough , france is in a state of emergency ... 
   i hate to remind you that you said that catalonia joined spain seriously , if the word catalonia gives you the scare feel free to replace it with murcia . 
   how could i know if there is no written treaty to argue about ? 
  does picardo say , we would agree on those terms but we want the right to go back to the current situation , take it or leave it no , there is no negotiation and afaik the spanish offer is n't that detailed . 
  then why do you already compare it to the eu ? 
  there 's absolutely _ zero _ evidence that this would be anything other than an annexation , and plenty of evidence to doubt the definition of `` autonomy '' from the current government . 
  but no problem , let 's just wave another few esteladas around in order to keep the populace lulled ... 
   yeah , you won , i 'm doing this . 
  not precisely because of my brilliance , since i kept trying to repeat there is _ absolutely nothing to discuss _ with catalonia . 
  the question is , do you see _ any hint _ of any provision that would even suggest that the situation with gibraltar would be any different ? 
  there is _ absolutely nothing _ to discuss about catalonia here because we do not disagree on anything . 
  or is it that you are arguing that catalonia has a right to secede ? 
  can you turn your brain on for a second before reading catalonia and going into shitstorm mode ? 
  see e.g. 
  ah yes , the usual `` pointing out the obvious is obviously trolling '' phenomena . 
  i hate `` spain '' quite a lot ( i have said it numerous times i think it would be better for everyone if the country just disbanded ) and i think anyone who ever volunteered to be ruled under the current spanish government would definitely qualify for insanity ... 
  yet it is a fact that gibraltar is currently a tax haven . 
  and they have it next door . 
  anyone forgot about mossack fonseca ? 
  it was less than a year ago ... 
  you do n't cede any sovereignty when joining the eu , as proven by brexit . 
  there is an explicit provision to leave in the treaties . 
  you do cede sovereignty when joining spain , as proven by catalonia . 
  there is absolutely no provision to leave in the constitution . 
  i think the difference should be strikingly clear . 
  for a start , she does not seem to be against the state of emergency . 
  for sure not : spain 's popular party ( pp ) is much worse . 
  they have hundreds of corruptions cases , there are almost daily news of trials of their high ranking members , and it is hinted that they used the construction of their headquarters building to launder money . 
  heck , when you google for the equivalent of `` corruption cases pp '' in google.es , it helpfully shows a _ fucking table _ of the most frequent ones . 
  i am not kidding : https://www.google.es/?gws_rd=ssl#q=casos+de+corrupci%c3%b3n+pp this did n't prevent pp from winning the elections ... 
  hey , i was there yesterday  -- what a coincidence . 
  the water flow seems to be closed because of some renovations , so the picture was not as nice as that one . 
  still , worth a visit !, 
  because they all look the same in the plots ? 
  because it is extremely misleading to try to extrapolate information from _ minute _ differences when the numbers just a few thousand kilometers away are orders of magnitude worse ? 
  because ( and this is not the case ) even if it was the worst in any one magnitude of the nordic countries it would still be miles high from what i see here ( ie still great by any measure ) ? 
  etc , etc. 
   but strangely the spanish and italian ones , who where as illiterate workers had magically fully integrated offspring that flourished in higher education .

can i choose the countryman i want to die ? 
  wait , there are a lot of hidden cameras in traffic lights . 
  one of my friends got a ticket for not waiting at 4 a.m in a deserted junction . 
  if i was in charge , i would ban all religions that teaches things against human rights . 
  sympathy for the persons , loathing for the regime and their politicians . 
  i have never heard about it in spain, 
  that one is very funny , because some conspiranoic sites tried to pass it as a proof of ancient aliens . 
  new york is nueva york . 
  new orleans is nueva or-leah-ans . 
  los angeles is pronounced with a hard h. 
  halloween , and some bars celebrate st. patrick 's day , but only a few . 
  good people , nice accent . 
  i am waiting what it will happen now that castro is gone , and i wish them all the luck in the world . 
  the only one i know a little about , is basque . 
  so basque, 
  juan carlos the king ? , the cheater , thief , heir of a dictatorship and killer of his brother and some innocent elephant ? 
  that juan carlos ? 
  all the uses of the word testicles `` cojones '' . 
  no hay cojones \u00a1 it 's like a dare acojonado , scared shitless descojonado laughing escojonado , very tired tener los cojones cuadrados , squared testicles , it 's being very brave tener m\u00e1s cojones que el caballo de espartero : you are very brave because you have more testicles than espartero 's horse tener los cojones pelaos ( peeled testicles ) , when you are very experienced in something y un coj\u00f3n . 
  : no way cojonudo : great . 
  you are right , and i should know because i used to live very near the divisi\u00f3n azul street in my hometown . 
  no , it 's not too long . 
  maybe too long for a daytrip but not for a twoday trip . 
  pp is on the far left of trump . 
  after we voted rajoy again , i am not sure of anything . 
  hans landa is one of my favourite characters ever . 
  a lot ? 
  if i have to make a list i can waste hours . 
  i normally watch then in their language and with subs . 
  the real academia de la lengua espa\u00f1ola for spanish , they take care of the official spanish dictionary, 
  i do n't know if it 's illegal but no one cares, 
  versailles and haussman, 
  we did n't participate in the wwii, 
  yes to ljiubljiana , it 's beautiful, 
  if you like historical places : toledo , m\u00e9rida , tarragona , granada, 
  weirdly yes , but it 's because my boyfriend is a fisherman and he is subscribed to a fishing and hunting online shop , so they send him advertisements about fishing rods and hunting guns . 
  but unrequested , no . 
  and only for hunting guns . 
  you can sell alcohol in bars , caf\u00e9s , restaurants , supermarkets , dollar shops , at any time the shop is open . 
  minimum age of purchasing and drinking is 18 , but almost all people begin to drink earlier , there is a new law that punish parents and vendors but i do n't know anyone who has been carded . 
  no problems with advertising alcohol , in newspapers , tv , etc. 
  i think that you can advertise alcohol in children 's channels but you can advertise alcohol at any hour . 
  there is a huge culture of drinking in public that the government is trying to ban , but botell\u00f3n ( young people in parks , most of them minors ) is very popular . 
  and drinking outside in summer is very common . 
  of course i can think of many scenarios where a black person can deny a white person a job and give preference to another poc , because there are black ceos , and black hirers and black human resources people . 
  and there are a lot of black supremacists out there like there are white supremacists and both are equally despicable . 
  football , football and football , as you can see if you take a look at any sports newspaper . 
  sometimes cycling if it 's the tour , el giro , or la vuelta ciclista a espa\u00f1a but mostly football, 
  best in greece , worst in england, 
  spilling salt , breaking mirrors , bad cats , walking under a ladder , do n't give knifes as gifts, 
  epervier is like the game of l\u00e1tigo ( whip ) in spain , el bal\u00f3n prisionero is like ballon prisonnier , un deux , trois , soleil is like our uno , dos , tres al escondite ingl\u00e9s , and your ball game is like our bote botero , only that instead of playing with a ball we played with an empty can . 
  we have the same games . 
  hide and seek . 
  rescate , where you had a person or two catching the others , and the others had home , a safe place where the catcher could n't get you . 
  the people caught made a line and if one of the runners touched your hand you were free . 
  churro va , a line of bend over in one team and the other team had to jump over them . 
  un , dos , tres al escondite ingl\u00e9s , where one kid put himself against a wall and chant : uno , dos , tres al escondite ingl\u00e9s and then he turn around , the other kids have to approach him while he were chanting and if he saw any kid moving , the kid lose . 
  i always find ironic that we are one of the biggest producer of fruits and vegetables of the eu , but no without our chorizo and jam\u00f3n . 
  only on the practical side , if the relationship will have to be long distance , where we were going to live , things like that . 
  it 's not big here , very few choices or restaurants, 
  gringos are only americans , guiris are foreigners . 
  jos\u00e9 garc\u00eda , or something like this . 
  come to an eu member that covers the treatment . 
  the same , hola , qu\u00e9 tal ? . 
  which can be translated into , hi , how 's it going ? 
  in 2009 there were more civil weddings than religious ones , and most catholic people here only go to church , to weddings , baptisms , communions and funerals . 
  a lot of nuns are from india or southamerica because nobody wants to be a nun , and there are few priests , they called it a crisis of vocations because only a small number or young people want to be priests . 
  but we like the traditional festivals , that 's why easter is a great festival in some towns , and that 's why my nephews who are atheists from atheist parents , dressed themselves in white robes made by my atheist mother and participate in religious parades . 
  diga ( tell me ) , or si ? 
  ( yes ? ), 
  not at all, 
  italy , they drive like madmen, 
  the big cities are most liberal , so madrid , valencia , barcelona . 
  we have a lot of dialects , i am from the middle and i hardly understand the accents of some parts of the south . 
  in the north there are dialects like bable in asturias , fabla in arag\u00f3n . 
  there is panocho in murcia . 
  i think that there is a religious show on sundays in the state tve . 
  there are not a lof of miners left , but they always voted left . 
  in fact there is a slogan about `` worker learn from the miner '' , because they were involved in a lot of strikes and laboral conflicts in the past to fight for their rights . 
  chineses own most of the dollar stores in spain , to the point that the shops are called chinos ( chinese ) . 
  the rest of corner shops are mostly owned by ethnic spaniards , although this is changing and there are some halal meat shops , ruman specialities shops and a lot of muslim are opening fruit shops . 
  in spain we are less susceptible to terrorist attacks since eta leave the weapons , so we are more safe now . 
  legal , free and rare . 
  the big newspapers are totally partisan and they manipulate the news , but i do n't think that they dare to fabricate totally fake news , yet . 
  never , but we are very far from russia . 
  thank manitou \u00a1 \u00a1 \u00a1, 
  i was only talking about spain , is he still famous in germany ? 
  i know that saladin was a kurd , and that you are the biggest ethnicity without state in the world . 
  and a little about peshmerga . 
  but before the current war i only knew that saladin was a kurd, 
  i am forty something and i have read them , but i think that the youngsters do n't read them anymore . 
  yes , and moreso with trump . 
  although it 's more against usa than against americans . 
  the inquisition only killed like 3.000 during near four centuries . 
  hardly a genocide at all . 
  there were a lot of propaganda about it : `` la leyenda negra '' , but the inquisitors had to document their trials , so there is enough information about that . 
  jeans and a t-shirt, 
  the same than in spain , the sefard\u00edes can claim spanish citizenship, 
  in 1492 the catholic queen and king expulsed the jewish people from spain , and made the moors convert to cristianism . 
  in 1609 felipe iii , expulsed the `` moriscos '' muslim people who did n't convert .

  i am from the us . 
  i grew up a bears fan . 
  very few people that grew up here actually understand the game . 
  it 's basically just random leftist idealistic posts with random contrarian stuff thrown in there just to be contrarian and filled with plenty of righteous indignation . 
  i mean , when i saw that the cup literally got their members together in an auditorium to vote on mas presidency and then basically said they might not care anyway . 
  the situation over there is such a complete mess , it seems new elections are really needed . 
  i 'm not saying it 's okay . 
  i 'm saying it certainly different than a bomber actively flying combat sorties wandering into uncontested airspace . 
  personally , i do think it would make a huge difference if there were a dispute over that stretch of land . 
  but there 's not so it 's stupid to compare the two situations . 
  i think turkey is petty and stupid in the agean and i also think they were right to shoot down the russian plane . 
  they are n't exclusive opinions and trying to bring stupid false equivalencies between the generations old disputes that everyone knows are just posturing and the shit going on on the syrian border is what i take issue with . 
  nobody really wants to do anything since we have a general election in 18 days . 
  me too ... and now with all the turrones and cocidos , i wo n't be doing better for awhile . 
  this step was expected and the big question is ... what now ? 
  the political scene in catalonia is more of a mess than ever . 
  i 'm also convinced that the cup is what would happen if / r/politics were an actual political party . 
  i 'm not saying i agree , i am saying i think everyone is trying to draw equivalencies for the russian plane when turkey flying over territory that it considers turkish is pretty different and is generally the norm of how territorial disputes work . 
  hell , it 's the same reason why the us navy has an aircraft carrier parked in the s. china sea right now . 
  does turkey recognize those islands as greek or turkish ? 
  a fairly important fact in all of this . 
  yeah , lots of people that barely have a visible belly are `` overweight '' . 
  especially in the more n. european countries where it 's normal to just have a wider build . 
  `` i know spain just as well as people in spain . 
  how well do you know your country ? '', 
  take that spain !, 
  they even had a podium for him , and most of the times they mentioned pp or rajoy , they made sure to show the empty spot . 
  it was glaringly obvious . 
  the article mentioned that he was on a tv broadcast at the same time , but it failed to mention that he made a comment along the lines of not having time for all of that . 
  those two fact combined seem to be really galling . 
  honestly , he could have just done nothing and said he was busy with the commitments in paris that day ( which was true , but he made it back in time for the tv broadcast anyway ) . 
  as a us citizen , the fact that polish citizens do n't have vwp is infuriating . 
  honestly , schengen is a common border and nobody in the us cares all that much and if they were to just threaten to not give visa-free access to schengen until all schengen states were allowed in visa-free , it would happen instantly . 
  mostly because most people that take biggest advantage of visa-free to europe tend to be much wealthier americans . 
   but it does not mean the person is employed it does n't mean they are in the labor market either . 
  the students not being counted thing is pretty standard around the globe . 
  but this is / r/europe and a thread about eu nations being sued by foreign companies . 
  afaik companies are not citizens in europe and they should n't be . 
  coporate personhood is an important concept that people seem to refuse to look past the name of . 
  the reason a company can sue is the same reason it can be sued . 
  it has nothing to do with conferring fundamental rights of an individual . 
   actually , it 's not our job to prevent people going out . 
  schengen has exit controls , so yeah ... it kind of is . 
  bilingualism is increasing massively in spain . 
  in friendly settings : woman with anyone is two kisses on the cheek . 
  man to another man is generally a handshake . 
  with family sometimes the two kisses is normal between men , too . 
  in business settings : here 's where things get complicated . 
  with men it 's always the handshake and say you are meeting an new client and it 's a woman then it will always be a handshake . 
  the tricky part is afterward if there should be the two kisses or not . 
  it can be useful to signal that you are friendly and not adversarial but it can also be too friendly for the environment . 
  generally with your own coworkers it will have kisses and with other generally not , but that one is a minefield . 
   these people most likely already have english competency this is spain you 're talking about . 
  i would n't take that as a given . 
  and yes , even for people going into stem fields , not speaking english is surprisingly common . 
  but that said , it 's not an either or argument and it 's perfectly possible to better both english education and allow more education in the regional languages . 
  why would the biggest country in nato with the most military capacity by far be involved in a nato military issue ? 
  what is `` industry '' in this case ? 
  does it include state oil companies ? 
  because that seems like a pretty biased skew in that case . 
  especially considering just how much capex is coming out of koc/aramco/gcc countries in general . 
  at the moment yes . 
  but they are trying to get the best return on their money and currently renewables just are n't economical in many situations . 
  plenty of companies have heavy investments in wind , for example which generally is profitable . 
  see iberdrola for a local company here for a big example of that . 
  well , i was more referring to the entire power structure of the ecb . 
  thank god there 's an italian in charge though . 
  i do say that the crippling fear of inflation from germany/netherlands at the expense of so many other countries is probably the single biggest issue with the eurozone . 
  the crazy thing is it would help them the most . 
   climate change is way more important than ttip , and undoubtedly the fossil fuels industry is a major player in poisoning the public debate about it with misinformation in line with their business interests , i deal with the industry a lot and i do n't even agree with this . 
  oil companies these days just see oil as part of their current portfolio but very few companies even see themselves as `` oil '' companies but rather as `` energy '' companies and want to be fully involved in whatever the future brings . 
  the biggest issue people seem to have is companies absolutely will fight against being hobbled in europe while sinopec , rosneft , aramco , nioc , etc. . . can just go do whatever the hell they want while funding their respective state directly . 
  i have said it so many times but it 's so clear that for all the arguments about fiscal policy , the real fix has been monetary policy and the ecb is just completely unwilling to do what is necessary because it 's still a massive amount of liquidity that needs to be injected . 
  at least they 've started , but the scale is nowhere near what is needed . 
  fun , completely irrelevant fact . 
  ( this is from memory so forgive me if i 'm wrong ) there are currently two elected monarchs in the world . 
  one is the pope and the other is the president of france who also serves as a co-prince of andorra . 
  the latter also has the distinction of not being elected by the people he `` rules '' . 
  turkey taking away visa-free status for russians would annoy the hell out of them . 
  but it would be stupid because they 'd lose way more money than it 's worth . 
  is n't that a reference to the iraq war and the `` you forgot poland '' line ? 
  though i suppose that was 11 years ago so pretty ancient history by today 's standards . 
  i think he will because it gives him the power to take down a government whenever he wants and also at least gets rid of rajoy . 
  i am fully expecting elections around a year from now as well . 
  this is going to be terribly unstable no matter what happens . 
  if c 's goes with pp , they 'll have to break the coalition relatively early to make a point that they are n't just pp light because rivera has mentioned how much he sees clegg as a cautionary tale . 
  c 's will absolutely not have a pact with pp . 
  if there is no other option , they may allow a pp government without a full pact only to call new elections relatively soon . 
  rivera has said specifically that he sees nick clegg and the lib dems in the uk as a cautionary tale . 
  he wants nothing more than to be less associated from the pp to have their party have long-term survival prospects . 
  honestly , psoe is a lot more liberal that people seem to give them credit for , too so it could work well . 
  i say this as someone who is pretty much c 's primary voting demographic , but do n't underestimate how much a lot of the less socially conservative liberals really hate rajoy and his incompetence as well . 
  and also , that would make the leaders really , ridiculously good looking . 
  i 'm very much not a podemos voter but the vast majority of people in spain have no idea about any of that . 
  greece stopped making the news awhile ago . 
  i bet awhile ago that it 'd be psoe/c 's coalition enabled by an abstention by podemos ( and maybe a few more ) . 
  i 'll stick with that . 
  so that explains my constipation . 
  no because the reason student loans are at a reasonable rate is that there are guarantees about not being able to discharge through bankruptcy . 
  this does n't apply to foreigners .

  and , anyway , read what eu 's chief brexit negotiator has said : that independent scotland would gain automatic entry to the eu !, 
  :-) http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/politics/eus-chief-brexit-negotiator-agrees-8796253, 
  if it was in any way efficient it would be already in use . 
  still much more expensive . 
  all fruits and vegetables from almeria , murcia , andalusia , valencia , going to a boat in the cantabric see ? 
  nonsense . 
  are you really telling me cdc has been ( demonstrated ) to be worse then pp or psoe ( b\u00e1rcenas , eros , rita barber\u00e1 , gurtel , naseiro ... ) just take a look at this , please : https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/anexo:casos_judiciales_relacionados_con_corrupci%c3%b3n_pol%c3%adtica_en_espa%c3%b1a, 
  many proindependence are not nationalists at all . 
  was n't the discussion about being expelled from the eu ? 
  just no . 
  carles puigdemont has never ever said anything like that . 
  either you are lying , you do n't remember what you heard or you did n't understand him . 
  by they way , are you talking about that time , as mayor of girona , when he was quoting carles rahola about the fascists troops entering the town during last war ? 
  a ) even if spain , against margallo 's opinion , was not dissolved , the treaties should already have to be amended . 
  no extra work . 
  b ) if margallo is right , spain and catalonia would be in the exact same position . 
  a ) are you comparing the level of corruption of pp and cdc ? 
  :-d b ) pp is 100 % of spanish government . 
  cdc is maybe 50 % of catalan government . 
  how many seats did pp and psoe , and cdc , get on last spanish elections ? 
  and in catalan ones ? 
  there are anti independence good texts . 
  but clearly the ones you are reading are nothing but propaganda . 
  and i 'm asking you to read good pro independence text , of course , not propaganda ones . 
  clear , now ? 
  sorry , i was talking about the last war in the peninsula . 
  last time there were 3 years of war , i think . 
  i wonder if some of the anti independence spaniards will realize one day it was the people , the masses , who have been leading the movement and the politics who have been adapting to it . 
  by the way , on last elections , what was the support in spain to the most corrupt parties ? 
  what about in catalonia ? 
  if there 's someone manipulated , it 's not us catalans ... 
  have you read any text by pro independence movement ? 
  i do n't think so . 
  it seems you have only read anti independence propaganda . 
  well , i think more than 50 % of spanish ( not including catalonia 's ) exports to europe go thru catalonia . 
  if catalonia is not in the eu that might be a problem . 
  if spain vetoes catalonia , catalonia might also choose not to asume any of kingdom of spain 's debt . 
  that would be fun , too . 
   they will need to be recognized as an independent nation do you realize that if we were not recognized we could not be expelled ? 
  i guess they 'd have to amend all the same treaties to change how much new spain needs to pay to the eu , how manyh meps it gets , it 's contribution to the ecb ... and , by the way , according to what spanish foreign affairs said on saturday , if catalonia leaves spain , spain is dissolved , so , it cesses to exist and by the same logic would be too out of the eu ... 
  you do . 
   keep in mind there was a time we shared king and we even fought in aragon 's side in your succession war . 
  yeah , and in the worst moment you betrayed and abandoned us , like the english did ... 
   our own president called catalans against independence `` collonists '' and `` collaborators '' why do you lie ? 
  ask your girlfriend how many tourist were there . 
  what proportion were just looking the show . 
  where i was , i guess none . 
   hundreds of millions ( hundreds of thousands ), 
   hundreds of millions ( hundreds of thousands ), 
  as i guess you understand spanish , this is from the website of the demonstration :  el 11 de septiembre de 2016 marcar\u00e1 el inicio de una nueva etapa . 
  ** https://apunt.assemblea.cat/cast/ for those who dont understand spanish , here 's the translation of bolded ( by me ) text : `` ready to become a new state '' , `` we are sovereign , we are the catalan republic in the last stage of construction '' , `` an ultimate step to reach our country 's independence '' , `` saying again the catalan republic begins '' , `` we want the institutions to be ready to start the construction of a new country '' , `` we are already catalan republic '' . 
  so , if not a rally asking for catalan independence , what the fuck was this ? 
   if you want specifics , i recommend you read 2-3 hours of european news daily for 5 years , then you 'll have a good grasp . 
  this . 
  tsk tsk . 
  they are pumpkin colour . 
  what 's the big difference between coloured and people of colour ? 
  you do n't know the definition of desert , innit ? 
  europe announces ??? 
  well , i 'd say `` europe annouced more than three months ago '' . 
  do n't lie to us . 
  this has to be the us . 
  please , make it be the us !, 
  i know . 
  that 's why i made a reductio ad absurdum when answering [ this nonsense ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4zmju8/a_majority_of_the_french_64_support_the_burkini/d6x9hns ) . 
  the one i was responding stated the burkini was forbidden on beaches because `` it shows your affiliation to a specific religion , which is not compatible with secularism ( in public place ) . '', 
  which is clearly false . 
   because it shows your affiliation to a specific religion , which is not compatible with secularism ( in public place ) . 
  are you telling me it is forbidden in france to wear an islamic veil in public places ? 
  to wear a kippah ? 
  a catholic monk veil ? 
  a sikh turban ? 
  never heard of it . 
  any source ??? 
  yeah , but if they include the gdp produced by the benefit of being the capital ( having the ministries and the thousands of government workers ) , removing the city but having the ministries and those workers in some other place would mantain that part of the gdp . 
  and in some cities , as it is the case of madrid , that proportion of the city 's gdp is really high . 
  have they accounted for what part of the gdp of the capital is there just because that city is the capital ? 
  i mean , a city like madrid has a great gdp , but it 's mostly due to it being the capital . 
  do you know her ? 
  you know she is forced by her husband ( is she married ) to wear that shirt ? 
  is it ok then the police force her not to wear it ? 
  as if , as it 's the law , it 's fair . 
  ** four fully dressed men force a woman to remove her shirt ** would be an alternate header . 
  any ? 
  here on reddit i 've seen many people taking it for granted , but never anyone showing any evidence . 
  just random accusations . 
  that 's all the evidence ? 
    -  gulen makes a coup attempt with those men in power . 
  fails . 
  any evidence ? 
  is this true , or are you just joking ? 
  argh !, 
  irish also use this nonsense month day notation ? 
  hey , in catalonia saint stephen 's day ( sant esteve ) is a public holiday . 
  however it 's on 26 december . 
  that 's what colonization does . 
  if there was a part of algeria still inhabited by french colonizers , similar difference would be . 
  please , show me the decree or law where it is declared so . 
  i 've read it so many times , but non has given any proof . 
  there are n't .

  it has an excellent setting and , whilst busy in the summer season , it does not have the large hotels and mass tourism of other costa brava resorts such as lloret de mar. 
  it is considered one of the few places in costa brava that sill conserves the charm of the villages prior to the arrival of mass tourism : narrow streets , curved tiles white houses , traditional two-story fisherman homes , etc. 
  it 's also known for its annual world famous '' ** cantada d'havaneres de calella de palafrugell ** '' ( * habaneras signing * ) on the beach ( as seen [ here ] ( http://www.havanerescalella.cat/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/cropped-a.torres-2.jpg ) ) , that takes place every july . 
  on this [ video ] ( https://youtu.be/d6ck-yprj_i?t=1m30s ) you can can watch a piece of last 2016 edition . 
  there 's a [ website ] ( http://www.havanerescalella.cat/en/ ) in english with more information . 
  even more curious that in catalan it 's actually `` saragossa '' and `` andalusia '' . 
  sounds completely right for me xd, 
  i know where 's he from ... 
  but i was jus joking anyway . 
  i love him !, 
  yeah , obviously !, 
  but my friends usually do siesta and they do n't work `` in the field or the construction '', 
  like you do with catalans ' money ? 
  i 've never done a `` siesta '' in my life . 
  5 \u00b0 c is already cold as fuck for me ... 
  i went there as a kid and sang the song on the bridge . 
  true story . 
   they could be preserved in other places instead of boxes . 
  not really i believe ... idyllic african natural reserves as seen in the movies are extremely expensive and rare . 
  if you want to preserve species , you need zoos to get the needed revenue . 
  as years go by , more and more species are getting extinct in the wild ( rhinos are already extinct or a couple years from being ? 
  ) , like [ african elephants ] ( http://www.futuretimeline.net/21stcentury/2024.htm#elephants ) or [ gorillas ] ( http://www.futuretimeline.net/21stcentury/2023.htm#gorillas-extinct ) . 
  from now on the only place in the world with rhinos will be safaris , zoos and natural reserves . 
  therefore we need zoos to preserve the hundreds and hundreds of endangered species , specially considering most of them will disappear in the wild in the near future and there 's just not enough money and space for other options . 
  but anyway , i know i 'm not an expert on this at all . 
  it 's just that i do n't like this general '' * moral * '' bias against zoos ( not talking about you ) without stopping to think rationally about species preservation . 
  i also personally like zoos , i do n't see anything wrong with them at all ( of course there are exceptions , ehem china zoos i 'm looking at [ you ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uwqic5u3-0u ) ) . 
  ps : they are planning the move the barcelona zoo away from the current location ( somewhat in the city centre ) , to have more space for the animals . 
  this has been discussed for many years , but for now nothing official yet . 
   catalonia and its people agreed to the constitution , this is the most pathetic argument i have ever seen . 
  seriously . 
  people that voted that constitution came from a fucking dictatorship dude . 
  anything would be better than a dictatorship . 
  it was either `` that '' constitution or nothing . 
  catalans were one of the people that suffered the most the dictatorship and the persecution against their language and culture . 
  they would have voted anything `` slightly better '' than from what they had lived . 
  nobody would have voted this constitution today ... 
  anyway think whatever you want . 
  31 \u00b0 c right now in barcelona !, 
  we do n't even reach that temperatures at night , being lowest at 26 \u00b0 c in barcelona this last night . 
  i think you live in a fake reality ... `` not a single poll gives 51 % for independence '' xddd you are so ignorant dude . 
   it defines that spain is one nation indivisible . 
  it does n't affect international law dispositions . 
  it 's a little more complex . 
   we could draft a new one ofc . 
  we will be out by then . 
  but yes i hope you reform your constitution someday . 
  wtf o_o, 
  there 's no problem with the constitution related with the referendum . 
  it is perfectly legal . 
  the problem is the spanish government that does n't want to allow it ( fear to democracy ? ) . 
  if another spanish political party had won the elections we would already had the independence referendum . 
  what reality ? 
  that 10 \u00b0 c difference between madrid and barcelona !, 
  exactly !, 
  this was crazy and i did n't expect that t.t. . . in the malls i was freezing , but outside i was burning up . 
  so i remember i stood in the middle of the entrance for some time , in the middle of the heat and the cold , trying to find the equilibrium . 
  same with the airport ( hamad ) . 
  they are crazy with the air conditioner . 
  it 's just not normal . 
  i was freezing and complained tot he staff ( they told me that 's a `` common problem of the airport '' ) . 
  and i had to wait for lots of hours for my flight , while freezing ... right after having spent the whole day experiencing the worst heat of my life . 
  anyone reading , bring a jacket and some `` cold '' clothes when going to one of the hottest countries in the world ( qatar ) because they ca n't go normal with the ac . 
  the irony !, 
   so do you support scottish independence too ? 
  of course !, 
  why i should n't support it ? 
   during your 2014 independence referendum there was an important coverage here in catalonia , and in our public tv channel . 
  you and the quebecois are an example for the catalans , since you already had an independence referendum and we have n't had the opportunity yet ( spain does n't allow it ) . 
  i believe in the right of self-determination for all current nations without a state . 
  if there 's a majority of people there wanting to leave and create a new country , they should n't be silenced . 
  democracy should always win in the 21st century !, 
  good guy diverting to visit barcelona , knowing in the near future it will become the capital of the next eu country catalonia . 
  now my question : in which city did you spent the most time and in which one the less , and why ? 
  because it 's june . 
  wait do you shave your cats for the heat ? 
  o.o i have 2 cats but they do n't seem to complain with the heat , and one of them is pretty hairy . 
  are your cats specially hairy ? 
  yep sure it is !, 
  people from outside coming to barcelona might not be used to this humidity . 
  mmmm well i was talking about intense heat . 
  the problem of china is pollution . 
  you just do n't see the sky and the nearby buildings ... having the feeling you do n't have oxygen . 
  at the middle of tiananmen square at midday horrible experience xd i remember being [ here ] ( https://www.google.com/maps/@39.990509,116.3864594,3a,75y,175.84h,102.84t/data=!3m8!1e1!3m6!1s-kbfjk40cy8u%2fvnuctnbelhi%2faaaaaaaaac8%2f6vsjqwrox-meqd7dxspe_iaqfwq28y83wclib!2e4!3e11!6s%2f%2flh3.googleusercontent.com%2f-kbfjk40cy8u%2fvnuctnbelhi%2faaaaaaaaac8%2f6vsjqwrox-meqd7dxspe_iaqfwq28y83wclib%2fw203-h100-k-no-pi-0-ya68.99219-ro-0-fo100%2f!7i10240!8i5120 ) one day and having the feeling i was in another planet ( literally ) . 
  there just was n't `` air '' . 
  no wind at all neither . 
  weird experience . 
  it was `` impossible '' this was earth as we know it . 
  i also timed ( in shanghai ) that in about 17 seconds outside you start sweating xd ps : i love china !, 
  hahaha cubans everywhere in miami !, 
  i miss miami :( for me worst weather experience in doha and beijing ( both in august ) . 
  no words . 
   that 's from your biased opinion . 
  sure ... 
  i am catalan and i know what i have lived . 
  [ anti-catalanism ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/anti-catalanism ) is a thing in spain . 
  and just watching television ( or telemadrid stuff ) one can see some hate towards catalans . 
  i 've never been to madrid , but i know people that have been attacked and insulted for just speaking in catalan on streets or subway . 
  i 'm sure its a minority , but it 's sad it exists and the fact they focus the hate against catalan people . 
  `` catalufo '' , `` polaco '' , etc. . .  otherwise they would n't want catalonia to stay with us , would n't they ?

   spain and italy are stagnant and have sickeningly high youth unemployment while unemployment is still a problem , we are very much so not stagnant . 
  we 're going to be pushing 3 % growth this year , ( assuming the greece thing does n't hurt us ) . 
  i actually think a greek default would be the greatest thing ever for spain since we are having an export let recovery so more devaluation would be great . 
  would they get kicked out of schengen , too at that point ? 
  they 're already basically a schengen island , so it would be easy to do . 
  low currency would certainly help tourism . 
  if i could get a decent vacation in greece for 50 $ a day or less , i 'd be there in a second . 
  ( my travel style is usually significantly more than that ), 
  well i do n't know what 's up with fiji , but the highest numbers seem to be from countries where , in general , a truly defensive war on home territory is n't a crazy idea . 
  they include russia as a cheap weekend but i suppose that assumes you already have a visa which is annoyingly not as cheap . 
  i doubt they would be able to beat mediaset in italy and spain at least . 
  well ... you are allowed to apply after two years of legal residency . 
  if you want to come illegal , it can take many years to get that first legal residency through arraigo . 
  that said , there is still a path that just does n't exist in the us . 
  and the application itself takes a long time ( going through the process myself ), 
  granted i 'm a non-native speaker , but i ca n't tell the difference between a canario accent and venezolano . 
  you guys just have more verga and arepa or something . 
  well ... `` latino '' is n't a block . 
  mexicans and other central americans tend to go to the us because you can get there over land . 
  by the time you get down to s. america , well you have to take a plane no matter where you go , so why would n't you go to the richest spanish speaking country to at least not have a language barrier ? 
  though it is true you can survive in the us without english , it 's just not the same . 
  we like you guys , though . 
  according to an argentine coworker , they even use gallego to mean from spain . 
  spain hates itself more than anyone . 
  probably amancio ortega 's personal bankers . 
  no ... they ca n't ( well at least not win ) . 
  they can sue if they decide to lower the co2 emissions from * foreign * cars though . 
  that 's a big , important difference . 
  you know , for all the isds fear mongering , people are really willing to cite situations where companies have sued or are suing , but nobody cites things where companies win ridiculous settlements . 
  i have no problem with people getting an honest chance to voice arguments however ridiculous they seem . 
  what matters is what 's actually decided . 
  i mean , there is one right now for solar subsidies in spain , but the government absolutely should lose that one because they signed a power purchase contract and changed the terms when they wanted to keep the cash . 
   however , i fail to see how you 're affecting the grid if you 're not generating nor dumping power , just installing a battery to ease your peak hours with the power you 've purchased at `` valley '' hours . 
  this , in fact , eases the work of the utilities as they would avoid spinning up so much the combined cycle power plants at peak hours . 
  am i missing something here ? 
  i agree . 
  i already said they 're probably fucking it up ( and i honestly do n't have the time to read the actual proposal that wo n't affect me in a block in madrid in the slightest ) . 
  i just hate the `` they 're charging us to use sunlight '' argument as it 's a more complicated issue than that . 
  but the issue is the connection cost does n't depend on how much power you get . 
  the connection cost is fixed . 
  i would say the best way is to just charge a fixed monthly connection cost depending on what you have connected ( which already exists ) but here 's the issue with generation that a lot of people all for renewables always gloss over . 
  being able to plan what is provided to the grid is hugely important and if you have a lot of houses that may just start dumping onto the grid depending on their own use , it 's an issue . 
  like i said , i 'm sure they 're fucking up the implementation of this , but the ability for the operator to plan operations and deliver to everyone . 
  it 's not an issue for a few houses , but it can be with a bunch of people . 
  there are ways around it and i 'm not against selling back , but it should n't be at the same price you buy for either . 
  i still do n't know how to feel about mass surveillance , but the point is once you have a concrete lead to follow , the mass data gathering lets you follow whatever threads it may tie to . 
  99.9 % of everything that 's collected just sits in an archive and is never heard from again ( still makes me pretty uncomfortable , though ) but the idea is you do n't know what 's useful until after the fact . 
  i do n't like it , but i understand why it exists and it 's not the `` the government hates you and wants to know everything about every citizen '' conspiracy stuff . 
  i really do think fighting well organized but disparate and decentralized groups that are n't governments does provide a new challenge that legal systems and intelligence services just were n't ready for . 
  there have been errors and there will be more but it 's really complicated . 
  here 's the big problem . 
  people connected to the grid * should * have to pay something to maintain it . 
  i do n't know exactly how this is implemented , and i do n't doubt it 's a mess ( this is a pretty terrible article , though ) . 
  that said , if you are connected to the grid , they are providing you a service even if you are selling . 
  the idea that you should be able to sell to the grid at the same price you buy is ludicrous and if you do net metering , it 's essentially what happens . 
  i 'm all for giving solar incentives , but giving people a service for free is n't sustainable either . 
  eh , i think it would have worked out for us as most of it is already built . 
  also , they would still have to pay all the debts eventually ... in euros , so you ca n't just inflate them away . 
  then their constituents should n't have voted for a pro-eu party . 
  it was no secret and it 's not like there was n't an anti-eu party around . 
  they are entitled to their opinion . 
  they are n't entitled to actively campaign against their party 's position and expect to keep their jobs within that party . 
  pretty big difference . 
  we like the romanians . 
  they are generally great workers and assimilate quite well into spanish society . 
  isis is filled with crazy terrorists , but they are n't interested in europe at the moment . 
  i get we need to do something about them , but their goals are basically for contiguous territory . 
  charlie hebdo was al qaeda ( also an enemy of isis ) types and yemen continues to be the biggest threat to europeans in europe . 
  all of that said , this is an easy way for those people to slip in undetected as well . 
   every country that has to pay the imf has the right , instead of making consecutive payments within the same month , to ask from the imf to make all the payments of a month on the same day . 
  just so long as they are principal payments , which they are in this case . 
  just want to be more clear . 
  got to have a decided court case . 
  which we are still a long way away from . 
  so does this trigger a technical default or not ? 
  edit : from the article they tapped an old imf precedent so does n't count as a default . 
  i will certainly pay for it . 
  i mean , the ability to watch without waiting for a download , knowing it will be high quality and with both language tracks and subs for such a low price is great . 
  let 's see how sgae fucks it up . 
  gentrification is n't inherently bad . 
  so the solution is to obviously make it illegal to charge more to live in the desirable parts of the city . 
  i do n't know how germany handles rent control ( it 's actually something i think spain has a very reasonable system with ) but this just sounds like it punishes people that would like to live in significantly nicer flats . 
   `` we do n't want a situation like in london or paris , '' said wild . 
  `` the reality in paris or london is that people with low income have to live in the further-out districts of the city . '' well ... yeah , if you want a city with more economic activity , there 's going to be more demand toward the center . 
  the problem with london , at least is not a lack of price controls , it 's a lack of being able to build more supply . 
  i guess this goes back to the eternal debate of gentrification and how much people hate it . 
  the low rates of home ownership in germany seem to compound the problem a lot . 
  i also just do n't understand the premise . 
  my place costs significantly more than the average for where i live but i get a parking space in central madrid , pool access in the summer , a fitness room and an overall fairly nice apartment . 
  it seems to be making it illegal to price in quality . 
  i like how they translated `` hosteler\u00eda '' to hostelry . 
  it just sounds strange rather than hospitality sector which is what i see in pretty much every business newspaper in english . 
  it 's going to be a long recovery and hopefully it picks up more steam , but i can attest that from the multinational side of things ... it 's very , very real . 
  i 've also seem to have seen a lot more people changing jobs recently which seems to be a good indication of health as well . 
  i grant all i see is personal observation and anecdote . 
  it would be england as it goes by federation . 
  though an england/scotland bid certainly makes sense . 
  strikes in europe generally are n't like in the us . 
  it 's basically less service rather than a complete shutdown . 
  that said ... a major reduction in transport in particular is very noticeable .

  we are one !, 
  yep , if they knew more about castilla/galicia/asturias etc. 
  a bit more we could wring out 10-15 m tourists more per year lol . 
  barcelona has a huge role , but not the only one as you pointed out . 
  sadly those `` guiris '' know little about northern spain aka `` green spain '' . 
  or the interior cities , full of medieval and roman monuments . 
  lol i 'm still trying to figure out because of you !, 
  one close friend from lulea ( sweden ) has visited spain several times , he loves  40\u00ba temperatures ... it 's crazy how he can resist lol in baleares and costa del sol i think you can find many scandinavians in the summer . 
  i agree but i do n't think there are a lot of people that believe portugal is a province of spain . 
  i wish portugal was part of an iberian union formed by the different iberians with their different but extremely related languages ( ahem , except basque , but that 's part of the charm lol ) . 
  but i actually do n't think there are many people thinking portugal is just part of spain . 
  hell even some people outside of our borders actually think catalonia is super different from spain and is a completely different - and/or especially unrelated - nation , or that there 's no catalans that feel just as spaniards aswell . 
  which is crazy wrong too , of course . 
  come on , cut it off , we all know all we have to talk about spain is how little democratic it is and how rough can be against their opressed autonomous communities !, 
  i do n't , 
  and mallorca , costa del sol , canarias , ibiza , sevilla , madrid ... etc, 
  this is good news about spain ... 
  i 'd be surprised if this gets upvoted . 
  you still do n't understand . 
  i 'm not butthurt because of your crap of an union that 's not actually an union and more like your `` countries-that-i-like-based-on-bullshit '' list ... but rather surprised of how someone can actually eat that shit up all by himself . 
  it 's in your imagination , yes . 
  we agree on that . 
  since as you stated you do n't even care about actual statistics anyway . 
  it 's like beating a dead horse . 
  good luck with your union , we will be trying to improve europe the rest of us , including france ( not the one in your imaginary union , sorry ) . 
  france is not a leading power in the world nor has been at the level of say , britain or spain back in its day . 
  france is just a regional/european power . 
  your arrogance on the other hand ... well , let 's just say that is what is topping the world 's ranks . 
  the corruption index for spain it 's not too far from france , actually . 
  denmark is galaxies far from you . 
  and for the immature `` argument '' ... let me just sit back and laugh at that . 
  i do n't think most europeans would be comfortable with your petulance and therefore want an union with someone like you . 
  gladly most french people are n't like that and you 're just a caricature of your own stereotypes , but come on , do n't be so ridiculous . 
  it 's awkward . 
  france was a financial burden when spain as a non-founding member was economically booming in pre-crisis times . 
  i 'm speaking about the deficit and the limits that the eu agreed . 
  i 'd say france is still not in budget , actually . 
  so do n't say something you can not even satisfy yourself , because france would be a burden following your vague words . 
  [ bonus ] ( http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-05-06/spanish-boom-meets-french-stagnation-as-reformers-lead-recovery ) just for you . 
  yeah , and screw the others . 
  bravo . 
  come on , you were even linking la gaceta , besides random google seraches ... that 's like linking from american renaissance or something . 
  fox news is such left-wing leaning compared to that . 
  this shit does n't help your credibility . 
  quite the contrary . 
   a somewhat unique cultural place in the world but ... they are andalusians speaking broken english . 
   and the rock is somewhat special in its appearance and the view it provides / its location . 
  then add the whole bah\u00eda de algeciras to that ... not just gibraltar . 
  where can i find a basque that thinks the fueros are injust for the rest of the country ? 
  because i can swear it 's injust for everyone else that 's not in the basque country . 
  more and more retard, 
   ... oh really ? 
  so i provide sources and i 'm called a troll you are providing google searches . 
  it 's not even classy , just bullshitty , like ( almost ) everything else . 
  why would it be ? 
  gibraltar is known for being '' a rock '' . 
  aaaaand here are again the catalan independentists trolling like they always do . 
  like if someone else outside of their bubble is going to eat their shit out . 
  but why ? 
  spain is supposed to grow a 2,5 % this year , according to the government . 
   he is the eternal prince but ... but ... that 's gaben, 
  i 'm not against the ave at all . 
  it 's not just that it 's on the level of a developing country , it 's simply probably a reference for the world and the proof of that is that spanish companies are building this century high speed networks in extense countries like brazil or saudi arabia , beating the french high speed railway companies . 
  the thing is that spain has built its network very fast , and it was very costly , and it 's something that we still have to pay for it . 
  it will be cheaper and worth i 'm sure , but time is a very important factor in the concept of investment . 
  spain 's quality of service is the highest and i could agree with that , but the ave is still a bit expensive . 
  honestly we could get rid of the shittiest ones , at least . 
  why would the telegraph care about spain 's pm though ? 
  it 's all marketing . 
  lmfao they 're going full retarded now, 
  yes , i hate it . 
  outdated . 
  with little to no support among the majority here in spain . 
  should get rid of it already ... but at the same time it also disgusts me the hypocresy of foreigners talking about barbaric traditions from others when not even checking their own shit . 
  if we had that levels of real unemployment , things would be pretty bad ( in the sense of revolution and blood in the streets ) . 
  but things are just peaceful . 
  i just think at least half that percentage is working with the shittiest conditions without a contract . 
  it 's pretty clear . 
  we also celebrate that we are not ruled by a fascist dictator anymore ... but we did n't get rid of him . 
  he died of old age . 
  in a bed . 
  in his palace . 
  forcing someone to do something after a war is not what i call a deal . 
  germany knows about that amirite . 
  what you show is either ignorance about history and what the spanish sucession war supposed in europe in the 1701 or simply want to practice the official sport in this subreddit which is bashing everything that 's not north-western european . 
  i do n't need to be careful at all , and saying that i should be careful at something for saying what i think is an offense to me as i take it as a threat . 
  gibraltar is a colony . 
  that 's what the un says , that 's why it 's still in the plan for de-colonization . 
  check it up if you ever need to be informed about something . 
  scotland is part of an union and conforming an independent part within the united kingdom . 
  that 's how you say scotland ! = england either . 
  gibraltar and hong kong are/were colonies ... catalonia simply does n't fit in that list , just like extremadura or cuenca . 
  surely the opressed colony of catalonia need their right to self-determination ... oops . 
  spain bad alone is the motto in this subreddit . 
  it 's not gibraltar drama though , more like independentist-politician-that-doesn ` t-give-a-crap-about-gibraltar-whinning-about-madrid drama . 
  spain is the most decentralized country in the union ... and it 's a country where half their population hated the other half for centuries . 
  you ca n't find nationalism in one half at least . 
  also it 's one of the few countries with no extreme right-wing in a parliament ... 
  i do n't think you can say the same . 
  this always comes up in reddit .

  even if in the future the uk rejoins , they wo n't have all the special deals ( rebate , keeping their own currency , keeping border controls , etc ) they had before . 
  i certainly do n't remember any demonstrations in the uk against a general election result . 
  the result in the us was legitimate , and in line with their normal democratic process . 
   today whoopi goldberg said that the us does elections `` better than anywhere else in the world '' . 
  i think it was a very ignorant comment i dunno . 
  maybe she has studied the electoral system in every other country in the world . 
  different countries in europe differ greatly , but in general europeans have a different attitude to `` freedom of speech '' than in the us . 
  for example , holocaust denial is illegal in france , spain and germany , but it 's legal in the uk . 
  i do n't know about other countries . 
  there was a huge public debate about the [ holocaust denial law ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gayssot_act ) before it was introduced in france , and the public were overwhelmingly in support of it . 
  it was n't enforced unilaterally by government edict ( which is how americans seem to see it , if my reddit experience is anything to go by ) . 
  it was supported by the public , and it could be repealed at any time if a political party could get enough support to do so ( the front national want to repeal it because they keep falling foul of it ) . 
  in the uk , there are laws against harassment , incitement to racial hatred , and a law against sending malicious communications ( expressly designed to cause distress or anxiety ) . 
  this last law has been on the books since long before the web ; it 's just as illegal to do this over twitter as in a letter . 
  freedom of speech is guaranteed in secton 1 of article 10 of the european convention on human rights :  everyone has the right to freedom of expression . 
  this right shall include freedom to hold opinions and to receive and impart information and ideas without interference by public authority and regardless of frontiers . 
  this article shall not prevent states from requiring the licensing of broadcasting , television or cinema enterprises . 
  but what the left hand gives , the right hand takes away in section 2 :  the exercise of these freedoms , since it carries with it duties and responsibilities , may be subject to such formalities , conditions , restrictions or penalties as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society , in the interests of national security , territorial integrity or public safety , for the prevention of disorder or crime , for the protection of health or morals , for the protection of the reputation or rights of others , for preventing the disclosure of information received in confidence , or for maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary . 
  the truth is that the us also has limits on free speech . 
  if you doubt me , try threatening the president 's life , shouting `` fire '' in a crowded theatre , or just ask chelsea manning how things are working out . 
  or i guess , check out the [ wikipedia article ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_states_free_speech_exceptions ) . 
  we just differ in where the lines are drawn . 
  i really think the biggest difference is that over here we tend to be more pragmatic and less dogmatic than in the us . 
   if so , how does that affect your posts on reddit ? 
  absolutely not at all . 
  it never even crosses my mind . 
  the simpsons , i think . 
  yeah , but brits are pretty good at queuing , even drunk ones . 
  in a pub in britain everyone at the bar knows who is next , and it 's generally respected , at least in ` local ' pubs . 
  here it 's just whoever the barman fancies serving next . 
  so usually women . 
  so much so that for a long time i thought the expression was `` tiran m\u00e1s dos tetas que dos carteras '' . 
  for movies , yes , but estrenar is also used for real objects like shoes , a newly refurbished apartment ( `` apartamentos para estrenar '' ) , etc. 
  yeah , true . 
  if the standard is `` no single word exists in english '' you could post practically every german compound word !, 
   we have double surnames . 
  and so as a foreigner in spain some of my letters come addressed to [ my first name ] [ my middle name ( which is not my family name ) ] . 
  the bank managed to do this with my first bank account . 
  i stupidly corrected them before realising how useful it might be to have a bank account in a name that 's not actually mine . 
  not exactly . 
  it 's specifically used for the aches you get a day or so later . 
  also not one word ;-), 
  * agujetas * : muscle soreness after exercise . 
  the nearest english term i can think of is `` doms '' ( delayed onset muscle soreness ) . 
  apparently in latin america this also means ` shoelaces ' . 
  * estrenar * : to use something for the first time , launch a project , premiere a movie , etc. 
  * anteayer * : the day before yesterday . 
  i 'm still learning spanish , and like to ` collect ' these kind of words . 
   these guys just want to go to england because they heard it 's pretty much heaven on earth and they tend to be from places with historical ties to the uk . 
  and a lot of people in the jungle have contacts and relatives in the uk already . 
  in the uk i 'd say that most people think it 's about benefits ( because the right-wing press tells them that ) , but benefits for refugees are * far * higher in france than the uk . 
  people in the uk also think that all refugees want to come to the uk , but the reality is that france gets more than twice as many people applying for refugee status than the uk . 
  ah , ok . yeah that makes sense . 
  did n't notice any attitude towards the english language either . 
  i always had the attitude that it was for me to speak french and not for the french to speak english , and did n't spend any time in paris until my french was ok . 
  so maybe that 's it . 
  and everyone in france was tolerant and patient with my bad french when i started learning ( except for * you * , rude woman in tabac in lyon ! ), 
  i live in spain . 
  flair does the spanish bit , username does the british bit . 
  coins are fair game , but better to keep the notes as they are : all the same and with nobody on them . 
  funny , because i 'm english , i lived in france for five years , and never got any attitude from anyone . 
  people would mock british food ( except scotch whisky ) , but that 's fair enough . 
  when i was at school ( i 'm 45 , this was in the uk ) , all the ` surrender ' jokes were about the italians . 
  i suspect they largely changed into being about the french in the run-up to the iraq war ( 2003 ) . 
   and by the way its really stupid calling basques and catalans spanish and when they do something offensive , wrong or which does not agree with your ideology then they arent spanish anymore . 
  yeah , i was told ( by a canario ) `` catalu\u00f1a is n't part of spain !, 
  '' , then five minutes later he complained that `` catalans want to break up spain ! '' . 
  easy to find in spain . 
  and not just in lidl . 
  you 've got ta be kidding ... 
  it 's the best !, 
  butter beats olive oil hands-down for fried eggs !, 
  yeah , i once bought ` bacon de pavo ' because it said on the packet that it had 70 % less fat . 
  what it did n't say on the packet was that it had 100 % more horrible . 
  that day i vowed to never again eat the meat of the turkey-pig . 
  it exists at about a similar profile in both france and spain : sliced processed meats , and to a lesser extent fresh , but pretty much always in pieces , not whole birds . 
  they 're not eaten for christmas ( and obviously not thanksgiving ) here . 
  slightly off-topic , in english they 're apparently called ` turkeys ' because it was thought they came from turkey . 
  in france they 're called ` dinde ' because it was thought they came from india ( ` poulet * d'inde * ' ) . 
  this goes on in [ a bunch of european languages ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_names_for_turkeys ) . 
  most seem to agree on the indian thing ( they are of course from the new world ) . 
  el laberinto del fauno todo sobre mi madre los girasoles ciegos ( ok , i mainly picked this because i have a massive crush on maribel verd\u00fa ),

  la palma is beautiful if you like a quiet life , and property is cheap . 
   i personally am of the opinion a ban on abortion is a breach in a woman 's personal freedom i totally agree . 
   and the eu needs to be way more proactive on this issue i totally disagree . 
  the situation is the same in ireland and it 's down to the irish to change their constitution , not the eu . 
  ` una cubana ' here . 
  seems to me that a pretty high proportion of brits want unfettered access to the eu markets but do n't want freedom of movement . 
  it 's like it 's ok for money , goods and services to move around freely , but not people . 
  i 'm really glad the rest of the eu is refusing to compromise on this . 
  money has the right to move freely ? 
  so should people . 
  if people accept ` hard brexit ' ( no freedom of movement , no special access to eu markets ) , then fine ; i respect that ( though it 's not my preference ) . 
  barcelona : tallest are the ' [ twin towers ] ( http://static.panoramio.com/photos/large/1307070.jpg ) ' ( hotel arts and torre mapfre ) at 154m . 
  best-looking tall building ( imo ) is the [ torre agbar ] ( http://bcnshop.barcelonaturisme.com/files/5445-7583-imagen/torre-agbar-noche-arquitectura-barcelona-pf-c1.jpg ) at 144m . 
  looks like a giant vibrator . 
  tallest * structure * is the [ torre de collserola ] ( http://www.vuelosalmundo.es/wp-content/uploads/shutterstock_19197604.jpg ) at 288m . 
  the top floor of the ` pod ' is 152m , and the tower is supported by guy wires . 
  i speak spanish and french , and can understand a fair bit of catalan .

  cup * does not give 2 seats to jxs , two of their mp will vote according to jxs * . 
  they can get them back and break the agreement too you know ? 
  this is not the time to go speculating about this , it 's kinda a moot point . 
   all i had to give them was our life savings , the deed to the house and a commitment of 10 trillion years of labor . 
  and when our galactic vehicle is complete , he will take us to our new home : blisstonia . 
  [ why of course !, 
  ] ( http://www.lavanguardia.com/politica/20140310/54402947586/margallo-una-cataluna-independiente-estaria-excluida-de-la-ue-durante-siglos.html ), 
  this agreement is to invest the president , not the plan of goverment . 
  rest assured, 
  nope . 
  they will give 2 seats to jxs to guarantee stability ( since this goverment independence , not normal goverment as its main goal , and that is needed as we have recently seen ) and expel the members who * are against a pact * , not mas , mas is out , due to the difficult circumstances that brought is here . 
  it would make 0 sense to have guys against the agreement working * in the agreement * . 
  cup is not neutered , they got most of what they wanted in the pact ( social policies etc ), 
  there would n't have been a social shock plan beacause it was probably the n. 1 condition of pact between the cup and jxs . 
  no pact , no plan , as simple as that . 
  just a standstill with parties waiting for the next elections and who know what would 've happened after those , since jxs would not exist then . 
   it is ridiculous . 
  it is not . 
  what you 're all forgetting here is that cup gets to impose a * huge * social shock plan that would n't have happened if there was no pact . 
  ( am happy cup voter , c'mon , ask me things ) . 
  also , it really does n't matter the spectrum of the different parties that get us a new state * once we get to vote the new government of that state * . 
  ideologies matter most when parties act on them , and creating a new state is surprisingly not an ideological act in a left-right sense , at least in the case of catalonia, 
  queeeeeeterunya triomfant, 
  less than 48h before all negotiations would 've ended ( after months of failed negotiations and new elections apparently inevitable ) !, 
  catalan politicians like the thrill of risk too much, 
  [ * heheheehehehehhe * ] ( http://images.ara.cat/politica/lalcalde-gallifa-jordi-fornas-acn_araima20130111_0115_20.jpg ) edit : since from some reason there is n't a picture of the mentioned portrait in the article , [ here 's ] ( http://www.ccma.cat/tv3/alacarta/telenoticies-comarques/lajuntament-de-torredembarra-exhibeix-la-foto-del-rei-de-mida-carnet/video/5576231/ ) the report from our national channel about it, 
  yep , here in catalonia both the caga ti\u00f3 and the reis are the gift bearers . 
  though some homes that are n't adapted into catalan culture celebrate santa, 
  de res !, 
  i 'm not really sure , probably pressure from the conservative sectors who , let 's be honest , are the ones that have the real power in jxs . 
  romeva said that he was n't the presidential candidate before the elections but people would n't mind it at all if he changed his mind . 
  he 'd be probably my first choice . 
  yeah , though surprisingly ( or not ) the far-left is also euro-sceptic , at least in catalonia, 
  sadly , jxs ( the majoritary independentist aglomeration ) has a lot of power not only politically , but also mediatically and they exerted a huge amount of preassure onto cup , trying to force their hand . 
  so they put practically all of independentism against them , and now that they 've seen that they ca n't do what they want they 're mad . 
  very mad . 
  yeah , i see your point , but many jxs voters were from converg\u00e8ncia who love their * president * . 
  they ca n't wrap their heards around why the cup did n't want to accept him and do n't even ask themselves why jxp did n't propose another candidate . 
  i fear that the internal stress inside the lines of the cup and many of their voters might cause some trouble , and that the party will be split between podemos and erc as you said . 
  no , i 'm not aligned with many of the policies from cup . 
  i 'm left leaning , * but not that left * . 
  no problem mate !, 
  sadly , you 'll soon ( next election in march i think ) see why it does n't happen often , they 'll probably get wrecked for sticking to what they said : /, 
  well , but if you * need * to make a deal with the cup and the cup 's sole reason for their recent surge to relevance is that they do n't want mas you * really ca n't put mas as the only candidate * . 
  probably coerced by the anc and much of the society , who value unity over what actually is going on with who get or does n't get power . 
  now , the independentists from cup that wanted a pact with mas will vote them though so in the end it worked out for them . 
  while people from podemos and other parties might appreciate it ( with an air of cynicism though ) they will never vote them * beacause they themselves are not independetists * , so either cup will dissapear or deflate due to extreme pressure from the majoritary indepenstist establishment and the flight of voters angry with the decision . 
  expect to see some people from the party leave too, 
  welp , they did what they promised and that 's why i voted them . 
  independence ca n't depend on a person , especially if his party and himself are of dubious circumstances in terms of corruption . 
  sad to see that the cup will probably recieve the short end of the stick for being honorable and get eaten by podemos plus they currently have internal turmoil and have angered the catalan establishment . 
  i guess that 's what happens when someone does what they said they 'd do in this country . 
  * ... that spain is a great nation and the spanish very spanish and much spanish . 
  thank you *, 
  i do n't buy that . 
  compared to other countries around here , what i posted can be even considered ` mild ' . 
  and now it 's wrong to talk about how the catalans lived under spanish opression for much of the xxth century ? 
  no matter how true it is ? 
  as far as i know * we did n't do the same for them *, 
  thank you !, 
  i put images related to catalonia ( not only barcelona ) and not in a particular sense as an olympic games , but a general one ( revolts , war , etc ) . 
  as far as i know , the demonstrations are * the opposite of oppresion * and the mancomunitat also is n't a sign of oppresion as far as i know , so i 'd say people only notice what they want . 
  but besides , is anything about what i said wrong ? 
  these things happened and beacause of what i said . 
  these things are also what i consider to be the 5 most important things to happen in the last 100 years in catalonia ( revolts -  mancomunitat -  civil war -  franco -  independentism ) and since it 's pretty subjective i find pretty retarded that people downvote me beacause `` hurr durr nazionalista '' . 
  but hey , this is not my first rodeo in / r/europe . 
  but you 're mistaking country and state !, 
  they have two different meanings , but since they usually correlate ( state is more or less the same as an * independent * country ) people do n't mind it too much and use one word or the other . 
  and i downvoted you for being rude and repetitive , the `` hurr durr catalonia is not a country '' is what made me put that text on my flair . 
  and yes , fuck them for ... being dependent on our money and not being able to develop their own economy as we did ? 
  alright then ... 
  oh , not that !, 
  i meant the flair * text *, 
  i mean , just check my flair mate :d !, 
  i just checked the numbers , it 's * the biggest in terms of % of people in the country that participated * . 
  my bad , it was poor wording, 
  at least the spanish trolls do n't go after the basques and downvote you to death for not being `` spain '' . 
  glad to see that they still respect one or two cultures inside their borders ... btw , even if it 's cheating since it 's not a picture , the painting of guernika is amazing, 
  yep !,

  without a doubt , the best science museum that i 've ever visited ( yes , i 've been to the one in munich :p ) .

  [ wiki link ] ( https://ca.wikipedia.org/wiki/cosmocaixa_barcelona ) * the museum of national art of catalonia , [ mnac for short ] ( http://www.abc.es/media/201307/15/mnac1--644x362.jpg ) is probably the most emblematic museum of barcelona though . 
  it houses the biggest collection and best collection of romanesque art and catalan art in general in the world , with it 's [ jewel of the crown , the pantocrator of sant climent de ta\u00fcll ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ed/meister_aus_tahull_001.jpg/800px-meister_aus_tahull_001.jpg ) .

  the building itself is considered the biggest surrealist object in the world . 
  figures . 
  it holds works from every single artistic movement of the painter . 
  nearby you can visit his private home , now a museum [ in the town of portlligat ] ( http://www.travel-to-costa-brava.com/images/salvador-dali-museum-port-lligat.jpg ), 
   there was an armed organization that is demanding catalan independence they were a bunch of misfits in the 90 ' who at most captured a guy and shot him in the leg . 
  nothing more . 
  the only real terrorist organization in spain is eta , which was set up in the franco regime . 
  and yes , we the catalans have had it rough historically ( war of spanish succession , decreto de nueva planta , revolts in the xixth century , la setmana tr\u00e0gica , miguel primo de rivera , the civil war , franco , and more recently the constant economical and cultural struggle against madrid ), 
  it 's shown on january the 1st every year on statal public tv , and lots of people watch it , usually old people, 
  [ kinda more like this :p ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iynw5kovfxw ), 
  [ ahhh these guys !, 
  of course ! ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fvifdzisgo&amp;t=0m52s ) . 
  we have to sub them though , which is sad . 
  they are singing about the glorious death camps of the gulags in the urss are n't they ?

  africa was doomed to be run over by external powers , sooner or later , one way or another . 
  you 're wrong to blame the people there . 
  the whole word economy was largely agrarian until the 20th century , that does n't have much to do with my point . 
  you 're going on a tangent to blame the african people for their misery , which is absurd . 
  not every problem in the world is someone 's fault . 
  whose fault were china 's defeats against the uk ? 
  the chinese emperor 's ? 
  the british queen ? 
  the world 's gears go much further than that . 
  you can find personal responsibility for personal actions , but trying to blame one whole continents problems on the whole lots of its inhabitants is absurd . 
  it 's the cheap simplicity of your argument what i find wrong , not it 's `` harshness '' . 
  projecting much ? 
  when capitalism arrived to east asia it wrecked havoc even though east asian empires had already a mercantilist economy . 
  when capitalism arrived to black africa , a majority of the continent was still tribal . 
  yeah , i was expecting this replay . 
  i did n't say africa 's current situation is white people 's fault , but blaming `` the natives '' is ever more unfair . 
  africa 's situation is the result of a whole continent forced to suddenly adapt to an economic system who developed for centuries , thousands of kilometers away . 
  in a way it 's like blaming the aztecs for dying from smallpox . 
   their people fucked it up though . 
  yeah , it 's not like colonialism had anything to do with it at all . 
  did spain regain western sahara ? 
  where do you live ? 
  except from munich , stuttgart and hamburg , food and clothing prices in germany are comparable with spain . 
  the african community in spain is small so it can be more easily integrated . 
  i 'd say spain got lucky with immigration because most of them came from romania and latin america which are culturally close . 
  the only group that is both big and culturally far are the moroccans . 
  mercator 's fault . 
  europe 's economy is more than 10 times that of russia and we have local uranium sources . 
  in case of conflict europe could have a nuclear arsenal that would the russian look tiny . 
   eu bases in the americas that would never happen , not just because it would mean a huge cession by the us , but because the americas are strategically not very important to europe . 
  europe 's focus is africa , the middle east and central asia . 
  which is why a western european united army is more feasible , since is way less controversial . 
  after that the east can join if they want to . 
  the sun brightness in that picture has the shape of spain . 
   minor nitpick -- it was arvanites & muslim albanians ( formerly called `` turcoalbanians '' ) that made up most of athens . 
  what , is that actually true ? 
  i though the guy was trolling . 
  yeah , it 's influential among spain 's conservatives , including the currently ruling party . 
  mostly in the south-east . 
  the center and north of the country do n't have earthquakes . 
  horsefaced spain, 
   arabs , they 're not any different than jordanians or saudis or other arabs as far as their ethnicity goes that 's really ignorant . 
  palestinians are indeed very different from jordanians and especially saudis ( ! ) . 
  they are closer to syrians or lebanese , but still there 's plenty differences between them . 
  it sounds you 're trying to make them look all the same so you can justify israel taking all of their land forever . 
  they can go to any other arab country after all . 
   as you make it seem i did n't say `` start '' . 
  it 's rather annoying when someone intentionally misreads your post . 
  secessionism was a fringe movement back then when spain was a centralized state , just like it is today in france . 
  had spain given no concessions , it would have remained like that . 
  i do n't find that paragraph in the link you posted , but regardless , what is official is what was published in the government bulletin boe , which is the text i copied and clearly states that `` catalan must normally be used in blah blah all materials and activities , except in the spanish language and literature and other foreign languages courses '' . 
  the `` normally '' bit maybe open to interpretation , but seems to only leave room to the exceptions listed next . 
  [ i guess the law is a lie then ] ( https://www.boe.es/buscar/act.php?id=boe-a-2009-13038 ) . 
  bilingual schools are definitely not the status quo . 
  education in catalonia is 90 % in catalan , only the spanish language class is taught in spanish , and there is no alternative . 
  public schools were education is 50-50 % spanish-catalan simply do n't exist . 
  agree to disagree . 
  one of the reasons pp is getting voted despite being the most corrupt party and a cancer to spain is their position on catalonia . 
  they seem the least likely to compromise , and many spaniards like myself are tired of every single compromise backfiring and creating more secessionism . 
  the percent of people who see themselves as repressed has only grown , and now they call everything `` repression '' . 
  the government asking them to have bi-lingual schools instead of only 100 % catalan ones would be seen as repression , pp being against them calling themselves a nation was seen as repression , them paying their fair share to poorer regions is seen as repression . 
  the reality is : catalans live in a free society , and there has n't been any significant repression for 40 years . 
  why have their demands only grown ? 
  because now they 're getting something . 
  they 've smelt blood and want more . 
  giving in any further will only make the situation worse . 
  i would n't say scapegoat , but many catalans believe their society would improve by simply not being part of spain . 
  as if spain , and not also the own catalan society , was the only source of all their problems . 
  my opinion is that an independent catalonia would have just the same problems they have today , plus all the new problems from the secession process . 
  because people see it as an endless slope . 
  * spain was a centralized country so autonomy was given to appease the nationalists : more of them became secessionists . 
  * autonomous regions were given more competences to appease the nationalists : more of them became secessionists . 
  * autonomous regions were given healthcare and education competencies : more of them became secessionists * autonomous regions were allowed to call themselves nations on their statutes : more of them became secessionists now they want to turn spain into a federal state . 
  what do you think will be the result ? 
  many of us believe secessionism would n't be so strong if spain had remained a central state . 
  as the spanish saying goes : we gave them a hand and they took the whole arm . 
  i have n't said boats ca n't get to china , but that they have to go through other country 's waters . 
  in case of conflict , that would be problem for china . 
  there 's no way erdogan is gon na blame the only ally he has left . 
  i also doubt saudi arabia would support a kemalist coup , although erdogan is trying hard to paint it as a gulenist coup . 
  in spain , you can easily find decent t-shirts for 5 euros if you do n't care about the brand . 
  i do n't think they really are protected , i think it 's more about how our police forces work . 
  the police base their power in their ability to make you suffer long term consequences : a criminal record , fines , and in the worst case prison . 
  most of these people care mostly about the short term , so these threats are n't very scary to them . 
  in third world countries , where this is widespread , the police , first thing , give you a beating . 
  that 's not gon na happen in europe , so we 're stuck with the problem that only law avowing citizens care about the law . 
  who cares about the general mood . 
  prove them wrong . 
  more like 40 , but spain , portugal and greece 's regimes in the 70 's do n't look all that different compared with today 's turkey . 
  destructive crises come always after golden times . 
  one can only fall from the top . 
  china lacks a clear way to international waters , since any boats have to sail through russian , japanese , taiwanese or philippine waters . 
  they want such clear way and the easiest way to get it is having back taiwan , which as of today , will only happen by force . 
  germany is probably too densely populated to use nuclear energy . 
  in comparison ; france , spain or sweden have big areas with a very low population density , which makes nuclear plants safer . 
   in theory this can cause bidding war between employers and hyperinflation . 
  has it ever happened in reality ? 
  you seem to be unfamiliar with sarcasm . 
  if they were to remain , they should n't be allowed to keep any of the privileges they currently have , like the `` uk rebate '' . 
   give them a hand just before they drown which is exactly what the uk did to france in wwii .

  lub it up and give it a titty job .

  looks like portugal is having far right and racism problems in their universities , so sad to see this from our iberabros !, 
  ** translation ** the association claims to have received threats from around 40 people linked to the far right . 
  the association of students of the faculty of social sciences and humanities ( fcsh ) of the new university of lisbon denounced on wednesday threats from about 40 people linked to the far right . 
  `` on tuesday , the board of the association of students of the faculty of social sciences and humanities ( aefcsh ) of the new university of lisbon was invaded by four dozen individuals assigned to the extreme right , who identified themselves as such , '' he says . 
  according to the association , in a `` clearly intimidating '' attitude , people demanded to meet individually members of aefcsh . 
  `` along with this initiative , the photos of some association leaders were published on social networks of the extreme right , and the 40 people promised to return in greater numbers to the aefcsh facilities , '' he says . 
  the students of that faculty decided on monday at a general meeting of students not to cede the auditorium to the organization nova portugalidade to hold a conference of political scientist jaime nogueira pinto on `` populism or democracy ? 
  brexit , trump and le pen in debate . '', 
  they claimed that the event was `` associated with colonialist , racist , xenophobic arguments . '', 
  in the statement , aefcsh stresses that `` it never sought to prevent the existence of political debate , nor the presence of professor jaime nogueira pinto in college . '', 
  `` the board of the aefcsh was limited to following up on a decision of the general meeting of students that mandated it not to cede the auditorium requested by the organization nova portugalidade.this organization has a salazarista profile and the direction of aefcsh is reviewed in student concern to which it was linked in the general meeting of students , `` he says . 
  in the statement , the association also explains that it was only aware of the decision to cancel the conference by the media . 
  the aefcsh ends by stating that it `` will not be intimidated by the presence and threats of any far-right group '' and that `` it is not afraid of the free debate it has never prevented and will continue to promote in the faculty , as well as democratic values by which are governed . '', 
  this case caused controversy , to the point that the president of the republic , marcelo rebelo de sousa , asked for clarifications on the cancellation of the conference , which motivated criticism and led to the 25 de abril association to make its facilities available to nogueira pinto . 
  pnr calls for protest this wednesday it was also known that the national renewal party ( pnr ) called for a protest in front of the faculty of social sciences and humanities of the new university of lisbon `` against the totalitarianism of the single thought and the freedom of expression for all '' . 
  `` at least , these media cases that already affect jo\u00e3o braga and jaime nogueira pinto serve to awaken minds and consciences , and that , once awakened , realize that only the pnr truly fights against the totalitarianism of the single thought , '' the party says . 
  announcement on its website . 
  fado singer jo\u00e3o braga wrote last week on his facebook page , referring to the oscar-winning ceremony in hollywood : `` now just be black or gay to win oscars . '', 
  the statement provoked controversy and led the sos racism association to lodge a complaint with the commission on equality and against racial discrimination . 
  in the summons , the pnr points out that `` it always felt in the face of discrimination , boycott , censorship and threat by the owners of established power . '', 
  `` when we warned hundreds of times that this was the reality in 21st century portugal , most of those who heard us ` shake the water out of the cape ' and told us it was because we were ` extremists ' , just to make a difference , think differently and say it without fear , `` he says . 
  for the pnr , with `` nationalist growth in the west , the left , who dominates the system , who dictates the rules and who imposes cultural marxism , begins to get nervous and to harden the struggle . 
  who can have a voice , what is right and wrong and criminalizes who opposes it . '', 
  ** translation ** the court of appeal of lisbon distributed to judge rui rangel the new appeal of jos\u00e9 s\u00f3crates in the ambit of operation marqu\u00eas . 
  the court of appeal of lisbon distributed to judge rui rangel the new appeal of jos\u00e9 s\u00f3crates in the context of operation marquis , according to saturday . 
  jos\u00e9 s\u00f3crates asks for the nullity of the procedural acts and the end of the operation marquis 's investigation because there has not yet been a deadline for the prosecution or the order to close the facts investigated . 
  this is the 38th appeal of operation marquis , and judge rui rangel 's choice does not seem to please the public ministry . 
  `` someone should explain how the distribution of cases in the lisbon relation is being done , '' said a source quoted by saturday . 
  the decision may be appealed by the public prosecutor . 
  the only remedy won by jos\u00e9 s\u00f3crates until now was judge rui rangel , who put an end to the secrecy of internal justice and allowed socrates access to the documents and testimonies of the proceedings . 
  the attorney general , joana marques vidal , extended the investigation until march 17 but did not officially announce whether the case ends within that period . 
  to me it just looks like they replaced local flora with foreign flora .

  is this memes ? 
  do n't be silly , that might cause internal trade strife in the us . 
  yeah , i know , not much ago english media made some shitarticles about police in majorca being scared or something . 
  the real issue stated by the police is that salary is lower than what rent even costs there so they could n't afford working there without housing help like family , so yeah , housing does go up big time in some places . 
  still , there are better ways to solve overcrowding ( < - is that even a word ? 
   uneducated politicians to be fair , the mayor of barcelona is in favor of pushing away tourists and buy houses for occupy people with state money . 
  so if you 're in barcelona and do n't have a place to stay just occupy a place and demand the ajuntament buy it for it , free housing !,

  or are they all in cahoots ? 
  actually the ban is not only for old cars but also some newer cars , it depends more on the amount of co2 emissions than the age , though sure , older cars will pollute more on average . 
  weaksauce is not an excuse , it 's the [ difference between conspiranoia and facts ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwlwq5ron_k ) . 
  and no , i ca n't be sad about some supposed screencaps that somebody has to send them and that you saw some years ago . 
  sorry buddy but it does n't add up , you say a lot of things but do n't back them up , you 're fluff , you say i 'm selectively blind to some `` truth '' you 're trying to promote , but the claims you make are not backed . 
  where are these screencaps , who is this supposed respected photo-journalist and where are the threats ? 
  where is the backing for your facts ? 
  i find it really silly that you 're trying to spin a yarn on us with this fluff but you refuse to acknowledge direct source on clearly xenophobic remarks on the catalan counselor of work that are recorded and spread widely . 
  of course you know that , because you know better . 
  you 're one smart cookie that can read the mind of the attendees and the organizers . 
  not smart enough to realize that 's a different article than the others though . 
  i 'm going to note some things a smart cookie like you might appreciate : two assholes trying to boycott a legitimate protest is n't enough to condemn a legitimate gathering . 
  specially with security keeping them at bay . 
  sounds like you 're trying to spin a yarn on us with this , specially knowing that in the other articles ( of the same media ) they flat out refuse to show pictures of said ` fascism ' . 
  the case still stands , a dozen links after the accusation of `` demonstrably fascist '' all you 've got is a bunch of fluff and a picture with two idiots that are not related to dol\u00e7a catalunya . 
  anything else to add , smart cookie ? 
  yes , i did , and they 're full of fluff . 
  they read shit like `` finally , we saw the falange wave their flags '' . 
  yet in the images there 's no sign of fascism whatsoever , only people with spanish , catalan and barcelona flags . 
  no sign of falange flags , not in the same article anyway , the information is so disconnected that rather than information it 's dissociated data . 
  i think it 's funny how you keep trying to portrait me as uneducated , yet you insist on ignoring the logical flaws in your own sources . 
  hot or not !, 
  it 's the same post , with the same sources , and a few images without sources edited by the blogger . 
  the only thing that it says is that one of the supposed founders of dol\u00e7a catalunya is a catholic , and a conservative ... and apparently that 's enough for a bunch of conspiranoics to call him fascists , francoist and amusingly enough , to link him with a blog about nutrition . 
  ok . my eyes have been feasted with your silliness , now , can you actually `` demonstrate '' that they are fascists ? 
  do you even understand that feelings and facts are different things ? 
  sigh , i 'm going to have to get a tinfoil hat when i speak with catalans now . 
  -- you know what , i 'm gon na write a checklist to help you differ between people you do n't like and actual fascists : it 's not a fascist if ... * disagrees with your political opinion !, 
  * writes in a media with a different political opinion than yours !, 
  * has a different faith !, 
  there , hopefully this should help you , unicorn . 
  and yet portugal still insists that spain is a danger to the environment and that they 're green knights . 
  so they ate chorizo and then ran away ?

  my thermodynamics exam all over again !, 
  more interesting than its use as an airliner ( doubt it will ever be used for that ) are its possible uses as a ssto spaceplane , since it reaches orbital velocity at 33 km of height .

  please step away from your keyboard before you do anymore ridicule, 
  you are stripped of certain human rights when you are put in prison, 
  1st amendment protects you from the government . 
  freedom of speech is a philosophical concept , one societies should strive for , at that . 
  equalizing a philosophical concepts with the exact wording of a part of the american constitution is dishonest at best . 
  edit : and legislation protects you from assaults and aggressions . 
  we are getting called everything under the sun with every new measure , getting our governments bogged down by useful idiots , and being expected to both secure the border and treat them better than our poor with very little assistance . 
  all of this while living under a crushing economic crisis being destroyed by badly thought imposed austerity measures . 
  in this case they are interchangeable , countries can get away with both illegalities and immoralities , which does n't mean they stop being so . 
  ok , it was just an example . 
  let 's see : the sinking of the rainbow warrior by the french was pretty immoral , and they got away with it anyway , what i meant is that countries can do immoral things and get away with them , but that does n't mean they are n't immoral . 
  and killing people is a crime , yet i do n't see the police arresting drone pilots , do you ? 
  the fact that a country can get away with something , does n't mean it 's not immoral , or illegal, 
  are you aware that majority of degrees from me are not equal to european ones ?

  when did bbc become this kind of propaganda ? 
  seriously , i 'm curious, 
   i consistently check comment histories you are the reason people make alts . 
  i might even make one , if it was n't a hassle on mobile, 
  that is the kind of thing absolute idiots with zero knowledge of how laws work would do . 
  trying to find a loophole like that does n't work , that 's what the judge is for , to interpret the meaning of the law , rather than the letter . 
  it 's like bumping into someone so their phone falls , picking it up and running . 
  not thanks to our government . 
  jokes aside , most parts of spain get very cold in winter , despite popular perception . 
  it 's an almost normal occurrence now for old people to burn or asphyxiate to death due to burning things in makeshift fireplaces . 
  oh , no , it 's possible . 
  you looked at the right number . 
  granted , there 's a lot of sunken economy , but even then , number of people working is ridiculously low . 
  also , for people under 35 it 's more like 50 % unemployed . 
  if farmers were paid what supermarkets charge , they 'd be filthy rich . 
  it 's ridiculous the margins they have . 
  personally i think governments should support direct sales to consumer initiatives and the creation of producer cooperatives . 
  it 's better for rural economies and the environment . 
  according to tv , also spain, 
  you know , i hope i 'm wrong, 
  they know full well the place is safe now , they 're not the idiots you make them to be . 
  so this is how eu ends . 
  you could get the un on board to manage the camps , if they try to complain just do the saudi thing and give them a `` donation '', 
  both, 
  we can convince turkey with money . 
  besides , we really should be helping turkey with its camps, 
  if you eliminate incentives , and create a risk of being sent to a neutral african country , they will stop coming , eliminating the market .

  or in greece ? 
  serbia ? 
  yeah , those countries ravaged by civil war ...

  oh , ut some will say that `` democracy is n't always ok '', 
  good luck hungary !, 
  thank you mr orban, 
  why would you send them away when it was you that invited them ? 
  i honestly thought about taking a bus to denmark , saying i 'm a refugee from syria and seeing how many months of free money i could get until i was denied and had to pay another 30 euros to come back . 
  it happened right as they lowered it from 2500 to 1400 $ . 
  if it was still in the 2500 i 'd have looked at whether it 's a crime , and if it was not harshly punished , i 'd have done it . 
  normally i would n't do such a thing , but one thing is frauding a system for poor people , and another some idiot trying to hand out free money . 
  ah , i did n't understand the idiom ( is this the word ? ), 
  you used, 
  ah , thanks . 
  no , it 's not shameful behavior , nor it is downplaying it . 
  it 's just the most impartial and dry way to say it , the fact that somebody did it is clear both from the act and from context , and that it 's a quasi-terroristic ( it 's debatable if it can be considered full terrorism , with the negative connotation the word implies , since it was not aimed at directly bodily harming a person , but it 's just personal opinion on the line between vandalism and terrorism ) is also not up to debate .

  ( i 'm american myself btw ) people put so much into imagining how a place will be and honestly , american tourists in europe are generally well viewed . 
  at least here we are comparing to the loads of british tourists which has a huge working class component as well . 
  nobody hates you for your government , we all hate our governments . 
  and honestly , it 's kind of endearing hearing people not being able to speak the language but manage to get some sort of communication across anyway . 
  but yeah , being a foreigner is fine , just do n't act like an ass . 
  the piece of dirt you live on does n't really matter . 
  that said , us culture has an outsized influence a lot of people have been so they like to talk about it as a common experience , so the us thing is usually a conversation starter at least . 
  is n't this similar to the french system ? 
  but that does n't matter if they are in europe or not , hence why french guyana is a part of the eu . 
  and i just realized the ~ ~ second ~ ~ * third * longest single border of an eu/non-eu country is france/brazil ( after norway/sweden ) . 
  edit : forgot the ridiculously long croatia/bosnia border . 
  you 're on !, 
  last one to the competiton ... wins ? 
  how does gibraltar fit into that ? 
  i thought they were n't in the eu , but apparently are . 
  but it 's not a choice . 
  it 's perfectly reasonable that both are considered a mother tongue . 
  the problem is politics gets into this and people do n't want to consider themselves native spanish . 
  but that has nothing to do with being a native spanish speaker . 
  if you grew up being able to speak spanish at a native level , it is considered a mother tongue . 
  language at home does n't necessarily matter . 
  all the chinese children i see in madrid that speak perfect * castellano * because they are raised here certainly have spanish as a native language , even though they may also have mandarin . 
  i would n't be shocked if more than half the world has more than 1 native tongue , with the language diversity in asia/africa/america, 
  from a linguistic point of view , it 's not an either/or thing . 
  it 's entirely possible to have two languages as mother tounges . 
  very few people under the age of 75 would not be considered native spanish speakers . 
  that just has to do with how the languages are . 
  portugese has many more sounds than spanish and since the languages are relatively similar , we just sound like retarded people to them , but they do understand without being able to speak spanish . 
  a spanish speaker pretty much ca n't understand spoken portuguese at all , though i can pick up a newspaper and pretty much understand 85 % of what i 'm reading . 
  the vast majority catalans/basques/galicians have spanish as a mother tounge . 
  it 's entirely possible to have more than 1 l1 . 
  the numbers are from the vast numbers of romanians/moroccans/chinese that have learned spanish . 
  i myself have immigrated and had to learn spanish . 
  it 's a huge percentage of the population . 
   catalan and galician are n't that hard to understand . 
  yes they are . 
  catalan i can maybe pick up a small bit of , but i honestly find italian easier to understand . 
  spanish is just really strict about what sounds there are and it 's difficult to hear other , subtler sounds . 
  i have an advantage as a native english speaker in that regard as well . 
  that said , pretty much everyone also speaks spanish . 
  i am orginially from the us so it 's kind of the opposite . 
  spanish is the default language and not that many people really keep up with it . 
  i got pretty decent before i moved to spain , but really my fluency comes pretty much entirely from my daily life here . 
  is it similar to spanish and portugese where the portuguese understand us reasonably well , but it 's just really difficult to understand portuguese as a spanish speaker ? 
  it means that it may become inflamed if it makes sense that way . 
  i 'm saying that the well managed economies on the euro are doing great . 
  having a currency worth artificially less is a good thing for a country , especially a country like the uk that exports a lot of services . 
  not op , but i 'm not an eu citizen . 
  it would n't be hell without schengen , but it would be goddamned irritating . 
  passport checks on non-citizens have gotten stricter recently as well ( good thing ) , but even with my residence card , i get every page scrutinized from time to time . 
  not joining the euro is the biggest mistake the uk has made . 
  being a rich country having other countries keep your currency artificial low is a huge advantage . 
  germany is doing fantastically and a huge part is the euro . 
  all of the uk 's services would be relatively cheaper on the global market without the pound keeping prices high . 
  that 's a political problem and basically what nato does right now . 
  if you wa n't a combat soldier , you need to have the 10 soldiers running logistics to support him/her or whatever the ratio is . 
  the way western minilaries are oraganized at the moment is basically that people can support the us mission but nobody can do anything on their own really . 
  i think this really is n't the best way to go about things , but watching people get defensive about it does n't fix the problem, 
  i mentioned this , but it 's worth mentioning as a top level comment that the 2011 numbers have greece with the lowest suicide rate in the oecd . 
  source : www.oecd.org/els/health-systems/health-at-a-glance-2013.pdf page 37, 
  i believe greece has one of the lowest suicide rates in the world , actually . 
  all the way at home . 
  the advantage of native english . 
  also approximately 80 % of the rest of the spanish web is forocoches . 
  if things get much more heated i would n't be surprised if a carrier group parks in the black sea . 
  you know , just to see what 's going on . 
  so you are admitting to basing your views on what you read on the internet and not having traveled ? 
  i 'm an american and i now live permanently in the eu and i can assure you i have only been hassled once about it by an extremely drunk fellow who was belligerent and would have found fault with the color of my shirt otherwise . 
  the difference of `` i do n't understand some of your politics '' and `` i do n't like you as a people '' is very profound and there may be a lot of the former ( that also exists between european countries ) i have found the latter to be pretty much non-existent . 
  it would happen , but the issue is after iraq and afghanistan , the war would be generally unpopular in the us , but if the us is attacked directly it will sell easier . 
  the russians also know this so us presence is , in a way , a deterrent as well . 
  if it 's done wrong it 's not great , but if it 's done correctly ( privatise after recouping investment ) then it promotes much more economic efficiency and is a good way for public infrastructure projects with huge capex to get built and maintained well indefinitely . 
  they look to be truly cooperating on the nuclear issue and if they keep it up they can pretty effectively drive a wedge in between the eu and the us position . 
  smart on their part . 
  i was n't aware of any sort of fiscal transfer for border security but i would be happy to learn that such a scheme exists . 
  part of the idea of schengen was a common border so i do n't think it 's unreasonable for a common border force . 
  at the very least that a lot of the bill for expensive security should be helped by countries that may not be directly on the border . 
  the whole idea of schengen means that the fence in ceuta is also the border for berlin and stockholm yet the crisis hit southern countries have to deal with most of the fallout . 
  edit : apparently this fund exists so any debate is just about appropriate funding and allocation which is much more boring . 
  yeah , it 's shitty here , especially with lowering wages and high personal debt loads in general . 
  that said saying the euro threat was mistaken is probably wrong . 
  the uk could probably be even more propserous if it had the euro keeping forex rates in check rather than having to make international sales profitable in sterling . 
  i am , of course , happy that the value is not being pushed up even further , but from a uk perspective , passing on the $ was a big mistake . 
  the euro is the best thing that ever happened to the industrial countries on it . 
  having other countries artificially keep your currency value down is a great deal for industrial economies . 
  i am a us citizen and i would say the huge number of states is actually one of the main problems for why things are n't working there right now . 
  i think everyone would be much better off if it were 4 or 5 countries . 
  the us works like that . 
  see wyomig vs. california . 
  `` awkward '' can be anything from * torpe * to * verg\u00fcenza ajena * . 
  it 's such a vague and specific term that it just does n't have an equivalent word in spanish . 
  of course you can translate each specific occurance pretty well , but not with a single word and there 's no real term that encompasses that whole uneasy feeling of something that 's not quite right . 
  i rembember there used to be like 20 mile stretches of straight-up slolemning on i-65 between chicago and indanapolis . 
  that has gotten fixed though but pothole dodging is still way too common and just seen as something that is normal . 
  at least in the midwest and east coast where i am from . 
  what do you mean `` where i 'm from ? '' . 
  i grew up around the midwest and east coast us . 
  so yes , to varying degrees there is is horribly normal . 
  in spain it would be considered a shameful road and the fact that potholes are around much at all now is generally seen as a sign of the economic crisis . 
  of course extremely rural roads can go either way , but aside from having to go slow from being narrow and windy , they are still generally better maintained than main roads in the us .

  most learn the language but still will live in their small communities . 
  mostly the chinese . 
   we already have enough andalusians , thank you very much . 
  what is the meaning of this ? 
  for some reason , ca n't read `` freight train '' without thinking of breaking bad . 
  that 's what the press has done to you . 
  meh , i think we 're fine . 
  problem is people that wo n't blend with us . 
  but that 's not true of everyone of course . 
  so the actual numbers are a bit higher . 
  of course there the line is blurry . 
  i am for some reason under the impression that right wing extremists do n't vote in spain . 
  same goes for left wing extremists . 
  a large part of the population does n't give a rat 's ass about elections or voting . 
  a shame , really . 
   i wonder whether that 's because most of spain 's non eu foreigners are from the colonies and so their shared language and certain cultural aspects makes integrating into the spanish community really easy . 
  actually i might share more with you , culturally speaking , than with any south american guy . 
  and the adults are fine folk , but in schools they make groups and it 's quite problematic . 
  take it easy , it 's no big deal . 
  you can hire a freelance to do that for you for 5.000 $ tops . 
  i guess we are better prepared . 
  some buildings at least . 
  my room is a furnace . 
  i do not understand your comment at all . 
  they can try . 
  shitstorm would be epic . 
  although i guess they could fish some votes that way . 
  you see , being against separatism earns votes in spain . 
  edit : i would like to see the downvoters say something to support their claims . 
  as someone that learned 3 languages in school , it 's pretty great . 
  and our knowledge of the other 2 languages does n't seem to be suffering from it . 
  how the fuck do you spend 400.000 $ on a website . 
  i 'm guessing they either hired a friend , or some web designing studio is laughing their asses of right now . 
  stopping piracy in russia , hah . 
  it 's bad , but at least they are openly incompetent . 
  i guess people will vote them again in 8 years or so . 
  government is just cyclic here for some reason . 
  100 % sure no tanks will start up , do n't worry . 
  best thing was government telling ciu not to participate in the human chain because `` chains are bad '' and `` this day should representate every point of view '' . 
  too bad every party represents their own pov and not all of them . 
  bro do you even spain ? 
  joke is on you ghent is beautiful . 
  i guess it 's both and both are stupid . 
  well our winter is not so bad , but if you really want to have non-winter , consider visiting canarias islands . 
  because you seemed to be disagreeing i guess . 
  but i gave you my upvote , all is well , son . 
  i do n't think that 's true . 
  ave is pretty expensive , it is more convenient than flying but the low time alternative already existed . 
  i do n't think it made people travel more . 
  and even if it did , it 's to their benefit , that the state offers us things to improve our quality of life , which is its main goal . 
  nobody commutes with more than one person in the car . 
  traveling , maybe . 
  but almost never 5 ( or 7 ) passengers per car . 
  i do n't really see any point on it , to be fair . 
  if a train full with passengers is n't less polluting than a car , i 'll eat my damn shoe . 
  in my opinion , the arguments in this article are mostly bullshit , except the toledo cuenca line , which of course must have been planned by an idiot . 
  also the people that wrote this do n't know much about physics . 
  the power required to move a mass depends on the third power of speed , actually . 
  also a train offers a much lower surface compared to total volume and load , which is pretty great . 
  and i 'm gon na go out a limb and say that it 's much better aerodynamically than a car . 
  this sounds pretty similar to ludism to me . 
  lol, 
  we are not tight with money . 
  if you ca n't tell a gipsy by the looks , you are going to lose a wallet . 
  at least in my city . 
  the `` battle '' involved the massacre of thousands of atahualpa 's unarmed entourage of nobles and attendants , in the great plaza of cajamarca . 
  such a fucking hero, 
  what if they did n't ? 
  we 've got some other people to take revenge on first . 
  how do you get from that conclusion from my comment ? 
  \\ # 3 was a joke . 
  ca n't argue with the rest . 
  a war has winners and losers . 
  sometimes only losers . 
  racism is not a good thing . 
  and columbus killed bazillions of people and enslaved as many of them as he could . 
  dude was a scumbag . 
  not in some sweet venganza . 
  good for us , bad for them . 
  bad 3 . 
  bad . 
  bad, 
  we could use / r/vivaspa \u00f1a, 
  and the 5th r. religion . 
  i am definitely not in . 
  i do n't care at all . 
  it 's not arrogant . 
  i mean that he might have been born in macau for all i care . 
  but he got our ships and shit , so it 's kind of our fault . 
  ok , you can keep that piece of shit then . 
  but we enabled him . 
  we are united for good and for bad . 
  wether i like it or not . 
  but catalunya has its fair share of shameful moments too . 
  good ol' columbus . 
  i do n't think we will have a military comparable with the us one . 
  neither do i want it . 
  lies upon lies !, 
  oh yeah i 'm so used to see people mispelling queue from playing lol . 
  queue * and they do , even though other things can overcome that advantage .

  the ones that should get the money back are the taxpayers . 
  how much has that free money setback airbus in the competition is title click bait . 
  do n't worry , i thought the map was great . 
  just to complete , you gave three possible origins of spain , but there are quite a few more : * land of rabbits * land of metal-forging * edge * lip * land of snakes * hidden/remote land * north island * the land that divides the sea * western city also , it could derive from some mythical figures ( hispalo , hispan , son and grandson of hercules ) , or from baal sapanu ( some phoenician divinity ) . 
  but i agree that the first two you have chosen ( rabbits and metal-forging ) are the ones more commonly quoted . 
  specially the rabbits one . 
  does it ? 
  well , he should get a flair , then . 
  pretending to be a troll is the same as being one unless you declare the sarcasm . 
  well , i guess ... 
  but selling organs ? 
  i very much doubt that there is anyone selling here . 
  well , googling it , it seems like the very first time someone was arrested for that was in 2014 . 
  they were from lebanon . 
  yeah ... although the gist of it it 's basically he gave 200m $ around in the zone , to relatives , which were quite a few ( he was one of thirteen brothers . 
  and he had twelve sons ) the rumour was also made believable as he has been paying for a lot of infrastructure for all the small village in the past . 
  curious , i did n't know he was spanish , i expected him to be mexican . 
  good of him , not forgetting his humble beginnings . 
  the years he lived in spain before leaving for mexico were not good years to be spanish , or european in general , at all . 
  we are talking about populist potential . 
  off the charts on those . 
  about the other characteristics , they are quite anti-eu . 
  and anti-charnegos ; that should qualify partly as anti-inmigrant . 
  yeah . . 
  it should match podemos and jxsi results , but it doesnt seem to . 
  precisely to europeans i would n't say it 's strange . 
  we are kinda tired of visiting those four , so changing for summer it 's not such a strange idea . 
  the last long travels i did have been to poland , croatia and czechia . 
  i would say it 's more strange for someone that 's crossing the atlantic once to then avoid those four and go for the less traveled road . 
  it 's no surprise they will go and recommend those for you , with good reason ... 
  unless he was doing a 6 months trip and it 's going all over the place . 
  they ? 
  who ? 
  were n't those the r1a ? 
  is racist because he painted himself black ? 
  i think that 's racist only in the us ... 
  in spain when there is not a black guy to do it , someone paints himself black for the three wise men parades on xmas . 
  and nobody cares . 
  there is no black face or kkk tradition for someone to see it in a bad light . 
  `` santiago , keep us r1b '' sounds less classy . 
  well , just an example to compare ... the terrain is bigger than germany 's , and we have only a bit more than half the population . 
  there is a lot of parts with 50-100 people villages separated by 10-12 km each where terrain is dirt cheap . 
  if someday they invent teleportation , some very poor people are going to be quite rich ( they hold a lot of terrain used for agriculture , big houses with very nice weather , but almost useless because there is literally nothing to do in there ) . 
  the third was always french . 
  it was the second , actually , for a very long time . 
  we didnt learn english in my school until i was 16y old , only french . 
  yes . 
  they banned bullfighting at the same they protected the burning bulls as a tradition there . 
  it 's just like ... like the point was creating a distinction out of thin air instead of protecting animals . 
  well , the ones that have their turn at being popular this lustrum . 
  erc , jxsi or whatever is nowadays . 
  well , burning bulls is that strange single point on which pp and independentists agree . 
  so maybe it 's a bit more than a third . 
  quark ? 
  the difference between madrid and the north is the sun more than the temperature . 
  it might get cold in madrid , but i had never considered whether i should start buying vitamin d tablets while in there . 
  in germany i think it about it every november . 
  or getting a sun lamp , being this drained is not normal . 
  the worst month by far for me here . 
  +1 here . 
  it 's not i like i care that much to prefer one , but i am starting to be a trump supporter . 
  just as an allergic reaction to the modern left . 
  i do n't think that must always be the case , at least in spain they sometimes try and do some modern flourishes with vpos ( subsidized houses ) which are clearly more expensive , and imho far uglier , than a simple clean , classic , good design . 
  well , as far as i know , that imaginary title is granted by popular opinion . 
  so if we said it enough times , she will magically be the leader of the free world . 
  of course . 
  poor people should feel poor , and rich people better than them , that 's why it 's important that their blocks are designed ugly as fuck . 
  at least that 's my theory behind those atrocities . 
  do n't know . 
  a robot cooler than me told me to do it . 
  well , if i had to choose an early death , i would choose something cooler . 
  like being crushed by a runaway semi truck driven by the incredible hulk . 
  say here , right now , that ethnically catalans are different from the rest of spain . 
  go on . 
  say it . 
  good example , although i am 2 % that somebody thought about the whole thing more than borrell once he decided to put the elbow in the bar . 
  but he pass perfectly as our german friend in here . 
  what are * you * on about ? 
  is this trolling or do you have a mental handicap ? 
  i am just too tired for the day to tell the two apart if you were trying to have a laugh . 
  well , luckily you were not one of the guys spending countless hours , negotiations , calculations and effort redacting our constitutions . 
  so , now catalans are not ethnic spaniards . 
  that thing with the rh + was an idea of s. arana for the basques , afaik catalan independentists are not deranged as him . 
  yet . 
  i am rather sure that a bayern independence referendum was blocked not long ago because germany has the same rule : ( ... ) but the court said in a decision released that germany 's constitutional law does not allow for individual states to break away . 
  `` in the federal republic of germany , which is a nation-state based on the constituent power of the german people , states are not ` masters of the constitution ' , '' the court wrote in the decision . 
  `` therefore there is no room under the constitution for individual states to attempt to secede . 
  this violates the constitutional order . '', 
  they will not be the only ones if the dollar-euro keeps going the same direction . 
  at least you got a fairly big chunk of terrain . 
  i very much doubt you can be happy for a fellow countryman , but i will take the sarcasm at face value . 
  are n't you learning a lot today ? 
  what excuses , you simpleton ? 
  did you bother doing any research on the topic ? 
  go and read the link . 
  if 17 pages are too much just skip to the very last one . 
  might be ... 
  but the idea originated in the 2nd republic and stopped due to our civil war , was to have the same as france , as this was the only border to rest of europe , regardless of the reasons france had to have it . 
  that thing with the time zone just keeps going around ... and while it 's not clear ( surprisingly for something that happened 80y ago ) , there are two facts 1 ) the implementation just reused the 2nd republic plans for it , 2 ) the main interest was train coordination with france . 
  nazis had nothing to do with it .

  how are they going to get their wages and pensions if banks are n't solvent ? 
  ca n't stand demagogues . 
  deposits put food on the table and medicines where there are needed . 
  i 'm sure that the person who wrote that has n't kids or people who depends on him . 
  i really hope that we wo n't see an humanitarian crisis in the next months in greece . 
  and with an humanitarian crisis i mean ** the whole ** country with rationing cards queuing to get food . 
  that 's my personal nightmare , i would hate to see that in europe. , and do n't believe is something unthinkable right now . 
  rajoy has said the same . 
  shame on them . 
  tsipras is the greek prime minister , pleases them or not . 
  that 's what i wish for , but i do n't think they will add enough seats . 
  tired of reading that nonsense . 
  ciudadanos is imposing important restrictions in their pacts . 
  to pact with pp for the government they would ask rajoy 's head and primaries , and that wo n't happen . 
  want to bet ? 
  of course . 
  they created it 9 years ago in catalonia just in case it became handy somehow ... las gilipolleces que hay que leer ... 
  most of the current problems of spain were already there ten years ago if you wanted to see them , but most of the people did n't care . 
  two parties were born by that time : upyd and ciudadanos . 
  he speaks galician too ... or so he says, 
  i was a teenager when chiquito de la calzada became famous . 
  i remember trying to pronunciate a sentence with perfect oxford accent with a motherfucker behind me whispering * ai can de more jarrrlll ... * ahhhh , those were the times ... 
  the pool is shrinking ... marry now !, 
  yes , almost guaranteed . 
  out of luck ... that does n't inspire a lot of confidence in the currency . 
  and in the change machine case , sure you may go to the ecb , but the `` evil greek '' now has 50 legit euros ... 
  i 'm sure that there are n't enough threads in the front page about the greek crisis that you guys needed to hijack this thread too ... 
  if esperanza aguirre asks for it , its sure that rajoy wo n't do it . 
   if you look at the notes , any one beginning in y is greek what if it 's already in my pocket ? 
  what if i use it in a change machine or something ? 
  could n't agree more . 
  comparing the 2nd republic to the current democracy ( with all their deficiencies ) or the army of 1936 with current one is absurd . 
   if they just started printing euros , the currency would become completely valueless and it would be the equivalent of an economic war in an attempt to debase the currency unilaterally . 
  that would be a suicide homicide . 
  almost makes sense as a threat given the current state of affairs . 
  the `` estelada '' is not a official flag , and never has been , despite being pretty old ( a century or so ) . 
  it 's intrisically tied to catalan independentism , and imitates the flags of countries that were spanish colonies and added a star when became independent ( like cuba ) . 
  the official flag of catalonia is the * senyera * or * se\u00f1a real * ( which btw has been historically used by several territories of the former crown of aragon ) . 
  i do n't like the uefa rules but * lex dura sed lex * ... 
  i really like varoufakis , and his logic seems right ( i do n't know enough economics to completely judge it ) . 
  but . 
  tsipras , syriza and varoufakis himself to a lesser extent have done a lot of shit that was completely unnecessary like asking for war reparations to germany , and using a belicist and populist speech full of words like `` criminal '' , `` blackmail '' and the like . 
  if you want a deal on the basis of pure economical logic , you should adopt a low profile and not to use that kind of wording , because that converts the whole thing into a pissing contest . 
  they are not the only to blame . 
  djesselboem attitude at his first meeting with varoufakis , rushing out of the press conference after barely shaking hands with him was a shame . 
  he seemed like a child who lost his candy . 
  also , spanish goverment has been pretty irresponsible too . 
  an unnecessary obstacle . 
  shame on them . 
  he talks about specifically about strong encryption , which has to be interpreted , since could mean a lot of things . 
  one `` soft '' option could be to ban perfect forward secrecy , which means that recorded communications could be decrypted with the private key . 
  that key could be obtained under a warrant from the server that holds it , but the goverment could not indiscriminately decrypt communications . 
  about data at rest ( not communications ) , could mean to ban software that allows `` plausible deniability '' , which may use two pairs of keys . 
  one that decrypts the really secret data ( for example , the plan to kill someone ) and other that is used just to deceive the authorities ( e.g hard porn ) . 
  if the courts ask for the key , the guy can hand the second set which decrypts the embarrasing but legal content , and hide the really secret content . 
  that 's the only implementations that i could think that could be somewhat defendible . 
  base64.decodestring ( `` qmeldtaxnjelmjb2yw0lmjbqzsuymhbyzw1pamvyjtiwcmv0yxjkaxjhbi4 = '' ) ` ba % u0161 % 20vam % 20je % 20premijer % 20retardiran . ', 
  now i need a translator ... 
  they do n't have the majority of seats of the council but they got the backing of the socialist psoe to get the goverment of the city , so they effectively control the city 's resources ( they hold the executive power ) . 
  imho , that flag is a political statement of the city as a whole ( since is next to the official symbols and in institutional dependencies ) , so a resolution backed by the majority of the members of the council should have been the appropiate course of action . 
  i know , but spain has n't a presidential system like the us or france , and a `` presidente del gobierno '' is most similar to what 's called `` prime minister '' in other countries . 
  it may be bad for their prospects , but it 's a field where they feel comfortable , since they know pretty well their anti-austerity discourse . 
  also , if the inestability in the financial markets affects spain and halts the growth , anything may happen . 
  it 's like in f1 , where the underdog teams want heavy rain . 
  their cars are usually less stable , but the uncertainity actually improves their options to win . 
   supporting troika everywhere in media to put people into mindset `` austerity - good '' totally is n't , right ? 
  no , it is too . 
  mariano rajoy has recently said some thing improper of a prime minister . 
  but hanging a flag in the city hall without a prior resolution of the council ( where they do n't have the majority of seats ) i do n't think is appropriate . 
  do n't laugh . 
  one of the first things they intend to do is a renegotiation of the `` criminal conditions '' of [ part of the debt ] ( https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=auto&amp;tl=en&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2faragondigital.es%2fnoticia.asp%3fnotid%3d133892%26secid%3d4 ) . 
  a bit of context . 
  the council is governed by a leftist coalition like the ones of madrid and barcelona . 
  it 's just an example of how the greek crisis is being used as a matter of internal politics . 
  * the whole reason we have elected officials is so we do n't have to think all the time . 
  * homer simpson now seriously , i think that this referendum is a farce . 
  we mostly know what the yes implies . 
  the no is a huge unknown . 
  tsipras is not acting honestly , unless he acknowledges that in that case he ca n't guarantee to remain in the eurozone or even in the eu . 
  i think that podemos chances to win are vastly overstated . 
  under normal conditions they will be the 3rd most voted party , which means they can help to psoe 's candidate pedro sanchez to be the next prime minister , but nothing more . 
  actually , economic instability in these months may help them to get reach a better outcome . 
  sure , greece 's problems may convince a lot of people to not to vote them , but at the same time , what 's hapenning just fuels their rethoric . 
  it 's in nuanced , technical debates when they show their weaknesses an inexperience , but capitalism vs democracy ? 
  they know that script , they have played it for years ... 
   edit : sorry for an opinion ? 
  if you do n't like downvotes for opinions wait for downvotes for simple , verifiable , yet uncomfortable facts . 
   might just decide to not make any more preofit than say 450 thousand ( just to be safe ) how does a company cut its profit to avoid taxes ? 
  rejecting sales and deals ? 
  reinvesting in the company : buying new trucks , renewing their it infrastructure , opening new offices , etc. . . all of it is good for the economy as a whole . 
  ( that 's one option , the other is obviously to just commit tax fraud . ), 
  no , the canary islands have a lower vat called igic ( versus iva in the mainland ) . 
  not sure about the balear islands . 
   live and let live . 
  live and let ~ ~ live ~ ~ die, 
  i get what you say . 
  my grandmother loved bull fighting . 
  she was raised inmersed in the bull culture , and lived most of her life in a farm . 
  she had a spontaneous way of dealing with animals . 
  dogs and cats naturally obeyed and loved her , and at the same time , she could kill a hen without blinking an eye .

  well , there was a popular case in spain in which the president , mariano rajoy , read one of these notes out loud by accident , the note said '' [ fin de la cita ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kl9n0yxwl1u ) '' ( end of the quote/quotation ) and it was n't even in english . 
  so it would n't surprise me the slightlest . 
  its a common strategy in spain , i 'm going to take the opportunity to plug in here the video of [ emilio bot\u00edn speaking english ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaldowqiq2m ), 
  the only ones that took this elections as a independence vote where the independentist , i voted what i though would be a better goverment regardless of their position towards independence ( which happens to be neither yes nor no ) , which was a thing you should have done aswell , since , after all is said and done , we 've been left with a shit parlament for the next 4 years , pro budget cuts and privatisation and fairly corrupt , if mas gets actually invested , which was the opposite of what the people seemed to want . 
  there was not a no option and shoudl n't there had to be a yes one , its going to be a shit 4 next years and its going to be our own fault . 
  i 'm sure that even if trum is n't directly involved in the defence business , usa 's military is fairly big , enough for it to be meshed up with other industries , you know , you buy me these submarines that do n't float , we buy your matresses for our pre built troops barracks or something like that that would somehow made profitable for him to keep the war machine rolling . 
  that does n't mean that there was a `` no '' option to vote in , again , there was a campaign to not vote yes , thats pretty obvious , but the psc dude clearly said there was not going to be a `` junts pel no '' and there was n't one . 
  we can pull europe towards america and put more sea in between maybe ? 
  is not about syria , is about russia taking the spotligh from the usa as `` world police '' . 
  i do n't remember which one was the `` good one '' , i 've listened to like 2 and i almost had a brain aneurism , so [ this one ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duocd7uekpc ) will have to do . 
  and it was `` delfin hasta el fin '' , i still dont know how the usa didnt declare war on ecuador after [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=necobo0bhek ), 
  yes , but not coming in and abolishing it just because or jumping above the law because they can . 
  the law does n't only matters when it affects us . 
  do the colonies count ? 
  because wendy sulka and el delf\u00edn sin fin would be worth a mention . 
  yes , probably abolishing syndicates we would also get cheaper goods , point is that there has to be a compromise , unregulated taxis did n't work in the past and i do n't think it 'll be different now . 
  thats not what history shows tho , taxi licenses were set up to battle the unlivable wages that taxi drives had because there were too many of them , which also affects city traffic . 
  uber is not a guy in his garage looking for the best for people , its a multinational company valued in billions that want to cut costs on employees wages . 
  fun fact , the `` asereje ja deje dejeve etc '' is actually from the opening of [ the sugarhil gang - rapper 's delight ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rktuaesacqm ) edit : links are hard, 
  i 'm surprised none has linked to [ tito mc 's la raza ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8-wss0aswy ), 
  i 'm settling for next year for the ones that actually go to the parlament , because , ironically enough , the seats are always empty save for the anti-eu mp 's . 
  the european parlament its a fucking joke not even their members believe . 
  i did , it was impossible not to , and there was not a `` junts pel no '' that needed to be voted , whether there was a campaign of pressure to vote other that yes candidatures is another thing . 
  [ i 'll let you go this time . 
  the context of this answer is that , whether that people want independence or not is moot since they have not voted in favour of the current independence process ( that might not take off after all ) , so its a no , no matter how much you try to spin things . 
  even if 100 % of them were pro independence , they would still count as no . 
  or rather as a `` not this way '' , which is a no anyway . 
  so lets keep thing spinning until they reach the ultimate truth , that there are only one way to independence and mas is our saviour , lets ignore whatever else other people think and lets get them on board when its convenient . 
   some people among the voters and the members of the party are pro independence , some are n't . 
  what the fuck are you talking about ? 
  which makes the statement true , just incomplete . 
  a even split is not pro independence , stop trying to spin the situation in your favour , if they 'd wanted to vote yes they would have but they didnt , so do n't take their ( or mine ) vote for granted , please , i 'd like to have my opinion too and not the one you want to impose on me , thank you . 
  a yes to what ? 
  there is a significant portion of voters who 'd prefer a federalized state but under spain , so while the yes is fairly prevalent , there is a split on those who want full blown idependence and those who 'd rather federalize . 
  the circus you mean ? 
  yes , in the end people complains how much the budget cuts are hurting them , with the return to classes in crowded schools that ca n't hold the student 's they receive or the always going worse healthcare and in the end people end up voting for the right wing , which will keep the cuts because , so far , they 've been the ones in favor of them . 
  i once had a girl argue me that mas was n't a rigth wing politician , so figures . 
  and i suppose you can prove tha `` its false '' . 
  the people i know who voted csqep would rather federalize , me included , so just because of that , his statement its true and you are a dirty liar . 
  no its not , there was no `` against '' movement , there was only a yes and you did n't make to the goal so you are now moving the goalpost . 
  catalonia as we know it today by itself have n't been a nation , unlike scotland , it has always been mixed in between other regions . 
  funily enough what we celebrate the september 11th is that we chose the wrong side on the succession war for the throne of spain . 
  i do n't say its a new idea , after all barcelona has been always a privileged area , i just say it does n't compare to scotland , since scotland has been a sovereign nation for themselves . 
  for more than 4 days anyway . 
  and i do n't know what people you go with or maybe is that i do n't follow football that much , but i hear as much roar on the street when both bar\u00e7a or spain scores . 
  spanish nationality is weak because being nationalist = = franco , that i give it to you , but it far from justifies nationalism , no nationalism is better than other . 
  i do n't know there , but here people hate all inmigrants equally . 
  so in only makes a difference when its convenient or what ? 
  the only cultural shock that exists in spain is between deep rural comunities and big cities , like in every other country . 
  the differences between regions are n't so great as to be shocking , different ? 
  yeah , but not shockingly different . 
  besides , scotland was a sovereign nation before it was literally bough by england . 
  that might be a oversimplification of the events going on between englishmen and scots before , but the birth of modern scotland comes to be when they ponied up all the country 's money in a colonial bet and they fucked up and ruined the country and england came in and bought them . 
  catalonia on the other hand had a bit of an affair with france and thats about it . 
  yes it will , somehow since gallardon assumed the ministry of justice he must 've done something to piss judges off , because they 've gone from shot down one of spain 's top judges ( garz\u00f3n ) for exposing and bringing cases of corruption against the goverment , to the other end of the spectrum to the point is rare that there is no announces of new imputations . 
  moreover , while they have told that , yes , a secesion would be ilegal , they 've reminded rajoy that laws change and that this is a problem that needs a political solution . 
  rajoy will propose to buy a bigger plasma tv or something like that . 
  russia have their own secessionist movements they ca n't afford to support or give legitimacy to , besides russia does n't recognize kosovo . 
  same goes with china , the only nations that would recognize catalonia are those which are n't recognized themselves by other countries . 
  usa its not so clear cut , they do n't have any reason by themselves not to give it recognition , except that it would piss off most of their eu allies . 
  no no , the main talking point on independence is n't cultural but rather economic `` spain steal us '' is all about money and not much about culture . 
  people does n't want to literally `` pay the tooth fillings of some andaluz when i have to pay mine 's here '' . 
  and thats a honest to good argument that independentist people brand . 
  culture comes second to money . 
  you obviously have n't traveled that much arround spain . 
   they are their own people who can think and represent the constituents to the best of their abilities . 
  and that can include going against the will of the majority of their constituents . 
  ( eventually they have to convince their constituents that that was a wise choice -- when elections come up -- but i really do n't think that 's an impossible task . ), 
  `` we were promised these conditions and now i can see that they are not being met , so therefore i can not , in good conscience , vote to leave at this moment , since i believe this deal does n't represent what my constituents voted '' boom , and i 'm not even a politician or have charisma , i bet they can do better . 
  going with the will of the people puts you at odd with 48 % of the electorate . 
  specially when that will is just the oposite of the 52 % will . 
  also the 48 % has the support of the people who actually have money and power , so there is that . 
  either way you are going agaisnt the will of practically half of the population, 
  majorities are always right , there is no way that ignoring 48 % of the population could backfire into you at all . 
  that great system in which the slimmest majority defines the rule of the rest . 
  the democratic thing would be to keep an scrutiny on all the step of the proccess so at least all positions get something from it , right ? 
  because if brexiteers finally cut a deal thats not what the brexit voters were promised it is still democracy , right ? 
  yes , but now its not his problem at all . 
  you wo n't lose your write offs and stuff since you have not left . 
  as for the rest of affairs , you 'll keep being a pain in the ass as you 've always been , but we 'd like you the same . 
  worse still , mr bush administration had the balls to suggest that maybe those territories spain have in the north of africa should go back to morocco after aznar sold our souls to the devil with irak . 
  so figures . 
  yeah , the syrian war has been the only one to happen this century . 
  there 's been no war in this 16 years that the usa and uk have gone a bit over the rules with torture and shit . 
  besides , spain still is on the top 10 world weapons exports , probably to syria aswell , so what gives . 
  well , the outcome its hardly a surprise . 
  i 've read that some institution ( maybe even the city council ) is taking all the footage from the vandalism and adding it to the ongoing exposition , so after all it might only been some sort of ongoing `` art project '' . 
  most of the vandals have been identified but the civic centre in which all of this is going on have n't pressed charges , so they 've been let go . 
  so maybe this was the outcome they were looking for . 
  you didnt read the fact that the organization powers lie in the local goverment ? 
  there is no need to have the law at all . 
  war i refered catalonia towards `` madrid '' and not in reverse . 
  i was basing in your `` historic facts '' . 
  really ? 
  thats what you believe ? 
  the law says that you ca n't ban the activity while at the same time giving full power to the local goverment about organizing the events , so what about if the goverment does n't organize the bullfights ? 
  we have to overthrow the goverment about a law that we did n't need not to have bullfighthing . 
  makes lot of sense . 
  this is just a petty overreaction , just because it can not be passed at a local level means we have to stop pursuing , we could go and get a ban at a national level o negociate a change in the constitution that allowed local goverments to ban the activity . 
  but no , war is the first thing we have to throw when things do n't go slightly our way .

   they do n't have power to actually , not even article 155 gives this power .

   in any case it 's gon na be a mess if the spanish government do n't come to terms we all know this is what it 's going to happen . 
  you ca n't really be expecting the government to accept the independence like that, 
  please , tell me what you think will happen . 
  i ca n't tell , we will have to wait and see what happens . 
  i honestly think he wo n't declare independence , but instead use the referendum as a tool to show the world how serious catalans are in their feelings for independence and force spain to give a real one . 
  that 's why a higher turnout is important to give it more `` legitimacy '' . 
  then the goverment being jackasses and feeding more independentism . 
  so i expect basically the same as the other time , . 
  this time they really really mean it . 
  puidgemont has said he will declare unilateral independence no matter what , so the goverment will be forced to revoke the status of autonomous community and take care of catalonia directly . 
  catalan independentist politicians will be prosecuted for disobedience and prevarication , they 'll be seen as martirs and there will be even more discontent .

  the two nations have been mixed up for too long -- the carthaginians who came from africa to spain , the vandals who left spain for africa , the moors who stayed in spain for 700 years -- for such a long cohabitation not to have confused the race and customs of the two countries .

  * there are dozens of testimonies like this . 
  i do n't think it has any sense to continue with this thread we are not going anywhere . 
   you 're mixing up things . 
  no i 'm not . 
  eta and some basque nationalists consider that only basque nationalists are true basques . 
  moreso if they were n't of true basque origin . 
  you also have flirted with this idea , not long ago , while arguing with / u/rc72 , when you stated that the aguirre 's , etc. . who flew from the basque country because eta threats where spanish who happened to be born in the basque country . 
  again , more proof : the official symbols of euskadi ( hymn , etc. . . ) are intrisically nationalists and were not chosen by unanimity . 
  so yes , eta and its surroundings targeted preferently who they considered invaders . 
   the `` us '' in `` they killed one of us '' usually referred to the status of the person as a basque nationalist , not as a basque overall . 
  as i said previously , there is no distintion between a basque or a basque nationalist for some people . 
   ( pnv , ea ) tolerated , and some sections even actively supported , eta up until the mid-1990s . 
  whoa . 
  if someone dared to say this during the 90 's ( which i happen to remember perfectly ) the response of those parties would have been complete outrage . 
  but it 's true that some portions of those parties had zero empathy for victims who were n't basque under their very own definition . 
  oh , it was a key factor for sure . 
  and the proof is that a part of the basque society reacted very differently those rare times when eta killed a pnv member . 
  for them was `` killed one of us '' this time . 
  lots of those victims were considered spanish who happened to be born in the basque country or just foreigners because were immigrants or children of a immigrant couple . 
  if you challenge yourself out of your comfort zone you probably will change your mind .

  that 's not true . 
  that word was common at the very least until the 60 's and 70 's . 
  and the basque nationalism has been far from open-minded and welcoming . 
  i should n't have to argue too much in this regard to anyone who knows recent spanish history ... not unlike spanish nationalism really . 
  your comment is a good example of nationalism ... and no it 's not a compliment . 
  you are pretty acritical towards how the basque society has handled immigration . 
  the word * maketo * is the pejorative way to refer to castilian immigrants and you know perfectly well that the first basque nationalist was outright racist and catholic fundamentalist . 
  so no , not always the basque nation has been so tolerant . 
  this should n't be a problem for you as individual , if you personally are open-minded and tolerant . 
  but at the moment in which you believe that there is some kind of unbreakable link between you and that people from 80 years ago , they become your people and write a comment so self indulgent as the one you just wrote . 
  the whole concept of nation is a bit backwards in this place and age . 
  nationalism was understandable in the xixth century , where people of an area could identify with certain customs , and essentially everyone had access to the same reads , the same art expressions , etc. . . 
  this is n't true anymore . 
  we as westerners already share a good deal of cultural references ( thanks to hollywood ) and our children will do even more . 
  it 's a good thing that our states pivot over a concept of citizenship completely detached of race , origins or religion . 
  modern nationalisms also claim to not share those parameters but they have exchanged them by simple adherence to the nation itself , which is n't a lot better ; is still a way to draw a line between them and us . 
  it makes me sick when politicians allude to nations as something concrete , durable and eternal . 
  no , nations does n't even exist nor they are a sort of supernatural beings . 
  they are human constructs that served a purpose , like tribes , and hopefully in some centuries they will be seen also as a backwards thing .

  catalonia is not a country, 
  my sister speaks 6 languages she must be insane . 
  your mad, 
  there wont be any referendum because its illegal . 
  catalonia is spain, 
  im amazed that spain , being the worlds biggest wine producer , still preffers beer . 
  also snobish luxembulgarians and their appetite for wine . 
  dep in rip, 
  do you actually beleive what you are saying ? 
  there were tbousands of kids throwing stones to the police . 
  and you are telling me all of them were secret police ? 
  also you are justifying violent acts just because there is viollence on the other side of the espectrum too . 
  everything i posted is true, 
  thank god we have a great riot police . 
  left wing radicals are very violent in spain . 
  the demonstrators were all left wing extremists . 
  the spanish term is dog ~ flute . 
  its a kind of radical wich can turn violent . 
  there should have been more anti riot police . 
  we cant allow hooligan demonstrators to run our country . 
  they are probably poor russians trying to emigrate to a better nation . 
  starvin marvins . 
  what can we do to stop this ? 
  they are amerindian like this http://i.imgur.com/g6zgm8h.jpg, 
   argentina  white, 
  they voted on a constitution wich allowed that . 
  spain owes nothing to the catalans , i ` ts exactly the opposite . 
  why does n't america let kansas go ? 
  the whole independentist movement in catalonia derives from the huge debt mess over there . 
  the current ruling party in catalonia uses it as a tool to get better finance , and as a way to confirm ( failing btw ) their leadership in the mess that is catalonian politics . 
  i will link you to a comment i made months ago about why catalonia should n't be independent . 
  spain would be better off . 
  catalonia is financed by the spanish goverment since they are in a huge debt mess . 
  the basque country is financially independent already . 
  in spain you dont get a passport , you get a residence permit wich only applies to spain , so its not even like a visa . 
  also the house must be 160.000 $ . 
  prostitutes, 
  do you know the meaning of contraband ? 
   have i been reading the news wrong ? 
  yes . 
  get over it . 
  grow up, 
   back, 
  your flag is insulting to your nation . 
  im a spaniard in favour of the current status quo in regards of the gibraltar issue . 
  just as long as you dont interfere with our police catching drug traffickers who use gibraltar as a refugee . 
  and as long as you dont send your rotten nuclear submarines to fix them right on our coast . 
  having said that , i oppose any pressure on our side , and i acknowledge our faults like the fishermen who shouldnt fish in your waters . 
  we basically should support your integration as neighbours and treat you as if you were andorra , basically . 
  and im glad the regular brit would downvote you . 
  peace . 
  get over it, 
  that it is not european . 
  bullshit article . 
  bullshit newspaper . 
  turkey is not europe . 
  british economic newspapers should be banned in this subreddit . 
  but i would like to stay in europe . 
  i want to vacation in greece now :(, 
  nice proof, 
  great britain is not a country, 
   they are already corrupt give names . 
  people here canalize their anger throug protesting . 
  its a way of showing the terrorists that we , united are stronger than them . 
  in the demonstrations against the terrorist bombing of the atocha station in march 2004 , about 25 % of the country went to the streets . 
  in madrid 2 million people gathered ( half of the city ) source : http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/reactions_to_the_2004_madrid_train_bombings, 
  there is tons of corruption in the history of podemos, 
  spain has great infrastructures, 
  pp is just a conservative party . 
  the populists are podemos . 
  and he is the best president we ever had, 
   turkey  european, 
  but you are a dictatorship , not a democracy . 
  would you dare to critisize the king here ? 
  even if it was just as a joke ? 
  here in spain people shit on the king constantly , we have several republican parties . 
  you may have a `` constitution '' on paper but it does n't mean you have western freedoms or democracy levels . 
  you are light years away from being a modern parlamentary monarchy like the european ones . 
   if you are find with getting punched in the face for disrespecting a symbol or thing of something that somebody else loves or adores then express all you want . 
  how does this apply to mohamed cartoons ? 
  poland is eastern europe , not central . 
  roma , that 's the etnicity of romanians , right ? 
  as a spaniard , i totally agree with that . 
  la linea de la concepcion . 
  came here to post this . 
  yes, 
  thanks morocco / s, 
  shut up nerd, 
  i want to go to georgia now . 
  do you have qt3 .14 's there ? 
  you must be so smart . 
  btw ive been on reddit for almost 9 years . 
  youve been here for just 1, 
  then stop being a filthy perroflauta . 
  wash your hair and get a job,

  i can only think it 's the ignorance of not knowing that ceuta and melilla were part of spain way before morocco even existed . 
  your point is that they belong to morocco because it 's in africa and not in europe ? 
  that hardly makes sense . 
  youtube comments are youtube comments . 
  they are like that in every single language/country . 
  it 's the general feeling though , and you ca n't say `` sudaca '' or `` panchito '' is a word only heard of in youtube comments . 
  it 's ok to dislike an accent though , that 's * still * not racist as of 2015 . 
  castilian spanish does n't have any weird lisp . 
  the ` c ' / ` z ' sound that sounds to you like a lisp is only used in those letters , and not extended to the s or any other of that kind . 
  and the `` lisp '' is exactly the same that you use when you say `` month '' , `` throw '' or `` mouth '' . 
  so if we are lispy then you are , too !, 
  yes that 's an internet classic in the spanish-speaking sphere lol, 
  * we are not lazy , quite the contrary . 
  * we are not partying all day . 
  *  90 % of us hate bullfighting as much as you do . 
  * we do not take siestas more than you do and we do n't stop the day and our work to take them , that 's because of our horrible timezone . 
  * we are not religious . 
  it 's about the tradition for most people . 
  lots of people can follow the most known catholic tradition celebrations being atheist or agnostic , just because `` it 's pretty '' and it 's socially acceptable . 
  * and we are one of the most decentralized countries in the world , without being an actual federal state , though it 's asymmetrical . 
  * most of us do n't give a flying fuck about the ownership of gibraltar , but it 's annoying having a tax heaven micronation right in the backyard that want to make you feel like you own them the world and scream at you when you defend your waters from their incursions . 
  * there 's indeed a bit of disrespect against the old colonies and are seen them usually as inferior . 
  latinamerican spanish is also usually disliked , though i 've seen the sentiment is mutual between latinamericans towards spaniards/europeans . 
  that 's self-reported . 
  am\u00e9rica is europe 's child . 
  who cares if eu or them are better anyway . 
  we made them , people !, 
  sadly , most young people probably wo n't even know about what is [ this ] ( https://marisolroman.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/velacc81zquez_-_de_breda_o_las_lanzas_museo_del_prado_1634-35.jpg ) . 
  if that 's not clue enough , then no , people do n't even care about gibraltar and stuff like that , despite what the news and the uk and spain 's respective governments wanted to tell you . 
  gib breda back pls and do n't remove paella, 
  you should probably add that that 's very rare and barcelona 's homicide rate is probably among the lowest in the world , like in the rest of spain aswell . 
  despite that terrible thing that happened to your friend and his brother . 
  spaniards are also light haired btw , just not as much proportion . 
  but that 's something they probably ignore , like many many other things . 
  so , precisely , your point is ... ? 
  this does n't make britain more xenophobic . 
  it 's just dumb idiots being dumb , and xenophobic . 
  i wished other people , especially in the uk , understood that and stopped saying spain is super-racist for this same reason . 
  it 's not . 
  spain is the mecca of * casual racism * , but that 's because we are not ocd about speaking of nationalities or the skin in our language , nothing else . 
  for example , we do n't have a `` n word '' , we only have `` negro '' for instance , and it 's not a bad word . 
  and yes we use to describe people , beacuse you know , it 's part of the appareance . 
  that 's why spanish language in spain is not so ocd for this like in other places . 
  it 's more offensive for me as a spaniard to have another european tell me spain is very racist than this particular attack from some dumbs in york . 
  such beard , hnnngg . 
  because they do n't even aknowledge the existence of other nations ? 
  franco did n't simply `` came to power '' . 
  that 's the problem with revisionism . 
  that it leads to say stupid things like `` franco came to power '' instead of `` franco did a coup supported by militars and fascists '' . 
  and the church , by the way . 
  the coup failed and that leaded to the civil war . 
  the regime of the second republic was n't a dictatorship nor a communist regime , despite what far-right revisionists want to say . 
  people downvoting this need their head get checked . 
  it 's like downvoting a `` hitler was bad '' comment . 
  it 's a fact . 
  downvotes wo n't change it . 
  deal with it , franquistas de paco-tilla . 
  comparing spain with mexico and its people it 's like comparing france with algeria and its people . 
  spain is comparable with france or italy and their cultures , not with south american countries , despite the hispanic heritage . 
  there are over a million brits in spain . 
  most of them are retirees living in the coast , that 's why unemployment figures do n't matter . 
  and as of ...  think about the number of brits that speak spanish . 
  has another explaination : brits retirees in spain like to form ghettos , immersed in their own language and do n't ever talk to spaniards . 
  they have their own places and they are serviced in english exclusively . 
  they 're just that nice .

  the main reason could be the welfare system functioning in most eu countries today . 
  human health is not something to use as a currency to trade with . 
  that 's something that has been done right in europe . 
  other reasons are also very obvious . 
  quality of life and life expectancy . 
  the low figures of homicide rates and/or criminal rates overall . 
  the culture , and weather itself ( at least in this side of the continent ) . 
  one developed area in the world with good gdp per capita ( something that we need to push from and beyond western europe ) . 
  and there are quite more reasons frankly . 
  the big chunk of the world 's population is in asia . 
  but who would change europe for india or china ? 
  sadly that 's how it works . 
  that only proves catalans speak spanish more often and that 's it .

  spain-wide , electrification of railways should be a priority to make the trains go faster .

  there was this electoral promise from a couple of parties to turn the spanish parliament unicameral , removing the senate - upper house - . 
  this is due to having the senate 's powers never used and weaken by having the main parties overrepresented , to the point that the media only focus their attention to the lower house - congress of deputies - .

  it was projected that the spanish motorways ' network would be the 3rd world 's largest , after china and us .

  lots of highway tracks are new , so the roads are in fairly good conditions . 
  there are two types of motorways - * autov\u00edas * , way more common , have to give access to nearby properties , usually with building an exit to local roads , while * autopistas * does n't - . 
  usually , the * autopistas * are toll roads , and older than the rest of the network . 
  they 're more common in coastal areas . 
  there are n't * autov\u00edas * that are toll roads , so the highway network is mostly free .

  basically the problem with gypsies is not only the integration in society , it 's the values and social rules they hold , that belong to gypsy culture , but non-gypsies ca n't accept - see , encouraging your daughter to marry at 15 - .

  i think not . 
  i think both genders face ludicrous social expectations and it 's against that that we need to fight , not against the people working towards ending women 's social expectations . 
  fighting against problems that affect men does not mean looking away from problems affecting women . 
  prostate cancer is an issue ; let 's build a social movement to de-stigmatise it and spread awareness instead of taking away from breast cancer ; let 's build equality up , not level it down . 
  more men die of suicide than women , but also more women attempt suicide than men . 
  and let 's not fall into the narrative that somehow white , heterosexual men are the most oppresed group in the world . 
  i 'm not saying that but it 's disingenuous to believe that men and women face the same societal issues . 
  of course everyone deserves the same rights and protection but this is like saying ` straight people need pride too ' or ` white people need a white histoyry month ' . 
  oh right , well then if those things are n't over as we know , i do n't see how being ` bombarded ' with these issues ( if such a thing happens anyway ) is a problem . 
  especially with feminism , there 's so many misunderstandings and so many people pretending it 's about killing all men that it 's ridiculous . 
  of course we are ` bombarded ' with social issues , that 's because the issues are there and pretending they do n't exist will not make them go away . 
  oh no , we 're so bored , why ca n't these people stop asking for rights ?

  i only see one thing in this thread : people with spanish flairs calling catalan independentists fascists . 
  the levels of spanish propaganda here are disgusting . 
  now we 're being called fascists by a few users with spanish flairs . 
  look at the video at the end of this article : http://www.vilaweb.cat/noticies/la-fiscal-en-cap-de-barcelona-vaig-temer-per-la-meva-integritat/ judge for yourselves if that is fascist harassment . 
  this will probably get quickly downvoted but i ca n't believe the blatant , in-your-face levels of propaganda that get posted by a couple of users in this subreddit who are obsessed with posting anything that can be remotely used to portray independence supporters as a bunch of scary nazis , while those users themselves have been posting the vilest homophobic , sexist and racist comments in the past . 
  edit : you 're not going to show [ meps ] ( https://twitter.com/stevenshelga/status/831524561590087680 ) who are appalled by the actions the spanish state is taking , right ? 
  it does , but a great first step is to welcome it instead of hindering it . 
  only if the websites were translated , etc. 
  that would be a step . 
  instead , my father lost his wallet while we were on a holiday in rome and the embassy staff scoffed at us ( we 're valencian ) because we were speaking in catalan , and one of them said : `` no ser\u00e9is independentistas de esos tambi\u00e9n no ? '', 
  obviously that 's just anecdotic but it goes to show that we need a big change in mentality . 
  you mean , their exppiry dates ... ? 
  ( i 'll see myself out now ) . 
  yeah , pp having still more than a third of the votes despite * all * the issues that have been surfacing does not give hope to anyone , but we can dream . 
  i 'm talking about officiality at the ` federal ' level . 
  i think it should be up to each state to decide their official languages , but other than that the 4 main languages should be equally official . 
  i should be able to go to a spanish embassy and use catalan . 
  ah , fresh , organic , locally-produced memes . 
  truly the best . 
  the common issue with all your paragraphs is that spain imposed castilian in places where other languages were spoken . 
  now in most of these places castilian is the majority language . 
  so now you say we will never be able to have full equality . 
  let 's look at canada . 
  french and english are both official throuought the country , even though there are basically no french speakers in , say , alberta . 
  do you know why ? 
  because the fact that a language is minoritary does not mean it 's less important . 
  because even though english may be the lingua franca in canada , you can speak french in the parliament . 
  like in belgium , like in switzerland , like in sensible multi-national states . 
  spanish has been chosen and imposed as the lingua franca and we did n't have a say in that . 
  and now calling for equality of all spanish languages is nationalism . 
  saying ` but now most catalans speak spanish ' ( which is only true around barcelona ) does not address the issue . 
  that 's my view anyway but i know it 's not shared by most people in spain , or at least in spanish-speaking regions . 
  we already had our language as well before spanish was imposed . 
  why does spanish have to be the only official language ? 
  this is why we 're wary of ` federalist ' talks . 
  if you suggest something like switzerland where no language is above the others , ok . other than that it 's hard not to call it imperialist . 
  i beg your pardon ? 
  i do n't understand what you mean . 
  i was not trying to start an argument , my point was devoid of politics . 
  on the other hand , it always comes down to treating people like me as deluded nationalists . 
  spain is not an empire but lots of things feel a bit imperialistic to me from the castilian side . 
  why is catalan not official in spain outside the catalan-speaking regions ? 
  why is using catalan in the spanish * and * european parliaments illegal ? 
  why is castilian not only legal in catalan speaking regions , but also mandatory ? 
  if we 're all equal , how come spain is not like switzerland where all languages and cultures truly feel equal ? 
  why does castilian , which has been given the name of spanish , have the primacy ? 
  i do n't think he had a bad intention . 
  but it 's at the very least disingenuous to call catalan culture outside of spain spanish . 
  scotland 's case works because all of scotland is in the uk ; however i still think that describing [ cape breton ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cape_breton_island ) 's culture as british instead of just scottish is not very informative . 
  in the same way , going to the french basque country and calling them spanish because most basques are in spain is also logically wrong . 
  catalan culture does not only belong to catalonia . 
  here ` catalan ' does not mean ` from catalonia ' . 
  catalan culture is spread accross spain , france , andorra and italy . 
  you ca n't call andorra 's culture spanish just because most catalan people live in spain . 
  catalonia is a spanish ` region ' but this city is not and calling it spanish is not correct . 
  before anyone has said anything yet there 's already people complaining about catalans getting triggered . 
  no one is getting triggered here but it just does not make a lot of sense to call this city 's culture spanish . 
  yes , catalonia is in spain right now . 
  as such , you could argue that something ` catalan ' can be described as ` spanish ' . 
  saying that l'alguer is the most catalan city in italy does not imply that catalonia is independent , or that the person that is saying it is a supporter of catalan independence . 
  why be ambiguous saying ` the most spanish town ' , and at the same time erase the fact that this is culturally catalan ? 
  a navajo town is american yet you would n't call it ` the most american town ' . 
  a tibetan town in india would not be ` the most chinese town ' . 
  catalan culture is spread accross several states ( france , andorra , spain , italy ) . 
  therefore calling this city ` spanish ' makes as much sense as calling a basque town in france ` spanish ' , just because most basque people happen to live in spain . 
  10/10 i may or may not copy this for ... future reference . 
  ` you just speak a dialect ' . 
  especially with ... basque . 
  bar\u00e7a is the football team . 
  we call the city ` barcelona ' or ` barna ' if you want to be cool . 
  mainly the angles , the saxons , and the normans :p, 
   spain is a great nation , and the spaniards , very spaniard and much spaniard . 
  this will surely resonate through the halls of history for time immemorial . 
  do n't just stare at these times that are coming ; get down to the streets and get involved . 
  they can do nothing against a united , joyful and spirited people . 
  this was a bit hard to translate , if someone has a better idea do post it !, 
  if you want to be technically correct , whom is used for the oblique case , which in english takes the role of the accusative and the dative , although historically they were different ( acc . 
  * hwone * vs. dat . 
  * hw\u0101m * ) . 
  the one major exception is when you 've used * of * and then you have to use the genitive , as in ' a friend of mine ' . 
  why does everyone hate him so much again ?

  pla\u00e7a de les gl\u00f2ries catalanes ( shortened to gl\u00f2ries ) , is a large square in barcelona , first designed by ildefons cerd\u00e0 to serve as the city centre in his original urban plan ( pla cerd\u00e0 ) , but nowadays relegated to quite a secondary position . 
  however , beginning in the early 2000s , and as of 2007 , revamping project for gl\u00f2ries has started , which is aimed to give the square a new role in barcelona and revitalize the northern districts of the city , under the name [ 22@] ( http://www.mustrealty.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/22@-district-barcelona.jpg ) ( innovation district ) . 
  the current transformation of the [ square ] ( http://www.glories.cat/imatges/futur/glories_2017.jpg ) , with underground [ tunnels ] ( http://ajuntament.barcelona.cat/glories/wp-content/uploads/tunelcastillejos.jpg ) for vehicles , will transform it into a green space . 
  in case you wondering , the building on the [ left ] ( http://www.masterdg.net/2014-15/projectesweb/olga-pedreira/img/museu.jpg ) is the [ design museum of barcelona ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/design_museum_of_barcelona ) .

  the number of international association meetings continues to double every ten years : from just under 6,000 in 2006 to over 12,000 in 2016 . 
  newcomers in the top 10 compared to last year are amsterdam ( twelfth last year and now sharing seventh place with madrid ) and seoul ( jumping from 13th to tenth ) . 
  like last year , lisbon is ninth . 
  statistically , barcelona holds at least one congress every 2 days related with the technological or medical sectors , like the esl expo barcelona-gaming experience , the european cardiology congress or the world congress of chemical engineering . 
  notice that this ranking does not include congresses with expositions , like the 4fyn , the mobile world congress barcelona , the automobile barcelona , the barcelona building construmat , the bizbarcelona , the iot solutions world congress barcelona , the barcelona meeting point or the barcelona international boat show .

  i watched both videos , the winning one looks way better !, 
  i 'm sure i will go there when finished !, 
  integrating resort zones with business and residential ones is the best thing to ensure the project can be a success . 
  having just a massive resort and hoping it will be profitable all year long is way too risky . 
  i like it being integrated with the city , instead of building an artificial island some kms away * dubai-style * . 
  even with public transport access !, 
  you 'll be getting a big green lung for all the surrounding areas that look way too dense/over-constructed in the render . 
  when i went to greece a few years ago one thing that shocked me a bit was , without wanting to sound offensive , how * poor * ( * poverty * ) everything looked . 
  projects like this can help the economy a lot !, 
  if everything is well executed , i 'm sure it can be a success . 
  one ca n't find stuff like this in europe , and many people , families and businessmen will prefer going there than a long flight to the caribbean or middle east/asia resorts . 
  that 's the best part xd,

  sometimes it 's just been 5 seconds i have posted and the downvotes are already there ; and a few seconds later spaniards ( and openly anti-catalan ) users like rainymeadow & co comments start to appear . 
  i would like to get more comments from european people , instead of the same spaniards commenting ( and downvoting ) all the time in my posts . 
  but anyway i 'm just gon na keep posting stuff for people interested ,

  the building , which has been designed by the architect \u00cd\u00f1igo am\u00e9zola , will be erected in the barcelona port , in a [ waterfront area ] ( http://www.ara.cat/2015/09/16/ara_mateix/aixi-llevant-projecte-marina-vela_1432066975_24275412_1875x1334.jpg ) that is being developed with luxury hotels and a marina . 
  the museum will have five floors and seven gallery rooms , distributed over 15,000 square meters , and is expected to receive up to 500,000 visitors per year . 
  the developers of the museum -- the designer ujo pallar\u00e9s , from the company cultural development barcelona , and his partner , the russian entrepreneur valery yarovslavski from acceleration group -- will raise a total of $ 38 million from private donors to finance the project . 
  the hermitage barcelona will make use and display of the saint petersburg 's hermitage three-million-item collection .

  nope , nothing at all . 
  it was at night and i was too nervous . 
  i could n't even see his face . 
  i think at that time there was n't that much control on that ; now the situation has improved i believe ( they must have their identification visible and all the stuff ) . 
  of course i was so angry at that moment , but well at least he did n't hurt me . 
  and if you compare it with [ quintana ] ( http://ccaa.elpais.com/ccaa/2016/04/12/catalunya/1460453324_020202.html ) for instance ( the woman that lost an eye because of mossos ) ... 
  why ? 
  it 's fine !, 
  i just was * in the wrong place at the wrong time * . 
  i was school age ( 15 maybe ? ), 
  during fc barcelona celebrations . 
  there 's always some crazy people there . 
  so when the mossos came to charge , people started running and i did n't know what to do ( since i knew i had n't done anything wrong ) , so i was just standing there on the street . 
  then one police came to me and bumped me ( * porrazo * ) , without any reason . 
  it did n't hurt me at all . 
  but i was so scared xd, 
  at least they want to work here xd anyway i do n't think they are that violent . 
  there are exceptions of course , but the most i have encountered i would say they were pretty nice ^ ( except one time that i was beaten by one of them xd ), 
   an officer stationed in catalonia lasts a year , two at the most , and then leaves . 
  they do n't even want to work here anyway we wo n't need them when independent . 
  our catalan police already does almost all the job . 
  o [ aqu\u00ed ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6d1eue/over_60_of_catalans_reject_unilateral_declaration/dhzptso/ ) que defensaves el pa\u00eds quan va publicar una not\u00edcia sobre un escrit que havia estat immediatament desmentit pel govern de catalunya .

   who is us ? 
  i 'm asking it as catalan . 
  us = the catalans . 
  i am a catalan too  the spanish uses the force every day of course . 
  but i do n't think the state is going to us the force against us ( the catalans ) preventing us from voting . 
  if our president holds a referendum , i do n't expect the spanish police destroying the ballot boxes or `` attacking '' the people that want to vote . 
  so your comment '' * every day , in every state in the world , the state uses the force to prevent something * '' i think it was a bit misplaced here .

  `` brutalist style '' xddd you are talking about the ** passion fa\u00e7ade ** ( [ wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sagrada_fam%c3%adlia#passion_fa.c3.a7ade ) )  in contrast to the highly decorated [ nativity fa\u00e7ade ] ( http://estaticos.elperiodico.com/resources/jpg/0/3/lpedragosa32100693-barcelona-2015-fachadas-sagrada-famili151215224345-1450216056630.jpg ) , the [ passion fa\u00e7ade ] ( https://c7.staticflickr.com/8/7373/26947520734_27d2795d3a_b.jpg ) is austere , plain and simple , with ample bare stone , and is carved with harsh straight lines to resemble the bones of a skeleton . 
  dedicated to the passion of christ , the suffering of jesus during his crucifixion , the fa\u00e7ade was intended to portray the sins of man . 
  that 's why !, 
  this is also the [ style ] ( http://www.gestornoticias.com/archivos/religionenlibertad.com/image/subirachs_esculturas.jpg ) of the sculptor josep maria subirachs ( a bit polemic indeed ; for example this '' [ lion ] ( http://i.imgur.com/andy3xk.jpg ) '' located at the passion 's pediment ended up being removed because of the criticism , and they are still working on a new design ) . 
  anyway i like both facades ( i ca n't chose a favorite one ) : passion and nativity . 
  with its unique and different style ; and also purpose ( nativity vs passion ) . 
  in a few years we will have to add the 3rd facade ( [ glory facade ] ( https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3873/14853842327_85339bcc0a_o.png ) ) which will be the biggest and majestic one , since it will be the principal entrance of the whole church . 
  next focus will be connections with india , tokyo and mexico .

  i guess it may be true when you look at the big picture , but day to day stuff became way , way more expensive in matter of weeks . 
  i used to do it to get a feeling of how expensive something was . 
  however now , 12 years later , 60 euros can buy way fewer stuff than 10.000 pesetas used to . 
  edit : actually , a week after having the euro , 60 $ could already buy way fewer stuff than 10.000 pts used to .

  it 's more complicated than that . 
  in my opinion , many spanish have kind of an inferiority complex . 
  in short , the feeling is : * the french do n't like us * . 
  this general attitude means that people will magnify any problem with the french , no matter how small , since it will be seen as part of this imagined long timed hatred . 
  a couple of examples of how ludicrous this can get : in the 90 's , french farmers were on a strike and as protest , they decided to stop spanish trucks carrying vegetables crossing the border and throw away their content on the road . 
  i 'm sure most french people have no idea what i 'm talking about , but every spanish know of this story : `` los franceses nos tiran los tomates ! '', 
  ( they throw away our tomatoes ! ) . 
  another example : many spanish people claim than there is a french saying that goes as follows : * africa starts on the pyrenees * , and that this is common opinion among frenchmen . 
  of course , i 've only ever heard this phrase from fellow spaniards , not even a single time from a french guy . 
  but still , it 's the french .

  cameron was oportunistic and irresponsible . 
  he called the referendum for the exact same reason that may called the election . 
  he thought victory was in the bag , that there was no possibility to lose , and that he would profit from the result politically and economically . 
  he was motivated by greed and power-hungriness , just as may . 
  cameron 's expectation was that remain would win by a short margin , just like all the polls were saying . 
  with that , he expected to discredit ukip and gain its voting base for the conservatives , on the one hand ; and to use the closeness of the vote to blackmail the eu into giving more special privileges to the uk , under the threat that if the eu did n't comply , the uk might call another referendum in the future ( one in which leave would win ) . 
  his resignation was nothing to admire him for . 
  he refused to deal with the mess he created . 
  i swear i sometimes think you are a cni plant to make catalan separatism look like a sack of lunatics .

  this announcement is n't an improvisation , and it being planned for today is n't a coincidence .

  `` old castile '' is how the east half of modern castilla y leon was named in the middle ages . 
  the post is about the medieval walls of a city in what was once old castile .

  that 's simplistic .

  hmmm re-coloring the map made me realize that france and belgium are scale behind spain and the netherlands , or that there were no countries in the middle section , meaning that the most pro-gay marriage country in eastern europe is at least 10 points behind the least pro-gay country in the west . 
  i purposely chose not to use green because of the assumption that green means right and red bad . 
  i chose blue for least and red for most as an analogy to cold and hot . 
  the cross is meant to chastize them for doing a poor colorizing job ( not just for choosing it poorly but for also coloring countries wrongly and making some countries look more like others when they are n't that close ) , but i see how it could be interpreted otherwise . 
  [ map made more understandable with this simple trick ] ( http://i.imgur.com/3ycnjef.png ), 
  because we have this * sambenito * of being religious , so people project what is religious in their own culture unto us and expect us to conform to that . 
  portugal and spain had democracy before they had fascism . 
  is this how you increase ties with the commonwealth ?

  who is going to give 4 + points to spain then ? 
   why i have a feeling that germany is expected to pay for most of the euro-bonds , anti-crisis budgets and unemployment insurances . 
  because germany has profited immensely from the crisis in the rest of the eurozone . 
  well , she 's french . 
  you want britain to leave eurovision ? 
  green = independent celtic peoples according to the map astures , cantabri , and possibly others were celtic but are not shown as celtic here, 
  they forgot to color half of northern spain green . 
  disclaimer : some empires may appear more powerful in this map than they were in reality . 
  actually at this time northern navarre should be part of spain ( well castile really ) not france . 
  charles v abandoned it during the italian wars .

  strong in the stable , lads . 
  it is the political system which is dumb . 
  if trump had run for any other party but the republicans , all while exhibiting the same knowledge , policies and attitude , he would never have been elected . 
   imagine if everyone went `` i do n't want to be forced to pay for public transportation either because i do n't use it '' and so on ... 
  imagine if an american said , `` i do n't want to be forced to pay for the military . '', 
  it 's not about britain . 
  it 's about farage and all the other retards creaming themselves about le pen , wilders , etc being elected and their hated eu disappearing .

  it is futile to discuss this with pro-independence activists . 
  the catalan government declares that catalonia stops being part of spain -  unconstitutional because that would mean this article is violated since la * indisoluble unidad de la naci\u00f3n espa\u00f1ola , patria com\u00fan e indivisible de todos los espa\u00f1oles * would stop being * indisoluble * . 
  i am tired of the mental gymnastics some people are going through to justify their cause . 
  not that their cause is stupid , bad or anything negative , it is just futile to have this conversation since the constitution is very clear about the legality of a referendum in regard to a secession of a part of spain that makes up the nation of spain . 
  so beach in spanish ? 
  lol in spanish `` khaganate '' sounds like take a dump + nate :d, 
  lol paja in spanish means straw . 
  it 's also a slang word for masturbation . 
  were magyars back then part of the khazar khanate ? 
  oh sorry i misunderstood this `` that ca n't wait to express their pen up frustration of independence '' i thought he meant the desire of some catalans to become independent from spain . 
  i am sorry . 
  the other points i made stand still . 
  wait i am trying to point out is that it not only * depends * on being well-educated . 
  where you went to school and the social environment you grew up in are also a big factors in deciding your political positions . 
  heck , for fuck 's sake , most school teachers i 've met where i live atm ( a predominantly valencian speaking area ) are in favor of the `` paisos catalans '' while people out on the streets are completely against that idea . 
  of course , then again , going by that same rule of thumb , would n't `` french '' catalans do the same ? 
  if you point out their fanatic nationalism , you instantly get categorized by them as a bad person/troll . 
  idk why but the most active catalans on reddit are in favor of independence blah blah blah ... and the response i am going to get is `` of course , since there are no catalans in favor of remaining in spain ( and france , for that point ) '' , yeah , bullshit . 
  remember , 45 \u00b0 c over there right now . 
  it 's just a ruse to kill you :d, 
  yes , but your tourists are rude in my personal experience :(, 
  is this even a surprise at this point , to be completely honest ? 
  why ? 
  it 's also the first time she 's kept her mouth shut around people . 
  [ and my favorite meme created with this picture ] ( http://cementeriodemarmotas.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/rajoydedo_independencia-cataluna2.png ) `` new achievement unlocked '' `` flag of the catalan independence movement pops up '', 
  but even more context , seriously . 
  yes , of course , of course , thanks for ignoring us , we the valencians want also to be bound only by madrid and the andalusians would also love that , we 're just irrelevant regions who have always followed behind madrid 's footsteps ... 
  yeah , mostly because i 'm from a small town and if you knew that you could easily identify who i am irl based upon previous comments too in which i tell that for example , one of my parents is from another country ( ukraine ) so i speak russian and a little bit of ukrainian , etc , etc , etc. . . 
  i agree with you . 
  podemos is another topic for another time ( [ this video is pretty much why i do not trust pablo iglesias or his party ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=286-ywqgoau ) ( the hypocrisy is just too much for me , '' incluso que existan los medios privados ataca a la libertad de expresi\u00f3n '' for god 's sake , going by that rule the act of you saying something against the state or even thinking something different from what the party says is a violation of your rights and you must go to prison ) my views on socialism are complicated , but i digress . 
  i am a pragmatist within reason . 
  again , we are not talking about catalan independence , we are talking about that guy . 
  note how i have n't insulted anyone and i 've even acknowledged when i 'm wrong . 
  no , what i mean to say is that there are consequences to becoming an independent country ( leaving the eu , schengen border agreements , rule of law , finance , monetary policy , etc. . . ) that are very difficult topics , and people need to be aware that actions have consequences , like it or not . 
  also , the fact that you will be refusing to be spaniards ( effectively speaking refusing to own the 3rd best passport in the world ) matters a lot for people internationally when travelling or doing business , but we all know that most pro-independence catalans will be citizens of spain as long as it is convenient for them , being hypocritical to their beliefs . 
  when i said quality of life , i meant all of this , sorry i made a mistake by not fully explaining myself . 
  i am a blavero , of course , of course , though i 've never voted for pp in my entire life and i 've always hated them , i am in favor of restructuring of the spanish state , i am in favor of a referendum in catalonia , provided it 's legal and people are fully aware of the consequences of leaving one of the best countries in the world ( we might not be the best , but we have a quality of life many people are jealous of around the world ) , i 've never denied that catalan and valencian are the same language ( you know the joke , qui diu que el valenci\u00e0 i el catal\u00e0 s\u00f3n idiomes diferents no saben parlar ni el valenci\u00e0 ni el catal\u00e0 ) , etc. . . i tu continues diguent-me que s\u00f3c un blaver , per l'amor de d\u00e9u , xe . 
  that comment was n't made about catalonia ( not even by me ! ) . 
  we are talking about how this guy is trying to make redditors identify catalonia as separate from spain by willfully ignoring to do things like i explained before . 
  yes , it is politically motivated based upon * context * , like it or not . 
  if i posted a picture of catalonia and ignored to say catalonia and just said spain when it 's common practice here in spain because of our regionalisms and so on and did that every single time i posted a thread , would n't you think that ? 
  is anything what i 've said objectively wrong ? 
  also , thanks for the [ whataboutism ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/whataboutism ), 
  [ it exists in it 's current form because of it . 
  it has powers to rule alongside ( and limited by ) the government of spain in catalonia because of it . 
  cool , but that is n't a piece of wood per se , 
  the spanish state existed in 1977 and at that moment had sovereignty over the territory of catalonia . 
  so , what do you want to tell me with that fact ? 
  hehe it 's good to change yourself when you are wrong !, 
  hahaha , i 'm also a european federalist ( democratic one , if a country does n't want to integrate to an union you must not make it to ) . 
  you see , i do n't identify with spain per se . 
  it 's all about context . 
  when i have a conversation with someone from catalonia , or andalusia or madrid , i identify first and foremost as a valencian , when it 's with someone from another town from mine or city in the cv , i identify as ( i do not want to disclose my exact location ) and when it 's with someone from another country who does n't know a whole lot about spain , it 's always european and spanish , and so on ... 
  i think that 's the case for most spaniards , especially in comparison to people from other countries , we are more `` local '' ... 
  i hate socialism , podemos and so on ... but to each his own hahahaha ... 
  but obviously here in spain if you say that you are `` clearly a pp member , or a ciudadanos cu\u00f1ao ) but eh ... 
  i identify first and foremost as a pragmatist to be completely honest ... anyways , i should get off reddit ... oh wait 35c outside nevermind :d, 
  the spanish government also existed before the 1978 constitution . 
  should 've made it bigger then !, 
  or even better , make a gigantic one and put it on right under the ceiling of the parliament , so that technically speaking , all diputes are covered with the oak 's `` powers '' :d, 
  what does that cross looking rock symbolize ? 
  ( also lol :d so stereotypical of you basques ! / s ), 
  i always wonder , how the heck do you start a _ physical _ fight in parliament ? 
  hahaha me too , me too . 
  i do n't agree , i think it 's fine how it is right now :d !, 
  i will refer you to this comment i made before in response to op , and tell you that there is always precendent - we are not talking about something that happens once in a while , we are talking about a behavior he has exhibited throughout all of his posts . 
  well , he is not objectively wrong , since 48 % < 50 % . 
  besides , he 's doing that in reference to what happened for example in brexit , in which the uk has been made to leave an union because of a 52 % - 48 % split in a vote , with consequences that so far have yielded a lot of bad problems , meaning that small percentage differences like this can fail to represent democracy properly . 
  in many countries , affairs like these which usually can have a very big influence upon people 's lives are agreed upon reaching a 2/3 or a 75 % approval rate by the people , be it through parliament or legal referendums . 
  also the fanatic part . 
  merriam-webster defines fanatic as `` marked by excessive enthusiasm and often intense uncritical devotion '' , and the rules of / r/europe define that fanatics are not to be allowed . 
  in the specific context / u/ksgrip mentioned *  it is like you need every oportunity to make it seem like it is another country * and a quick browse through your previous posts and comments , it can be concluded that you are indeed , fanatically trying to make it seem like catalonia is another country by not mentioning for example , that catalonia is a region inside spain , contrary to the common practice among redditors in this sub to point out too the country of origin of a post for example when specifically posting something non-political related to that region , like a picture or something like that . 
  okay , not madness , relax , there are different kinds of people in this world . 
  he might just like to defend the independence of catalonia , and that is fine , but he has violated the rules of this subreddit with his behavior in regard to obsesive posting and commenting as i 've explained before . 
  i 've just browsed through his user account again , he does n't call anyone fascist or traitor apparently , so please , restrain yourself from doing those comments . 
  i 'm also tired of _ independ\u00e8ncia !!!, 
  ! _ my biggest problem with the movement ( apart from the use of spain as a scaprgoat ) is that they want to become an independent country , okay , that is fair , but they need to explain how that state is going to be and what are the consequences of creating such a state , such as the potential refusal by spain to allow them into the eu ( i would be against that , on a personal note ) and how they would need to react or other things . 
  it 's just a disaster for them and a for spain ( but to a lesser extent ) . 
  and also , everyone with a rational mind knows that 95 % of the population in the case of catalan independence would n't give up their spanish citizenship , the 3rd best passport in the world for travelling , doing business and such ( spain internationally speaking is not a hated country ) in favor of some `` catalan passport '' which would n't even allow an individual to work in italy . 
  that is why i feel like the independence movement is fake , it 's just about emotions . 
  also , you are not the best politically speaking . 
  posting `` la legi\u00f3n '' when we all spaniards know that part of the army is associated with ultra-catolicism and even fascism makes me not exactly like you . 
  anyways , have a nice day !, 
  i 've heard that concept before but what does it mean ... okay ... let 's see ... [ wikipedia ] ( https://ca.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/blaverisme ) so did i ever tried to point out that catalan and valencian are different languages ? 
  am i a populist ? 
  well that i can agree with , since i would like the cv to have more autonomy from the c. spanish government within reason ... and anticatalism . 
  can you show me how do i hate catalania , a region of spain ? 
  oh wait , just by saying that you automatically become an enemy of catalonia ? 
  well , he is not objectively wrong , since 48 % < 50 % . 
  besides , he 's doing that in reference to what happened for example in brexit , in which the uk has been made to leave an union because of a 52 % - 48 % split in a vote , with consequences that so far have yielded a lot of bad problems , meaning that small percentage differences like this can fail to represent democracy properly .

  yes , yes . 
  aggressive confrontation is definitely the best way to de-escalate the catalan conflict . 
   personally i think a party like podemos which recognises spain as a nation of nations like the uk , and which accepts the right to self-determination , as we have here with scotland ( it was never even in question really ) , is the only way spain will stay united . 
  as it is , i think their inmovilismo only makes it worse . 
  you 're right . 
  sadly , only a minority of spaniards agree with you . 
  whereas brits know the power of pragmatism , there is a lot of * burros * in spain , and that 's always been the main problem in this country . 
   retrospective retrospect, 
  and the biggest of which , including the new president , is right-wing . 
  there 's no way to twist it anymore : cup , just like erc and all pro-independence parties , have conclusively shown they care about independence more than they care about anything else . 
  it really is a fantastic show . 
  whenever you think it 's going to get boring , they manage to come up with a plot twist . 
  you 're right , but the thing is , there are not that many southern europeans ( ca n't speak for eastern europeans ) who are willing to move and settle in germany . 
  while unemployment is still high , the economy is starting to recover and the difference in standard of living is not big enough for a high enough number of people to be willing to leave it all behind and move to another country . 
  i 'm a spaniard living ( and working ) in germany . 
  after 6 years , i think i can say i 'm integrated and feel part of this society , which i sometimes feel i appreciate and cherish more than many old germans . 
  i have a full-time , stable job and live with my german girlfriend . 
  that being said , it was definitely not easy , especially when it comes to learning the language . 
  german is hard , and it takes years to master , much more if you want to achieve a high degree of proficiency and avoid making mistakes . 
  i 'm saying this because if it was hard for me , and i had a university degree and come from a country that is closer in terms of culture , values and religion than syria , iraq , etc. , we should n't get our hopes too high when it comes to the recent wave of refugees . 
  alright then , show me the graph of unemployment in spain since the restoration of democracy . 
  let 's see who 's right . 
  unemployment in spain was at its highest in 1994 ( psoe ) and 2009 ( psoe ) and was reduced during aznar and rajoy 's administrations . 
  are you kidding me ? 
  that graph shows the total number of people within the social security system ( basically equivalent to the number of people working and paying taxes ) , not the percentage of people who are unemployed . 
  while both variables are related , they do n't correlate 1-to-1 with one another , and more importantly , it makes no sense to use the total number of people , given that the population of spain has obviously grown since 1982 . 
  in any case , your graph * still * proves my point . 
  the number of people contributing to the system grew by 2 million during the 14 years of the gonzalez administration ( left-wing ) , and by 5 million under aznar ( right-wing ) , in almost half the time ( 8 years ) . 
  zapatero rode the waves of the aznar administration for a while before making a mess out of it , and ended up right where he started , with no real growth after 7 years . 
  it took another right-wing government to fix that mess . 
  i 've never voted for pp , but facts speak a clear language , in spain and everywhere else : leftist governments are a recipe for mass unemployment and economic stagnation . 
  a spaniard just corrected your german grammar . 
  go sit in the corner and think about that . 
  unemployment in spain has always been at its highest during left-wing governments and been reduced during right-wing governments . 
  the left 's special talent is getting people unemployed . 
  but are n't spaniards and italians also * s\u00fcdlander * for you ? 
   perpetrators look `` southern , arabic '' police said `` from northern africa or the arab area '' . 
  do n't you put this evil on us !, 
  but you did n't need 10 guys for the madrid bombings . 
  they were n't suicide bombers . 
  the only islamist terrorist attack in europe that was deadlier than the paris attacks was carried out with explosives ( madrid 2004 , 192 dead , 1500 injured ) . 
  grammar do n't either . 
  do n't you ? 
  he 's not wrong . 
  in my valencian dialect of catalan , we do n't say * tardor * ( though that 's the standard catalan word ) but * primavera d'hivern * : `` winter spring '' . 
  we are talking about the future of the catalan language . 
  in this context , it seems to me the only reasonable metric we can use is the number of native speakers ( unless the diglossic situation suddenly does a 180 turn , and non-native speakers of catalan start switching from their native spanish to catalan for their everyday interactions , which seems highly improbable ) . 
  and around we go ... 
  i am well aware of the mass migration of southern spaniards to catalonia during franco 's time . 
  that is , indeed , i believe , the major reason behind the decline in native catalan speakers of catalan in catalonia . 
  once again , and this is really the last time : you must know that the 78 % number refers to those who can speak catalan and use it occasionally , not to those who are native speakers of catalan and use it as their preferred language of communication in everyday life . 
  i do n't think you 're stupid enough to not know the difference between speakers of a language , native speakers of a language , and speakers who use that language primarily in everyday life . 
  i 'm forced to conclude that you are purposefully trying to deceive others by taking numbers that show knowledge , proficiency and occasional use of catalan ( 11 million , 78 % of catalans ) and making them pass as the number or percentage of native speakers of catalan , or of people who use catalan primarily in everyday life . 
  and spain . 
  and canada . 
  and south africa . 
  south fucking africa legalised same-sex marriage before any nordic nation did . 
  we 've gone through this over and over again , and your constant confusion of total speakers with percentage of speakers , and percentage of people with knowledge of catalan with * native speakers of catalan * , which is what i was specifically referring to from the get go , as i made very clear , is telling . 
  facts do n't care about an agenda , and the fact that you attempted to equivocate by throwing the 11 million speakers number out there , which you very well know does not represent native speakers , says a lot about who 's being dishonest here . 
  experience shows that would be irrelevant . 
  catalan is the sole official language of andorra , and it 's being displaced there by spanish as well . 
  language is by definition democratic , bottom-up rather than top-down . 
  holy shit , i was in poland earlier this year and i was shocked at how religious people are there . 
  the churches were ** packed ** . 
  excuse me ? 
  we were ahead of all of the nordics . 
  not really . 
  official recognition has greatly expanded . 
  it is most certainly a natural phenomenon of language substitution due to diglossia and other factors . 
  denmark is one such case . 
   nothing . 
  we simply seem okay with the fact that `` marriage '' is supposedly a religious thing and so wo n't force churches to perform that . 
  but this is not about what the church does , but about what the state does . 
  following your line of argument , the state should n't issue marriage licences to divorced people , since the church does n't marry them . 
   it is n't like the partnership is significantly different from the `` real '' marriage at this point . 
  a few changes and updates are still being discussed , but before long , all the rights will be pretty much the same . 
  as you imply , the rights are very much not the same . 
  and even if they were , it would still not be the same in one very fundamental respect : it would not be marriage . 
  separate but equal is not equal . 
  believe you me , they are . 
  i do n't know much about basque or galician , but the percentage of native catalan speakers has been steadily declining for decades . 
  it 's now at 34 % in catalonia and as low as 20 % in valencia . 
  the situation in the balearic islands is a bit better ( about 50 % ) but catalan is also declining there . 
  sources can be found on the catalan language wikipedia article on the catalan language . 
  i hope i 'm wrong , as part of that 20 % of valencians who speak valencian/catalan as their first language , but i 'm convinced the catalan language is doomed to extinction , and will be only residually spoken within 40-50 years . 
  i used to believe an independent catalonia was the only chance to save the language , but i now think it 's too late even for that . 
  assuming psoe does n't change their stance and join `` grand coalition '' with pp ( maybe + ciudadanos ) . 
  and germany . 
  and switzerland . 
  and austria . 
  seriously german-speaking europe , what 's wrong with ze schwulen menschen ? 
  they want to include us valencians and other catalan-speaking areas in a greater catalan state . 
  polonia must have been partying all night . 
  they just got the script written for them . 
  12 hour-long assembly , three votes , ends in a statistically hilarious draw .

  the surrender of breda is my favourite ( do n't tell the dutchies though :p ) .

  you need to live for 10 years in spain to be eligible for citizenship ( 2 years if you 're from a former colony ) .

  it 's true that many people are having very hard times and poverty ( in relative to spanish gdp per capita , which is not low ) it 's high , but that 's inherent to a world-wide/euro economic crisis in more countries .

   living in a mediterranean country can make you hate 3-months 42c summers . 
  in spain you can pick other places where summer temps are much more reasonable without having to leave the country or having to exile to the mountains . 
  in italy i 'd say it 's more or less the same but because of the alps rather than the atlantic , so you 'd have to move to higher ground there i guess :p also the interior of spain and the north ( except basque country maybe ) are not so crowded . 
  actually castille is as densely populated as ...

  no , that 's just because the article is from a british news site . 
  * uh eah uh ah ah ting tang walla walla bing bang do do do do do do do do *, 
  this july has been the worst summer month i 've ever experienced . 
  temperatures have been extremely high for weeks , with only 2-3 days in the entire month of taking a break . 
  it 's been fucking annoying . 
  luckily now we seem to have better temps ( not more than 30\u00ba , or even around 25\u00ba during the day ) with occasional summer thunderstorms that are very welcome . 
  i hope it 's the end of the very high temps and they do n't come back in september before we finally get the so-deserved autumn . 
  the guy just wants to be dramatic from the comfort of his house . 
  cccp, 
  my thought exactly . 
  i do n't consider invasions , conquests or anything like that to be something to be proud of in today 's standards , but it 's great that we are now somewhat recognized for leaving a very strong and huge cultural heritage in the world , with one of the spanish languages ( castillian ) at least . 
  sure there are people from both france and spain going there for that reason , but that 's far from considering andorra a nation of smugglers . 
  i can only speak for andorra : there are a few towns , not just one in andorra . 
  they 're not poor ( higher gdp per capita than france or germany ) , smugglers ? 
  do n't think so . 
  and rednecked ? 
  woot ? 
  it 's a people with a mix of catalan and castilian ethnic groups , with a surprising amount of portuguese , and a minority of french too . 
  but that 's today . 
  in 1950 andorra was probably poor , like spain , but things changed ( like it did in spain ) . 
  because it 's not a joke and just how it is , or what exactly ? 
  he 's * partially * joking about greece being a german vassal , i think . 
  well i 'm talking about the early 1500s , when we still were * en pa\u00f1ales * in america ( they like to call it the americas here so let 's give them that , just do n't tell them we consider it a single continent or their brain will start to hurt ) . 
  in that time catalonia already had a strong textile industry competing with the flemish . 
  i will add something else : the industry that boomed in catalonia ( textile ) boomed because it required a crap-ton of water sources , and the interior of the peninsula was/is quite more dry , and this is one of the reasons as to why the castillian bourgeoisie invested in catalan soil rather than investing in castille itself , leading to obvious economic differences ( catalonia was the `` vanguard '' that competed with the low countries or lombardia ) . 
  it 's interesting to see how this still has consequences up to this day . 
  well it 's difficult to know since we 're just assuming that history did n't happen and it happened something else ... so hey , the `` could be \u00b4 s '' * could * even count barcelona as an hypothetic capital  and yes , the density in the meseta is very low indeed !, 
  but back a few centuries ago it was n't too crazy low compared with the rest of the powers , otherwise we would n't have colonized ( or had been a power at all ) a thing i guess . 
  also , lots of castillians moved to galicia , that was so densely populated for many centuries ( today 's having real demographic problems though ) . 
  also do n't forget madrid ( and also barcelona ) received an influx of people from extremadura and andaluc\u00eda in the 50s , 60s and 70s . 
  it is known . 
  but how does that make madrid different from any other city ? 
  every city has its history , and they do n't rain from the sky suddenly and people say `` oh , let 's settle here , there are some brand new houses , and it 's a big city ! '' . 
  cities are built , all of them , from scratch . 
  i mean , `` madrid , the artificially crated city '' , is literally the subtitle for every other city , in the world . 
  every city is `` created artificially '' , lol . 
  they do n't suddenly plop from thin air . 
  besides , if it was n't madrid , toledo would have remained the capital city and it would have been today 's madrid . 
  just with a much more interesting river rather than the frigging manzanares . 
  oh , and much better downtown probably ( i love toledo 's narrow streets and the mixture of the three main groups that populated our country : christians , jewish and muslims ) . 
   the artificially created city of madrid i did n't know the other cities did `` plop ! '', 
  and appeared back when there was no time , since they 've been there forever . 
  are you sarah palin and this is some sort of pro-creationist argument ? 
  lol, 
  that 's hardly a solution . 
  it 's more like a `` s\u00e1lvese quien pueda '' thing that even has some scary ethnic components of those that use it . 
  i doubt that 's what most spaniards want . 
  yeah , pretty much . 
  the analysis is clear ... but what do we do ? 
  i do n't think tearing apart the country is the solution . 
  i think we need the catalans to make a big change in spain . 
  without them , we 're probably screwed for a few more decades . 
  this actually happened in the big cities . 
  just look at madrid 's local elections : psoe did n't win in a single district . 
  all districts that voted massively to psoe for decades voted for ahora madrid ( podemos + other minor parties ) and psoe happened to be an almost marginal political force there . 
  if you look at towns all around spain this did n't happen . 
  i 'd go as far as to say this is how it has been working always : changes happen first at the big cities , and then spread around the rest of the country . 
  so maybe that 's going to be a trend . 
  30 % of the * census * voted for them , i do n't think we can say spaniard people is pro-pp . 
  and yet they get a super-absolute majority . 
  it 's painful , but i also blame on people that stays in home instead of go voting , damn them . 
  you and me know that ulta-nationalistic independentists do n't recognize those as `` true '' catalans . 
  that 's something foreigners on reddit do n't know , among many other things . 
  they 're good at pushing their agenda though . 
  i 'll give that . 
  this is what happens when you are an ultra-nationalist . 
  you have to say you 're better than the others if you want to keep up the tale , or the idea of independentism through exceptionalism will just vanish . 
   the rest of your post is just a poor tu quoque argument which i 'm going to summarily dismiss . 
  they 're simply facts , you can ignore my comment and focus only on replying whatever you are more interested in but those facts wo n't change at all , even if that 's a poor attitude from your side that i simply also happen to ignore . 
  then that 's not a reason to split a country . 
  did you know that ciu , current party ruler in catalonia is a right-wing party too ? 
  plus they supported the pp government of aznar with their former leader jordi pujol , who by the way is immersed in a corruption scandal , like a big part of pp . 
  everything stays in the house ... 
  there are really not so many differences . 
  the thing with the pp it 's not an ethnic issue . 
  it 's a half spain vs half spain thing , like it has always been . 
  catalans are no superior beings that deserve to be free from those pesky spaniards . 
  catalans are just as plural and diverse than the rest of spanish nations and regions . 
  catalan , i like to speak it in madrid if i have the chance . 
  that 's stupid , i 'm left-wing leaning and 100 % republican , the flag of spain represents more than right-wingers and conservatives , it 's the flag of spain for many centuries . 
  it was franco that used it and changed the coat of arms . 
  i do n't care what others think when i 'm wearing its flair to be honest , the current rojigualda is perfectly fine , even when we become monarch-free . 
  i 'm sorry , you mean olivenza ? 
  ohh , just ask them but they probably will not understand you . 
  i laughed too loud, 
  that sound quality made me get a bull to kill myself though . 
  abolition now . 
  go to spain then .

  religion permeates everything in the islamic society . 
  its their flag and a form of natiolanism . 
  would it be any difference if they were killing in the name of a country or association of countries , or on the name of any social ideology like comunism or fascism ? 
  religion controls everything for them and thus everything is made in the name of religion , but their rulers , as rulers everywhere have very down to earth objectives . 
  asian immigrants dont even try to integrate wherever they go and they dont go around blowing themselves . 
  there are open war fronts ( of real war ) against islamic countries and a lot of geopolitical and economical stuff going on ( espheres of influences , the control for resources , greedy politicians ) those are the causes of terrorism not lack of culture assimilation . 
  i believe fanatics and radicals are only a tool in all this mess . 
  islam used terrorist attacks since the middle age . 
  once they got expelled from spain the ottomans used armies of pirates to raid the coasts as a way to take revenge . 
  they did it for profit mosty , but all was under orders of sultans and the flag of islam . 
  i think islamic groups are using sect brain washing tactics to lure marginal people without nothing to lose and resentful with society . 
  the higher ups probably dont give two shits about these new recruits but they are useful since they have freedom of movement inside and out of europe and they are expendable in case they are caught ( or being convinced to blow themselves ) i guess thats what we got as a reward for allowing marginal ghettos to exist on modern nations . 
  irak , that paradise after you went there . 
  or afganistan , lovely place for a quiet weekend on the mountains . 
  libya is lovely in the summer too , aint it ? 
  well , i cant really say . 
  i just heard the controls at the airport were more strict than in other places . 
  guess not , after all . 
  of course we should check people , but lets not start thinking that every poor refugee from syria who is trying to escape a warzone is a terrorist . 
  i can even bet that whoever did this attack on brussels has been stablished on europe since years ago . 
  isis sending terrorists among the migrants is a possibility , yes . 
  but the sad fact is that terrorists attacks on france and years ago on spain were done by people who who had all their documents in order and in most cases were even born in europe . 
  blaming people who are trying to run precisely from the madness of isis because their country is at war is not going to help the issue . 
  sure , just dont mind the fact that the latest france terrorist attack was done by some natural born french citizens . 
  just blame immigrants if that helps you sleep better at night . 
  and brussels security was among the strongest in europe , scary thought that . 
  europe should seriously reconsider its policies with islamic countries so the civil population stops paying the price . 
  i think i 'll pass on that one , if you dont mind . 
  is that even a thing ? 
  as a galician i 'll tell you that , from my point of view , the language is already dying . 
  i speak it all days and love it but i think that in 50 years only old people would know about it . 
  most parents only teach spanish to their kids , there is barely interesting media in the language for the young and in some of the big cities you are still looked like a weirdo if you talk it in public . 
  anyone who does business in spain knows basic english ( or has employees who do ) and its not like there is a booming economy over here to consider it a wise work choice . 
  chinese . 
  when you see businessmen sending their seven year old kids to chinese class you know thats where the money is going to be . 
  well , i dont know how people behave on every region of spain but its the usual thing in the northern regions . 
  you get the odd rude costumer and i counter being extra polite so they feel like the little pricks they are . 
  madrid people , just like parisians , are famous for their arrogance . 
  i own a store and can tell you that its rare that someone doesnt greet you or says thank you after the transaction . 
  its also normal in spain for educated people , dont let those assholes without education let you think otherwise . 
  i always thought that extremely clean big cities are a syntom of social oc disorder . 
  millions of people being polite , civic and considerate is never a good sign , they are probably plotting a war or mass genocide . 
  you could always sell opium as the new cannabis . 
  retro is so fashionable !, 
  in north spain cities smell like chems mixed with rancid water and villages smell like there is cow shit in the air ( which in some cases is the truth , dont ask ) beyond the filthy grasp of mankind ( drive your car in any direction for half an hour ) it smells of clean air and wet grass . 
  you are right , we could let the germans built some of their renowned camps and let the refugees rot in there but that would be unethical . 
  so for some millions europe is letting turkey be the unethical one since they seem to care a lot less for human rights anyway . 
  and turkey is really going to do it ? 
  or would it keep asking for more money every year ? 
  the daylight saving times are a complete disaster on the northwest regions of the country . 
  we expend most of the winter in the dark after 7pm and there are lots of wasted light hours on the summer . 
  not to mention that it mess my sleeping habits . 
  the fuck , marx was an economist and even liberal authors recognice his analytical value ( even when dont agree with his conclusions ) the mein kampf was only propaganda . 
  well , you wouldnt like to know how many retards still prefer life under franco over here . 
  at that point you needed a monster to fight another monster . 
  all in all it could have ended worse . 
  saints in galicia are in most cases made up names from the church to christianize pagan spirits and folklore , thats why there are so many . 
  the situation was the same as libya , the civil war was induced by economical interests of the us , europe , turkey and russia . 
  most of the refugees asking for asylum are from syria though . 
  the refugee crisis has an easy solution : stop creating wars in the middle east . 
  it seems a sensible topic for him , better dont bring it out . 
  in the 90s i think there was in the people a ting of pride of being european . 
  nationalism in spain is often associated to extreme far right individuals ( or old school fascists ) , being anything else was a breath of fresh air . 
  but in restrospect i think that was just marketing so the economical transition could go smoothly . 
  i still see many differences between our countries , and too much bad blood to talk about a true european nation . 
  but maybe thats not such a bad thing because rarely good things come out of too much nationalism and patriotic fervor . 
  maybe the issue is about british beer not qualifying as a drink :p, 
  also if the russian war industry were to be reignited they could flatten europe in a matter of years . 
  only the us would be able to keep them in check . 
  have the french won a war in the last centuries ? 
  i doubt any army on europe rivals russia 's . 
  and that percentage is total bullshit . 
  no way 1 out of 5 people talk english here . 
  reading and writing , yeah sure , but talking ? 
  simply no way . 
  so someone paid these north africans to tarnish the syrian refugees ' reputation and force germany to close its borders ? 
  i think the germans plan to add them to their working force ( teaching them the language and giving formation cycles ) its a long term thing . 
  also i read that germany was hand picking the refugees that were entering the country and they were choosing the ones with working experience and studies . 
  edit : its a good plan for them if it works , they would get almost slave like forces that would only work for minimum wages , they would owe the estate for everything and cant move outside ( neither come back to syria or move to another country in europe because no one wants them ), 
  cheap manpower maybe ? 
  economical interest over the war at sirya ? 
  what you define is exactly what i read it happened . 
  a thousand men took over a huge area , splitted in organized groups and started the assaults . 
  it was something organized , not 100 drunken guys that decided to start raping women . 
  and the swiss banks with all his gold wouldnt be very happy . 
  on new years eve police everywhere was alert in case of terrorist attack . 
  they saw hundreds of inmigrants banding together and didnt react ? 
  i find it hard to believe . 
  it gives more value to the independence movement . 
  it was certainly losing credibility with artur mas refusing to step away . 
  i assure you police forces on europe know how to be brutal . 
  not trigger happy like in the us , but they dont hesitate to crack skulls when ordered to . 
  surprisingly they didnt do a thing this time . 
  if i were a war refugee i wouldnt dream of commiting a crime or even making a fuss on a country that accepted me ( and when most of the population dont even want me there in the first place ) this seems staggered to give syrian refugees a bad name . 
  also i thought germany police force was well organized , they surely have riot control units , dont they ? 
  nah , being a tax haven is switzerland best defense . 
  every other european country wants for it to remain as it is . 
  erdogan certainly bite more that he can swallow . 
  man you sound sore . 
  i have never found anyone here who would talk bad about portugal ( or talk much about portugal at all ) we are all owned by the banks now , so dont fret over what happened centuries ago .

  barcelona could declare itself a nation if most of their citizens felt like it and there were reasons for it , but it 's not gon na happen any time soon . 
  there 's no loop . 
  i 've had this argument before : ` but then my building can declare itself independent !!!!, 
  ! 11 ' you know very well the difference between those cases , let 's not even discuss it . 
  the people of that nation . 
  and your beloved constitution , i believe it says something about it too , look it up . 
  and the estatut . 
  no problem , but now it 's time to pay it back !!, 
  all courses in the main universities in catalonia are in catalan though , although if a lot of students and the professor reach an agreement i guess that sometimes they can be unofficially made in spanish . 
  most of college students are catalan speakers though , the demographics are skewed . 
  there are already thousands of courses in spanish all over the world , that 's why we defend our right to have an upper education in our language . 
  if you exclude catalan from university ( even if it 's only ` partially ' ) , it starts becoing a ` language of the street ' , only useful to gossip with your friends and buy potatoes . 
  a normalized language has a presence in all layers of society , from government , law and culture to dirty jokes with your friends . 
  i agree to some extent , but it 's very hard for me . 
  look at the downvotes in this thread , i 've received more than 50 already . 
  that 's the internet version of the daily reality . 
  we 're tired , of being mocked by spain , of being disrespected , of being told ` speak spanish to me ' , of they trying to constantly downplay the role of our language , even saying that ` we only speak it to bother them ' . 
  and now we have to respect spanish speakers in catalonia . 
  i am not asking for repression or anything , but it 's hard to treat these people with respect and understanding after having seen their attitudes . 
  perhaps in an independent catalonia the attitudes towards language would change . 
  i do n't know . 
  i know that it is mostly here to stay . 
  it is a difficult situation . 
  it 's like an invading army occupied a territory . 
  now their children and grandchildren live there . 
  you ca n't blame them for being there , since it was not chosen by them . 
  the same happens with spanish . 
  alright , it 's now spoken in the catalan countries ( remember that the situation in the balears and especially valencia is far , far worse ) . 
  we did not ask for that , it was forced upon us by the state and brought here by the immigrants . 
  now it 's here , so we ca n't and wo n't expel nor repress spanish . 
  i just want to make sure that catalan is never replaced by it . 
  i do n't like utilitarian views such as ` but there are languages that may be more useful ' , since they are mostly very reductionist . 
  i 've met people that are more radical and simply want to eradicate spanish from the catalan countries . 
  i was seduced by those ideas once , but now i 'm trying to find a compromise position , although as you can see , it 's very difficult . 
  i want to get rid of the preponderance of spanish in its official use , and encourage the use of catalan in informal and formal settings . 
  there are people that would like to get rid of spanish . 
  i do n't care about spanish or other languages in catalonia as long as they are not imposed upon us and catalan is not threatened . 
  we do blame him , of course , him and all the unwanted bourbon kings that still ` represent ' us without anyone having voted for them . 
  for everything ? 
  at least , most of the blame for the current situation can be attributed to the spanish government . 
  who was it that took down the estatut in 2006 ? 
  who has been denying to discuss the current issues with catalonia ? 
  you tell me ... 
  remember that , first of all , the main reason for getting independence is self-determination , it 's not irrelevant . 
  other than that , the linguistic question is difficult and there are different opinions . 
  my personal view , shared by many , is that spanish is an imposed language and i would n't like to see it used more than catalan in an independent catalonia . 
  however , since there are so many spanish speakers now here , i would n't go the same way the spanish did and forbid spanish . 
  but i would certainly promote catalan , as in , making it the primary/only language of government , making sure that movies/tv are translated to catalan , and labels , etc. 
  i would have catalan as the only official language , with spanish being protected and maybe having some administrative facilities where you could use it , in places where there are a lot of speakers . 
  but this is not the official position of the catalan government , who has stated that spanish will also be official . 
  i would not forbid the teaching of spanish , but i but of course prioritise english and catalan ; then , you can learn spanish , french , or any other language . 
  but we do n't need to impose the learning of spanish to everyone . 
  in the same light , i would not forbid spanish in the public sector , but i would have as the only linguistic requisite that you know catalan to be employed by the state . 
  those are my views though . 
  we would at last have a state where catalan is an official language ( there 's andorra , but it 's very small and has little political influence ) . 
  it could be used in europe , and it would not be up to spain to legislate on its use . 
  a catalan state would promote catalan culture and language , inside and outside europe , and it would stop being considered a ` regional ' language . 
  it is quite a change . 
  barcelona is nonetheless the most visited city in the iberian peninsula . 
  personally , it 's one of my favorite cities in the world , but that 's just my irrelevant personal opinion . 
   also , having been to both madrid and barcelona , i 'd take madrid any day of the week . 
  that 's just a personal opinion , not an argument . 
  during the dictatorship ( and several hundreds of years before ) , catalan was forbidden : to speak it in the streets , to teach it , to write it , to read it . 
  nowadays it 's more of a soft imposition , leaving it to a role of a ` co-official regional language ' , and with the castilian spanish knowing that they wo n't have to bother learning another language since all catalan , basque and galician speakers have been taught spanish for years in school . 
  it is as well forbidden to speak it in the parliament or in european organisations , and spain is constantly trying to change the catalan educational laws so that more spanish is taught and spoken at school , even against the will of parents , students and teachers . 
  and ? 
  most of what canada produces is bought by the usa . 
  i dont ' see the problem there . 
  it depends on what you mean by becoming another austria , but of course it will become like austria as in we will be an independent country . 
  language is a huge part of our culture , and we want to preserve it as much as possible . 
  if catalan use is reduced nowadays , it 's not because its speakers have naturally accepted to speak another language , but because of forced imposition by the spanish state . 
  if in the future , we all end up speaking english , let it be because of a natural choice , and not by imposition . 
  of course , each case is particular in their own . 
  however , they all share something in common : a group of people that do not want to be ruled by someone else unwillingly . 
  we do n't need to be enslaved by the spanish to want to have our own state . 
  there have been peaceful separations like in slovakia-czech republic , or norway-sweden , but you did n't mention those in your reply . 
  the political divide between spain and catalonia is quite large , with the spanish government party ( that holds an absolute majority of seats in the spanish parliament ) is only the 5th party in catalonia . 
  and why are catalan parties nationalist by definition ? 
  what about spanish parties ? 
  ciutadans is very nationalistic , but spanish instead of catalan . 
  i do n't think my language is special , but i do know that is is not liked in spain , and that spain has tried to eliminate and limit it for decades and centuries . 
  can you refute that ? 
  it is not tribalist to want your own state . 
  that argument of yours is really wrong when applied to our current situation . 
  catalonia is not trying to go back to the middle ages , we just want our own country and to govern and represent ourselves internationally . 
  is ireland in the middle ages for not being a part of the uk ? 
  is slovakia in the middle ages ? 
  hungary ? 
  norway ? 
  iceland ? 
  well , i hope that they do n't start acting that way then , you ca n't stop the will of milions of citizens because of silly things like that . 
  again , we will see it in the next elections . 
  if catalan society is fractured , it 's because of the spanish state 's actions , it 's not ` the fault of mas ' like many people enjoy to say . 
  first of all , there are already people that do that , but they are a tiny minority . 
  that proves that most people want to live under a state that respects them , and at the same time , they respect the state 's rules and laws . 
  a citizen of catalonia is someone who holds catalan citizenship . 
  since we are n't independent yet , it 's more difficult to measure . 
  right now , people that are registered to live and pay taxes here and are able to vote are considered citizens , i guess . 
  a galician does n't have the same rights in catalonia because they do not fulfill these requirements . 
  let 's hope not , we are not children .

  besides more and more of us think we want simply different things compared to the spanish ( we do n't want to live under a monarchy anymore ) . 
   some polls have showed a plurality of catalans being for independence , and even then not all of them ( and only in recent years ) . 
  we have a majority in the catalan parliament in favour of independence , 48 % voted so in the last election . 
  if there were a vote tomorrow , independence would win . 
  you can stay on your cloud if you like but more and more join us everyday . 
  the pp is an independentista making machine , even those who are opposed to independence here recognise that . 
  you are laughing at us . 
  that is only slightly offensive but ok . you are welcome to come to the diada next month and see over 2 million people in the streets of barcelona demanding independence . 
  then we will see who is laughing . 
  the only people who should be being laughed at is the spanish government and those who think they can keep us in spain against our will . 
  how so ? 
  that is barcelona , the slogans are in catalan . 
  to describe us as spanish is pushing it to say the least . 
  we are only technically spanish . 
  i , for one , ca n't wait to burn my spanish passport . 
  hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha ( * gathers breath * ) hahahahahahahahahahahaha !!!, 
  that 's so funny because there are people here of different ideologoies in favour of independence . 
  who cares if there are marxists ? 
  it makes no difference whatsoever . 
  god , the level of ignorance about what is going on here is astounding . 
  absolutely unbelievable . 
  we live in a state we do n't want to be in and are not free to leave . 
  in fact the vast majority of catalans want to leave but are not allowed to . 
  that 's how we are not free . 
   heavily devolved government . 
  that 's nonsense . 
  cantons in switzerland or german states have more autonomy than us . 
  we wanted more autonomy and that was completely rejected . 
  so we are left with no choice but independence . 
  then there is the fact that spanish people really , really , really do n't like us or our traditions . 
  are you even aware that anti-catalanism exists ? 
  that looks terrible . 
  my thoughts with the victims . 
  we did a [ similar thing ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/catalan_way ) here in catalonia . 
  we will be free soon like the baltics . 
  well done to the police . 
  he 's lucky he did n't hurt anybody while driving , or himself . 
  i read the article . 
  i am afraid we will wake up one day to learn that murray or nawaz has been killed , just like theo van gough or the people at charlie hebdo . 
  because there really is a violent intolerance at play here that too many people shut their eyes to . 
  the guardian has also published many articles criticising the prevent strategy . 
  for many people ( particularly on the left ) , the only issue appears to be western foreign policy . 
  somehow these people would be tolerant of jews , blasphemy , gays and apostates if we changed our foreign policy . 
  the chief rabbi of strasbourg is claiming the assailant attacked a jewish man in 2010 ( see the figaro article about this ) . 
  he apparently believes jewish people are some kind of plot against him . 
  but remember now , it 's not anti-semitism just mental illness at work . 
  shouting : admiral akbar . 
  what do you do for your st. stephen 's day ? 
  the hungarians are celebrating a different st. stephen , the founder of their country . 
  the st. stephen 's day we celebrate is for the early christian martyr . 
  except northern catalonia is not included . 
  the people smugglers must have been passing around the eu flags/photos of angela merkel in order to draw our sympathy and let them through . 
  because the more that managed to get through it to germany , the more money they made . 
  i imagine the people smugglers must love merkel . 
  her policy meant that 2015 was a great year for them and they all must be living it up now . 
  i remember reading an article in french about algerians who were trying to make it to france but had got stuck in greece . 
  when asked how they survived over there without work they answered , `` we have no choice . 
  we steal . / * on n ' a pas de choix . 
  on vole . 
  * '' that is wrong on many levels but the fact that they thought that was acceptable , or that europe should still let them in after doing that , says a lot about them . 
  yes , the guardian is so committed to multiculturalism that they do n't want to hear about the serious intolerance from muslims in the uk and they hate maajid nawaz for pointing that out . 
  the intolerance is , however , very real . 
  for example , when nawaz tweeted some jesus and muhammad cartoons , he received death threats . 
  [ there are still a lot of people who support her ] ( http://www.ibtimes.com/german-chancellor-angela-merkel-poll-support-drops-amid-refugee-crisis-2367038 ) ( about 36 percent ) . 
  even though it seems the majority have turned against her , that is still a lot of people . 
  i 've come across germans who are quite liberal ( who voted for parties other than the cdu in the past ) yet who fully support her refugee policy . 
  i had a german lady who was very pro-migration tell me recently , `` can you imagine what would have happened if germany had n't taken 1 million refugees ? '', 
  i did n't tell her this but of course i could . 
  that decision has already had serious consequences for germany and europe as a whole . 
  remember now ... post-brexit is supposed to look [ like this . 
  ] ( https://youtu.be/yiyq5xmw98i ), 
  both camps kind of made is seem that everything was supposed to change the next day . 
  farage calling it independence day etc. 
  puigdemont is not me but rather is my hero . 
  if spain/italy/whatever returned to the currency it had before , it would be a big blow to the economy as it 'd effectively be a devaluation . 
  however , it 's also make it cheap to export or visit there which would help with the economic recovery . 
  the big problem is with the existing debt denominated in euros , often owed to northern european countries or banks . 
  a weaker currency would make it much harder for spain/italy/whatever to make repayments in euros . 
  to make matters worse , the existing debt is huge at over 100 percent of spanish gdp and 130 percent of italian gdp . 
  we did a [ similar thing ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/catalan_way ) here in catalonia . 
  we will be free soon like the baltics . 
  there was a similar story with the irish in america with regards religiosity and nationalism . 
  the ira and sinn f\u00e9in ( for a long time considered extremists ) received a lot of vital support from irish americans . 
  i agree . 
  as maajid nawaz ( who is a muslim ) put it : `` it 's simply a measurable , quantifiable fact that we get more outraged by cartoons than by medieval barbarity in our religion 's name . '', 
  the guardian hates nawaz though and has published many articles attacking him . 
  at the same time they have published favourable articles both about and by people from hizb-ut-tahrir !, 
  out of curiosity , how common are burkinis in swimming areas in your country ? 
  you make a good point . 
  i 'd upvote you but your flair says you 're spanish , so i ca n't . 
  sorry , i was away and did n't see your message before . 
  maybe i should have removed this as you already shared the same thing . 
  if he had voted leave , would this be such an issue ? 
  would his position be untenable as he had breached his impartiality ? 
  am i supposed to be impressed by all these posts about protests in romania ? 
  these numbers and protests are rather pathetic [ compared to ours . 
  ] ( http://www.barcelonas.com/images/section-of-v-of-la-diada-2014.jpg ), 
   of course nothing like what 's happened in europe hey , we are in europe too !, 
   but i know what you mean . 
  yeah , we are working on that .

  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/invasion_of_portugal_ ( 1807 ), 
  a federal iberan union can be the answer to everything . 
  that actually happened with napoleon . 
  catalunya was merged into france , and portugal was given to spain . 
  as someone from spain ( iberia ) , i would like the union . 
  portugal has in common with the rest of iberian territories as many things as some of the spanish parts have betweem them . 
  i would be perfect in order to move forward as an iberian federation . 
  also , as someone from catalunya who is constantly fighting with madrid , it 'd be very good to have another powerhouse to the west . 
  yes they are . 
  places for kindergardens are very limited though , and they are usually given based on money . 
  public schools have more places , the problem with public schools is that a lot of them have high demand , and they are given those ones to people in `` need '' . 
  then everyone who hasnt be assigned a public school is given one in a free slot . 
  so usually middle class are given shite schools far away from their houses . 
  this makes people go for a private school ( or concertado ) nearer their house which is giving more quality ( in theory ) . 
  what i mean by good and bad schools is usually about the services offered . 
  like swimming pool , gym , music class , ... and also `` bad '' public schools are filled with inmigrants who can not speak the language , so your kid instead of learning maths will be sitting there while the teacher tries to explain basic concepts to a foreign student . 
  a private kindergarden will cost you between 300 and 500 euros a month . 
  it is good . 
  germany put eu money given to spain ( as many other countries ) to develop themselves . 
  spain built a lot of fields and green houses to grow fruits and vegs to be sold to eu . 
  i agree with you . 
  i know a case of a family , i think they are the 2 parents and 3 kids . 
  the mum does n't work . 
  with only the salary from the dad they are under some threshold , so they get school / kindergarden for free , plus some other benefits i do n't really know . 
  if the mum worked , they would be above that threshold , so they would lose a lot of those benefits , plus paying for schools , plus someone to take care of the kids , ... making some numbers the best for them is just to keep the mum unemployed ( she is not getting paro ) . 
  that 's the best thing for that family , but it is not the best for the country . 
  i can also speak about the butcher below my house who has n't make a receipt in his life . 
  same for plenty of pubs and bars . 
  we really need to fight all these things . 
  it also does n't include the nearly 2 million people who went to some other countr to work , but who would return to spain asap if they could . 
  it is easy to reduce the unemployment numbers when people is directly leaving the country, 
  this is beause spain is part of the eu , so there are no fees to sell that food in germany . 
  there are quotas of products , and as long as a european country can fill a quota , you wo n't buy things from the outside . 
  germany has `` invested '' a lot of money in making spain the farm from europe . 
  you get fresh product almost the next day and at a very competitive prices . 
  also , the people working on those fields got a fair salary . 
  and everything used from soil to seeds was up to eu standards . 
  green houses camps are the only man made structure you can see from space . 
   the reason is that you get all the tourists from islamic countries and also from greece and so on . 
  a part fears terrorism . 
  and another part fears that they have to share their beaches and bitches in greece with all the refugees . 
    so i do n't think this will help spain for a long time . 
  would be nice , anyhow . 
  spain really deserves a good solution for all this problems . 
  i disagree . 
  the tourism is going up every year . 
  although there is an obvious point where it will just stop . 
  in my city , barcelona , now a lot of people are coming from usa , china and russia . 
  this people did n't use to come here as much before . 
  and this people did n't use to go to islamic countries . 
  it is more related with the price of flights going down . 
  nowadays if you are smart you can get a flight from europe to usa for like 300 euros . 
  years ago this would rarely go below the 800 euros . 
  the same is happening with cruises around the mediterranean . 
  they used to be a luxury , but not anymore , because there are a lot of them , so you can get them for cheap . 
  so basically , the price of tourism has gone down a lot for international tourism . 
  i agree with you , but in my opinion the main problem of spain is the corruption . 
  once we get the systems to fight against it , we can be good again . 
  meanwhile , each month or every 2 months we get some huge scandal . 
  the problem is more about political parties getting total power for 4 years , and as / u/lupinechemist said , changing everything to their own way . 
  it makes everything more unstable than anything . 
  minority governments implement changes is a slower pace , and this is much better . 
  me too . 
  but he is draining the pension funds . 
  that is the only reason we did n't ask for a bailout , because we had the cash . 
  yes . 
  tourism related jobs . 
  but best june in 10 years, 
  sadly we will get the same government . 
  this next 4 years can be brutal because we are likely to run out of ss money , so the debt will be crazy , we will need a bailout or we will default, 
  podemos voters cared about brexit . 
  every party has a set of hardcore fans who will vote regardless whatever happens ( like pp in catalunya even when they said they would destroy the catalan nhs ) . 
  there is also a hardcore group of fans of podemos . 
  but there is also another big group that can vote for podemos , psoe or even c 's . 
  i know quite a lot of people who used to vote psoe and now they are voting c 's or podemos . 
  the media portrays c 's as right , but in the street a lot of people sees them as centre , even centre-left . 
  yes , unidos podemos . 
  all the polls thought they would be in second place with more seats . 
  even the exit poll which is usually very accurate gave 120 to pp and 93 to podemos . 
  then pp got 137 and podemos got 71 . 
  there are several reasons why this happened . 
  brexit is one of them . 
  people prefered to go for the established party . 
   is brexit even being covered by austrian media ? 
  it is covered everywhere in europe, 
  in spain this sunday in our ge , brexit `` hurt '' our moderate * eu sceptic left party . 
  they lost 1 million of votes , and some people say one of the causes was `` brexit '' * moderate only in their eu scpecticism . 
  they are a left party , but their stance about the eu is not 100 % clear . 
  galicia is more spanish than most spain, 
   illegal immigration problem is migration from east to west europe . 
  basically from the last 10 countries that joined eu, 
  why ? 
  places like vilaweb are very dangerous , because they are left liberal places ( i consider myself a left / social / liberal ... / i have always voted for left parties ) . 
  the fact that they have a political aligment similar to ours makes us blind to the fact that they are a cesspit . 
  the_donald is in the other side of the spectrum , so we are already ready to dislike it , but with vilaweb , they upload a lot of content that makes you think `` oh this is really cool '' , but then you check a bit more or read other sources and you are like `` oh wait '' . 
  similar things can be said about the guardian . 
  the main different is that the guardian has good journalists , although some other are just the left version of your average the_donald redditor . 
  that 's why the guardian is very dangerous ... you have excellent columns mixed with horse shit , and you might eat it all at the same time . 
  vilaweb follows a similar rule , with the different that for each good column they have 9 which are horrible echochamber . 
  i 'd say worse .

  but the thing is about worst locations . 
  also i live in one of those shitty neighbourhoods as well , in the suburban area . 
  well , they 're far from being ghettos . 
  they are simply home for mostly mid-low to low income workers ... let 's not criminalize them just for not living in beautiful and expensive urbanizaciones around the north of madrid that are for richer people , for example . 
   prague has an ongoing problem of pickpocketing welcome to every other major city . 
  this is a problem in each and every one of them i 'd say . 
  at least true for madrid and barcelona . 
  we might be one of the safest countries on earth , still there are problems with this stuff for tourists that seem not to care about their belongings . 
  actually , linguistic unity was and is achieved ( ie all spaniards speak spanish ) , just that those languages lived on . 
  i 'd say that 's even better considering language unity was achieved as well . 
  i understand that but the damage is already done while the irish economy is the only one that 's been profiting from its own tricks . 
  what i do n't understand is , why the hell do n't we have a fiscal union already , as to avoid this kind of ... unloyal policies . 
  yeah , nearly-tax-heaven low corporate tax really helps making those big-ass us companies not paying a single cent in your country partners ... 
  finland is my paradise ... 
  i 'm truly in the wrong country for my personality lol . 
  a finn would die super-quick in spain with all those strangers looking at them , talking at them ... and even touching !, 
  on a daily basis . 
  they 're quite special creatures and must be treated carefully . 
  this is what the extreme right-wing in spain spits all the time . 
  do n't fall for this , / r/europe, 
  yep , here in this side of la raya galicia is struggling with floodings and a really bad sea . 
  we are not in 1970 . 
  this is not the truth anymore . 
  spanish is a prestige language in the us and being picked more often through northern europe . 
  i am sure he does n't . 
  lol . 
  that 's us . 
  all the time . 
  he could have went for spanish just for usefulness , it would cover way much more people and nations in the world . 
  holy shit i thought you guys did n't know that . 
  i mean , there 's even people in spain that totally ignore this fact . 
  i have so much work that i do n't even have time to say more . 
  [ this was me last week ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3ze6xb/monday_moaning_thread/cylep1y ) :(, 
  funny example . 
  in zamora the ruling party is iu . 
  yes , you live in another planet , lol . 
  nice , where you going ? 
  remember not to drink tap water . 
  and take pictures !, 
  madrid is not the popular party as long as barcelona is not convergence/together for yes . 
  no one talks about `` barcelona '' when refering to the generalitat , so why would you talk about `` madrid '' when refering to the spanish gov ? 
  double standards . 
  anyway , i do n't care about pp , they lost their absolute majority and ca n't even form a government ... we do n't even know if they 're going to rule ( it 's very difficult ... * todo esto * ) . 
  but this political movement from the independentists can force a pp-psoe or pp-c 's + psoe abstain pact . 
  unilateral independence can be declared . 
  but that does n't mean that it works . 
  it wo n't . 
  it literally is like that . 
  not only that : but they literally cede 2 deputies to together for yes permanently and assume that `` it 's their fault '' all this drama lol . 
  no , this does n't make catalonia more prone to obtain unilateral independence . 
  it was never going to happen with the current spain . 
  maybe if we were still a dictatorship , isolated , not in the eu ... etc. 
  but that 's no the case anymore , so catalan indepedentists are too optimistic if they think they can obtain a unilateral independence in the core of the eu ( spain is the 4th largest economy in the eurozone ) . 
  this `` process '' can be a huge pressure for a referendum ... which should be good since it can be lost by independentists easily . 
  but not unilateral independence . 
  edit : heh , getting downvoted by sectarian indepes means a lot to me , thanks guys :d, 
  dat madrid 's 2017 worldpride vid got me hyped . 
  again ??? 
  lucky them , i have to go to work this friday !, 
  how do you know i will still be on holiday until friday !?!??!!, 
  i 'm still on holidays !!!!!!, 
  yes , you can downvote me !!!!, 
  it 's not surprising and you should know it : the most fiercely nationalistic people in spain is usually the left ( check : izquierda abertzale , bng , erc , cup ... ) etc. 
  obviously you have right-wing parties that are nationalistic as well ( ahem , pp , lol ) , but ... really , i will never understand those that claim to be left-leaning but completely refuse to be part of a common project putting the argument of `` too much solidarity '' or even `` stealing us '' ( when it 's not ) ... that 's not socialist/left-leaning at all . 
  it 's just the argument of people like the lega nord or the far right wing independentists in flanders . 
  and i 'm very left-wing myself , just not from izquierda castellana because i hate nationalism for being incredibly irrational , like following a religion, 
   i guess that 's what happens when someone does what they said they 'd do in this country . 
  i guess you mean spain , because well ... it 's the same shit . 
  and yes , i wish cup received more votes just for their coherence . 
  italy and spain share more than just their latin roots , they 're basically a copy of eachother even in this xd, 
  so jelly . 
  it 's raining , with 6\u00bac outside right now :(, 
  exactly the same over here . 
  well , first of all let 's say that it 's hard to find a really independent newspaper/news site in spain . 
  they are all have a bias , and they are kind of strong - although some of them are simply way too loud about it ... and sometimes , if not every day , they make stupid outrageous front pages ... that 's the case of newspapers like abc or la raz\u00f3n , both right-wing , but you can also find the left-wing counterpart in online media like el plural ... anyway , with that in mind , vilaweb is one of those online sites with a strong , too smelly bias . 
  in this case pro-independence , and their articles are as laughable as they can get ... they dedicate virtually all of their time to speak of just one thing , and that is not catalonia ( unless you think the * prus\u00e9s * is everything , catalonia is the independentist movement , and campaigning for independence is the only thing you should do ... ) . 
  because that 's what they do . 
  they also apply this `` catalan countries '' dogma over every little thing ... including the frigging weather forecast !, 
  and they use political rhetoric like `` the country '' ( in singular ) to refer to every catalan-speaking territory . 
  this is called pancatalanism , some sort of * annexation thinking * . 
  obviously a strongly biased independentist will tell you that not , it 's about the common language ... but the point is exactly the rhetoric they use ... utilizing `` the country '' and that sort of terms , which is absolutely not debatable : a country is not `` a territory which shares a commong language '' ... as you and me know . 
  but i do n't want to be viewed as biased , and i also acknowledge ( like they wo n't with their own press and shit ) the fact that press like el peri\u00f3dico ( sort of like unionists but federalist , social-democrats ) or la vanguardia ( usually moderately catalan nationalist , right-wing , today is a bit more unionist ) are also quite sketchy about many things ... and the press in madrid is also far from being independent and 100 % free . 
  vilaweb claims they use money from random people that visit their site , so `` they 're more free '' , but truth is it 's the most subsidized online newspaper by the generalitat ( catalonia 's regional government ) , and they are just followed by ara.cat ( also pro-indep . ), 
  and others like el m\u00f3n ( also pro-indep ... it 's hard not to see them prolliferating with public money from all the catalans , including the majority which are not independentist according to the latest electoral result ) . 
  any ... they 're all very nice , portuguese , greek , spanish , italian ... they all are as good as they can get . 
  spain is estr\u00f3n xd, 
  grrrrrr ... only rain here for now :(, 
  you 're such a pretty mammal, 
   * false pretenses *  says other countries are far more progressive than spain based on nothing but prejudices , disregarding the actual data exposed earlier , which shows otherwise listing spain at top among the biggest ( and relevant ) countries in western europe , and accuses the counterpart of being nationalistic for pointing it out . 
  oh the irony . 
  your time with me is over . 
  sweden did n't have gay marriage in 2003 , so no , you ca n't add full adoption to your gay marriage legislation if you do n't have gay marriage legislation * at all * . 
  spain remains on top of the scandinavian countries in this regard , and rightfully so , as it is the most accepting nation in this topic gladfully even if that just hurts you somehow . 
  spain did beat the scandinavian countries legalising gay marriage , being also the very first in the world adding full adoption in its legislation . 
  so this  far more progressive countries in europe is false based on facts for this matter  sightless commentor is sightless . 
  oh , the netherlands ? 
  it would be on par , but not many others . 
  kill it !!, 
  kill it with fire !, 
  lucky :( here silence is awkward ... go figure .

  the guy whose birthday is also the date mexico celebrates independence is not the same guy as the first emperor of mexico . 
  also , the first emperor of mexico was not the only emperor of mexico ... 
  you got nothing on mexico , though . 
  the french napoleon deposes the spanish catholic king and imposes a puppet monarchy with representative parliaments in spain and all colonies , including the viceroyalty of new spain . 
  mexicans find the idea of representative-democracy appalling , so their priests and nobility conspire to rattle the natives to fight against the french and to restore the king 's reign . 
  they fail miserably for over a decade until they save up enough money to bribe the main spanish general in the region , who then becomes an emperor who establishes a parliamentary monarchy . 
  infighting leads to the guy quitting after 10 months , and total chaos for 50 years . 
  we celebrate this every year on the date of the birthday of the worst dictator mexico has ever had , as a remembrance of our freedom . 
  if you had to include all teams that have played in european leagues , then you 'd have to include morocco there too ... http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/atl%c3%a9tico_tetu%c3%a1n, 
  and the women , too ... 
  actually , i think they lost because they lied , not necessarily because it was the islamists . 
  i mean , spain was n't the only european partner in the us 's coalition of the willing . 
  they could 've made the argument that `` now more than ever '' did the country needed their party to remain and finish what they started . 
  they chose poorly . 
  he was n't a king . 
  he was emperor of mexico . 
  also , i do n't know about being good . 
  i just know he was cool . 
  sort of like a mid-19th century obama . 
  well , when i say formally , i meant that the british actually did show up along with the french when the french invaded mexico . 
  but the british negotiated terms and left , while the opportunists french did n't , stayed , and invaded . 
  i also think that this entire french incursion into mexico is one of the most illustrative examples of magical realism that pervades mexico 's history . 
  the mexican conservatives conspired with a foreign nation to invade their own country so they could get a european monarch to rule over them , and the monarch the french chose was the liberal maximilian of hapsburg , who , by trying to be the best leader mexico could ever have , ended up alienating everyone in mexico , and in the end , was left to his own devices by the french . 
  when juarez , maximilian 's successor , died , he was succeeded himself by porfirio diaz , one of the most ruthless dictators mexico has ever had , and he stayed in power for 30 years . 
  today , mexico celebrates diaz 's birthday as their independence day , and shuns maximilian . 
  it 's ridiculous . 
  yes , i agree it was an exaggeration . 
  i mean , the british have never formally invaded mexico . 
  yet , it 's still on the map . 
  nevertheless , it 's still quite an impressive show of their historical power . 
   it would be nice if engineers at lockheed could avoid opening the latest cat video infected with a worm . 
  an engineer not opening a cat video ?!, 
  i would 've thought tajikistan was a more attractive target . 
  [ the british have invaded 9 out of 10 countries , so look out luxembourg ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/history/9653497/british-have-invaded-nine-out-of-ten-countries-so-look-out-luxembourg.html ) !, 
  i thought it meant `` to raise a white flag '' . 
  btw , i 'm surprised people could n't read the sarcasm in my previous comment . 
  i mean , the mexican wave originated in the united states , but it 's called that way because it was used in the mexico 1986 world cup ... 
  it seems like sarcastic humor is prohibited now ... 
  you mean , [ this recent history ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxhs0mxqqyg ) ? 
  but italy and germany have won the world cup more times each than spain ...

  have the turkish people not hear about the japanese lost decade ? 
  yes , it 's also 1000 years older . 
  first of all , as an inhabitant of the country that gave the world [ cacao ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/theobroma_cacao ) , without which the world would n't even have chocolate , i think that it 's ridiculous that either belgium or switzerland are seen as * the * chocolate country . 
  secondly , i 've tried both belgian and swiss chocolate . 
  both are very good . 
  you can quit bantering now . 
  wait . 
  i 've heard of belgian waffles , but never of belgian fries . 
  french fries are from france . 
  it says so right in the name !, 
  logically , china would n't want a war . 
  but logic does n't seem to be dictating chinese foreign policy when it comes to attacking its neighbors . 
  it is being debated to be ~ ~ lifted ~ ~ re-defined . 
  the current government and the obama administration favor the changes , so it may well happen . 
  yes , but the portuguese still have cristiano ronaldo , so i 'm gon na chose to laugh about a comic . 
  spain , good at soccer . 
  i must say , though the spanish `` la liga '' is good , the premiere league is arguably better . 
  not to mention , germany and italy are both better than spain at soccer . 
  i 'm pretty sure most countries did n't want muslims back in 1933 either . 
  to be fair , the swiss were n't stupid enough to ask the public for their opinion ... 
  the risk of contagion will remain high as long as the euro exists . 
  and of course everybody knows what will happen if the euro is dropped . 
  it is precisely that reason why all of europe , the imf , the world bank , the us , and everyone has begged germany to continue bailing out europe . 
  it 's gon na be the mother of all bank runs and everyone wanting to cash in germany . 
  what i 'm saying is that it does n't matter because that is not a long term solution . 
  greece was bailed-out ( evidently not saved ) because it prolonged the life of the euro and prevented a crisis of confidence in the euro , which german savers use to , you know , save . 
  in order to save the euro , there needs to be a federal european government . 
  when is that gon na happen ? 
  never !, 
  so why not just drop the pretense and stop using the euro ? 
  it costs less if its done sooner rather than later and germany is in a better position to minimize the fallout locally . 
  dropping the euro is the best logical thing to germany 's best interests . 
  but it would collapse the rest of euro-area ( with the possible exception of france ) . 
  that 's why greece got a bailout , to protect other euro countries . 
  it heavily affected every single euro country , and none more so than germany . 
  and the cause was that greece acted irresponsibly . 
  so , yes , greece should be held to a high standard of fiscal responsibility if it wants a bail out . 
  it screwed europe with the bailout , so it should pay . 
  if it does n't want the bailout , then stop the posturing and leave the euro . 
  no one is forcing the euro on them . 
  being in the euro is voluntary . 
  and germany will survive ... 
  why would banks in italy collapse if greece defaults ? 
  because the euro , which is the same for both countries , will have greece 's country risk attached to it . 
  this is what happens when you have multiple countries with a single currency . 
  so , individual countries are incentived to act , as greece did , wrecklessly , because they know others will share the costs . 
  that is the definition of moral hazard : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/moral_hazard i was n't missing the point . 
  you are raising the point of moral hazard . 
  of course , the us federal government also debated moral hazard when they bailed-out its financial system . 
  my counter-point is that you ca n't expect germany to behave as the federal government of europe , unless , of course , you want a europe ruled by germany . 
  spain needs to bail out its own banks , but obviously , it does n't have enough money to do this , so what do they do ? 
  they ask for a bailout . 
  i know that , right now , spain is pretending they do n't need a bailout , but you , me , rajoy , and everyone knows very well that they are not fooling anyone . 
  if you are implying that , somehow , this is the reason why germany ( or europe in general ) had an obligation to bail out greece , so that they could in turn bail-out their own banks , as spain will do , then you are forgetting that greece and spain are different countries , with different structural issues . 
  spain 's issue is its medieval banking structure . 
  greece 's issue is government corruption and untrustworthiness .

  so in short ... what the fuck are you talking about ? 
  also , euromed may not be true high speed , but it 's a fine service that works almost as well , so there is n't much benefit to a true high speed service since it would only shave a few minutes . 
  as far as high speed service to the basque country , we do n't have that from madrid either , what 's your point ? 
  and valladolid is only because they are working on the galicia line . 
  that 's like calling calatayud a specific destination for the ave when it 's really just a random station where a few trains stop . 
  i would n't believe it if they said half of 25 year olds in the first place . 
  a galician could make a reasonable claim for portuguese , but even then ... eh . 
  the camino gets lots of foreign tourists . 
  my family lives in a small town on the camino so it 's really hilarious watching foreigners try to get by because english just does n't work there . 
  if i 'm around i 'll help and it 's even funnier to see their reactions when i start speaking my english with a rural us accent . 
  andorra is way more than 35 % . 
  i have no problem just speaking spanish with everyone i meet there . 
  they show movies dubbed in spanish if there is no catalan dub , etc. . 
  it 's way closer culturally to spain than to france and i would say spanish knowledge is close to universal . 
  i think this is what most bother me about the 2016 meme . 
  like celebrity deaths are mostly people who were hugely important in the 70s and guess what , they 're old now . 
  that will continue . 
  it the people that think brexit/trump , etc. . . are a symptom of the year that really bothers me . 
  like there are very real and dangerous political winds that want to undo all we have done to help make the world so much more peaceful ( and despite everything , it really is ) and we all have to fight it , but no ... it 's a number that 's the issue . 
  i 'm no leftist , but he was pretty good through the end of the bush years . 
  he was a big advocate for the us removing the hiv ban , for example . 
  he got the snowden scoop and basically went downhill from there . 
  like i disagree with him on a hell of a lot , but he used to be a respectable voice from the left . 
  just that he 's kind of gone off the deep end recently . 
  just today you had greenwald agreeing with tucker carlson of all people about russia being not all that bad . 
  also proudly tweeting a super conspiratorial oliver stone pro-russian rant . 
  greenwald had a scoop with snowden and then since then has gotten weird . 
  that whole episode has him firmly on the pro-putin train now , too . 
  it 's such a strange coalition coalescing around being pro-russian that is basically a bunch of otherwise enemies that just want to be anti-establishment . 
  obama has now made it so trump has to actively concede to russian intelligence within us borders to undo this rather than just be silently complicit . 
  it 's not that this is a particularly effective move since he 'll be gone in 3 weeks , but it 's the same thing with israel , make trump have to publicly place himself in his extreme positions rather than just be slimey and avoid the questions . 
  engineering , procurement and construction . 
  basically the people that manage large projects . 
  true to a point , but madrid will never be as bike friendly as a lot of other cities simply because of the inclines . 
  i work on these large scale types of things and i can see how a small error in a communication somewhere would lead to undersized ducting quite easily . 
  i 'm frankly shocked this sort of thing is n't even more common . 
  as far as cost overruns , i write proposals for large projects and given the time constraints we have , it 's basically guaranteed that there 's going to be mistakes and the low bidder tends to be the one who 's made the most mistakes . 
  winning a large contract is an incredibly exciting and terrifying thing because you know errors in the proposal will come back to you . 
  but really , it 's all about ability to execute these sorts of things and project execution is entirely different from manufacturing engineering that germany is famous for . 
  in a lot of ways things that make a good manufacturer make a bad project manager . 
  and not to get too stereotypical but things like adhering strictly to protocols is incredibly important for maintaining quality in a manufacturing environment , but inventing new solutions and patches to weird problems in sort of cowboy ways is essential to project management . 
  a lot of times you have you break the rules and ask for the deviation later at your own risk . 
  they fucked up the fire suppression system and it turns out it was a really , really fundamental design flaw so they basically have to go back and redo a huge amount of the work . 
  as someone involved in project work , i ca n't imagine the sinking feeling of failing the test and then realizing that it 's physically impossible to pass . 
  honestly , as far as pollution is concerned , it 's not cars in general that are the problem ( though i do think discouraging cars in the city center is a good idea for a lot of other reasons ) , it 's diesel engines in cars . 
  they are slightly more efficient for carbon emissions but orders of magnitude worse for nox . 
  the promotion of diesel for environmental reasons is like guaranteeing a heart attack in an attempt to ever so slightly reduce the risk of a long term cancer in a non-meaningful way . 
  i should note that i live in madrid center and i have a car . 
  i generally do n't drive to work ( though i am this week because of how my monthly transport pass works with my vacation combined with lack of traffic ) and i prefer to move around the center in transport . 
  that said , i 'm finishing my moto license now and will probably just start going everywhere by motorcycle unless i need cargo or i will be drinking . 
  fyi , a lot of spain rainy and does , indeed freeze in the mountains . 
  there are a lot of mountains in spain . 
  the biggest single issue is , indeed , poor design . 
  it was from not adequately accounting for the fact of rising smoke in a fire and having an undersized forced ventilation system to deal with it . 
  the airport is basically done right now , the issue is it is n't safe in the event of a fire so ca n't be signed off on . 
  i never tried to say german engineers suck . 
  german engineers are pretty good , on average . 
  just that 's also true of dutch , french , spanish , italian , polish , etc. . . engineers . 
  european engineering is pretty good . 
  i absolutely agree that the air pollution here is a major problem . 
  one of the things that happens here in winter is a lack of wind combined with the mountains to one side of the city that makes sure that pollution can only dissipate away to the east and south . 
  that said , my big problem with these measures is that they are n't really thought out as a way to solve the problem and there 's no indication that it will even make things all that much better . 
  the first stage is limiting the speed on the main highways into the city , but i have n't seen any evidence that it does anything to help pollution , and , at least with my car actually makes it worse because i have the motor at the same or higher speed only going slower because i 'm in fourth rather than fifth gear . 
  ( the speed is slowed from 90 to 70 ) . 
  i do n't know if anyone has actually determined to see how much not allowing municipal parking actually changes things , but i suspect not all that much . 
  the price is only very slightly higher to pay for a private garage spot , so people just do that and it does n't actually change behavior . 
  as far as the odd/even days thing goes , it has been tried time and again and proven ineffective at actually curbing the problem . 
  paris is taking their restrictions for the same thing away right now because it does n't work . 
  one big thing that can be done is making transport free . 
  transport in madrid is controlled by the autonomous government and not the council , which is who has taken these measures . 
  unfortunately they did n't sit down and hash out a real plan the council just basically said to make it free without providing any money ( despite the fact that they do provide heavily to the budget ) . 
  it really needs to be a long and slow political process to get all the affected councils on board with it and provide money to make transport free , at least in the central zones . 
  as it is , the things are rushed which just leads to pointless blaming when things are poorly thought out . 
  my solution would be first to prohibit diesel cars older than 20 years old from driving in the city and then every year move the age up by 2 years . 
  that way you give people enough time to deal with it if they just bought a newer diesel car . 
  i would also push the national government to have the taxes reflect the natural prices of the fuel where diesel is more expensive . 
  promoting diesel has been europe 's biggest policy error in the last decades and has led to the health crisis of pollution in the major cities . 
  the restrictions as they are are too heavyhanded and there are plenty of cases where they just do n't work . 
  how do you deal with someone from out of the city who was staying here for a couple days and now wants to leave but is now legally prohibited from doing so ? 
  what about people with jobs that do n't have public transport connections ? 
  thankfully this is during vacations , but what about parents who can only make their schedule work by driving to drop off kids at school ? 
  i get promotion of public transport , but it quite simply does n't work for everyone 's needs and telling people they just all of a sudden ca n't use their car is a huge deal . 
  also , i drove the entire length of the castellana ( main n-s axis in madrid ) this morning and did n't see a single police control point . 
  edit : just looked at the weather forecast ... this will absolutely get much worse . 
  two holiday weekends in a row coming up and there does n't appear to be any wind in the forecast for at least a couple weeks . 
  we 'll see how they react to their measures basically doing nothing . 
  ab is looking for anyway out and leased a bunch of their aircraft to lh , too . 
  the problem is that nobody wants anything to do with their operation and would prefer to just buy rights and aircraft in liquidation . 
  normally etihad is sort of an investor of last resort as part of their business is taking shitty , failed airlines and turning them around . 
  of course , that does n't always work ( see also : virgin australia ) . 
  so really the question is how much longer until abu dhabi decides to stop sending the airline cash infusions and they will just have to stop operations . 
  especially with other low cost german operations out there , i ca n't see the government stepping in , either . 
  the new airport is essentially a new terminal at sxf . 
  in theory it 's supposed to close but i would bet they keep that open as a separate terminal to keep capacity up for awhile . 
   air berlin is constantly losing passengers and is about to go bankrupt has essentially gone bankrupt a long time ago and is now only operating due to cash from etihad that can dry up at any second . 
  but , yes , there is still pressure to open so they can actually close txl and consolidate everything at the current sxf . 
  as of right now even the new ber wo n't have enough capacity . 
  my prediction is they still close txl but then just operate the current sxf as the sch\u00f6nfield terminal of ber or something like that and still open the new one to keep enough capacity . 
   only germany , with it 's strong brand of `` german efficiency '' i feel like most people who think like this have never actually had to work with siemens . 
  realistically , the engineering there is about as good as everywhere else in europe .

   * fans *, 
  sweden btfo . 
  same applies to the other dolls , yes . 
  what do \u00fdou mean ? 
  it 's fucking great compared to a few years ago . 
  hell , i 've actually turned down a few job offers recently , which as a part of the so called * lost generation * it is a completely new experience for me . 
  \u00ddou mean i can get free shit by just going to the beach a few days ? 
  this is big . 
   `` they 're not looking for a peaceful country to live in , they 're looking for a germany to live in . '', 
  truly incredible revelation . 
   and ? 
  he is still a husband to a pm . 
  which means literally nothing . 
  he was not elected to nor should have anything to do with his husband 's job . 
  read the article . 
   * mostly syrians , afghans and iraqis * damm , schengen grows so fast !, 
   i 'm sure they will not be happy if you start treating them in this way . 
  at least i would be pretty offended if i were king of saudi arabia with 40 billion dollars fortune . 
  40 bazillion dollars !! 1111 !, 
  i really could n't care less , nor see why the spanish state should , they 're not an important economic partner whatsoever . 
   you ca n't really stop interacting with them you do n't need to stop interacting with them , just stop importing people from there . 
  you can still have talks , trade goods and host visitors in a perfectly healthy manner . 
   after all you already have some of them inside , they have children in your country , these children will be unhappy and eventually they will get more radical . 
  not at all , in fact , the group that has more to lose from bad immigration is precisely the immigrants that are already here since the actions of some generally end up creating tension towards all of them . 
  the last thing someone moving away from some islamic shithole needs is bringing more islam here . 
   the problem is that if you start valuing security more than anything else you go further and further along this road and eventually end up being locked in one single tiny room in your great giant rich house  ahh yes , the slippery slope . 
  cool story as usual , needs more nazis tho . 
  lmao  * but what if the gulf countries get mad that we stop importing islam ????!?!?!? 
   'm not willing to give up freedom of movement or opportunity you 're living a fantasy world , no such thing has ever existed nor ever will ( not in our lifetimes anyway ) . 
  you do n't need to check individuals whatsoever . 
  you select a bunch of countries with a somewhat similar culture and host people from those , in the case of spain there 's literally no reason to take people from anywhere but europe / latin america unless they 're high skill workers coming with an employment contract . 
  like i said , it 's super simple . 
  or we could simply stop importing culturally incompatible people . 
  it 's extremely simple . 
  big, 
  yes . 
  also correlated with how much of a shithole the place is . 
  sad !, 
   * windoze * opinion discarded . 
  for now . 
   gay people dont spread their genes , which means their genes are purged from the gene-pool anyway . 
  that 's really not how genetics works , it 's * a bit * more complex . 
  that would require absolutely massive changes to the way our society organizes , specially on the taxation side . 
  but it would be interesting to see , to say the least . 
  which is exactly the same , since all donations are screened without exceptions . 
  in spain at least . 
   the life of children adopted by same sex couples is drastically worse than those in normal families when it comes to depression and identification crisises . 
  no , children of same-sex couples are significantly more healthy and successful than the general population . 
  the adoption bias is huge , obviously , but given the context it is fair to make the comparison . 
   but 100 % against full adoptions , there are conflicting studies ont the subject not really . 
  having one or two studies that find some negative impact among dozens and dozens that support that they 're not only as well off but actually better ( due to adoption bias ) is not what any scientist would call `` conflicting '' . 
   and tbh there should 've been no studies on the first place , you have to use human children as test subjects . 
  they 're not thrown into giant test tubes if that 's what you have in mind , we just ask them some questions and look at data that is either public or freely given , the impact on their life is literally zero . 
  not even half a peanut . 
  it 's the exact same issue . 
  and a bunch of thugs in a suit would be absolutely useless to stop any fairly elaborated assassination attempt in the first place , specially in a country where is perfectly legal to own firearms . 
  is there any reason why the authorities are still letting him bring those thugs when they 're known to be criminals ? 
  the host country should be perfectly able to provide security for a foreign visit , otherwise fuck off . 
  lmao this has to be a joke . 
  this must be how america being great looks like . 
  not impressed tbh . 
  this has to be a joke . 
  if not , get some economics , high school ones will suffice . 
  all european telecoms will do it , every single one of them . 
  the danish ones are just upfront about it . 
  it 's regular 2017 newspeak . 
  that 's what they say , we started together and they 're earning quite a bit less than me now but things are a lot less expensive so overall quality of life is great . 
  one of them is thinking about coming back though , he 's living with a qt pole that he already knew and they 're planning on marrying eventually which is simply not possible there . 
  completely anecdotal , but two of my friends left for warsaw last year ( we work in it ) . 
  nobody cares about your completely ignorant american opinions , they 're worthless . 
  stop projecting your own problems , that 's not how the world works . 
  that 's a fault of eurovision more than anything . 
  i 'd ban english for everyone but uk , ireland and maaaaaybe malta if it were up to me . 
  yeah , it 's the first time that i unironically love an eurovision song . 
  native language , catchy tune and the harambe presentation that is actually pretty witty if you look at the lyrics . 
  then let 's end the eu , because this is exactly what the common market is . 
  i certainly would n't call the us culturally diverse , quite the opposite . 
  for it 's size , it is incredibly homogeneous . 
   i think writing `` tend to form ghettos and become conflictive '' is racist and in no way constructive . 
  no , it 's just objective reality . 
  deal with it . 
   do you really think anyone on earth thinks it 's fun forming ghettos and get into trouble . 
  whether they find it fun or not is completely irrelevant , ultimately , that 's what 's happening . 
   the country is not that conservative . 
  more people voted for hillary clinton , ** who although is very centrist , was the more liberal choice ** . 
  is this a joke ? 
  hillary clinton is a hugely conservative politician by most european standards . 
   we are already diverse , many different countries with different languages , cultures and heritages spread over a rather small amount of land . 
  they all share foundations , that 's the point . 
   their children will grow up as europeans . 
  as seen by the last 2 years of emergency state due to terrorism by ** second generation ** islam trash . 
  we should just import more latin americans with their despacitos . 
  yes . 
  that 's exactly what they were . 
   it 's a reference to swedish rape culture ftfy, 
   * i was merely pretending to be retarded . 
  lmao, 
  ** reality ** : no one will remember who that guy is in a week . 
  in fact , the epic sax guy is a million times more relevant than he 's ever going to be . 
  the fact that some eurovision trash genuinely thinks that he 's adding something to music is hilarious .

  [ i do not think so ... ] ( http://imagenes.lainformacion.com/2016/03/30/economia/pib-per-capita-regiones_903222088_101609713_667x486.jpg ) they 're below the avarage . 
  europe is not only a geographical concept , but also a cultural concept . 
  indeed , europe does not exist geographically as we think , because what we know as europe is just a cape of the eurasian continent according to physical geography . 
  the geographical borders between * europe * and * asia * are geologically arbitrary ... 
  i mean european culture in eurasia makes europe . 
  not only barcelona ( which is like a * mini-catalonia * sociologically ) , but almost all its metropolitan area that 's quite different from the rural catalonia . 
  take a look at the results of nationalist parties in baix llobregat . 
  it sounds very * less socially conservative * ... and [ this ] ( http://www.cartasaldirector.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/10375150_744802032232040_6297099248762074744_n.jpg ) . 
  also , pujol said many times that ciu was ideologically heir to lliga regionalista , which leader , camb\u00f3 , financed the [ fascist coup d'\u00e9tat against a democr\u00e0tic republic ] ( https://www.google.es/amp/m.publico.es/politica/financiadores-del-golpe-da-inicio.html/amp ) . 
  although they were different parties , converg\u00e8ncia and uni\u00f3 were allies , so they may think similar in many aspects ; that 's why , they were allies ... [ duran i lleida , who was the spokesman of ciu in the spanish national parliament , supported medicians who '' * heal * '' gays ] ( https://www.google.es/amp/sociedad.elpais.com/sociedad/2010/06/23/actualidad/1277244002_850215.amp.html ) . 
  are you minimizing the acts of a terrorist group because they thought similar to you ? 
  it 's clear it was n't like eta ( fortunately ) , but i think it was n't a [ `` joke '' ] ( http://www.acvot.org/v2/enews2.php?var=444 ) for this woman . 
  there were also spanish nationalist groups like triple a ( related to fuerza nueva ) : [ matanza de atocha ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1977_massacre_of_atocha ) . 
  in the first years of the current democracy there were a lot of terrorist groups in spain , not only eta and later gal . 
  castile does not exist nowadays as a political entity . 
  also , * nacionalidad * in the spanish constitution does n't mean * nation * , but a territory with history and culture . 
  andalusia is also a * nacionalidad * . 
  the supreme court of canada declared quebec 's referendums illegal in 1998 because they have a constitution like us and unlike uk . 
  the clarity act , which is constitutional , allows to make a nonbinding and consultative referendum in quebec . 
  in the case there 's a referendum in quebec and the * yes * to independence wins , only the districts ( i do n't know exactly how they 're called in canada ) which vote for the independence would be allowed to be independent from canada , only if the canadian parliament approves it ( that 's why it 's consultative ) , because the canada 's constitution only recognises the national sovereignty in the canadian parliament and does not recognise the right of self-determination as almost all the constitutions in the world , except the ethiopian constitution . 
  if some eastern europeans countries believe russia is still the russian empire or the ussr , it 's not our problem . 
  we are n't in the cold war anymore , although it seems to be because mass medias treat russia as it were the ussr ( i 'm gay ; i do not like putin , but i do not think russia is the evil ) . 
  there 're countries in western europe ( like mine ) which are loosing much money . 
  the italian state looks after italy 's own interests as it 's normal . 
  where 's the news ? 
  are we in the cold war ??? 
  i thought we 're in 2016 ... 
  yes , it does not make sense . 
  but the first ones to use ( false ) historic arguments are nationalists since the xix century . 
  the unity of spain is not sacred , neither the unity of catalonia ... 
  principality , not even a kingdom like val\u00e8ncia in the crown of aragon . 
  moreover uk lacks of constitution , unlike spain . 
  the spanish constitution , as almost all constitutions in the world ( except the ethiopia 's one , if i 'm not wrong ) , does not recognise the right of self-determination and protects the unity of spain . 
  i do n't consider the unity of spain to be * sacred * , but if you want to make a referendum , you have to change the constitution , which most catalans voted for 38 years ago , and not committing illegalities . 
  i want to remind that quebec 's referendums were declared [ illegal ] ( https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/1999/12/que-d04.html?view=article_mobile ) : `` last year , canada 's supreme court ruled that a unilateral declaration of independence by quebec would be illegal under the canadian constitution and international law . '', 
  i 'm gay , i lived in a village and i agree with you . 
  where does that come from ? 
  andalusia is more open to gays than all centre of spain ( except madrid ) and navarra for example . 
  castile is our bible belt . 
  it 's not ridiculous , but original . 
  as non-nationalist catalan , i must say your comment is very good . 
  catalan nationalists keep thinking that spain is like franco 's spain , but the reality is totally different . 
  indeed , catalan educational system ( almost all is taught in catalan ) is recognised internationally as an example for increasing the number of speakers , the knowledge and respect to minority languages . 
  and this is possible thanks to linguist laws of catalan parliament and the spanish constitution , which is not perfect and must be reformed , but it 's very respectful with minorities . 
  you can not compare astur-leones and the aragon 's language to other spanish national languages . 
  these languages/historic dialects can be considered languages but also dialects of spanish ( i do not say personally if they 're dialects or languages ; i 'm telling the controversy in academia ) . 
  it 's a complex issue and very discussed in academia because the borders between a dialect and a language are very , very fuzzy . 
  some linguists consider them as languages like ethnologue 's linguists ; other linguists like men\u00e9ndez pidal , who studied asturian very much , thought they were dialects ... 
  both positions are right . 
  they 're currently in a grey area . 
  so , as student of linguistics , i think your comparison is not accurate because nobody doubts catalan , galician , basque and occitan ( * aranese * ) are languages . 
  catalonia has n't been recognised the right of self-determination by the un because it 's not a colony . 
  it 's for colonies . 
  the scottish case is very special for many historic and legal reasons . 
  and the quebec 's referendums were declared illegal ... 
  the western sahara is better compared to catalonia in spain , what an ignorance !, 
  i think it 's a complex issue . 
  spain increased its gdp a lot during 2001-2008 ( 3-4 % per year ) , we 've been increasing our gdp a bit more than 3 % for the last two years and we expect to increase 2,8 % our gdp the next year ... 
  if the euro damages southern economies so much , why has spain 's gdp increased considerably with the euro except during 2008-2013 ? 
  i do n't think * the euro is heaven * , it 's true that it has damaged some aspects of southern economies ; but i do n't think it 's that much bad ( at least for spain ) . 
  [ spain is still the top . ], 
  ( http://www.irodat.org/img/database/pdf newsletter2016_secondedition . pdf ), 
  i do n't agree with you , but it 's a good comment . 
  in spanish , we do n't pronounce the / r / sound in * tr * and * dr * , but / \u027e / ( a softer sound ) . 
  only / r / ( * trill r * ) sounds in * rr * ; * sr - * like * israel * , * nr - * and * lr - * like * alrededor * ; also , when it 's the first letter like * raudo * . 
  the cold war ended . 
  get over it . 
  i think he means [ laws like this ] ( https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/ley_de_relaciones_comerciales_con_las_antillas ) . 
  ( sorry , it 's in spanish ) . 
  basically , there were protectionist laws , which destroyed ( among other factors ) other industries focus in the rest of spain like my grandmother 's city , [ m\u00e1laga ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/history_of_m%c3%a1laga#economic_expansion_and_industrialisation_.281833.e2.80.931868.29 ) : `` the second half of the 19th century began a period of prosperity in m\u00e1laga , with an economy energised by the resumption of traditional mercantile activities and new industrial employment . 
  this positioned the city as an important european manufacturing center ; urban renewal projects and the modernisation of local infrastructure were initiated by local government . 
  manuel agustin heredia 's ironworks , la constancia , located in san andr\u00e9s , started a run of productivity in 1834 that made it the country 's leading iron foundry . '' there were more industrial focus in spain like vigo , alcoi , val\u00e8ncia , c\u00e1diz ... they could n't compete with the catalan industry thanks to the evil-spanish-state-which-hates-catalans because as the famous swiss writer stendhal , who knew spain well , wrote : `` catalans want just laws -- he notes down -- with the exception of the customs law , which must be done to its measurement . 
  they want that every spaniard who needs cotton pays four francs the pole , for the fact that catalonia is in the world . 
  the spaniards of granada , of malaga or of corunna can not buy english cotton cloths , which are excellent , and which cost a franc the pole ( memoirs of a tourist , 1939 ) '' . 
  i think it 's clear what stendhal saw when he visited spain . 
  this does not mean that there was n't an illustrated and entrepreneur elite ( as in other parts of spain ) which was an important part in the industrial development of catalan industry , but history is more complex and more prosaic ( and less epic ) than nationalists of all kinds say ... there are many factors involved and maybe without the help of the state the industrial focus in spain would have developed in galicia , andalusia or val\u00e8ncia . 
  who knows ? 
  once again here for foreigners : why are n't catalan nationalist movements or they 're very minority in catalan speaking regions like val\u00e8ncia or balearic islands ? 
  are n't they * catalans * ? 
  because they 're ( relatively ) poor regions . 
  it 's all about money . 
  we 're the poorest area in the iberian peninsula , unlike portugal ... 
  there was also a rebellion in [ andalusia ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/andalusian_independentist_conspiracy_ ( 1641 ) . 
  it was n't about nationalism ( this idiology did not exist before the xix century as you said ) , but nobiliary and high clergy interests ( power interests ) , moreover money ( as always ) . 
  learning german is a waste of time if you 're not an engineer . 
  learning or improving your english is a better investment . 
  if you 're not eurocentric , learning chinese , arabian , any asiatic languages or even spanish , french and russian ( as european languages ) are more useful ... or your own languages like we do in spain with our languages ( learning one of the spain 's not-castilian languages should be mandatory in all spain ) for working in your country . 
  i consider german to be a beautiful and interesting language , but life is short and germans speak a good english on average . 
   support for far right is up across the eu . 
  spain : 0 far-right member of spanish parliament and all the seventeen regional parliaments . 
  so that sentence is false . 
  moreover , i think portugal does n't have far-right representantives . 
  spanish governments are very stable , unlike italian governments . 
  only in 2015 and 2016 we had a caretaker government and we had two consecutive elections ( unprecedented in the current spanish democracy ) . 
  so , far from italy according to historic facts . 
  i do n't know about portuguese governments . 
  [ it 's more democratic than your little country ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/democracy_index ) according to this report . 
  catalan nationalists =| = all catalans . 
  it 's not that difficult . 
  we all know here that nationalists are very noisy .

  that picture is actually upside down .

  there 's good british people too . 
  with paco behind the bar ? 
  pepe drinking a tercio with a little plate of olives ? 
  where are the bars ? 
  iberian soil is monochromatic and boring . 
  a train line straight to southern spain like the nazi did already . 
  we have sun , add the ucranian soil and ta-daaa, 
  thats cos you have n't met the same gypsies than me . 
  take off the potato from your throat , ca n't understand a thing you 're saying . 
  thx, 
  same happened to me many times , but changing countries . 
  i was supposed to dance and ol\u00e9 . 
  but you 're not rich , nor blonde or cool viking , so it does n't counts . 
  you ca n't imagine the struggle every time i want to do a bill ( factura ? ), 
  for costumers because of the iva ( vat ), 
  stupid incult translator ... 
  you man , are a cult person . 
  always like to hear what you have to say . 
  came here to for once say that , but i 'm 5 hours late : /, 
  man , i wish russia was doing much better . 
  damn putin and damn oligarchy, 
  i edited, 
  is it a joke i 'm not getting ? 
  let him who is without sin cast the first stone . 
  joke ahead : silly , he even wrote the name of the river wrongly :d haha !, 
  ( end of the joke ), 
  i was expecting the `` tercios '' , not this alfe\u00f1ique . 
  tip : ( remember this tip when cooking a spanish meal ! ), 
  we do n't use so much spices here . 
  i 'm not a big cook , but someone more into it could explain to you . 
  for example , paella only has saffron and \u00f1ora ( if you want to call \u00f1ora a spice ) thats it . 
  and the capital . 
  that or bacon . 
  okay , not giving them clicks . 
  what !?!? 
  7gigas for 6 $ ? 
  guillotine in the squares is not that violent . 
  it 's a clean and fast cut . 
  i feel bad for the turkish redditors when things like this happen : / even tho we know they 're not very pro erdogan , must be embarrassing for them . 
  yup, 
  bashar al-assad seems , and i say seems to be more classy than donald . 
  norway has many . 
  one question came to my mind : what was going on in australia during the european mid ages when forts were built here ? 
  could be the one with more symbols ? 
  construction is `` moving '' a lil . 
  on the coast at least . 
  construction is `` moving '' a lil . 
  on the coast at least . 
  so many trees there , my bosque is ochre . 
  they share border with italy and compete in eurovision , eurocup and world cup . 
  id like to go visit some time . 
  and thats how the spanish empire 2.0 begins , by teaching all the blind people in the world to read spanish or die under the wheels of the train . 
  starting by russia in the middle of the winter . 
  is n't that badass ? 
  we still have the mediterranean . 
  i use to live by the sea , now i 'm in the middle of the desert in a hormonated mallorca . 
  we could start a marriage agency here in reddit . 
  they make the best polvorones . 
  there 's plenty room to hide them . 
  / u/spanishduke agaves planted ? 
  [ benidorm ] ( https://m.imgur.com/gallery/h43aj ) look at the top left :p, 
  * judas, 
  running in circles they are !, 
  you have been for a long time . 
  * annoyingly catchy . 
  are french really late ? 
  deal, 
  cagamandurries !, 
  you 're loco !, 
  nooo way it can be good for anybody !!!, 
  we 're expecting 7 degrees tonight !!, 
  eating at the sun in t-shirt here today . 
  they said it 's going to change next week with a new cold wave . 
  we do n't expect snow , we need venus crossing the 4th moon with saturn both in line with the polar star for that to happen . 
  it is cold temperatures with high pressures or ok temperatures with low pressure , ingredients for a good snowfall are rarely given together in this clays . 
  lol, 
  i do n't change it for mediterranean sea . 
  winter cream ? 
  the fuck is that ? 
  roman empire is still alive . 
  just changed the forms . 
  maybe, 
  good :p, 
  is brexit changing anything about it ? 
  what does it mean that the european countries are getting more money from uk trains every time some one buys a ticket ? 
  ( serious ),

  it 's not political policy is it . 
  it 's racial policy . 
  own up to your views . 
  holy shit ... for a moment i thought i was in stormfront . 
  saying that europe is too white is simply stupid . 
  but making the opposite argument ( that europe is not white enough anymore and that we should stop immigration from non-white countries to preserve europe 's whiteness ) is the sheer definition of racism , and in my opinion morally repugnant . 
  of course . 
  i moved to germany for work in 2009 and my german girlfriend and i are getting married soon , so looks like i 'm staying ... 
  you have no idea what a representative sample is . 
  yes , mainly moroccan . 
  pretty far from the conflict areas . 
  absolutely not true . 
  the poles and the turks in the ruhr area are just polar opposites when it comes to integration . 
  the turks have built a parallel society and do not mix with the local germans . 
  i bet if they stay , their children and grandchildren will integrate no problem . 
  in the ruhr area in germany , the polish people who migrated there in the 19th and early 20th century intermarried with the locals and their descendants are indistinguishable from your average german . 
   why is a country any more obligated to help their own citizens than other humans who suffer inconceivably more ? 
   are n't we beyond nationalism now ? 
  we are n't , sadly . 
  i 'm very critical of islam and of the lack of integration many muslim immigrants in europe show , but some people would rather let homeless syrian children die than risk not being able to afford the $ 2,000 flat screen tv and having to settle for the $ 1,900 one . 
  this is an odd comment . 
  he was just stating his opinion , and hoping others join him . 
  europe not being responsible for the syrian civil war is one thing , but it 's another thing to say we should n't help those who 've lost their homes and had to flee fearing for their lives . 
  now , finding out who was legitimately in danger and who 's taking advantage might be a hard task , but i personally do n't think we should deny help to those who truly need it . 
  no , what * you 're * doing is gamble , what i 'm doing is investing . 
  timing the market is the ** very definition ** of gambling in the stock market . 
  no matter how convinced you are or how loud you say it , you have no idea how long this slump will last , or when the markets will go up again . 
  and i have no idea either : which is precisely why i do n't try to time the market . 
  i invest 3,500 $ every four months into low-cost index funds and etfs : 30 % msci north america , 30 % msci europe , 30 % msci emerging markets , 10 % msci pacific , according to market capitalisation . 
  and i do n't try to guess when it 's a good idea to buy or when it 's a good idea to sell . 
  i 'm in it for the long haul , and i 've done enough research to know market timing and active trading is the best recipe for diminished returns . 
  i did n't modify my strategy in 2013 , when the market was growing at a rate of 25 % , and i 'm not modifying it now , when it 's shaking and falling . 
  as / u/gentleroar says , i stay the course . 
  ok . can you tell me whether the drops will continue in the following days ? 
  will you tell me when is a good time to buy more stocks ? 
  precisely because the biggest drop happened a month ago , it was far from clear that there would be further significant drops . 
  well , no other option now ... 
  not the only thing i bought , but it 's been the one taking the hardest hit . 
  lol guess who bought 1,100 $ worth of emerging markets stocks just a week ago . 
  `` do n't time the market '' , they said ... `` the best moment to invest is always now '' , they said ... 
  you 're right in that these terms are very ambiguous , but you have to understand that for portuguese , spaniards , etc. , anything north of paris is northern europe . 
  is it me , or does the term western europe get confusing ? 
  it used to mean the western half of europe , that is the countries west of the former iron curtain . 
  this poll included italy for instance . 
  a minor , irrelevant detail ... 
  typical ... `` we 'll decide and let you know what we decided for you to agree '' . 
  which is why a big crisis was needed and we should see the silver lining in this whole affair . 
  agreed . 
  since it is inception . 
  the supreme court striked down the new labour law . 
  ha , i just realised in spanish we call it `` primera comuni\u00f3n '' but then `` confirmaci\u00f3n '' instead of `` segunda comuni\u00f3n '' . 
  weird . 
  hmm i 'm not a native speaker but i do n't think you 're using the expression `` to let oneself go '' correctly . 
  i thought you meant verhofstadt had gotten fat . 
  perhaps a native english speaker can clarify . 
  or are you one ? 
  in that case nevermind . 
  i majored in translation and interpreting with a specialty in simultaneous interpreting . 
  not ashamed to say i abandoned the job as it proved too hard and stressful for me . 
  what do you mean he let himself go ? 
  also , you know , germany lost almost 40 % of its territory . 
  lol . 
  i swear some people live in a parallel universe or something ... 
  yes . 
  when he found out , he could n't live with the guilt so he killed himself . 
  thank you based east german . 
  i 'm sure the stasi will take care of this matter immediately and efficiently . 
  on the latter , do you mean support by the people in eurozone countries for administrative and fiscal union , or by the governments ? 
  is n't there quite a bit of support already ? 
  holy shit . 
  and i thought corruption and tax evasion was bad in spain ... 
  not to the same extent , but yes . 
   i do n't believe ( heh ) that you can say that something has different connotations ( not only `` negative '' ones , but meaningful ones ) and mean the same . 
  i 'm a linguist , so perhaps i 'm taking a `` radical '' approach at this . 
  connotations are not related to the literal semantic meaning of a word , but to its social and cultural implications . 
  the explicit meaning of a word is its * denotation * . 
  its implicit social or cultural associations are its * connotation * . 
   pure agnosticism ( non believers ) and agnostic atheism ( atheists ) are both part of the irreligious group of people regarding religion . 
  but their instances are not the same , so you can be one , or the other . 
  so they are not the same . 
  again , i disagree with your classification . 
  non-believers are people who do not believe ( in god ) . 
  that is the basic definition of atheism , or if you want , of `` weak atheism '' : lack of belief in god . 
  you can certainly be one * and * the other . 
  in fact , you pretty much * have * to be the two in a literal sense . 
   you could argue , of course , that an atheist is also a non-believer , but i think that denying the existance of anything to believe in is far deeper than that . 
  ah , now it becomes clearer . 
  you seem to hold the view that atheism = hard atheism ( the strong denial of the existence of any gods ) . 
  many people hold that view , but that is not the necessary meaning of the word atheist . 
  an atheist is simply someone who does n't believe in any god . 
  i certainly do n't think your definition is accurate though . 
  an atheist is certainly not someone who `` denies the existence of anything to believe in '' . 
  which is exactly what i said ... 
  you 're agreeing with me ... 
  i said they mean the same but have slightly different connotations . 
   abortion ? 
  yes , but with some limitations ( or , if you prefer , `` no , but with some exceptions '' ) . 
  most spaniards are pretty liberal on abortion even when compared with the most liberal western democracies . 
  the proposed abortion reform by the conservative government in power met with such backlash that the prime minister had to drop it and it ended the political career of the minister of justice , as you know . 
  the law is now one of the most progressive abortion laws in the world .

  and my idea is not nationalistic , almost the opposite . 
  i do n't want the eu to end or to close upon itself , but to stop following the lead of the us and begin to work with other parts of the world too , because it is clear that following the us can turn against us pretty quickly during the following decade . 
  my question to you is : how do you think the eu should react after the declarations of the us government about luring countries out of the eu to weaken it ? 
  to withdraw from the nato ? 
  something has to be done because we can not wait 4/8 years until trump is gone . 
  we would trade it for your wonderful towels . 
  it could be , or it could be not . 
  morocco is a good ally of the us . 
  i think the situation would result in a change in the speech to `` they were moroccan cities anyway , to begin with '' and pressure on spain to drop the ball before a direct intervention . 
  what i mean is that spain is alone against its most probable aggressor , so the country spends enough to keep it in check . 
  why commit to nato when you have no guarantee of being helped ? 
  i am just fleshing out some opinions that i have heard to try to explain the situation . 
  my own opinions are not worked enough yet and i have plenty of conflicting arguments for and cons in my head . 
  we should all bow our heads before him and be thankful to the man who sacrificed himself to save the humanity . 
  thank you , goku . 
  and he said that women having an abortion should be punished ... somehow . 
  have you really spoken with all the 1.1 million subscribers ?!, 
  that is amazing !, 
  it so happens to me that i am already starting to recognize most of the names of people posting , because there is a handful of people who post anything and the rest are here simply to read the articles . 
  much more than any of the redditors the other guy is complaining about represent all europeans , because at least boris johnson was an elected official , so there was people supporting him . 
  the treaty of the nato is much more than what was signed in 1949 . 
  you also do n't see any mention to the famous goal of 2 % spending , because that was introduced latter ( 2002 , if i am not wrong ) and it is defined as guideline , not as a mandatory target . 
  that is what i mean . 
  sorry if i expressed myself poorly . 
  yes , that actually would be great . 
  that kind of people do not really post arguments , just things that can be perceived as arguments if one looks at them only shallowly . 
  when one actually try to work out the logic , there is nothing , usually . 
  bots prepared to post a dissection of that lack of logic every time a certain argument is posted would help greatly , if any , to not give the false idea that there is no opposition to that ( the echo chamber effect ) . 
  so , let me see if i understand . 
  there has been a constant campaign of vilification of the eu , the member states and the citizens in the uk leading to the referendum . 
  comments of johnson and farage saying outrageous things day after day . 
  and , suddently , the citizens of the eu are the baddies because they respond ? 
  you do not get to play the offended person card . 
  it is more complex than that . 
  in marketing there are plenty of details to take into account , such as things like beautiful people are unconsciously trusted more by other people . 
  i am not an expert by any means , but i have read a bit about the art of marketing and there are thousands of studies that people use to manipulate other people to the point that it truly feels like magic , because one never notices any of that subtle manipulation . 
  that is the oldest trick in the book . 
  if you have a bad argument to defend a position , use a fallacy to compensate for that . 
  you see it all day long in reddit . 
  `` i am actually a ... , so i am blindly against of people like me , but i wo n't give any more arguments '' or `` you are wrong , i studied ... , but even with that i wo n't provide any source that could easily refute your argument '' . 
  at some point , the us has to be considered a hostile nation that is trying to destroy our continent . 
  the cabinet has said it themselves , they want the eu in pieces so it is easier to manipulate . 
  spain will have to fight its own war by itself . 
  the only direct military threat to spain is morocco and they threat basically ceuta and melilla , which are excluded from the umbrella of protection of the nato . 
  the nato target is a suggestion , not a mandatory target . 
  ~ ~ it is defined as such in the treaty . ~ ~ edit : to prevent further misinterpretation , the 2 % is not mentioned in the original treaty signed in 1949 . 
  when it was introduced , it was introduced as a guideline . 
  call it a part of the treaty or not , but that does n't change . 
   i know . 
  it looks ridiculous at every stage . 
  sorry , i did not understand the comment and i thought it was a serious question , but i agree . 
  it is like the russian joke `` we believed to have reached rock bottom , but someone knocked from below '' . 
  he ca n't , because it is the us who is using illegal subventions for farmers . 
  that is why the us is paying brazilian cotton farmers . 
  brazil was big enough to denounce the us and win , but instead of removing the subventions , the us agreed to pay subventions to brazilian cotton farmers too , so us cotton could keep flooding the american continent . 
  but i guess it is the eu 's fault , like always . 
  the dotted line is the prediction of the imf on the written date as for the future of the economy . 
  the black line is the real gdp growth . 
  that is why even the imf has softened its position on `` raw austerity for greece '' , because that is as far as they can go without admitting that their recipe was indeed a recipe for disaster . 
  if you want to know more about the real effect of austerity , with real arguments by a real economist , here is a very good albeit long video : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jquhsqxxsjm and here an article , speaking about why the a us crisis has affected more the eu than the us : http://piketty.blog.lemonde.fr/2016/02/27/2007-2015-such-a-long-recession/, 
  they have been doing what told for a decade . 
  the only time they did n't was for two months after the election of syriza . 
  this is , however , the effect of the `` plan '' designed for greece : https://mishgea.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/imf-growth-forecast-vs-reality.png `` follow the prescription and you will be good . 
  do not mind that loss of 30 % of the economy , doing even more damage to the economy is what you have to do at this moment '' . 
  tomorrow the meps will vote on it . 
  today it was backed by inta . 
  https://twitter.com/ep_trade/status/823826872480002048 i was listening yesterday a debate about it and i actually learned a few things that changed my perception about parts of ceta . 
  i prefer the real facts , that is why i thank corrections . 
  reduce 60 % of the debt and restructure the rest . 
  more like growth to pay the debt . 
  austerity , when sensibly done , cut down unnecessary corners , but it is not aimed to create growth and , when overdone , actually hinders it . 
  one uses austerity during the good times , not during the a slump , or you enter in a downwards spiral . 
  thank you very much for the correction . 
  i hate to not have my facts straight . 
  anyway , you had a nice , peaceful revolution . 
  the closest thing we had was the 23f , the date of the failed coup of tejero . 
  out of curiosity , is there any group in portugal that still defend the dictatorship period ? 
  why would a voter from die linke vote for merkel instead of schulz ? 
  honest question . 
  i am not aware of any position in which the former is closer to die linke than the last . 
  mass immigration and security might your top priorities . 
  25 % of unemployment , ten decades of austerity and no future is the top priority for other people . 
  i am on the boat that social problems related with bad economic performance are way more important , but who knows . 
   the big difference is we ended up in a fascist dictatorship . 
  same with spain , but at least you took your dictator out during the revolu\u00e7\u00e3o dos cravos . 
  ours died in his bed and there are still people who defend him . 
  i agree with what you said , specially the last part of your second paragraph . 
  one decade after the whole austerity thing , the eu is lagging a lot with respect to other markets , such as the us , because there was never an organized tackle down to fundamental problems of the union , simply because it was not possible to sell it politically to local voters . 
  hopefully , this brexit thing will finally put an end to it : either solutions for the eu or the dissolution of the eu . 
  we can not postpone this anymore . 
   breakfast is an opportunity to pull europe closer together , i agree , people understand each other more easily after a nice meal . 
  you clearly do n't know what 200-300 years mean . 
  not even 100 years ago you would have been in trial for treason just for suggesting that france and germany could be in the same union , sharing the same currency and being fancy friends . 
  300 years ago , the us was n't even the us yet . 
  history change in a matter of decades sometimes from unsuspected causes . 
  it is simply absurd to say something about what is going to be in 300 years , when you will be probably wrong predicting how the world is going to be in 30 years . 
  the eu and canada are in negotiations about the ceta . 
  now that the us wants to renegotiate nafta , canada is probably looking for new markets as much as possible , to minimize the possible damages . 
  i do n't know if that is `` getting closer to canada '' for the us , to be honest . 
  as for the uk , all in all , the eu is still a bigger market for canada , both for imports and exports , than the uk alone , and the eu is not threatening to become a tax heaven ( which would be catastrophic for canada , in case of a trade agreement ) .

  i bet they have less ping from the space than i do from home : <, 
  i prefer it , but of course i am totally biased . 
  people simply prefer to what they are used . 
  now , spanish simpsons are objectively better than mexican simpsons . 
  i would say that american spanish is closer within than any of its variants is to peninsular spanish . 
  however , i am not sure of it , just from my experience . 
  the difference would be like the us vs uk accent . 
  any us accent is probably closer to other us than it is to uk 's . 
  they are military ninjas , though . 
  you can not see them , but they can see you . 
  it may have the spanish flag , but most spanish courses i have seen are mostly based on mexican spanish . 
  jokes . 
  do you have them in ` murica ? 
  apples without skin do not taste at all . 
  i guess it is the glyphosphate what gives them the flavor . 
  he was a german citizen and had a fixation with breivik . 
  and he lured immigrants to the mcdonalds via facebook , targeting them afterwards during the shooting . 
  i am not saying that he was a part of a far right terrorist group , because the police has n't reach that conclusion , but the way you have presented the data is quite misleading . 
  trump is not an heterogeneous group . 
  he is a single person . 
  therefore , i do not understand your comparison . 
  it is not the first time they have made covers of terrorism with pictures like this one . 
  when are we expecting `` the left '' to explode ? 
  can we wait until tuesday , i have an important presentation on monday . 
  also i read the `` america first '' not as `` i will look for america first '' but in the sense of `` i killed america first , who is the next one ? 
  we have a spanish le pen , he is called santiago abascal . 
  thankfully he is utterly irrelevant and he is only known because it is funny to laugh at him . 
  his party got less votes than the animal rights party but he still tweets like if someone really care . 
  as an anecdote about such character , the idiot went to gibraltar to give spanish flags to the monkeys and had to swim his way back . 
  edit : we also have proper fascists , called la falange ( the phalanx ) . 
  but they obtained 257 votes . 
  crisis are also oportunities . 
  i hope that romania is able to turn the tables and end up better than how they started . 
  is there any one of those who do not give the panflet feeling ? 
  only a few look like professionally made . 
  trolls are funnier and more effective when they look like people genuinely posting their opinions . 
  the us is not sending their best : <, 
  the us is not going to put sanctions against germany as they did not impose that stupid 20 % of tariff against mexican imports ( the idea was scrapped within minutes , i assume because the economical advisors of trump started to yell and run in circles ) . 
  the world does n't work that way . 
  one person can not change at will the pattern of global markets , even if it is the president of the us . 
  are you sure ? 
  out of those subs , reddit can be quite hostile towards women , even if they do n't mention what they are . 
  it would not be the first time that i have spoken in / r/worldnews , for example , only to be belittle for supporting topics or posting arguments that most women i know would use . 
  internet in general is very daunting for women , just take a look at twitter . 
  however , i have also noticed that the higher the concentration of women , the more women are attracted to it , even in places like online videogames . 
  * takes a another look to the gender distribution * i think i am fine , thank you . 
  as an excuse , i will say that the meeting would be brigaded by / r/t _ d. 
  so . . how is the dm box going ? 
  well , one can not say that romanians only complain in internet and do nothing . 
  thank you very much for the advice !, 
  i do n't want supremacy . 
  i do n't pride on what my country did on the past . 
  i want a europe which is strong not to benefit ourselves alone , but to stand up for everyone else in the world , and that mean making calls for what we think is right and not only for what we think is good for us . 
  i do n't think europe is ready to do it , and neither is the eu . 
  we are not superior to the americans and look what power have done to them . 
  do n't count me in that ambition of yours to `` regain supremacy '' , we are seeing where those kind of enterprises end . 
  it recalls me to this the story of jack tueller : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvt3cmlzr_k not because of the same ending , but because the message is the same . 
  now , this is something i can get behind !, 
  so many nice moments . 
  i wish people could simply be able to confess to feel lonely , even if you are a `` tough guy '' . 
  i know . 
  i have some friends who have just started their phd there and have been screaming and running in circles the whole day . 
  i was very lucky and decided to not move to culham , otherwise that would be my case too . 
  well , pretty bad in both youth and general unemployment , yes . 
  jet is financed by euratom through eurofusion . 
  so it does n't matter of which it is part , if it does n't get money , it is not going to operate . 
  jet is one of the most important experiments of fusion in the world and it is financed by euratom and eurofusion . 
  not at all . 
  anti gmo and anti vaxx movements are completely different things , even if some people would be a part of both . 
  how do industry and job opportunities are created , then ? 
  if you can not see why andalusia would trade less with the rest of europe than , let 's say , catalonia , you should open a map and check the distance of huelva and barcelona to the french border . 
  why would a ship coming from china stop in cadiz , then move all the goods to france in a 1000 + km trip when you can simply download them in barcelona and take a fraction of it ? 
  andalusia trades with the eu with goods that can not be obtained , or not as easily , in the north of spain , such as vegetable products . 
  the only anomaly is madrid , and just because it is the capital city , thus many companies have their hq located there . 
  this is a part of the gravitational theory of trading and can be seen through history in all countries . 
  i never mentioned where it was started , but only where it gained track . 
  as an example , hayek was a british economist but his policies found support in the chicago school of economics instead of cambridge , where keynes was the most prominent figure in the topic . 
  you can see that the uk is actually very light , despite being the origin of it . 
  as for france , and correct me if i am wrong , please , a lot of people can disagree with the statement but they still vaccinate everyone so there is no anti-vaxx movement , because they still consider that the benefits outweigh the disadvantages . 
  well , now that is a eu i can root for . 
  count me in . 
  thank goodness the stupid anti-vaxx movement did n't catch much track here . 
  many factors but the most important is probably geographical location ; the same reason as why portugal is generally poorer that some parts of spain ( basque country , madrid or catalonia ) but of equal development of the parts which are closer to it ( galizia , extremadura , andalusia ) . 
  it is all about trade . 
  the north of spain is closer to europe , the south of spain is closer to africa . 
  the trade with europe is way more important in spain than the trade with africa . 
  as a historical example , andalusia was one of the richest in spain when all commerce to america was handled through its coasts . 
  the decline of andalusia came with the decline of trade with africa and america . 
  that recalls me to snow white 's evil queen . 
  he has great words , the best words . 
  they are * yuge * !, 
  leavers insulting eu citizens too . 
  you need two to dance . 
  probably the best argument in favor of the eu ever done . 
  first of all , my comment was a critic to treating human beings as mere numbers , like if helping them could be only considered if we also gain money . 
  now , about your comment :  bombs exploding i will assume that you mean people killed by islamic terrorists . 
  victims of terrorist attacks will always have my support , and that is why i support helping refugees , either abroad or here in europe . 
  these people live through that every single day of their lives . 
  out of 2 million refugees , how many attackers ? 
  most attackers were locals and had passport , so a ban on refugees would have done exactly nothing to prevent most of the attacks .

  add an insult to the crown . 
  tell everyone you 're getting jail time for insulting the crown and not for glorifying terrorism and asking people to kill eachother . 
  cry about it on the news !, 
  you 're a martyr !, 
  everybody believes you got jail time for insulting somebody when in reality you 're basically asking people to start another civil war !, 
  the marxist miracle !,

  i guess nuking people you do n't like is nice and ok up there , huh ? 
  we 're not catalans , deal with it , basementfolk . 
  i see you like holocaust denial !, 
  have you no shame ? 
  because this is / r/europe , land of basementfolk , eurocrats , federalists and orcs . 
  why is valencian not showing ? 
  we do n't like catalan cultural appropriation . 
  spanish is spoken in gibraltar and andorra as well . 
  at least de facto . 
  it was commissioned by a political party , the same political party that refused to sign a letter condemning the terrorist acts of niza , among others .

  ( you 're francoists ) . 
  this is fucked up on so many level , not only a personal attack to everyone who endured the dictatorship . 
  but i admit it 's catalan propaganda biggest 's success , brainwashing people into thinking the civil war and the dictatorship was a spain vs catalonia thing . 
  you 'll never get enough hate for this .

  the shock value of your mantras is long gone . 
  yeah i agree . 
  gender of words in german is pretty much guesswork . 
  in spanish it 's simple , mostly . 
  few exceptions . 
  further news : http://www.elnacional.cat/es/sociedad/magaldi-joven-testigos_137592_102.html apparently the people harassing the prosecutor claim that it does n't count as harassment . 
  ** translated transcript of the general provincial prosecutor of barcelona during an europapress conference ** ana : so , i said that after the penultimate session , i left the palace of justice i was accompannied by the coordinating prosecutor of technological felonies who then started going down the stairs , i stopped to light on a cigarrette i had spent too many hours without a smoke , and while i was turning on the cigarrette i could see what was going on in front of me , and the image that i saw was a group of twenty to thirty people , in the passage lluis companys behind some security barriers . 
  next to them , several tv cameras i ca n't assure how many , but there were many . 
  and slightly beyond the cameras i could see the three accusees ' back walking towars park ` de la ciudadela ' . 
  that made me think that few minutes earlier they might have been saluted or acclaimed or however you might want to call it , by these people and that they would go away now . 
  i started walking down the stairs on the second or third step i could start hearing yells of `` fora !, 
  meaning : `` out !, 
  out !, 
  out with spanish justice ! '', 
  in this moment , i realized that i could n't keep going down the stairs fast , with my head down and humiliated . 
  and precisely because of this , because i felt , in these moments that i represented a institution of the state , i stood up , firm , and looking at these people .

  there are mainly two reasons why we keep melilla : - it 's been part of spain since 1556 ( and before that , the city was created by people from the caliphate of cordoba ) . 
  - there are around 80,000 people living there who like being spaniards , and another 80,000 in ceuta , so i do n't see any reason for changing that . 
  and i 'm just saying that it 's easy to trivialize international problems when you are n't an interested party , but it 's also useless and tends to antagonize the other parties . 
  also , you 've failed at this reddit thingy , as every alusion to finnish territorial integrity should be answered with a reference to simo h\u00e4yh\u00e4 . 
  by the same reasoning , finland should become part of russia , as it would also solve many problems . 
  actually , most of them come from senegal , mali , ghana and mauritania ( even though most claim to be from cote d'ivoire or liberia for asylum reasons ) , and while none of them are places where i 'd like to live ( specially mauritania and mali ) they are n't remotely like somalia . 
  yeah , we could have a fight even between the capitals and the second cities of most autonomies : santiago vs vigo , oviedo vs gij\u00f3n , torrelavega vs santander , bilbao vs vitoria vs donostia ... we are such a lovely bunch . 
  yeah , but ww2 is a touchy subject , and on saturday night the happy people have better things to do than posting , so we only have the angry ones , the loners and the drunks , and we are picky . 
  i too think the subject is interesting , but i also think the title could be seem as offensive to other countries of europe who also did n't massacre their jewish population , like the swedish , the fascist from both italy and spain , the swiss , or your own country . 
  thanks , i looked in el pais and el mundo and neither of them gave the news the `` first page treatment '' that the guardian has . 
  in any case , lets hope it amounts to something . 
  that 's a very unexpected news , and while it 's weird that i have n't found anything about this in local media , i really hope it 's true , as we 've already suffered enough . 
  thank you for the translation . 
  off course , as switzerland is a sovereign entity . 
  but the problem with leaving efta would be that whenever any freight train wanted to leave switzerland it would be subjected to custom controls and import taxes ( as it would then be entering the free trade area ) , therefore making transport between italy and germany through switzerland slower and more expensive than simply going though austria or france . 
  i 'm sure that 's what they 'll want , but the eu probably wo n't allow them to cherry-pick which of the four `` european freedoms '' they want , if only for the domino effect it would have in the union ( for example , the richer countries would probably try to emulate switzerland and the poorer would re-nationalize their industries , effectively destroying the eu ), 
  does anybody know what will happen with the [ gotthard base tunnel ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gotthard_base_tunnel ) ? 
  as far as i know , without free trade through switzerland there 's no way it 'll ever be profitable . 
  you did n't have to study the [ 50 provinces ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_provinces_of_spain ) ? 
  i know that we spaniards have a terrible fame regarding fishing , but , at least according to [ wikipedia ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fishing_industry_by_country ) , in europe the captures by norway are three times the ones we do , iceland fishes twice what we do and even the danish fisheries are larger than ours , so could you provide a source that explains your claims ? 
  i mean , i know that in the past we 've had lots of problems with fishing in canadian and irish waters , and probably our fame comes from then , but since the nineties spain has n't behaved worse than other countries . 
  yes new master !, 
  anything to please you !, 
  you can buy as many ~ ~ ilegal ~ ~ villas , ~ ~ ruinous ~ ~ construction business and ex-public utilities ~ ~ filled with politicians who expect their cut ~ ~ as you want . 
  also , if you are fast , you may be able to grab one of our famous cajas !, 
  who knows what 's inside them !, 
   of course the european commission say it does n't . 
  they announced the dates they were going to come and `` investigate '' and of course that day , traffic flowed perfectly . 
  why do you assume that the european commission only used their delegate visit as proof ? 
  i mean , they are n't stupid , and neither is your government , who surely provided them with images and testimonies of the situation from their point of view . 
   it 's a huge shame , there are thousands of people putting up with the spanish 's government perfect smoke screen for their shitty economy , high unemployment and corruption . 
   why ca n't they just get over that gibraltarians do n't want to be spanish . 
  i 'm all for great neighbourly communication at the end of the day spain benefits from gibraltar just as gibraltar benefits from spain . 
  i 'm not sure that i agree that the relationship is mutually beneficial for both countries , as many of those thousands of people that work in gibraltar while living in spain then pay their taxes in one side of the border while demanding public services in the other . 
  also , while i thank you for those jobs , there are more than 5 millions of unemployed people in spain , so it 's not like those jobs are saving our economy . 
  finally , i totally agree with your assertion that gibraltarian people do n't want to be spanish , and that this is a smoke screen , but you should also understand that spain , as a country , also has some rights , and among them we 're able to control our frontiers and decide who can cross , through where and when . 
  edit : i have n't downvoted you , as while i disagree with you , you make good points . 
  as i said , i disagree with the controls , but the current situation in gibraltar-spain frontier is n't worse than in our other land frontiers with non-schengen countries ( morocco and andorra ) and it is n't worse than lots of other international crossings ( try crossing between ju\u00e1rez and el paso ) . 
  also , you say that `` this violates human rights and freedom of movement '' , but the european commission says it does n't , and i can tell you some possible explanations for that : first , because there 's no human right to cross a frontier without controls , and secondly , because even if the framework of the eu guarantees the free movement of people through its states ( art 21 of tfeu ) , the protection of that right does n't require the removal of custom controls , as for that we have the schengen agreement , a treaty that the uk freely decided not to sign . 
  thus , i agree that my government are being assholes , but being an asshole is n't illegal . 
   they do n't follow eu laws i disagree with the controls , mostly because they punish the poor , who must wait , while the rich can simply travel by boat , but the ec disagrees with you . 
  actually , the court just ruled that there was no criminal liability , thus a civil court must now determine the non-criminal liabilities . 
  also , of course we fucking remember and care !, 
  i still find oil in the beach where i 've spend most of my summers !, 
  glad to be of help . 
  also , good luck with the project , do you already know what estonian product will putin ban this time ? 
  actually , you are n't allowed to do that , as every country must respect freedom of [ transit ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/transit_passage ) ( trust me , if we could tax every ship that crosses the gibraltar strait , gibraltar , morocco and spain would be among the richest countries in the world ) . 
  edit : source . 
  if anyone is interested , this place is called `` los lagos de covadonga '' [ ( covadonga 's lakes ) ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lakes_of_covadonga ) , one of the nicest places in asturias ( and an awesome trekking route ) . 
  so , a group of 30 random people from some social ngos join for a chat in a random place and among them some propose that maybe they could try to become british and for that they could collect signatures . 
  please do n't post an article in a language that most people in / r/europe do n't understand and then editorialize the title so it looks like this is something official when it is n't . 
  yes , of course there are more reasons , but maybe , just maybe , if both sides started behaving like adults instead of like hooligans , maybe some issues could be solved , and hell , maybe then we 'd be able to solve irrelevant problems like the unemployment or the debt . 
  while i agree with your sentiment regarding intervention , i do n't really see how assad is more legitimate than any other dictator . 
  regarding perejil , i agree , keeping anything in the coast of africa but ceuta and melilla is an stupid expenditure , but calling the perejil incursion a war may be a little excesive . 
  also , the concept of the eez was stablished in 1982 , so obviously is not aplicable to 1976 . 
  regarding the 1997 action , it was stupid , as , as i said , spain does n't pretend the savage islands , only denies its eez ( we could argue ad infinitum about those claims , but probably we would n't reach an agreement ) then , regarding the 2005 `` incident '' those furtive fishermen were a bunch of assholes , and personally i think you should have acted like the russian navy ( shoot first , let the diplomacy solve it later ) also , the oil was found between lanzarote/fuerteventura and morocco , so in theory spain would have no need of territory to the north , also those low level flights and fishing incidents could be seen as a non acceptance of the current situation . 
  finally , it 's interesting how , according to your post in this thread , you assume that the spanish government airs these problems as a way of blowing off internal pressure ( i totally agree that 's the case regarding gibraltar ) , but in this case , is n't it the portuguese government who have unilaterally started its eez modification knowing it would cause a replica ? 
  i mean both countries economies are in the shitter , so maybe our government is n't the only one searching for an external enemy . 
  pd : i love portuguese language , it 's so easy to understand , yet so beautiful !, 
  so now not starting a war over the detention of some fishermen means our government accepts it ? 
  and also , it could also be said that that it 's amazing timing that portugal wants to expand its islands eezs just after the spanish and moroccans discover oil near the canary islands . 
  third paragraph of the linked article :  portugal said it wants to set up an exclusive economic zone off the coast of the savage islands , which , under the un convention of the law of the sea , would grant the country 12 nautical miles of territorial control around them and a claim to sovereign rights to explore , exploit , conserve and manage natural resources that exist within 200 nautical miles . 
  maybe the author is wrong , but that 's what it says , and it does n't state the savage islands eez as a fact , and neither does spain . 
  from the rediquette :  vote . 
  if you think something contributes to conversation , upvote it . 
  if you think it does not contribute to the subreddit it is posted in or is off-topic in a particular community , downvote it . 
  so you think explaining the spanish position does n't contribute to the conversation ? 
  well , in international law , when a country does n't oppose another country public actions it 's understood that the first country acquiesce such actions . 
  therefore , if spain claims that the savage islands do n't have an eez due to , according to your link , lack of a continental shelf and habitability of such islands , then it must diplomatically oppose the actions of portugal or it would be tacitly recognizing the portuguese claims , regarding both the existence of such continental shelf , and its habitability and therefore would , according to unclos , have to cede part of its own eez to portugal . 
  i do n't know nor care who 's right or who 's wrong , but , as i said , your claim that this does n't affect spain is wrong . 
  ( oh , and thank you for your downvote ), 
  so , if according to the article , neither country does currently have an eez in that area , then why did you editorialize the title by claiming spain is undermining such yet not existent eez ? 
  i mean , according to the link the only thing that has happened is that both portugal an spain claim the eez of some water and portugal has asked the un to clarify those matters , and that 's hardly a diplomatic conflict , that 's in fact how such a dispute should get solved . 
   this is something i do apologize for and admit i was wrong doing . 
  i will reverse them . 
  i only did such reactionary because i assumed you were doing the same to me , considering i was downvoted almost immediately after i posted . 
   but now i see that 's not the case , i 'll change it . 
  do n't worry , in fact i probably deserve some of those downvotes , as i may have been too `` in your face '' and also you do n't deserve your downvotes ( i gave you none of them , some lurker probably did ) . 
  also , while it 's evident that you and i have very different positions in these matters ( and it seems mine , while worse argumented than yours seems to be favoured in r/europe ) , i 'm glad to have had this conversation , as you seem well versed in the military history of europe and your reasoning hold lots of true . 
  have a nice day . 
  do you know where is spain and where is morocco ? 
  for an air strike in morocco and in algeria , spain would n't need any logistical capability ( not even air refueling ) , we would n't need your inteligence capabilities ( having your satellite capabilities would be nice , but we have huge humint and signit deployed there ) also , i 'm not sure how the fact that france wanted to save some money by passing you the bill means that they could n't do it by themselves , hell , when the falklands were invaded the uk was able to to fend off the argentinians by themselves in a different continent , because obviously a country will use every single resource when need arises ( the uk felt the integrity of its territory and the life of its citizens threatened ) , but wo n't break the piggy for defending some stupid country in bum-fuck africa . 
  also , regarding other of your points , what `` active defence '' does the us have in europe right now ? 
  while it 's true that during the cold war there were thousands of hundreds of us personnel in europe , right now most of your operations in our continent are simple pit stops for transport aircraft ( i think aviano , rammstein ) . 
  finally , as all of my post relate to this topic , i want an explanation about why did you downvote every single one of them only because you disagree with me . 
   yeah dude , totally fucking roll over every country in north africa . 
  you 're completely right bro . 
  / s as i said , if we needed to , we 'll do it , what you fail to understand is that we do n't need to do it because they are not a menace to us , in fact they are one of our closest allies but yeah , our 150 combat fighters ( f-18 and eurofighter ) , 5 aegis frigates and 6 ohp would be able to destroy the 40 or so fighters that morocco uses and the 70 that algeria have ( but we wo n't , because it would n't make any fucking sense ) . 
  if putin really wanted us death he 'll simply nuke us , and for that , our eurofighters would be quite useless . 
  sorry to burst your bubble , but the last time any spanish peninsular territory was invaded was in 1812 , and the last time any spanish territory was invaded by a world power was in 1898 ( and it was you ) so i 'm not sure how nato , funded in 1949 , has saved us spaniards from anything ( hell , you financed the dictator that ruled my country for at least two decades and even our fascist dictator had better relationships whit the soviets than you did ) . 
  but let 's talk about the threats to europe : - we border northern africa , and yes , they are an unruly lot , but they lack any military power , so they 're not a military threat to us ( if needed , my own country air force could destroy every single aircraft and ship from morocco and algeria , the only real military power in northern africa would be egypt , because you give them a shit ton of weapons , and they are too worried about israel to care about europe ) . 
  - then we have `` the evil east '' , those nefarious countries such as russia , ukraine or belarus , and while those countries all have huge armies , all of them lack any kind of power projection , so even if they decided to attack us they could only nuke us ( and for that , nothing you can do would protect us , specially not your `` anti missile shield '' ) . 
  but you know what 's the funny thing about those two threats ? 
  they all prefer to commerce with us instead of fighting us , so maybe the soft power does in fact , work . 
  also , you point at srebrenica , and you are totally right , we europeans dropped the ball and let milosevic kill tens of thousands of people in `` our backyard '' , it 's a shameful point in the history of europe , and we should work together so it never happens again , but well , at least we did n't sell him the weapons like you did in your backyard with pinochet , with the argentinian junta or with the contra , so i 'm not sure how you can claim any moral superiority . 
  finally , we , the eu , do n't border the middle east , turkey does and right now they do n't seem very interested in promoting peace and love . 
  between 2000 and 2013 there has n't been a single military menace to europeans , so of course we do n't need to spend that much , and for a counterpoint to this opinion piece , it could be said that we 've been able to maintain our safety and freedom for a far cheaper price than you americans , so maybe it 's you should stop spending like you 're in the middle of the cold war . 
  also , of course the balkans spend less now than in 2000 , they were still paying the bills for their nineties parties , and obviously the baltic and eastern europe also spent more in the nineties , as they were justifiable scared of the russians . 
  yeah , yesterday i felt dirty having to watch 13tv and intereconom\u00eda to get informed ( channels similar to fox ) while every other channel was worried with stupid crap like big brother . 
  in my school it was mentioned and so was the utrecht treaty and the lack of agreement between franco and hitler about an invasion during wwii , but not much beyond that .

  is this also a thing in the workplace ? 
  i 've always found it annoying that it is taboo to know each other salaries . 
  we need to know the market to avoid being ripped off . 
  in spain we have what 's known as a `` puente aereo '' ( air bridge ? ), 
  between madrid and barcelona , meaning a regular flight with as much frequency as a bus service ( 25 times a day ) . 
  i 'd assume it 's popular since it 's existed as long as i can remember . 
  out of curiosity , if you had to choose some names , which famous norwegians would you expect to be known abroad ? 
  yep !, 
  is n't my flag showing ? 
  i 'm on mobile so i ca n't check . 
  basically i 'm ok with any name whose pronunciation fits spanish regular pronunciation . 
  erik ? 
  saga ? 
  yeah , sure . 
  fuck that , i 'd be condemning them to a life of `` how is that spelled/pronounced '' ? 
  bullfighting definitely . 
  places to hear flamenco and other traditional music are very niche , the ones i know in my city cather almost exclusively to tourists . 
  pop musicians that fit the latin lover stereotype ( enrique iglesias , chayanne , etc ) are hand tailored to fit the foreigners criteria of what a spanish man looks like . 
  i would n't say they 're hated , they 're just not exactly genuine . 
  if a restaurant openly announces tapas in the front , it 's almost certainly shitty overpriced food for tourists . 
  traditionally tapas are served for free in a bar to accompany your drink . 
  there are some fast food chains now selling the same kind of food ( la sure\u00f1a , 100 montaditos and others ) but other than that it screams tourist trap . 
   we do n't really learn a lot of geography in school . 
  we can guess which continent a country belongs to , but not learning their capitals by heart . 
  i actually did that several times for europe . 
  tests involved a blank map , with borders drawn . 
  i ca n't remember if we ever did it with the whole world . 
  / u/enelade gives a good answer . 
  in spain , due to cultural differences , we have far less taboos when speaking . 
  if you see someone fat , you could say to you friend `` mira a ese gordo '' and no one would think twice about it . 
  same for someone being asian or black . . is that xenophobia ? 
  well , we have probably the most integrated muslim community in western europe , with 2 million immigrants and citizens happy to leave here and it 's not ever considered a problem . 
  the extreme right is non practically non existent . 
  i am yet to see a single person protesting against helping refugees , most people are angry that we are n't doing more to help them . 
  all those aspects of culture matter , in my mind , waaay more - americans will raise hell for seeing a comedian using black face to portray a famous black person , but will be ok with the disproportionately harsher sentences being given to black people in their home country . 
  we are `` culturally insensitive '' but we will protest when a person is actually suffering discrimination . 
   vet inte  vene that drove me mad when i started learning swedish !, 
  i used audio lessons and duolingo and at no point do they warn you that those kind of contractions exist . 
  i tried listening to the audios while reading the written version and i just could n't manage to tell the syllables apart haha, 
  side question : at which level of formality do contractions stop being accepted ? 
  i always wonder . 
  like , are they ok in a technical manual/book ? 
  what about an exam ? 
   what about all the little chinese shops you see everywhere in spain , they are great when you need to buy beer law at night just a shame that you can only buy cigarettes in specialized stores . 
  keep in mind that chinese immigration to spain is quite recent . 
  those shops were n't a thing just 15 years ago ... 
  i 'm starting to see chinese girls on tinder though . 
   also the attack against `` zionist hollywood '' wtf , so racism is fine if it 's against jews or what ? 
  i 'm afraid you 'll get the same answer all xenophobic people give . 
  `` it 's not the race , it 's a culture/ethnicity/religion / nation '' . 
  apparently the point is driven as far as skin color goes , but it 's missed on all other kinds of arbitrary discrimination . 
   this was something , that occurred in southern countries during the financial crisis , too , but my impression is that it is an ongoing idea in britain . 
  just to clarify : in spain at least , the narrative was `` germany rules the eu , and they push their ideology ( austerity ) because they do n't realize its human consequences here / it 's better for their economy '' . 
  the `` conquering europe '' and hitlerish narrative you mention have never been a thing , nor have the germans ever been perceived as evil . 
  since the rest is already answered :  what 's the general public opinion on being a foreign exchange student ? 
  is it viewed as radical , or prestigious , or a bad idea ? 
  we have the erasmus program over here , where a uni student can spend a year studying their degree in another eu country , and pretty much everyone take the chance , so we 're quite used to it . 
  it 's not radical , prestigious , or anything like that , it 's really really common . 
  it 's just nice to see a different culture and travel , kind of a long vacation . 
  no , i meant kirgu\u00eds jamala . 
  it was just spain trying to be modern and leaving the choice to internet votes . 
  iran is viewed as a poor country with a backwards ideology . 
  saudi arabia is viewed as a rich country with a backwards ideology . 
  that 's about it . 
  it is common to point out the hypocrisy in treating the rich backwards guy better , although at the same time i 've seen some people talking about visiting sa to see the luxury . 
  fun fact : during that whole festival , `` viva polonia '' ( long live poland ) was top trending topic in spain . 
  for me it 's loreen , alexander rivak , lordi . 
  in that order .

  current parlament : - pp : center right . 
  it groups economically conservative people , capitalist liberals and religious / morally traditional people . 
  until ciudadanos appeared , it was the monolithic party where everything right wing was fused . 
  - ciudadanos : new center right party . 
  claim to be a break with the old way of making politics and a center party , but they usually vote in line with the pp , so they are currently struggling to get their own identity and are considered just the same old dog with new leash . 
  - psoe : center left . 
  the last time they were in power they did alright with social reforms ( legalizing gay marriage for example ) but they handled * disastrously * the economic crisis , refusing to even acknowledge its existence , and have n't recovered since then . 
  the party is currently broken between those who want to join forces with other left parties and secesionists , and those who want them to lean center and even pact with the right wing . 
  - unidos podemos : podemos is a new left wing party , that rose from the 15m movement against corruption and bipartidism , in a similar fashion the occupy movements . 
  they are accused of using populist rethoric . 
  izquierda unida is an old left-wing party . 
  they run together as unidos podemos . 
  they are against austerity , support the defense of social rights ( education , health , pensions ) and want to stablish a guaranteed minimum income , among other measures . 
  - secesionist/national parties : they are present in several regions that want to become their own countries ( most notably catalonia and the basque country ) . 
  each one has their own political leaning . 
  i 'm in madrid . 
  half an hour in the subway , reading or redditting . 
  downtime activities ... whatever you want . 
  this is a city of 6 million , if your hobby is putting fruit stickers into curtains you will find fruit sticker curtain meetups . 
  with an exotic fruits performance every weekend . 
  it appears relatively frequently in my search results . 
  it seems to be like yahoo answers but way less sucky . 
  i know , i 've got plenty of friends abroad and it 's never been a problem to get a point across , but i 'd still like to learn a nice accent/pronunciation . 
  i feel like i write 100 times better than i speak , and it 's frustrating . 
  see ? 
  there we are again haha . 
  all of those sound the same in my head . 
  i do n't even know if i should be paying attention at how much time the sound lasts , at the tone , at the pitch ... 
  yeah , apparently the way the army was deployed was a giant overkill precisely to impress the moroccan forces and keep them from fighting back , to avoid bloodshed . 
  but it also was a real gift to the press , that got pictures of a massive deployment over a little rock to mock the government .

  praise the new caliph , the return of holy sufist islam to turkey !, 
  / s i 'm really wishing this would n't be how turkey falls , but everything ataturk has done is for nothing . 
  ` practical ' meaning shooting immigrants on boats that are known to collapse . 
  simply pointing out that flaw , you 're advocating murder and violating human rights and the un charter . 
  what the fuck do you think finland is ? 
  north korea ? 
  i 'm turkish and catalan and i 've been seeing between the lines to see how practical we can get . 
  not only are you being a bigoted ignorant shit , you 're being one hell of an egotistical cunt . 
  so we should shoot poor people wanting a better life ? 
  kill them in the sea ? 
  you 're a reactionary fucker who only sees murder as the proper way . 
  i 'm fucking glad finland is better than you for this , you do n't deserve any power . 
  i 've lived in the worst of the worst ; afghanistan , sudan , tunisia , algeria , somalia , etc. , what have you done ? 
  lived comfortably in your home in helsinki ? 
  comforted with the fact you have a socialized system ? 
  you know nothing , ramblinrambo . 
  edrogan : bringing back the ottomans and shitting on the ataturk since 2003 . 
  sorry , we do n't want to become america . 
  do n't worry , bezb , you 're still an awesome mod imo . 
  sorry , we do n't like jingoists like you . 
  we 're not the us-mexico border , we 're the european fucking union . 
  you want to kill someone simply for being an immigrant , i 'm glad you 're not even remotely in power . 
  you 're fucked in the head , mate . 
  that guy ai n't right in the head , a lot of his things are pretty fucking extreme . 
  * you 'll never take my mead and wine away , soul-stealing milk drinkers !, 
  this sounds infinitely better than constantinople or istanbul . 
  transnistria can into putin, 
  would it be a similar analogy of going to an irish pub , downing as much booze as possible , and trying to dine-and-dash ? 
  i never implied we should become more like india . 
  i said there 's possibility that multiculturalism can work with effort . 
  unlike people saying we should segregate or become a monoculture . 
  and the partition was because india kicked them out ? 
  last i checked , the muslims wanted their own dominion because they believe the hindu 's would discriminate against them . 
  yeah , i felt a bit excited but then i kinda realized it 's india . 
  not exactly the best country , and it 's gon na probably take centuries for things to actual stabilize . 
  just hoping for a better future , mate . 
  i 'm completely for a european federation with these points : * an eighth schedule-like system similar to india 's that recognizes each european language . 
  allows them to be used at local and regional levels . 
  in return , english would be the official language of the entire union . 
  effectively allows states to have their own language , and keep our business end professional and comprehensive to foreign nationals . 
  * states divided between cultures and nationality . 
  catalonia , occitania , flanders/walloonians , etc. 
  in return , each state would conglomerate into a regional federation ( i.e. 
  iberian federation , scandinavia , britannia , etc. ), 
  * a pan-european model of economics modeled akin to the nordic model with a sovereign wealth fund . 
  * a strong , well-prepped european army with a twist . 
  our general army would be strong and advanced with some branches . 
  we 'd have our soldiers double as construction workers , akin to how the romans did with their frontier fortresses . 
  a swell , a gendarmerie and a european foreign legion . 
  effectively we 'd have well-trained soldiers and great labour sources to mix with civilians . 
  * what monarchies remain in europe would become a holy roman empire-esque elective monarchy . 
  effectively , an 'em peror/empress ' that all of europe can look to for pride and stability under . 
  a light in shining darkness . 
  * a great , progressive foreign policy designed to help european interests and her allies . 
  for our non-european allies , we 'd send strong peacekeeping forces when asked . 
  as well , humanitarian aid combined with a combined force to make sure it reaches target and is distributed correctly . 
  * with the united kingdom within the federation , it opens up greater possibilities for relations . 
  with an aim towards creating a commonwealth realm , it 'd give us a long-term edge over other powers . 
  though this wo n't have a schengen area , it 'd be a step towards a unified europe and a realm of partners . 
  * the federal commonwealths of africa . 
  with the surge of african immigrants across spain , italy , etc. , there 'd be a referendum . 
  if we had to , we 'd come back to africa to ` recolonize ' them without the same mistakes our ancestors did . 
  if they want european-like stability , they 'll be doing it on our terms . 
  an african realm that , over the span of decades or even a century , would be slowly remodeled with federal commonwealths that enforces universal human rights . 
  build an africa that 'd unite with us to create an even more powerful federation . 
  the fca would be divided into five specific federations : north , south , east , west , and central . 
  commonwealths would be shaped based on cultural , national , and linguistics . 
  no more half-assed cut up and run . 
  we 'll do this the hard way if necessary . 
  * the russian question . 
  with a unified european federation that sees a fine line from turkey to finland to ukraine and belarus , we 'd apply pressure on russia . 
  tough sanctions , squeeze the oligarchs by the balls . 
  as jingoistic and dangerous as this sounds , collapsing the russian federation may be the only way to end the shitfest it 's been since the decline of the ussr . 
  once broken , the federation would begin a slow , thoughtful process of helping the russians . 
  as we slowly bring russians into the fold , deprogram and have them change into proper europeans . 
  depending on public opinion , it 's either we stop at the urals or march on towards vladivostok . 
  as we go , we 'd create new federations and states until russia is now part of us . 
  * the [ atlantropa ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/atlantropa ) project would be resurrected to connect africa and europe together . 
  however , unlike the racist attitudes during its construction , this one would be designed to help the ef and the fca come together far closer than before . 
  new lands for us to relieve pressures of overpopulation , and hopefully pave a permanent tie between africa and europe . 
  * immigration policy . 
  in the extremely unlikely possibility that the commonwealth realms , fca , and european federation are formed in this image , it 'd require a greater policy . 
  a comprehensive immigration designed to help people integrate with the regional culture and language while making sure they can stand on their own two feet . 
  * a system devised to help record and collect cultures , languages , and practices for the future . 
  even as languages gradually die out , we 'd have ways to study them for time to come . 
  as this way , we 'd allow our descendants to learn from a world wholly unlike their own . 
  * a strong anti-corruption board . 
  nobody wants to see europe or a potential federation collapse to corruption like spain , portugal , italy , or greece . 
  methods to fight back against and minimize corruption would be emplaced . 
  * and lastly , for the time being , a pan-european constitution that allows freedom of speech , religion , expression , etc. , with no way to abridge or manipulate it . 
  it can be amended , but they 're firmly grounded . 
  this way , we can have the freedom we all desire with a guarantee that no one can take it from you . 
  even if this is n't completely what i believe in , this feels like an acceptable amount to convey to everyone how i 'd want to see europe go . 
  ** [ wish fulfillment intensifies ] **, 
  the sami called , they want their own union please . 
  too bad turkey would tell you to back off , it 's istanbul now . 
  no matter how much you want it to , it ai n't changing . 
  so nyah !, 
  that 's a thing i love about india . 
  it proves that diversity and multiculturalism works !,

  i do n't care about animals , i do n't agree with prohibitions , but as a spaniard , bullfighting ashame me , because it tells a lot about ( some of ) our people, 
  25 % of the scots who voted leave the eu , prefer to be in the single market than in the uk . 
  that 's cold, 
  true , i welcomed the superhero trend to stop the fantasy/dystopian teenager love drama trend and i immediately regret my decision . 
  as someone who has always like the nordic mythos i hope this viking trend in media die off soon . 
  i did n't even read the whole title , i just saw spain and start reading comments . 
  just for information what result could that hypothetical referendum probably have ? 
  it actually affects me , when they send me to another city , i have to get up 2 hours early and come back even later . 
  not that its going to change anything at this point , but at least i know i 'm in the right . 
  spain more gdp than canada and italy , i do n't need to look at the date to know we are talking about the year 1 b.c. 
  before crisis . 
  i read otherwise in the thread , my bad . 
  everything is cool then . 
  because is just the symbol of communism , while the nazi flag is the symbol of nazi germany . 
  if you want to talk about the totalitarian ideology you have the fascim symbol which in spain is part of the uniform of the [ guardia civil ] ( http://images.teinteresa.es/espana/nuevo-uniforme-guardia-civil_tinima20110915_0489_18.jpg ), 
  i do n't mind but its not consistent with the ban on the nazi flag . 
  is this a joke ? 
  it looks so good that marvel copy the [ royal uniform ] ( http://blog.adlo.es/images/2011/12/umvc3houseofmmagneto.jpg ) for [ magneto ] ( http://estaticos03.elmundo.es/elmundo/imagenes/2012/02/24/navegante/1330107044_0.jpg ) . 
  i got envious i went to see what happened in spain in 1066 ... [ 1066 granada massacre ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1066_granada_massacre ) sweet jesus !, 
  biggest jew killing in europe before the holocaust . 
   the ** direct ** will of the people do n't delete pls , parliament is a scam , a rigged system where you can not vote what you want . 
  a referendum is a direct question `` do you want out of the eu ? '', 
  `` yes '' `` so fucking be it '', 
  going against the result of a referendum , the direct will of the people . 
  literally the worst possible outcome . 
  so what does poland need to do to be fully westernized ? 
  i 'm honestly asking . 
   i do n't think the us is much better than russia or china . 
  but they are . 
  sure they are not anglels but they are better than fucking russia and better than fucking china , come on now . 
  how many more times do we need to read the same shit ? 
  i kind of think like that too because i always thought that in the last moment people will vote `` status quo '' but with brexit there is no `` status quo '' option . 
  whatever you choose , everything will change . 
  its weird , im 50/50 if nothing changes but i would assume that may will have a play yet to make before the vote and can sway it in her favor . 
  all those things about `` fighting for freedom '' `` choosing to be a dane '' sounds pretty good , it flatters some ego and it does a very good job at appealing to emotion . 
  but honesty it lacks of any intellectual or logic behind it . 
  no arguments were given for any definition of nationality we know of . 
  no offense but the real problem you guys have is the voting system , bipartidism or bust is not a good way to handle democracy . 
  how is gender theory not controversial . 
  some people need to get out of their bubble . 
  social science is not science this stuff has no place in school , period . 
  you want to teach those theories , perfect , get a plataform , do your work , bother people who want to hear you , whatever . 
  but , let 's have political and social doctrines far away from our education system . 
  thanks for the clarification . 
  that stuff has no place in the schools , kids already receive enough indoctrination as it is . 
  actually , i almost got run over by one this monday , i was walking down a pedestrian only street with some friends and i just notice a sound like a bycicle so i didnt care to look even though you could notice the vibration of the ground , my friends pull me out of the way , and it was a fucking electrical van . 
  if they become a thing its going to be hard adjusting . 
  25 % of foreign doctors do seem like a problem and there is nothing wrong to invest in your medic school so you produce more doctors instead of importing them . 
  the wording though is concerning . 
  people is reading too much into this . 
  fmi get things wrong all the time for ** all the countries ** spain forecast was half point less than what they say now ; they say they have been overly pesimistic ** with everyone ** the only one who get less than they thought is france . 
  i do n't know why the guardian makes it all about britain . 
  it will be a non-non-governmental organization very usefull much solidarity . 
  this decade ? 
  that 's actually something no to brag about . 
  how sad it is that this is the best comment on this thread . 
  i literally do n't know who these people are , and why are always on the press ; i just learned that west is an actual musician . 
  pretty bad , but i would n't want it any other way . 
   but how could you oppose ... 
  the cancer of this century debates . 
  it 's because `` muh equiality '' , it makes no sense , euros to pr , its like watching an ad but you paid for it . 
  the place where he 'd find a job quickly and get well paid it would be a major city , which besides language there is no culture shock at all ; they are all the same . 
   ciudadanos , and pray that they can purge the pp 's corruption as much as they can ( which means not much , but better than nothing ) i 'm an atheist , i do n't pray to things going my way , also i do n't believe in the free market magics of c 's and also i do n't believe that they have any desire to reform pp . 
  the reality is that they accept rajoy as the president , setting aside that everyone close to him ; barbera , ana mato , rato , de la serna , soria , ar\u00edstegui , barcenas and on an on have a proven corruption scandal . 
  ** no fucking way ** my vote is going to get near those people ; that would be conceding to this scum who made me wish we had chinese law ( death penalty for corruption ), 
  i 'm the kind of guy who thinks that you should always vote , but right now ? 
  there is no way . 
  i 'm fucking powerless and depressed . 
  whatever happens with psoe now if you go to vote next election you are : a ) supporting corruption , totally in your face , like ; yeah do whatever you want , there is no backlash , you can keep governing whatever horrible bullshit you do . 
  b ) supporting independent movements that held spanish congress hostage with a minority of votes . 
  i am personally in favor of independece if they have a good majority , but i wo n't bend to a hostage situation , when is clear that the rest of spaniards are against it . 
  and there is no other way about it . 
  any vote in the next election will go to ** a ** or ** b ** . 
  ** i literally can not vote now **, 
  it 's a terrible idea , but for each uk flag saying that , a new person gets keen on the idea . 
  i think i 've never shake hands with a woman . 
  i mean i do n't have anything against it , but there is n't any custom that requires it here . 
  its european sterotypes , you silly, 
  ok thanks . 
  i guess they thought they could get away with it because she agreed to have sex with two of them and then she wouldnt dare to denounce or nobody would take her seriously . 
  and just like that you have 5 guys , sportsmen , well off , showing their true color just because they thought they could get away with it . 
  that makes me think about how many closeted psycopaths we have in our midst and how many of them do get away with their crap . 
  also i 'm mad that the last guy who in my view did even worse gets a lesser punishment . 
  at my job almost every woman drink tea instead of coffee ( i do n't get it btw ), 
   western europe has progressed more and currently way way better place than poland . 
  debatable , i do n't think western europe has progressed much in this past 20/30 years while poland has . 
  so you say that you have been living in the uk for few years , so i take you have some years under your belt , i thought at first that you are at `` that '' age and at `` that '' phase . 
  also to not feel like an oddball about point 3 ) , you will have to live in morocco or jordan or something like that ( and even so ... ) . 
  in fact , as a no drinker myself , i would say that spain or italy are the few places in europe where that is not a social handicap . 
  only that britain has left the eu mainly because immigration , australia leave boat people stranded in an island and there is candidate in the us a bomb away to become president whose big policy is to build a wall at the border . 
  and i think it should be in a country that is not in nato . 
   `` each one of this reds dots is an anti-islamic tweet '' oh no !, 
  call the cops !, 
  the army !, 
  wo n't somebody please think of the children ? 
  ok , you are being ridiculous now, 
   `` when i started to watch these dramas , i realised how tired i was with all the violence and sex of american tv . '', 
  i know i am , the `` fight '' scenes are sameshit all the time i usally check internet on my phone while i hear the `` thud `` s and `` plank `` s of the fights . 
  and the sex scenes are even more retarded , there is 3 types ; sexual tensions that will always be resolved , wife gets depressed and cheat on husband or just tits and asses for the masses got style . 
  still i would n't touch a soap not even with a stick .

  what the hell is that . 
  whoops !, 
  you have n't given me a single example of the terrifying brainwashing catalan school . 
  this comment of yours has been like a surrender . 
  you ended up giving the same pointless points evey spaniard , and only a spaniard , as no one in europe thinks like you would give . 
   but this argument in the whole is pointless then why you spent those 3 hours and those 40 paragraphs ? 
  duh  all these efforts from the part of so many citizens here are going to waste . 
  manifestations , t-shirt designs , museum expositions , debates , everything is just so damn pointless ... why do n't you just give up ? 
  efforts going to waste ? 
  everything is pointless ? 
  give up ? 
  this demonstrates you know nothing about what the hell is going on in catalonia yet you do a god damn 40 paragraph long thread about it . 
  the amount of hate your last comment reflects is bigger than i could ever imagine from a `` catalan '' . 
  talking about social pressure ? 
  what social pressure ? 
  and give me a damn example of a corrumped text book . 
  you talk a lot about a lot of things and you have n't given a single source . 
  you ... you looked like a brainwashed . 
  tell me , what have you lived/seen/suffered ? 
  you have seen text books ? 
  okay , these text books have been aproved by the central government so if they do n't even ban the `` tales '' we teach here it must mean there are not such tales . 
  you are paranoic . 
   edit : i never wanted to spark such a violent and hateful discussion , mainly provoked by independentists that downvote en masse everything they do n't support , no matter how elaborate it is . 
  dude , not even in the apology edit you leave us alone . 
  it is hard for me to believe that all the 15 upvotes of my comment which is at the top are from independentists brainwashed zombies of the upvote/downvote . 
  i would like to think other people in reddit have their opinion . 
  yet again unlegitimizating and undervaluing other people 's opinion . 
  i have n't seen a single comment agreeing with you or repsonding to our brainwashed comments upvoted by the independentist brigade of the upvote . 
  there has to be a reason for that , has n't it ? 
  i have only downvoted you 3 times . 
  i bet you have downvoted me more than that , but whatever : http://imgur.com/nm1jvhc, 
  then come join us at the eu , folks !, 
  together we are stronk !, 
  it is not called repression , lol . 
  it is called dignity and having sense of shame . 
  i am not telling you what to do . 
  you talked about the things you were interested in , and the things you were interested that the people read . 
  i am more than sure that in this subreddit there are more pro-union ( spaniards ) than pro-independence . 
  it is not like we are a brigade of salty catalans downvoting everything which does n't adjust to our thoughts . 
  you can make 2 conlcusions : the pro-independence support of the catalans is even bigger than you thought or the rest of the spaniards do not give a shit . 
  i believe it is the first one . 
  you say your posts are -4 because of the slaty independentists , but if i 'm not wrong there is more people than spaniards in reddit . 
  are they also brainwashed or corrumpted ? 
  how is it that not most comments pro-independence but pro-democracy are completely upvoted and comments like yours are not ? 
  oh my fucking god ... 
  not only portuguese history , i am afraid . 
  if it 's your opinion then you ca n't say you are a `` neutral observator '' . 
  dude , this post is the definition of demagogy , a word that you have used against me in a discussion above . 
  you positionate yourself as neutral yet you only talk about few things and completely ignore others . 
  you are trying to sell / r/europe all these bunch of personal opinions from a clearly unionist person under the tag `` neutral '' and `` objective '' . 
  at this point i would even delete the post if i were you because every comment you do here dicredits the thread . 
  no , it has been voted right because you have positioned youself as `` neutral '' , which is an absolute lie . 
  people think this post sums up what has happened in catalonia in the past and what 's happnening in the present but it is not . 
  this dude is n't independentist , that 's for sure . 
  the thing is that probably is n't even from catalonia . 
   independentist manipulation wtf ... 
   nor do you know how deep the history of catalonia i have studied i have figured it out . 
   what you say about nationalism is completely and utterly wrong . 
  nationalism in the modern sense is only a cultural construct that exists since two centuries ago and is bound to disappear again . 
  go tell a scott they are english , go tell an american they are brits , go tell youself , as a spaniard , that you are mexican . 
  nationalism has existed since ever . 
  maybe i should call it patriotism , actually , that was my bad . 
  what i 'm trying to say is that people are how they are for a reason . 
  it is not arbitrary . 
  as a catalan i 'm 100 % proud of all the things my country has done , all the battles , the wars . 
  i have heroes , just as lots of brits would consider churchill as a national heroe , for example . 
  however , i give 0 shits about what spain has done . 
  colonize and anihilate more people than the nazis did during the holocaust in south america ? 
  i would be ashamed . 
  the funny thing is that today is spain 's national day and you celebrate that , the fact that today more than 500 years ago , the majority of the population that were living there had their death sentences signed . 
  you are making a huge mistake thinking that nationalisms or sentiments must adjust to the borders and jursidictial limitations we currently have . 
  it is totally the other way around . 
  the borders and the countries in the world must adjust their limits to the ones the people demand . 
   also , `` every word you say , every sentence '' is an insult to my post , my intelligence and a complete act of demagogy , and i request you got that back off unless you write three posts at least as long as i have done , to at least demonstrate the thing `` every word you say , every sentence '' . 
  i do n't know how can you take this as an insult . 
  you are telling me to back off because my posts are n't as long as yours . 
  well , here you have : huwdgveoweybfenf8uhre0f8yb0r8efbher8hfv90wksmedwe dwue9hfd98wehrfrewferfnerufnwunrefuwernfunwerfubewr8fy 9whjed9hweudnwunefuhwreufhweunfun bullshit bullshit bullshit bla bla bla . 
  when saying `` every word you say , every sentence '' , i 'm just showing my disagreement towards your `` completely scientific and empiric post with no sources '' . 
  if you are that arrogant and selfish to take it personal it is none of my business . 
  also , i ca n't find where the demagogy is in there , to be honest , but personally making a 3000 words long post to say the least from a `` neutral position '' which underestimates and undervalues the independentist movement and the catalan people has more demagogy in it than whatever i have written that has bothered you so much . 
  edit : want some demagogy ? 
  here you have : [ what they want you to see ] ( https://twitter.com/aliciascamacho/status/521271508124307456/photo/1 ) . 
  [ what they do n't ] ( https://twitter.com/pilarcarracelas/status/521301187027808256/photo/1 )  the airport thing was just a small detail that in no way has a big influence over the importance competition between bcn and madrid . 
  and yes , i 'm in favor in having more int . 
  flights from here . 
  how the hell does this have no big influence ? 
  it is all about opening to the world . 
  every non european citizen which wants to go to barcelona , for business or tourism , has to flight to madrid first . 
  and viceversa . 
  i am telling you again , you should have left that airport thing buried because it ca n't help you in any way . 
  i have n't insulted you . 
  and of course i use the word `` opression '' there 's no better word for it . 
  and if you think there has been opression only during the xxth century you have just confirmed you have no idea what you are talking about and that the whole text is garbage . 
  it is so hard for me to believe that this thing has been written by someone who consider himself `` a catalan '' ( judging by the flair ) . 
  but who knows , everyone can pick any flair so i could take a uk flair and do a post like that telling bullshit while you say you are * neutral *, 
  there ca n't be brainwhash because what is taught in catalonia is pacted between catalonia and the central government . 
  you are trying to say that in catalonia we can make up everything we teach like '' we won wwii alone '' and it is just not true . 
  the history we teach in catalonia is the same that they teach in the uk or in germany ... 
  main objective of the post : convince all / r/europe that the catalan movement for the independence is just another evil move by mas to get i do n't know what . 
  all those 1.5 milion catalans who have been concentrating in the streets 3 years in a row were just government puppets who were obliged to manifestate their claim for independence by force against their will to stay in spain .

  not much more . 
   t 's an ideologic and ban of free speech problem . 
  exactly !, 
  that 's why i expected a great outrage outside catalonia too . 
  not catalanist , but catalan . 
   ( 1 ) inter - and intra-ethnic bullying are just as common in ethnically heterogeneous as in homogeneous classes ;  ( 3 ) the prevalence of inter - and intra-ethnic bullying depends on the level of ethnic diversity in the class ; inter-ethnic and intra-ethnic bullying increase with increasing levels of ethnic diversity . 
  is n't this a contradiction ? 
  i meant not catalan ones ... edit : wow !, 
  manuela carmena has just said she will also not attend , as puigdemont and colau !, 
  hey , i 'm still waiting for the outrage of spanish politicians and intellectuals against this attack to freedom of speech . 
  how many of those spanish democrats have been outraged by the prohibition of * estelades * on this sunday final ? 
  republik deutsch\u00f6sterreich or deutsch-\u00d6sterreich was the name of your country ... ( republic of german east kingdom , or german east kingdom ), 
  i 'm not italian , but i equally get outraged . 
  what are you , a usian in disguise ? 
  better than the other option . 
  catalonia ? 
  flamenco and bullfighting , innit ? 
  ( sorry , i know technically that 's not a single sentence ), 
  well , what you `` see '' has been demonstrated to not be what happens . 
  are you really denying catalan has been prohibited / attacked / prosecuted for the most part of last centuries ? 
  or are you saying you can oppress someone during years , then stop , and do n't allow them to get any compensation , because the oppression , supposedly , is over ? 
  that 's not the kind of attack i 'm talking about . 
  i 'm talking about prohibitions . 
  were n't you told about it on school ? 
  nueva planta decrees , for example . 
   if a language needs to be defended it means it is useless if a language needs to be defended it means it has been attacked ( for centuries ) . 
  it has alwasy . 
  it 's been quite largely demonstrated that , it does n't matter how many roads you have , traffic will tend to reach a certain congestion level . 
  if you add roads , more cars go out . 
  if you remove roads , less cars do . 
  why ? 
  what disaster ??? 
  i hope you missed the / s, 
   sounds awesome but the streets with cars will probably get way worse . 
  not really . 
  it has been demonstrated that , the more roads you create , the more cars you have , till reaching a congestion limit . 
  same with removing roads . 
  first congestion might be chaotic , but then there are fewer cars , till reaching the previous level of congestion . 
  this project has been moving on steady since its inception more than 10 years ago ( psc government ) ; previous goverment ( ciu ) started with new bus lines , more straight , following what those megablocks would be ; current governtment ( bec ) might as well keep on . 
  i was just asking if you were talking about before or after eastern europe countries entered eurovision . 
  before or after eastern europe countries entered eurovision ? 
  you know this was eurovision , not japanvision , do n't you ? 
   it 's still better than the 2 $ coin . 
  that 's one of my favourit . 
  no different dialects , accents , customs ? 
  hey , my country is less than 300 km wide and there are lots of differences between people from one extreme to the other !, 
  the mesure of those who are 18 is 173,9 cm : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/human_height#average_height_around_the_world, 
  tallest ones emigrate ? 
  here standard beds are 190cm , but ikea ones are 200cm , so better for ( our local ) tall people . 
  really 6cm difference between portugal and spain ? 
  is there a gradient , maybe ? 
  love the french one . 
  literally reading the quran . 
  but so much literally reading the bible . 
  maybe i 'm weird , but my problem is neither with islam nor with traditions , but with killings . 
  i guess i do n't live in europe , then . 
  what we do is points = #correct - #wrong / ( #options - 1 ) in your case , with 5 options , you 'd get 20 % right . 
  then : points = 20 % correct - 80 % wrong / ( 5 options - 1 ) = 0 % according to op by doing it random you get a 0,4-0 ,5 over 2 . 
  so i do n't think they make any normalisation :  last year , you needed a 0.1 to get into the teacher program . 
  you 'd get around 0.4-0 .5 if you simply chose c on every single question of the test . 
  standard here is : points = #correct - #wrong / ( #options - 1 ) so , in your case , 3 correct , 7 wrong , 4 options =  points = 3 - 7/3 = 2/3 = 0,6666 points over 10 . 
  i was sure this was a universal formula used everywhere there are multiple-choice tests the idea is that if there are 4 options random answers would give you a 25 % of correct ones . 
  so : 25 % correct - 75 % wrong / ( 4 options - 1 ) = 0 . 
  so , i guess you are right . 
  if your teachers do n't use this formula , they are not really quite good ones ... 
  usually multiple-choice questions tests are graded so random answers will give you a zero . 
  is not the case in sweden ? 
  who has translated the andorran one ? 
  it should be `` united virtue is stronger '', 
   `` our language is a treasure '' the moldavian motto . 
  they speak romanian . 
  different culture , different words . 
  no , it 's a cultural difference . 
  do `` ultras '' mean `` supporters '' in sweden ? 
  to me ultras are violent , usually racist / fascist supporters . 
  the good ones are not ultras , they are supporters . 
  in my culture , ultras = bad . 
  the good ones you are describing are not ultras but supporters . 
  excuse me ? 
  shy instead of psi ? 
  really ???? 
  argh !, 
   ( do n't trust americanized pronunciations of letters tho ) i ca n't stand english speaking mathematicians pronouncing \u041f as pie , not as pee . 
  last time i checked eu flag was just blue with 12 yellow stars on a circle . 
  not half white half blue ... also , the stars should be pointing up , so this flag seems to be upside down . 
  i was wondering the meaning of the colours . 
  till i realized it was not about the colours . 
  but , anyway , what 's the meaning of the colours ?? 
  no initial minimum ? 
  i mean , going from 1 in 2010 to 3 in 2015 is a 200 % increase !, 
  fourth-degree relatives , not incest . 
  at least according to european laws and culture . 
  you realize that article ( and this map ) are not about incest , do n't you ? 
  a ) it 's catalan , unless you call yourself a swedenian b ) in their whole history catalan terrorist groups have killed maybe 10 people . 
  half of them themselves while building bombs . 
  hey , terra lliure only victim ( aside of themselves ) was an old woman sleeping on her bed because an defective wall felt down over her due to the expansive wave of a small bomb . 
  i think it was the last bomb they ever placed . 
   what is sociological francoism by the way , like i know the franco 's ideology but what `` sociological '' one stands for ? 
  fascist elitism ? 
  and by conservative , i assume you mean social-conservatism .

  but they 'd fall into a worse situation . 
  spain will do what germany tells them to do , no worries about that . 
  i 'm starting to doubt who i want to win . 
  living in the mediterranean side , imagine how much i hear about the portugueses . 
  internet never over reacts . 
  electrified cable embeded in the wall at + / - 15cm . 
  that teaches you fast :d, 
  touch\u00e9, 
  i think a 22 % is excessive . 
  pedro and that pp submarine aka mr.smithers . 
  they only wanted to keep the mafia from ruling us . 
  turns out the mafia is like a hydra . 
  4 years . 
  so you 're not sharing a bridge in milano ? 
  parents usually retired or about to . 
  mother is happy to see the table full kf people at lunch or dinner time and they do n't use enough clothes to fill the washing machine . 
  in my opinion it would be stupid to not to share food and washing machine . 
  i also live in a big house , separated but together . 
  are you sure ? 
  norway wants to have 2 words with you . 
  but that ... that hurts !, 
  wait till the hords of ni-nis reach you . 
  lol !, 
  ( from la resistance trenches in the outskirts of benidorm ), 
  nope :p i open the link , no context , just a graphic . 
  i do n't think thats news worthy . 
  aha , my dad uses orange fanta or a piece of dried cod in water . 
  thank you . 
  mind explaining me how you catch bugs with marmite ? 
  merci . 
  always sunny in the south east . 
  grrrr !, 
  what gold ? 
  have you seen the spanish nimbers for the last century ? 
  ahem !, 
  ours ... ours do n't even reach the outside of the bar where they took place :(,

  `` negotiating or giving concessions is perceived as weakness , '' said antonio rold\u00e1n , a lawmaker from the upstart ciudadanos party . 
  lol , waylon smithers party . 
  looking for love in each corner . 
  sssssh ! ... i just came from the beach, 
  sorry , i did not ask properly : care to explain why you came to this conclusion ? 
  what do you mean ? 
  it 's the most afghanistan/iraq/siria-ish land in the eu and since all the wars are fight there ... you know ? 
  to make everything more realistic . 
  even the hq, 
  what a romantic username by the way . 
  someone answer this person , please . 
  mine too , it was a rich country . 
  ( and it should still be : / ), 
  hehe and luis bu\u00f1uel !, 
  hmm !, 
  ( escobar assertive 's grunt ), 
  thats how romanians learn spanish , will southamericans learn turkish ? 
  and you call yourself french !, 
  same here in the east end of the peninsula . 
  - yo , you have used massive and brutal in a short comment +1, 
  ah , so it was carillo and not carrillo ( i mean not a mistake ) . 
  i 'm curious , where did you get those 2 names from ? 
  iberian peninsula, 
  i was explaining to other guys here that we use faca for pocket knife and now i discovered we use the 2words in an opposite way . 
  unknown ethimology . 
  we tend to use faca when referring to a `` navaja '' ( the foldable type ) in valencia . 
  as someone else pointed , we also use faca . 
  but where i am from we use it in valencian/catalan . 
  what if all of us , little and medium businesses began paying such low taxes ? 
  those big multinationals indirectly rely on us . 
  it 's our taxes that make the country to keep going so citizens can keep buying iphones , expensive coffees etc. 
  i had good savage sex . 
  did it in both seasons , both were worth . 
  they got it wrong to make the chart . 
  they accidentally got the data for the sovereign order of malta . 
  logicall , we like things to be in proper order . 
  yeah , but it happens quite often that those who pretend to outsmart us all are skiping some little details . 
  ridiculous . 
  i made the question again without the word muslim . 
  have you seen an answer ? 
  not me . 
  ... and military a little more . 
  are you really from the uk ? 
  what are the main reasons for the women who wear burkini to wear it ? 
  when did i say that ? 
  i made a question . 
  they are attacking the problem at it 's core , the difference is that you do n't see it at the news . 
  `` disguised cop entering a mosque whith radicalism suspicion '' no , you wo n't see that on news . 
  that people who is willing to kill for those photos needs to be taken out of a modern society . 
  what are the main reasons for muslim women to wear it ? 
  i was in fiestas so i have no clue really . 
  and yet we are saying bye to those new forrests here in the south east because the 2 years severe drought . 
  mexicans also like to use strong colors . 
  amateurs, 
  in jail atm, 
  literal translation of a spanish saying applied to what you are saying : give me bread and call me silly . 
  same happened here a few years ago in a very windy january night , the cable fell because of the stress . 
  well , nothing to add but this unnecesary comment . 
  we are south , ca n't be more south .

  pff do you even mercadona bro ? 
  lidl ai n't got nothing on em, 
  i would n't count microstates , really . 
  i personally think their idea of a social safety net , their views on natuonal security , gun ownership and taxes are really really wrong . 
  ah man your post makes me feel so sad for spain . 
  yeah i was kind of confused . 
  dude even if they get the best absolute conditions they will form comunities . 
  hell i know i would find other westerners if i had to live in syria . 
  civil war and transici\u00f3n . 
  not rob you . 
  only pickpocket . 
  if you have two neurones and are thus capable of synapsing , you wo n't get pickpocketed . 
  my arsenal knows no limits . 
  sugusino is literally hitler . 
  also my flair got censored by the mods so i got a new one . 
  well as an individual no . 
  as an expedition and the repercussions it brought , yes . 
  it is the point . 
  i do n't complain about columbus . 
  i mean he sucked , but so long as nobody celebrates it i wo n't remind you that he did . 
  on that we agree but still nothing to do with 12 of october , 
  do you celebrate genghis khan ? 
  you accept it happened, 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/genocide_of_indigenous_peoples#spanish_colonization_of_the_americas genocide is the systematic elimination of all or a significant part of a racial , ethnic , religious , cultural or national group the were quite eliminated i would think . 
  i agree . 
  fallas do n't seem very fun to me . 
  ai n't no party like fiestas del pilar !, 
  you compare separating from an opressive empire to colonizing a separate continent ? 
  what ? 
  in spain it was known as d\u00eda de la raza as well . 
  en negrita, 
  so what is australia does something bad we should do that too . 
  soon he will say that america invented america . 
  well then they are not self critics . 
  shame on them . 
  does n't mean i do n't find celebrating 12 de octubre abhorrent . 
  ouch, 
  i do n't think yanks have anything to do with this , lol . 
  i know some valencians that would stab you for saying that . 
  est\u00e1 also his syntax was correct too , no need to swap it around, 
  american ? 
  i think the indigenous people would have a right to be slightly butthurt about columbus eh ? 
  there 's never enough garbanzos , silly, 
  love me some genocide celebration . 
  in other countreis this day is also known as ... that 's some nice bullshit sir . 
  well , i 'm all for a spanish traditional day . 
  i partly feel spanish as well , love the language and the food . 
  but celebrating genocide is just no . 
  my honduran family is super thrilled with this party . 
  super . 
  eh not everybody is a greedy scumbag . 
  companies going to court against states actually happens already . 
  and you know , sometimes that is ok . company a builds a nuclear facility , 5 years later government closes all nuclears . 
  company a clearly deserves all lost investment . 
  suck it dclauzel, 
  that does n't address my post at all . 
  who decides when it is right to leave ? 
  pro tip : the citizens of a region . 
  that dinosaur is dead already though . 
  yeah we get it , we are all plebs except for you . 
  in reality , wars are complex and intercultural relations hard to manage . 
  that 's a huge if . 
  decades in the future . 
  lol battery storage for a whole country . 
  do you even know what you are talking about ? 
  well she 's not a princess . 
  at least not a princesa according to spanish law . 
  whoops i meant ephebophilia !, 
  the creepy ephebophobia questions again !, 
  giving up nuclear only to replace it by fuel . 
  environment my ass . 
  because elections in 3 months . 
  sad , i know . 
  if portugal and spain are n't south i do n't know what is . 
  also students studying for finals . 
  students do n't vote pp . 
  ah so rajoy has an expiration date already . 
  good . 
  yeah i do n't think i could manage with that much on my own . 
  not really . 
  food is cheap and we are four people . 
  130 $ in rent , 30 on utilities , 6 on internet , 50 on food . 
  i know a lot of interns , including myself and none makes less than 8 $ / h. 
  some make a bit more , up to 10 $ / h, 
  12k a year is more than enough for an intern . 
  for reference i spend 200 $ on rent , food and utilities per month . 
  you do n't need to be smart . 
  you need to work your fucking ass out . 
  but is part of what put is into the hole in the first place . 
  not the 30 % smartest . 
  but the most hardworking . 
  minimum wage for uni interns is higher than minimum wage . 
  some engineering interns make 10 $ / h which is n't bad at all . 
  first two years are boring . 
  math , physics , chemistry , etc then when the fun times begin , they already sucked your soul and you just want it to end . 
  well then it would sound boring to men as well . 
  well for example women are worse at most sports . 
  so they are different . 
  that 's exactly my point . 
  they do n't sign up because they do n't want to .

  add taxes social security etc. 
  dude if you believe making an international call costs the operator 50cent per minute , you need a new fermi estimationer . 
  implying we have 4g reception . 
  hint : it 's not everywhere . 
  energy can be bought . 
  i 'm not sure about water but i guess something could be done . 
  most countries are n't energetically independent . 
  they produce their own energy by burning gas , fuel or coal which they buy from other countries . 
  it 's the same in spain . 
  same as greece , not as romania . 
  vienna is very cold in the winter . 
  i would n't touch a bike . 
  actually that sounds likely . 
  however i have no proof of this . 
  and exercise would probably help them get happier , but you know , depressed people do n't want to take efforts . 
  i 'm fairly sure that major costs in road maintenance are trucks . 
  and highways . 
  cars in spain are only subsidized sometimes , and have n't traditionally been so , even though they are now . 
  i doubt it 's sold at a loss anyways ( i 'm betting tax is higher than the subsidy , it 's just a hidden tax cut ) . 
  roads will always be built , because long or medium ( think 6km + , most people are n't willing to bike that everyday round trip ) distance travel wo n't be ever done in bycicle . 
  and health benefits ... who knows , maybe like smoke , it 's actually profitable that they die earlier so they do n't have to spend so much in pensionists and other benefits . 
  that 's likely . 
  however , it would incur a big cut on state revenue . 
  gas is taxed like hell . 
  i commute with my bike everyday , but your first source does n't mean jackshit . 
  correlation does n't imply causation . 
  i know this phrase is tired around reddit but really . 
   we 'll just sell southern italy to spain we do n't have money and we do n't want southern italy . 
  i actually do n't mind a bit uphill . 
  i do that everyday on my bike . 
  but damn some lanes are just packed with parked cars ( or trucks , lol ) and if i have to do a significant ride on the road , i 'll think about it . 
  nothing . 
  what do our governments have to gain in this ? 
  appeasement , in an instance like this , just leads to more appeasement . 
  this is not russia getting back something of theirs or a one time play . 
  one might argue that this is just an excuse , and they might very well find another one to invade more countries . 
  should n't surprise anybody . 
  some people are still paying 2007 market price for their house , that is now worth 50 % of what it once was . 
   and we need to wipe away any knowledge involved with manufacturing of nuclear weaponry not only i find this to be wrong , i believe it so hilariously impossible as erasing a picture of the internet . 
  it 's just impossible . 
  even moreso , with the way international politics is playing out now , nobody will give up their nukes . 
  sounds a bit like spanish fascism . 
  add them all up and divide by gwh , that would be fair . 
  for now . 
  how do you propose we fight for it ? 
  well the catalan independence movement is a whole other beast . 
  but i 'm unsure what you mean by your coment . 
  well it 's not a rule but it 's definitely considered . 
  hence one of the big reasons we do n't want turkey in . 
  they are next to the hot zone . 
  big understatement while not being spectacularly wrong . 
  that 's amazing . 
  i 'm fairly sure the reasons for the switch are economical . 
  i mean , nuclear power has some flaws , but there should be a way bigger push for fusion reactors . 
  and i am afraid there is n't , partly , because people are scared of nuclear . 
  however , even with disasters like that one , compare the deaths produced by other forms of energy production , and their polutions and waste . 
  i would like to see some sources on your claims . 
  i mean the market failure and the costs . 
  that day might come . 
  not will . 
  come on , let 's not be sensationalistic here . 
  well i actually think the nato is close to disolving any time now . 
  or at least us leaving , which might as well be a disolve . 
  dude , kids are the best . 
  unless you have them 24h , then pain in the ass . 
  i do n't think it is selfish . 
  i understand the word selfish as an opposite of generous , and i do n't think having children is being generous to anyone . 
  it 's just a choice . 
  ok , you like stereotypes , i 'll let you keep that one . 
  not in barcelona , that i know of . 
  i got ta say it 's a wonderful thing , but honestly i doubt less than 10 % of workers can do it everyday . 
  i know i do it during summer . 
  of course . 
  it only makes sense . 
  this only showed that if you give your nukes up , you lose . 
  no dude it 's ok , he lived in sevilla for a while , he knows more than us . 
  supermarkets do n't . 
  stores close 2-5 but that 's more spread in the south . 
  yeah i guess ma\u00f1ana works . 
  to be fair they are about the only ones besides the us meeting the otan quota , so there 's that . 
  dunno man , i 've read spierdalaj and kurwa more times that i care to admit . 
  pl , br and russian are probably the worst . 
  i do n't understand . 
  ai n't nobody got time for that !, 
   several proposals have already been made but avelino luis de francisco martinez , the mayor of cortegada , the municipality that oversees a barca , said he would prefer a tourism project . 
  spain , spain never changes . 
  turismo y ladrillo , the magic formula for prosperity !, 
  well it would certainly help . 
  there are already organizations that provide food and other necessities to the homeless . 
  housing is hard to provide because space in cities is so expensive . 
  so he could not freeze all assets of eu and usa in his country without pretty much starving half his citizens . 
  [ classic guardia civil ] ( http://www.guardia-civil.net/img/avatar/big/homer-guardia-civil.jpg ), 
  you 'd think the spanish government gives a fuck about what the citizens think . 
  but no they do n't . 
  you 'd also think voters might react somehow . 
  but no they wo n't . 
  but winter freezes the sea and that 's bad . 
   putin already announced he could be completely independent of the us$ economy please tell me more jokes from this putin guy . 
  and why would someone be the third party ? 
  nothing to win here .

  it slightly favors the most voted parties ( although this heavily depends in the number of seats in the election ) . 
  as an example you can use the one in wikipedia : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/d%27hondt_method you can see how party a - the one with most votes - went from a true proportion of 3.5 seats to 4 seats . 
  party d - the one with less votes - went from 0.7 seats in true proportion to 0 seats . 
  nope , it was someone from austria . 
  a tower might not even be necessary , one guy with a radio and a phone might suffice . 
  the grand national is slightly different : there are quite high fences ( not very common in other championships ) and there are many more horse than usual . 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=afnpaewk4m4 some of the horses that fall down may be quite scared . 
  nope , it 's mostly spanish and mexican . 
  you can find some events in south france and other countries in latin america . 
  in portugal you also have some ( slightly different style ) . 
   in france , bullfighting is illegal . 
  not everywhere , you can find spectacles , specially in some towns in the south , such as arles . 
  back in the medieval ages , the economy of castilla ( one of the kingdoms that would become spain ) was based mostly on animal husbandry - mostly sheep - . 
  shepherds would take their herd from the north of castilla to the south and back following the most adequate climate . 
  in the xiii century , the king of castilla demanded that certain roads would always be open to shepherds and their animals . 
  those roads still exist today ... and one crosses madrid , so once year , thousands of sheep cross madrid as a symbolic gesture : http://www.starmedia.com/imagenes/2011/10/pastores-ovejas-protesta-madrid.jpg http://www.elmundo.es/madrid/2014/11/02/545629c0ca4741a8118b4577.html, 
  i hate many of those questions , for example : depending on who you ask , birds and other animals are dinosaurs so early humans definitely lived around dinosaurs . 
  we had to do stuff like this : http://www.milejemplos.com/lenguaje/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2014/04/sint_mod_1.jpg, 
  many banks ( supervised by the bank of england ) fixed the libor rates not so ago . 
  actually ... 
  in madrid airport crossbows are forbidden ( an example : http://www.vuelos.li/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/equipaje_mano_aeropuerto.jpg ) . 
  catapults are included sometimes . 
  a comedy monologue included it as something `` weird '' : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dt4lrlfyxke ( spanish only ) . 
  that makes more sense now , thanks . 
  does sweden have something like a presidential plane , or were they just using normal/chartered planes ? 
  in the first case , if the plane was in bromma from a previous - local - flight , it still would have to fly to arlanda for the international trip . 
  so no big difference in co2 consumption . 
  the italians said the same ... 
  except ceuta and melilla ... 
  we made an agreement with portugal a long time ago ; they got africa and brazil , we got the rest of america . 
  so basically we were late to the game in africa . 
  also , in the late xix century and early xx we were isolationists . 
   spain in red half of our flag is red ... 
  is n't that archaic ? 
   he = egli ( formal ) , esso ( formal not used ) , lui she = ella ( formal ) , essa ( formal not used ) , lei and in exchange you do n't have a formal `` tu '' , which we do ( usted ) . 
  if you want very formal ways to say he or her in spanish , you can use `` su merced '' , but is very archaic . 
  we also distinguish between `` pronuncia '' , which is informal and almost gone and `` pronunciaci\u00f3n '' . 
  instead of idioma/lingua we have idioma/lengua , but the common is idioma , while lengua is more formal .

  not necessarily , the spanish king is indeed `` capitan general '' of each of the branches of the armed forces , but there are a couple more `` capitanes generales '' , often just honorific . 
  the king is also `` comandante en jefe '' which means that he is over anyone else in the armed forces .

  no , we do n't , it 's just a `` legion '' .

  spain 's flag was chosen in the late 18th century as the naval emblem in order to differentiate it from other flags ( all based on the bourbon 's coat of arms of that time ) . 
  the modern coat of arms is the `` important '' part . 
  it shows the different kingdoms that eventually came together to form spain ( castille , aragon , navarra , leon and granada ) with the bourbon 's `` fleur de lis '' in the middle . 
  it also shows the two herculean pillars ( gibraltar strait ) and the spanish motto : `` plus ultra '' ( translated : further beyond ) . 
  this motto is derived from the common roman saying `` non plus ultra '' ( nothing further beyond ) which meant that further the strait there was no land ... which spain kinda proved wrong by discovering america ... 
  there are many big cities that are in the sea , of the ten largest metropolitan areas , 8 would be affected .

  heh , not really , many town were already abandoned way before the europeans arrived ( cahokia and mesa verde are good examples , abandoned circa 1300 ) , while many others survived european expansion ( pueblo culture ) . 
  they are planning to offer literature , theology and philosophy . 
  i do n't think people that get into those courses seek to improve their employability . 
  heh , that 's usually how armies work , it 's a very complex organigram of units , commands , bases and whatnot that is constantly changing . 
  as an example with the portuguese army : this is the web page of the portuguese army where the composition of the high command is shown : http://www.exercito.pt/unidades/paginas/cmdexercito.aspx each of those has their own organization , for example , the logistics department 's organization is this : http://www.exercito.pt/sites/cmdlog/paginas/organizacao.aspx and these sub-organizations are usually dependent on other organizations ... and so on . 
  and do n't even start looking into the nato organization .

  those laws depend nowadays on the city halls and the comunidades . 
  and in fact the objective was not to build more houses ( not that much of a housing problem in galicia or asturias where there are more fires than anywhere else in spain ) .

  moreover , denmark has a political culture of pact that it just does not exist in spain . 
  everytime that i switch on the news i see that the socialdemocrats and the naz ... df have agreed on something . 
   why has n't eu investment worked in spain ? 
  ( edit portugal as well ) eu investment in spain has worked pretty well . 
  spain is one of the recipient countries that gets less per capita and it 's projected to become a net contributor before 2020 .

  well , i will answer anyway : - most of brit students wo n't be able to go to switzerland to erasmus . 
  switzerland is simply not big enough . 
  - you are clearly cherry-picking the `` top 20 '' limit . 
  if you check the top 300 , you will see that british students will lose access to 90 top universities . 
  of those 90 , switzerland has only 7 : that 's less than 8 % of the total . 
  - this is apart from the fact that talking about `` top universities '' in general is a pretty bad idea . 
  many universities are very good in particular subjects of certain fields . 
  - finally , the erasmus programme is more about the international experience than the quality of the hosting university . 
  a `` switzerland-only '' international programme is ... well , not very international . 
  the eu does not scream `` more migrants '' . 
  some countries in the eu do so . 
  in particular two , who happen to be neighbours of denmark . 
  however , it 's much more popular in denmark to blame the eu than to blame sweden and germany . 
   potential loss of access to erasmus . 
  [ ... ] we could deal with this by setting up our own erasmus style deal with switzerland brexit thinking in a nutshell . 
  it professionals are in demand in germany - like almost everywhere else - , but salaries are pretty low comparing with us , or even with uk and denmark . 
  i was too drunk to remember . 
  tallinn 's port is something to be seen . 
  beer was almost exclusively sold in 4x24 packages ; with a little trolley included in the price for transportation . 
  i have never seen so many people drunk as there . 
  according [ this article ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/pensioners-earning-more-than-the-average-worker-new-analysis-says-a6701851.html ) , the average british pension is 398gbp per week . 
  that 's 2200 euros per month . 
  even assuming that this means after taxes , this quantity of money makes you middle-high class in spain . 
  not rich , much less `` very rich '' . 
  the prohibition was deep enough to go as far as forbidding catalan names . 
  from [ wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/language_policies_of_francoist_spain ) :  `` the use of non castilian names for newborns was forbidden in 1938 , except for foreigners . '', 
  it 's pretty well known that johan cruyff called his son `` jordi '' ( catalan version of `` george '' ) because of this reason . 
  from [ espn ] ( http://www.espnfc.com/blog/espn-fc-united-blog/68/post/2836616/jordi-cruyff-on-father-johan-cruyff-growing-up-and-football ) :  `` he knew that the name jordi was outlawed , but franco 's influence did n't extend to the netherlands , so his son was named jordi . 
  [ ... ] jordi thus became the first `` legal '' jordi in decades '' i guess wikipedia and espn are part of the catalan oligarchy too . 
  i sincerely doubt that british pensioners are `` very rich '' by spanish standards . 
  average spanish salary is 2.026 euros per month ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/spain/wages ) . 
  is the average british pension significantly higher than that ? 
  well , the rate of `` success '' is not really comparable . 
  like many-millions-to-zero not comparable . 
  what a pile of junk . 
  the article only includes two pieces of data . 
  both are incredibly wrong : - `` southern europe is in a ` massive depression ' '' . 
  no country in southern europe is technically in recession , much less in a `` massive depression '' . 
  no , not even greece . 
  - `` unemployment is over 20 % in spain , portugal , and italy '' . 
  unemployment rate in portugal and italy is clearly below 20 % ( 12.4 % and 11.4 % ) . 
  almost all polls right now give advantage to `` remain '' : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/opinion_polling_for_the_united_kingdom_european_union_membership_referendum . 
  of the last 10 , one gives advantage to `` leave '' ( this one ) , two show a tie , and 7 give the victory to `` remain '' . 
  you can also check the full history of the polling with a nicer interface here : https://ig.ft.com/sites/brexit-polling/ . 
  of course , this can change in one month ; or maybe most polls are wrong . 
  however , that does not change the fact that the `` poll signal '' points to `` remain '' now . 
  ethnicity is a pretty wide concept . 
  it can imply cultural identity , but it can also imply racial identity . 
  it depends of the ethnic group . 
  edit : anyway , i just modified my comment to point that when i talk about ethnic identity , i mean ancestry/racial identity . 
  well , actually that 's my point . 
  if valls can become `` ethnic french '' through the way that he carries himself , then it 's possible to become french through culture . 
  well , `` nymphomaniac '' totally enters in my ... in everybody 's idea of a french , does n't it ? 
  :d like in woody allen 's movie : \\ - with you its all nihilism , cynicism , sarcasm , and orgasm . 
  \\ - hey , in france i could run for office with that slogan , and win !, 
  so xavier valls , anne hidalgo and nicolas sarkozy - just some examples that came to my mind - are not french . 
  am i right ? 
  thanks for the question . 
  this is an issue that has made me think a lot in the last years . 
  it 's also one the main reasons why i 'm leaving the country where i live now , denmark . 
  i consider myself catalan . 
  i was born in barcelona . 
  my father 's family has lived in catalonia for many generations . 
  however , my mother is from andalusia . 
  i never thought that this could even imply any conflict with my condition as a catalan . 
  that applied for me , but also for children of two immigrants parents , even from out of spain . 
  the thing is that , in spain ( and in catalonia ) nationality is tied to cultural identity , not ethnical ( as in racial or ancestry ) identity . 
  suggesting that a children of immigrants who was born in spain , speaks spanish and acts spanish is not spanish is considered very - like very - racist . 
  a first-generation immigrant that assumes the spanish culture will be considered spanish by the vast majority . 
  i had always assumed that this conception of nationality was the norm , at least in the `` civilized '' west . 
  fast-forward to 2014 . 
  i got an offer from an american company to relocate to denmark . 
  i accepted it , and i still live in copenhagen . 
  here i discovered that what i presumed was the norm did n't work at all . 
  i met people `` born and raised '' in denmark ... who have problems to consider themselves danes , because their parents are not danes . 
  from a spanish/catalan perspective , this is surprising , and very disturbing . 
  when asked , they tend to doubt and answer something like `` danish citizen ? '' . 
  moreover , they do not have a particularly strong attachment with their parents ' country . 
  culturally they are clearly not from there . 
  i remember the case of a `` dane-polish '' , who told me that , when he visited poland , he realized that he has a very strong danish accent speaking his `` mother language '' ; he is an outsider there too . 
  i do n't see myself living as an outsider the rest of my life . 
  i do n't see myself raising my kids as foreigners in the country where they were `` born and raised '' . 
  from my perspective , this is a deal-breaker with a country . 
  i respectfully disagree . 
  i agree with you in that `` ethnic nationalism '' has more weight in the old world than in the new world , but i do n't think that it 's the prevailing view . 
  it 's certainly not the prevailing view in spain . 
  i would say that it 's not prevailing in france and uk , either : the current prime minister of france and the former opposition leader of uk are not `` ethnical nationals '' . 
  in northern and eastern europe ethnic nationalism may be more important , though . 
  i have a lithuanian friend who has exactly this problem . 
  he 's fair-skinned , but has black hair and dark eyes .

  but , anyway , the point is that the jail system is designed to reform , not to punish , at least in the modern concept of the legal system . 
  i am not assuming anything , that is the original idea . 
  if the system is failing or not to do it , it is another discussion . 
   well the issue is how strong a deterrent prison is . 
  for a finnish man , prison is a significant drop in his quality of life , but for a migrant from somalia , prison wo n't be a significant drop in quality of life . 
  is really prisons or harsher penalties a deterrent for committing crimes ? 
  why then countries like the usa , where you can be sentenced to death or , at least , live in prison , they have such a higher rate of violence ? 
  by your logic , poor people should be sent to somalia and rich people to jail , because surely living in jail is better than living in the streets in winter . 
  i am sorry to be straightforward , but any comparison between countries or nationalities and families is plain stupid . 
  i do not consider a spanish citizen any closer to me than my german neighbor is . 
  countries are not families , and that is the root of the whole speech of that kind . 
  about the second part of your comment . 
  i do agree . 
  that is not what i am reading here , nor what the article has reported . 
  i fail to see how anything you listed has anything to do with the fact that they were from somalia , which is what caused the outrage . 
  i think it is something related with the finnish laws , and not with the immigration , then . 
  what should cause the outrage is why rapist are not more hardly punished , if that is what finnish people think , and not about the nationality or heritage of the criminals . 
  p : s : anyway , thank you for the list , because when i read about laws in another country , i have no idea on what is going on . 
  because they are from somalia ? 
  would a finnish group of men with the same characteristics end in jail for the same thing ? 
  i am a complete illiterate in finnish law , to be honest . 
  i thought that being in jail was a mean to reform ? 
  what does it matter if it is nicer than somalia ? 
  are finnish murderers sent to somalia instead of to jail ? 
  what i can not grasp is the idea of why for a finnish rapist , jail seems to be enough , but however , for a somalian rapist , it is not because it is `` too nice '' . 
  have n't they committed the same crime ? 
  and why they were not ? 
  they already do not spend more money that they earn . 
  their primary surplus is positive . 
  the only reason they are in crisis at the moment , is because of debt payments . 
  in my opinion , they want to destroy syriza and everything they represent . 
  there are new parties in other countries , such as podemos in spain , which are in a similar line and they want to shut down them before they even start . 
  so this is no longer a logic or pragmatical discussion , is a discussion between a part that wants to do anything required to destroy the other . 
  one can see in [ this interview ] ( http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x2n95hq ) , for example ( it is in spanish , but varoufakis answers in english ) , that varoufakis wants to pay the debt . 
  the only difference , as you commented , is that there are two ways , and one of them would imply a lot of important figures to recognize that they were completely wrong . 
  in my opinion , as i commented yesterday , the greek part wants a deal that would benefit greece and its debtors , because ruined countries , as dead men , can not pay back . 
  do you mean that the rapist can not be sentenced to jail ? 
  why there is such a weird clause in the finnish laws ? 
  i am an anarchist and i never noticed it , until now . 
  thank you , random redditor !, 
    while lowering the taxes for lower/middle class ,  taxes for theee not for meee !!!!, 
  the difference is that lower/middle class are the engine of the economy . 
  the multiplicative effect of reducing taxes to them , thus providing them with more money to spend , is order of magnitude higher than any the rich tax cut would make , because , basically , lower/middle class spend almost all the money they have instantly into the real , every-day economy . 
  rich people do not create jobs . 
  customers do . 
  last time i checked it , dead men do not pay back . 
  that is what people pushing for `` austerity only '' policies can not see . 
  i did n't see any anti-europe speech . 
  rather a speech based on the opinion that different policies would be better for greece and its creditors , because if greece grow , it can pay back more easily . 
  i read the proposals of varoufakis ( which are online and free to read ) and they seemed to me more reasonable than the ones we are hearing from the fmi . 
  organizaci\u00f3n de las naciones unidas = onu united nations organization = uno ( vereinten nationen = vn , in german ), 
  man , they have such nice towels there . 
  and so soft !, 
  africa begins beyond the pyrenees . 
  ( pick-up line in galicia , by the way ) saudade . 
  10 words . 
  only two left for portugol a1 .1 !, 
   this is a reminder that our societies are still very much conservative and we should not ignore this fact . 
  a part of our societies . 
  not so long ago , a social voting in ireland gave a result 2:1 in favor of yes . 
  so , whereas there is still a lot of people who said no , i would not say that they define our society . 
  societies are changing fast , and nowadays , i would not say that the `` no '' is the majority . 
  people rallying to prevent other people to have rights which would not affect theirs in anyway . 
  and then , since people do not spend because they do n't have , you have to cut more . 
  the only way to break the cycle , as shown in history , is to inject money in the lower class , who are the ones who spend directly the most of their income . 
  thank you !, 
  i feel flattered , 
  could anybody explain to me why is cameron so high in the polls ? 
   honestly i would have expected him to be one of the least liked leaders in the world simply because he is the head of the catholic church . 
  i think you are mistaking not being religious with disliking religion ? 
  why should we dislike the head of the catholic church just because he is , well , the head of the catholic church ? 
  he still rules the religious lives of many people and i prefer a man who says something coherent from time to time than a man who says nothing coherent , ever . 
  this is basically the situation : * [ german debt before and after debt cut ] ( http://i.imgur.com/wggwowh.png ) * [ greek debt before and after debt cut ] ( http://cdn.tradingeconomics.com/charts/greece-government-debt-to-gdp.png?s=grcdebt2gdp&amp;d1=20030101&amp;d2=20151231&amp;type=line ) seriously . 
  the current situation is nothing compared to what has been done . 
  in the article i have posted , the expert says the same , the reduction that germany had gotten , allowing it to become what nowadays is , were out of the scale compared to greek 's case . 
  5.5 bn per year ? 
  did you know how big was the marshall plans in germany per year ? 
  the usa basically rebuilt the german car industry from the ashes ( literally , since the factories were all destroyed ) , for example . 
  edit : some past tenses were badly written . 
  the problem is , when the euro was created , that was the plan . 
  unified currency , unified fiscality and unified banking the tsunami caught us in the middle of the process , and now it is to hard to keep pushing forward . 
  that is why at the very beginning of the crisis , those two other points were still in the debate , but now you wo n't hear them anymore . 
  a currency union is dangerous without the other three aspects . 
  we are speaking about one order of magnitude more . 
  and that is only a lend , so greece has to give it back , which solves nothing , because they are getting debt to pay debt as this moment . 
  their primary surplus is actually positive . 
  the only reason why they need more money is because of the debt payment . 
  just by delaying the payment without extra payment for it , they would be able to pay the debt by their own . 
  i am not implying that with the current eu one can do that . 
  i am implying precisely the part of the comment . 
   the only thing that that has to do with politics is that we currently are unable to substantially change the eu in a fashion that would change that situation due to ** lacking popular support ** for the necessary adjustment in likely all member states . 
  and there is where the sentiment of fairness enters into the game . 
  and , do n't get me wrong . 
  i am not implying that germans are specially mean or something . 
  i live in germany and most of them are wonderful people , like in any other country . 
  and the same situation would happen if any other country were in the position of germany . 
  it is just that such speech has wet deeply inside the politic stage . 
  that is the amount of direct reduction in 1953 . 
  it does n't take into account the fact that nations were obligated to not reclaim germany extra money for reparations until they were able to pay , which is an indirect reduction of debt . 
  additionally , as pointed in the article , the amount of debt that germany defaulted in the decade of the 30s , at the time was equivalent to the whole amount of the current crisis .

  ** catalan : ** [ l'estaca ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a1ozxr3emd4 ) ( the stake ) by lluis llach with english lyrics ( with some errors ) . 
  this was an important song for the opposition of the francoist dictatorship . 
  probably there are more appropriated songs for this thread , but this two came to my head . 
  where do we get these users ? 
  who the hell upvotes their links ? 
  less than two years ? 
  sure !, 
   you said it yourself . 
  do you mean that we would be better with a dictatorship ? 
   and it 's funny that you mention university when we have shit tons of people thinking they are entitled to a well paid job just because they sat there for four years . 
  that 's not the point , sending children to the university was expensive . 
  and they were able to do that . 
  and even if it 's not a well paid job they expect at least a job like their parents had . 
  many people with college degree in their 30s can not afford to have children , do n't talk about sending them to university . 
   but of course , only ~ 15 % of those would be willing to take the risk of starting a business in the medium-term , because we all know that avoiding responsibility and shifting blame is always easier . 
  starting a business without contacts , capital and experience in the sector is a very big risk . 
  or simply impossible in many sectors . 
  in others is simply saturated . 
  2/3 of the new business that i have seen start in the last 5 years were bars . 
  despite that there were too many already and now there are less than 5 years ago . 
   are you implying that people lived better under franco 's dictatorship ? 
  or that more than 20 % of the population was n't under the poverty line ? 
  or that everyone had access to education when plenty of elders did n't even get to finish basic schooling ? 
  elemental education become universal in the 60s , and the university education acccess was universal at the 80s with more than 20 % of unemployment and way less productive jobs for the employed than now . 
  i am implying that we are moving the society in a direction were simply the people does n't want to go . 
  and our society has serious long term problems like birth rate that are n't solved becoming more competitive . 
  and we have terrible figures of [ childhood poverty ] ( http://www.20minutos.es/noticia/2274416/0/espana/tercer-pais-pobreza-infantil/unicef/ ) . 
  the only worse in the eu are latvia and greece . 
  that 's real . 
   wow ... get real dude . 
  i was overacting , but i do n't think that i am the one that needs to get real . 
  spain is a country with a gdp per capita of $ 24.000 per capita . 
  not a third world economy . 
  is n't that enough for having a population that lives in dignity ? 
  if we continue with austerity , making the fiscal system more regressive and worsening labour position i have to believe that the situation will get better ? 
  because that sound like a lot of crap for me . 
  most of the jobs are n't skilled . 
   if we talk about low skill jobs then well ... you ca n't expect to have stable well paid jobs when you 're 100 % expendable , that 's completely foolish . 
  well paid is relative , and my grandparents had a stable job live in a fucking dictatorship without significant skills . 
  they bought houses and raised children that went to universities and were able to live stable lives in the same area . 
  are you telling that what was possible with less of a third of the current gdp per capita is not possible now !? 
  then what 's the fucking point of being a rich country if the people ca n't live better ? 
  if being a rich country means more poverty and personal instability always moving changing jobs and homes , not being able to have childrens i do n't want spain to be a rich country . 
  [ podemos ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/podemos ) will be happy . 
   the big problem with these kind of arrangements is that some get them while others do n't . 
  was there any legal requirement to set the rent so low ? 
  there was , but you are right in that this does n't work with a 25 % of unemployment . 
  there were requirements but there were 10 times more people that needed the housing that housing . 
  now everybody is equal !, 
  no subsidized housing to anybody !, 
   the problem is n't with income levels , it is with the distribution of income well , i think that two mean workers should be able to buy a mean house and have it paid with a third of their income in 30 years . 
  and that is not true . 
  despite all the empty housing . 
  however , spain is n't the worse country in that sense anymore ( sweden would be the worse in that these days ) . 
   to solve this you need to dismantle over protective labor laws . 
  that 's another problem . 
  ok , now what .

looks like no matter much i try to carefully word my post you did n't understand what i was saying . 
  again , i 'm not fucking defending the actions of the ukrainians , just saying that what is shown on the video and what supposedly happened seem to difer . 
  i 'm saying what i think might have happened is that a fight was started between the far left guys ( not trying to generalize , but the looks of a lot of the guys fighting , like dreadlocks and mohicans , are very typical of spanish far-left ) and those far right ukrainian guys , so it was a bunch of radicals fighting each other , not innocent students being attacked by evil evil nazi ukrainians . 
  funny how what we can see in the video is exactly the opposite , guys that look like far-left with rods trying to take the flags from the other guys.not saying the ukrainians were n't violent or that i defend them , but considering this is from rt and that the video shows the opposite ... 
  please do n't spread disinformation.the way of choosing the constitutional members might not be the best one , but to say that there 's no separation of powers ... that 's one thing i was n't expecting to hear , and keep in mind that a lot of crap has been said about this issue . 
  you are right about that it cant be `` oficially '' illegal because it has n't been submitted , but it clearly goes against article 2 of the constitution.apart from where you say that the catalan parliament overrides the national one ( would love some kind of link about that ) you say no pact if possible.well , last year the constituation was changed when the 2 main parties reached an agreement.don ' t try to hide the fact that the constitution can be changed to make it legal , you simply do n't have enough support in el congreso to do it.i would also like to know what you think about valle de aran considering you seem to be against laws . 
  `` you all seem to hate it anyway '' is a comment that we get a lot if we do n't want an indepent catalonia.i personally do n't hate catalonia , it 's a great place and i have many ties with it , that 's why i would like it to remain in spain.however if the constitution gets changed in order to allow it to secede , i see no problem with that if we all get to vote about it as the principle of our constitution is that the sovereignty resides in all the citizens , not an specific region . 
  from what i know , the referendum would be non binding , altought the matter about if a non-binding referendum that clearly goes against the constitution would be legal considering it would be made by the catalan government will most likely be decided by the spanish constituational tribunal . 
  the constitution clearly states as i have said in another post that while it recognizes the right of self-goverment , spain is indissoluble.that 's why the referendum is illegal right now.the constitution can be modified as you said , the problem is that instead of trying to reach and agreement or reforming the constitution ( parties like psoe aprove the idea of a federal spain ) the catalan goverment is ignoring it.you seem to be bitter about the recent change of the constitution , but that does n't change the fact that it was correct legally-speaking . instead of defending law , you piss on the constitution . 
  do you know what having this constitution means ? 
  it guarantees your safety so that you ca n't be killed.it allowed you to speak your language and have your own institutions.it 's a constitution that was signed in a consensus between all democratic parties of spain , and you are ignoring it because it does n't suit you now.it 's a legal document , and the defeat of 1714 and it 's consequences have nothing to do with the fact that right now , like it or not , you do n't have enough support in el congreso to change the constitution , so you choose the illegal way . 
  i hope you are n't trying to make a serious comment being so disrespectful . 
  it might be because i 'm not a native speaker , but i get the impression that you seem to think that im opposed to any kind of referendum.i 'm simply stating that as it stands , the referendum is illegal . 
  obviously if there an agreement was reached and the constitution was changed in some form ( either allowing the referendum or changing the structure of the state to a federal one like the psoe wants ) i might not agree with the idea of an independent catalonia , but i will support the right of them to have a referendum if its legal . 
  the main argument used to oppose the referendum is that it 's against the constitution . 
  this is translated as : the constitution is based on the indissoluble unity of the spanish nation , the common and indivisible homeland of all spaniards ; it recognizes and guarantees the right to selfgovernment of the nationalities and regions of which it is composed and the solidarity among them all . 
  do you think the independence guys care about that ? 
  take a look around this thread and you will see them trying to spin the narrative . 
  sorry but you are the one that is wrong . 
  i linked you a statement from margaritis schinas , you are confusing it with the one made by juncker . 
  sorry but you are the one that is wrong.i linked you a statement from margaritis schinas , you are confusing it with the one made by juncker . 
  the eu leaders have been very explicit in the fact that unilateral independe would mean that they would cease being part of the eu.see the latest message from the eu comission , for example . 
  [ http://elpais.com/elpais/2015/09/17/inenglish/1442498331_707359.html] ( http://elpais.com/elpais/2015/09/17/inenglish/1442498331_707359.html ), 
  why the fuck does it matter what the `` no '' parties obtained ? 
  it is usually assumed that in order to push an issue such as independece forward , you would want atleast 50 % of the votes . 
  how does that even work ? 
  dude those votes are from small parties that migth or migth not be pro-indepencence , take a deep breath and try to use logic . 
  according to the exit polls they would obtain around 49.8 % of the votes , very close . 
  update : down to 47.25 % with half of the votes counted . 
  the voting is over at 8pm local time ( so in about 15 minutes ) , it is expected that clear results will be avaible around 10pm . 
  here 's a link to the regional government 's website , i believe english is available . 
  holy shit !, 
  dude you are fucking obsessed . 
  nazi collaborator organization ? 
  it 's a freaking reference to a star wars republic unit [ http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/501st_legion] ( http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/501st_legion ) and a star wars vehicle [ http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/low_altitude_assault_transport] ( http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/low_altitude_assault_transport ) . 
  please stop embarrasing yourself . 
  once again , we are n't discussing what the latvian auxiliary police members did or if they formed the first members of the legion before 90.000 latvians were conscripted , the question is if the latvian legion commited warcrimes . 
   in november 1943 riga ghetto ( or what remained of it ) was massacred by the latvian legion . 
  [ citation needed ] . considering the legion was figthing near leningrad at those dates i ca n't comprehend what were you thinking about . 
  you failed once again to provide anything that remotely resembles a credible source that proves that the latvian legion commited warcrimes and choose to ignore all the evidence that proves that they commited no crimes like us displaced persons commission : `` the baltic waffen ss units ( baltic legions ) are to be considered as separate and distinct in purpose , ideology , activities , and qualifications for membership from the german ss , and therefore the commission holds them not to be a movement hostile to the government of the united states . '', 
  what your are doing is posting things that have no relation with the latvian legion or you simply make them up.i 'm gona end this debate now because i 'm frankly tired of reading your bullshit , i hope you are atleast getting paid for this . 
  and yet you still have n't linked a single piece of evidence about the latvian legion specifically commiting war crimes . 
  you have simply talked about crimes commited by latvian auxiliary police or waffen-ss , but that does n't say anything about the latvian legion and it 's just a tool to derail the discussion . 
  you keep talking about propaganda and yet you have failed to provide any sources showing that the latvian legion specifically commited war crimes.ill ask once again . 
  since you say that the latvian legion was obviously involved in war crimes , go ahead , show us the historical sources . 
  you seem sure they commited crimes so it is obvious you must have ample historical evidence that show it . 
  care to share it ? 
  my convictions tell me to vote p-lib ( libertarian party ) but i migth do tactical voting and end up voting ciudadanos since it is the best out of the major parties . 
  it must be fun to live thinking that any ideology you disagree with is part of a conspiracy funded to stop the * true anarchists * from spreading the revolution . 
  oh , and just so you know , rothbard started writing about it before the koch brothers had any sort of power . 
  oh look , one of the `` true '' anarchists arrived  you should try reading some books about anarcho-capitalism , it wont harm you . 
  [ anarcho-capitalism ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/anarcho_capitalism/ ) is basically rigth wing anarchism , altough left anarchists get angry and say it 's not `` true '' anarchism . 
  here you can look inside the mind of the average catalan nationalist , who thinks the entirety of spain is against them and wants to keep them down , and every action taken by the government is fueled by hate towards them . 
  should i accept it because `` the nation '' and all that bullshit ? 
  that line of thinking migth work with nationalists , but not with me . 
  actions do n't change from being unethical to ethical if it 's my tribe that does it instead of the other tribe . 
  if the bank does that is because you have a debt with them , a mortage that you did n't pay for example , and they are asking for certain things in order to give you an additional loan . 
  sounds fine to me . 
  can i go to my bank and say it 's a coup if they do n't accept my conditions for a loan ? 
  meanwhile , tsipras just reopened the state owned television , a move that will cost 60 million . 
  but do n't worry , once things get bad they will start blaming the `` evil capitalists '' and `` economic war '' for all their problems . 
  if you consider a failure being the 3rd overall party in votes in the municipal elections , i do n't know what to say . 
  their result in catalonia was pretty strong too , 3rd in barceolona and lleida , 2nd in tarragona and hospitalet . 
  i know , but if either of them win , it will be interpreted as a victory of podemos , not icv or equo.perhaps it 's not fair , but its what 's going to happen . 
  both options are avaible , but most people do n't care and just grab them from the tables . 
  keep an eye in valencia , i think there 's gon na be a big surprise there . 
  at the autonomous level , they are n't going to win any of them , instead they will probably get a lot of 3rd and 4th places , but they migth try to form a coalition with other left parties if they get 2nd place ( i think asturias and aragon are their biggest chances ) . 
  on the municipal level , they decided they were n't going to participate , instead giving support to local groups.two of these groups that received support from podemos , ahora madrid and barcelona en com\u00fa , are near tied in the polls with pp in madrid and ciu in barcelona , they have big chances of winning there . 
  i said no special privileges , stopping others from working is obviously an attack on the other workers liberties . 
  as a libertarian i disagree.unions shouldnt have special privileges granted by the government , but if workers want to band together to get better salaries , they should be free to do so . 
   i will give you the benefit of the doubt and assume that you are ill-informed and proceed to correct you . 
  jordi ca\u00f1as was accused of tax evasion when he was working in a private company , in a time when ciudadanos did n't exist . 
  the prosecutor has already asked 2 times for his case to be dismissed . 
   even tough he did n't have any obligation as he was accused of tax evasion ( ciudadanos removes members accused of political corruption as they have already done with fernando mut and miguel cazorla , the later being declared innocent and rejoining the party ) , he voluntarely left his seat.now he has been hired by girauta , one of the meps .

  they have n't positioned to the right or the left because they are a center party that has policies both of center-left and center-rigth . 
  obvious ? 
  they are saying the opposite , but your leaders have brainwashed you to think that you have the eu on your side . 
  whatever , you are free to believe in your fairy tale where the juncker government ( who said `` you do n't become an eu member by sending a letter '' ) supports catalonia independece . 
  ffs , every time a eu high-level position has been asked they said they they would need to reapply . 
  no , they do n't have an official degree saying that catalonia specifically will have to repply , but they have never expressed they catalonia would stay .3 days ago eu refused accepting a diplomat sent by the generalitat , and said all talks need to be done through the parent country.there 's dozens of news like that.wake up dude . 
  if your plan revolves around hoping that eu makes a 180\u00ba turn and that somehow convinces spain to do the same , you have to admit that your plan is pretty bad . 
  stop being delusional , catalonia needs to reach an agreement with the central government if they want to get independence . 
  that poll is very outdated dude , why do n't you put up to date polls ? 
  [ this one from last saturday . 
  ] ( http://electomania.es/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/invymark1.png ) look , you might not like them but polls shows they are having a crazy growth in popularity just like podemos had . 
  i would say andalusia 's results only further prove my point.pp tried to play the `` catalans are coming '' card and they lost 1/3 of their voters.meanwhile , ciudadanos which severely lacked implantation there , multiplied by 8 it 's votes ( from 46k in last european elections to 368k ) and ended up in a solid 4th position . 
  not true at at all , albert rivera ( ciudadanos leader for those who dont know ) is one of the most popular politicians , usually getting the best simpathy score in polls . 
  do you realize that not a majority of catalans want to break up with spain ? 
  latest polls show that only 44 % are in favour of independence . 
  more votes for ciudadanos/citizens i guess.the pro-independence guys already vote pro-independence parties , but the average guy who wasnt very interested in politics migth now vote them out of fear the pro-independence win . 
  podemos + iu and c 's + upyd were the only clear-cut alliances , but both small parties will now pay the price.half of upyd 's meps are in basically open rebellion and want the party leader to step down , so some kind of agreement needs to be reached between the big parties . 
  here 's when the problem starts , because i believe there a big percentage of voters who will see a coalition as allying with the `` enemy '' . 
  ok , you are free to believe that they are not center-left , but next time try to be more careful with what you share , as i have shown you that it was never proposed to have workers pay their employers . 
  that 's all i 'm asking . 
  did you even bother to read the interview ? 
  that 's all i 'm asking read the interview.here 's what he said : `` no podemos dar por v\u00e1lidos los axiomas de toda la vida .

  there 's no name for it . 
  the closest similarity is probably nini ( short for ni estudia ni trabaja - does n't work nor studies ) . 
  but they usually are maintained by family , not by the state . 
  what ? 
  have you ever known someone that has been fired for being right/left wing ? 
  or losing friends about it ? 
  i just see lots of banter at most . 
  i studied dam . 
  unless things have n't changed the first course is common for both dam and daw , so you can choose any of those and just switch later if you like the other one better . 
  there 's also a three year version that will give you both qualifications at the same time , but i do n't recommend it - it 's kind of redundant . 
  if you happen to be in madrid i can tell you about specific schools , the quality of education varies * a lot * between them . 
  i did that ( coming from 3 years in math at uni that were n't satisfactory ) . 
  i did n't have much trouble finding work , dev jobs are quite meritocratic - as long as you have skills people wo n't look much at your qualifications . 
  i 've been working as a vr developer for 3 years now . 
  just mind that most of what you 'll study are great as basics but very outdated as real world scenario - so you 'll have to work at home investigating by yourself twice as much as you work in class . 
  if you do n't have curiosity and the hability to just enroll in an online course from time to time just because you feel like it , you wo n't progress much . 
  tons of samsung phones , followed by a couple of cheap brands ( huawei , xiaomi ) . 
  iphones are common but far less popular than android . 
  i think the main difference with america ( and perhaps australia ? ), 
  is that people text almost exclusively using whatsapp , and in some cases fb messenger . 
  no one uses texting - and nowadays the main advantage of iphones is that imessage is undisputed , so that is n't a good selling point here . 
  they might ... 
  i 'm the one that has n't had a dvd player for years :p, 
  question : i love danish shows and movies , but they are extremely hard to find and even harder with english subs . 
  do you happen to know where i can find them ? 
  i 've been after festen for a while but the only way to see it is to assume that i 'm going to see an alternative version where each character is a pixel . 
  i am yet to meet a portuguese . 
  and nope , i 'm not continuing the running joke , i actually have n't met one - and i routinely hear 4-5 languages on my way to work , from tourists and immigrants . 
  we do in spain , but take into account that the proper term is `` estadounidenses '' ( something like unitedstatians ) . 
  we end up using yankees just because it rolls off the tongue better . 
  i can try , although it 's a bit abstract . 
  most languages have a tint/style , for lack of a better word . 
  i am referring to whatever it is that makes you go `` oh , those guys are speaking russian/spanish/swedish '' after hearing them talk and getting it right even if you do n't speak that language . 
  for swedish for example is the melodic ups and downs , as well as the elongation of consonants and vowels , the common - en - et ending of words , and the relative absence of e sounds , compared to a and o. french style ( to spanish ears ) involves the accent , switching hard/rolled r for the french r , softening the spanish j sound , switching most endings to e , strong `` a `` s for `` ou `` s. . . a dozen details that you get through instinct . 
  the thing is that if i try to pronounce a spanish word with swedish tint , i 'll only get gibberish . 
  but if i try to pronounce a spanish word with the french tint , i actually guess or end up quite close to the actual french equivalent . 
  english and german seem to have the same relation , where an english word pronounced with the `` german tint '' frequently produces something quite close to the actual german word - although this similarity is hidden by the fact that german enjoys regular spelling and english does n't . 
  and since german has a similar kind of r , and a sound close to the french j - both of which do n't exist in spanish - the `` german tint '' sounds similar to the `` french tint '' to spanish ears . 
  castillian spanish apparently sounds old timey and regal to other spanish speakers . 
  no idea about foreigners though . 
  german to be sounds like it is to english what french is to spanish . 
  i know it 's a weird description but it is quite fitting in my head . 
  not exactly a law , but the rules of madrid 's subway ban exiting your wagon to wait for the next one ( like , if there 's a creep or something ) . 
  it 's enforced but not strictly . 
  apparently the law is there so workers have an excuse to make beggars leave when they go wagon after wagon asking for money , without having to prove anything . 
  here in spain apartments are the standard , at least in large cities . 
  i 've lived in several of them and it mainly depends on construction quality - in newer/cheaper houses you 'll hear it if there 's any discussion , kids playing , etc. 
  my current apartment has quite thick walls and it 's not common at all to hear others - i only remember hearing my neighbours in new years eve , due to the loud music and drunk singing . 
  # about basques ( stereotypically rough , spartan-like and hard headed ) : phone conversation :  `` hey patxi , i just took the bus , i 'll be at your house in half an hour '' `` i thought you were a 5 minute walk away '' `` yeah , but it weights a little '' . 
  two basque woman meet :  `` hey , how is it going ? '', 
  `` not too well , i was raped yesterday '' `` oh my god !, 
  what did you do ? '', 
  `` what was i to do ? 
  i held my ass tight and carried him to the cops '' a basque in a shop :  `` hi , i came to complain . 
  i bought this chainsaw and you claimed i could cut 10 trees in an hour , but i barely manage to cut 7 '' `` ok let me see ... '' the salesman turns it in and the basque shouts `` shit what 's that noise ? '', 
  # about catalonians ( misers ) : what does a catalonian do when he 's cold ? 
  he lies near a heater . 
  and if he 's still cold ? 
  he turns it on . 
  what 's the difference between a regular bald guy and a bald catalonian ? 
  a regular guy goes to buy a hat after losing his hair ; a catalonian instead goes to sell his hairbrush . 
   a catalonian goes to a friend 's house and finds him scratching the paint from the walls . 
  `` hey , are you redecorating ? '', 
  `` nah man , i 'm moving to a new house '' . 
  # madrillians ( proud and cocky ) :  how do you get 300 madrillians inside a car ? 
  by telling them that they wo n't fit . 
   what 's the difference between god and a madrillian ? 
  god is everywhere now , a madrilian has already been there . 
   a madrillian teaching his son before he moves abroad : `` son , you should never ask a person where they 're from . 
  if they 're madrillians , they 'll surely tell you ; and if they 're not , there 's no need to rub it in '' . 
  # spaniards in general : an englishman , a frenchman and a spaniard are talking at the entrance of a hospital when suddenly jesus himself appears between them . 
  jesus walks to the englishman , who is in a wheelchair , and says `` today , to celebrate my coming , you 'll walk again '' . 
  the guy stands up , he can walk , everyone is praising jesus . 
  the spaniard however remains unimpressed . 
  jesus then approaches the frenchman . 
  he goes `` you 'll also be free from sickness , your cancer is gone '' . 
  much praising again , the spaniard remains silent . 
  jesus then approaches the spaniard . 
  the spaniard stands and shouts `` stay the fuck away !, 
  i 'm on sick leave ! '', 
  not much . 
  my job starts whenever i feel like going to the office ( common sense applies ) and i work 8 hours starting from there . 
  no one is actually checking , and they wo n't mind if i miss a day once in a while for personal reasons , or if i stop working to clear my mind from time to time , as long as i deliver . 
  i work using programming and math , which i love ; my job being a startup , i sometimes get to do a different job for a day , since we ca n't afford to have a specialized coworker for each specific position ( so perhaps one day i 'll do ux , or i 'll be told that they need me to speak with a client in a foreign language i know , or i might be asked to provide technical assistance during a marketing campaign - there 's not really a pattern ) . 
  i like that , since it 's a break from routine and i get to try new things . 
  my only complain is that my commute is kinda shitty because the subway line i take is usually overcrowded ; i would like to be able to telecommute from time to time . 
  also , i know i could triple my salary by moving abroad , but i 'm quite happy with what i have now , all things considered . 
  same , much to the frustration of everyone, 
  no fucking way rajoy is comparable to trump . 
  he is decent for a conservative leader , and i say that as the very opposite of him politically . 
  not a merkel in any case , but still . 
  and most of his fuckups come from being completely socially awkward in public ( like the plasma debacle ) , he is hardly a showman . 
  and no pedro s\u00e1nchez , nor the king ? 
  out of curiosity , what would you do ? 
   it is a `` good story '' for media , there are dozens of fuckups ranging from regular rudeness to outright medical malpractice , they would eat it up like theres no tomorrow , the problem with that is if i mention what it is , it will follow me for the rest of my life , my country is so small ( 1.4 mil people ) that everyone will know who i am , it would be extremely identifiable one way or another i take it it 's something that could be embarrassing somehow ? 
  if so , being honest , when life is on the line that should be a problem to solve later - you can ask the media to cover your identity using a fake name , if it somehow leaks you can still always ask to have your name removed from the internet ( eu covers the [ right to be forgotten ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/right_to_be_forgotten ) ) . 
  even if all that fails and the case was important enough for people to remember you from a 5 minutes piece of news 2 years ago - which is doubtful - you can move out once you 're cured and start a new life elsewhere , which is still better than dying . 
  yeah , that was a long time ago , thanks for asking though !, 
  any particular reason why a fluent speaker would n't do ? 
  ( not judging , just curious ) .

  not so much what they specifically offer , but what they have to offer . 
  i 'd love bulk discounts and such , plus their hot dogs and such are apparently great . 
  plus reddit seems to be all over it , so it could n't hurt to have it around europe ? 
  wish there was a costco in there . 
  ohhh , thanks for that !, 
  been really interested in learning about india . 
  if i may ask , are you hindu or of another lingustic/ethnic group ? 
  sounds like france on usual business . 
  how did the french react ? 
  no no , you see comrade ? 
  one big lenin the size of skyscrapers and many plaza with many smaller lenin . 
  works !, 
  probably follow in suit with ukraine and march away from russia . 
  might not be like ukraine , but they 'll try their damndest . 
  they want a better future , not a russian oligarchy . 
  and we wo n't get accession if we have corrupt fucks like edrogan in power . 
  people like him are reactionary and frankly will take us back to ottoman times . 
  either we stand in solidarity against him and march to the eu , or fade into obscurity as a sharia backwater . 
  the sub-committee of lenin-to-citizen ratio has concluded taht there must be at least a 4:100,000 ratio at all times .

  from his comment karma and how he acts , this is one deep-cover troll . 
  they made the mistake of not being fc barcelona . 
  why was fc madrid here and not fc barcelona ? 
  this is travesty !, 
  as much as i 'm a prude with comedy , my lungs are in pain with how much i laughed . 
  i love you , norris . 
  samus , stop acting like you 're not one of us .

  give catalonia your delicious fisheries , norway !, 
  we 'll call it an elf . 
  the cup has some very enticing promises , and they really threw the ball out of the park . 
  very agreeable with your points , too . 
  but the party just feels extremely ... off . 
  anti-capitalism ? 
  those points make me think they 'd do far more harm than good for us . 
  on the point , they want to completely scrap nuclear energy for alternatives . 
  to me , that 's a big no-no , we still have * plenty * of possibilities with nuclear energy . 
  ugh , why do they feel so enticing , but also worry me !, 
  we got the harrier . 
  that 's actually a bit shocking , considering their position in catparla,

  a game of shitsmearing . 
  but there 's some like / u/white _ europa who 's a troll !, 
  twists and turns in the game of racism . 
  i see , thank you for taking your time to tell me . 
  so they employed tzeentch to the propaganda division ? 
  i thought they were always friends with north korea ... 
  what was your market ? 
  genuinely curious , considering i run two shops over here in catalonia . 
  i kinda have n't had any negative experience , since i inherited my store . 
  but when the church starts calling for its people to vote against the party advocating for gay rights and such , what can you do ? 
  it seems like a constant stalemate between the church trying to pin down and the government trying to be forceful . 
  can we have a racist bingo for r/europe ? 
  i 'm completely agreeing with you .

  madrid taxis while not all that cheap , definitely have fair rates at that . 
  also , if they are not registered as * servicio p\u00fablico * they wo n't be allowed into the center of the city starting at the end of the year as all private vehicles of non-residents are being banned . 
  right , and i agree that the system is n't great and should be changed . 
  that does n't mean you 're allowed to break the law because the system is n't great . 
  in madrid the taxi fares are already regulated so there is n't price competition . 
  there already are apps to deal with it with normal taxis as well . 
  hailo works decently . 
  as they should . 
  i 'm all for liberalization of the market , but you ca n't just go into a market and break the law of the existing regulations because they are inconvenient to your business model . 
  undoing the license system can happen , but it will be complicated since the licenses are so expensive in the first place . 
  how do you tell someone that bet their livelihood buying a 200k $ license last year that it 's not worth the paper it 's printed on anymore ? 
  well , seeing as how their export economy is dollar denominated , it helps to shore up state financing and weakens the private sector , not sure if that 's really a good thing . 
  but not exactly the same folks that would be after a ds4, 
  that sounds expensive . 
  and we 're not exactly one of the colder european climes . 
  they 're just going to put a lion badge rather than chevrons since people associate the citro\u00ebn brand with kooky people with a 2cv, 
  i just think it 's a much better representative diplomatically . 
  imagine zapatero followed by rajoy as the face to the world . 
  i had only left the us once when i found a job in spain . 
  that was 4 years ago , and i 'm definitely staying here forever . 
  i got placed to working on a project in brugge ( well zeebrugge ) just today . 
  happy times . 
  yes . 
  you have aboslute freedom to do what you want so long as you do n't want to interact with the rest of the world . 
  want to increase those interactions and you have to establish more and more rules to play by or everyone else will just leave you be as well . 
  it 's destroying freedom and autonomy as much as paying membership fees for a service is stealing . 
  everyone gets stuff in return . 
  i found 2 $ on the ground in italy once . 
  i think that means we officially win !, 
  to renege on a contract is actionable no matter what . 
  or do you think the government should just have the right to void any contract it wants as well ? 
  i mean , it does , but good luck having reasonable investments without up-front costs if nobody trusts the word of the government . 
  or it can be like the case brazil lodged agains the us and won about cotton subsidies . 
  the us refused to stop subsidizing cotton , so now they just subsidize brazilian cotton as well . 
  i do n't know how you do it , man . 
  but a lot of these folks are the same that defend the nationalizations that happened in venezuela and argentina and really believe that the argentines are victims of banks beating up on them for not wanting to give money away for free and following the laws and stuff . 
  it 's as if any talk of liberal trade is the exact same thing as unregulated trade . 
  there actually is universal medical coverage for the poor in the us as well and was recently expanded quite a bit , even though it 's heavily dependent on which state you happen to be in . 
  the us actually has fairly extensive social programs , though they may not be quite at the levels of other nations , they can not be discounted . 
  it 's the haphazard execution that is the problem . 
  ( universal , single-payer health care ... but only for the oldest and most expensive patients ), 
  the sephardic population can request residency and gets shortened residency requirements for citizenships , they can not request citizenship directly . 
  and all of that is in theory , i do n't know if they have figured out how to implement it yet . 
  the requirements for naturalization and being born into citizenship are generally different . 
  i 've known plenty of people from big cities that think they are `` global '' because they see how everyone has come to them but will only ever go places nearby and not really go anywhere thesmselves . 
  some people are just happy with what they know and do n't want anything more . 
  honestly , i 'm kind of envious of that feeling of contentness . 
  i was educated on this the other day . 
  the distribution method is retarded and only relates to population , not need of services . 
  barnett formula . 
  granada is heavily populated on the coast , the thing is that they have a very small coast : land area ratio . 
  especially compared to malaga right next door . 
  that does n't mean it will be the price of a ticket to kef at all . 
  emirates from europe-dxb-asia is often cheaper than europe-dxb . 
  remember a price has nothing to do with what it costs to provide , only that that is a minimum for viability . 
  wait till you try the pasteis de nata, 
  american tourists would be a godsend compared to the planeload of brits to the algarve, 
  it 's an unknown and to pretend otherwise is folly . 
  i think they will be a new state and have to apply as a new member on their merits . 
  as most law will be directly copied from current uk , law that should n't be an issue , but the requirements of new members is likely to be an issue . 
  schengen started outside the eu but got incorporated into eu regulations . 
  you either get a grandfathered in opt-out or you are obligated to join schengen . 
  same is true for the euro , except you can just avoid erm-ii ( swedish style ) and nobody will say anything , but there may be issues down the road with not following treaty obligations . 
  scotland really is going to be a new member . 
  that 's how successor states work . 
  it also allows for better specialization . 
  let the flag carriers fly the long haul and business heavy routes they are good at and let the low cost guys fly the routes that can not sustain that level of service . 
  the example here is iberia actually returning to profitability due to making iberia express the low cost feeder option for a lot of cities that they previously had to cut service . 
  they 've actually managed to get demand up to open new long haul service on the mainline as well . 
  we already got our strikes out of the way and have labor agreements with everyone now for the new model . 
  they were never planning on actually doing anything . 
  they were letting party members vote independently meaning they knew it would fail but show the ultra-catholics base voters a symbolic move and now they can just say it failed but they tried when it was never meant to succeed in the first place . 
  other than scotland being required to join schengen as a new eu member ... 
  do the german people not realize how massively an undervalued euro is benefitting the german export sector ? 
   as evidenced when spain came out and said scotland ca n't join the eu straight away , because they do n't want to give any encouragement to the catalans . 
  nobody has actually said that . 
  just that they would actually have to apply for membership on its merits and that spain would n't veto it since it is not a unilateral independence movement . 
  that may be so , but there are ways set out to change the constitution . 
  or the generalitat could declare the entire document invalid , but you do n't just get to pick the parts you like . 
  that 's a really fundamental principle . 
  right , but then they should n't have voted for it to be the supreme law of their territory . 
  there would be a much more compelling case if the constitution was n't approved at a 90 % favorability within catalonia ( less than 40 years ago , mind you ) . 
  it 's not boycotting . 
  if there were separate countries , there would be separate legal systems and companies would have to incorporate in both countries and have two sets of lawyers to make it work . 
  so yeah , la caixa might not have a problem to afford that , but a lot of smaller businesses would just stay incorporated in one or the other . 
  cross border business is just harder by nature of the legal differences . 
  with my industrial example , why would a german company operate a catalonia office with a separate legal system to sell to spain when they could just open a spain office and have it be clear where the contracts will be adjudicated ? 
  are you somehow denying that breaking economic links leads to less economic activity ? 
  or denying that madrid and barcelona are very economically interconnected cities ? 
  look , if you want independence illegally , you have to use force ( nobody wants a war ) . 
  if you want it legally , you have to follow the laws in place . 
  what 's the point of a constitution if you can just vote 55 % to violate its principles 40 years later ? 
  i would be fine with a constitutional change to allow things to happen . 
  but as it stands now , even if the catalan government would have to declare the entire spanish constitution invalid in catalonia ( see how popular that would be ) . 
  you do n't just get to pick the fundamental laws that you like , otherwise you could just say referendum for no social security for black people or something and have it me `` democratic '' at 50 % +1 . 
  it 's a really fundamental idea of what a constitutionally supreme government means . 
  i buy and sell a lot of industrial equipment from sales offices in barcelona . 
  these companies would just open another office in madrid and it would just go back to germany without any of the employment benefits . 
  the huge industrial companies are in madrid or basque country and a lot of the sales are in barcelona to be in an urban center and basically be able to supply tarragona . 
  but if it were a different country , they would need a separate spanish sales office .

  off-brand discount stuff costs around half of that, 
  to be fair , ni and gibraltar can still reunify with their neighbours . 
  not like they 'd like to , but the option is there ( i guess gibraltar could also become independent ) scotland is a bit iffier though , but independence and rejoining the eu is there as well . 
  to be fair , my country did pass the eu constitution via referendum , but under abysmal turnout ( 42 % ) and with very few political parties opposed . 
  however , there 's no way we ( or any other eu country ) would support the eu becoming a country . 
  they might be more pro eu , but definitely no federalists . 
  currently , the big split in the psoe on whether or not to support a rajoy government . 
  it does n't matter anyways , by the time it ends we 'll be going to a third election on the 25th of december . 
  on a larger scale , our inability to form a government . 
  considering i live in the canary islands , my options are very limited : i 'll take a bus or be driven by my parents ( ca n't drive myself yet ) if i 'm staying in the island . 
  if i 'm leaving the island and going to another island , i 'll normally take a ship . 
  planes are much faster , but also more expensive . 
  for a gran canaria-tenerife or gran canaria-fuerteventura trip they are not really worth it , but they are a very nice option for any other islands , as 2 ships end up taking the entire day . 
  if i 'm leaving the islands , planes 100 % of the time . 
  there 's a weekly ship to cadiz/huelva , but good luck staying 2 nights in a boat . 
  unless you absolutely need your car and are going to southern spain/portugal , just take a plane . 
  well , i 've never even heard of them : $, 
  yeah , i am actually very proud and surprised with the philae mission . 
  up until now , all milestones had been achieved by either the ussr or the usa . 
  to be honest , ever since the space shuttle stopped operating nasa has no way of sending astronauts to the iss , other than paying russia to do so . 
  ( i do n't think the esa sends people to the iss ) they were going to pay anyways , they might as well invest on a company that could provide a cheaper alternative . 
  pretty popular as well , but not as much as the other 2 in my experience . 
  what about the french basque country ? 
  or the area north of catalonia ? 
  ( perpignan iirc ) do n't they want to join an independent basque country/catalonia ? 
  definitely andalusia . 
  like , it 's not even a contest there . 
  flamenco , tapas , bullfighting , siesta ? 
  all started or is most associated with andalusia . 
  definitely either rum + coke or vodka + fanta lemon flavour for shots i have no idea . 
  i was told in school that we did n't get the marshall plan for being a fascist dictatorship ; then we got us help anyways in the mid 50s for fighting communism and allowing them to put military bases in spain : /, 
  probably trump , since congress is controlled by republicans , so he can pass his agenda easily . 
  if congress were controlled by democrats he would be much less terrifying . 
  what about something pacific like occupy wall street ? 
  the 15m movement here was very similar and it gave birth to podemos , which now holds important mayors ( madrid and barcelona ) and 71/350 seats in parliament . 
  why ca n't us left wingers do the same ? 
  ( i guess sanders ' campaing was their attempt , but still after that wo n't the movement vanish ? ), 
  i 'm not french , but for some reason it reminds me a lot of the us election . 
  assuming it ends up as sarkozy-le pen , it probably wo n't be that different from a gender swapped clinton-trump, 
  well , yeah , but it 's mostly centered on catalonia wanting to secede ( the valencian community and the balearic islands also speak catalan and they are n't seen as rivals or anything ) in fact , if catalonia did n't want to secede , we 'd probably have a government already . 
  yeah , we 've had bad relations with the us before ( zapatero-bush comes to mind ) . 
  we wo n't be much worse than then . 
  we would definitely need a government first , which we do n't :p then again , even on the worst case scenario , i ca n't see our relations being much worse than the ones when zapatero and bush jr were presidents ( 2004-2008 ) . 
  bush and zapatero were n't exactly friends . 
  ( unlike his predecessor aznar ), 
  to be honest , was n't bolivar 's dream an independent united latin america after getting independence from spain ? 
  with all the praise he gets from certain latin american countries ( looking at venezuela especially ) , it 's weird that latin america does n't have at least something like the eu , especially seeing how they are more homogenous ( there are only 2 languages for example ) . 
  i guess mercosur is south america 's eu . 
  only when dubbing differences are mentioned . 
  if you understand spanish , watching any comment section from a video trailer or something is hilarious . 
  here 's an example : https://youtu.be/l26ohccsl7q, 
  except a hypothetical `` castille '' community would be incredibly unbalanced , not to mentiom having half it 's population in madrid, 
  probably one of the largest semi-recient ones would be not giving cuba independence earlier ( and i guess the philippines and puerto rico as well ) . 
  we ended up in a war against the us which we could not win . 
  as one admiral said : `` i 'd rather have honor fighting the war and lose our navy , than keep our navy but lose our honor '' . 
  come to think about it , 1890s cuba probably was n't that different from 2016 catalonia ( habana was definitely as spanish as barcelona at the time . 
  hell , the first spanish railway was built in cuba !, 
  well , yeah , that 's the only worry really . 
  our army is still ridiculous though , i 'm not sure if we could defend ourselves from morocco without help . 
  on defense of franco 's first half ( not like that was really a good time for spain ) he did give us lots of public businesses !, 
  ( renfe , telefonica , seat and a couple more ) . 
  which we subsequently sold in the 80s and 90s :( very weird for a right wing dictator who fought a war against a left wing regime since they were taking back the land of rich people . 
   giving autonomy to regions that did n't need it to be fair , i actually think this was a good idea . 
  what would you propose , giving autonomy to only certain regions but not others ? 
  here we are , hoping we can break your record without language debates :p, 
  i studied in the canary islands ( at a private school , granted , but no one i know of can write in passive anyways ) . 
  i finished primary school only 6 years ago though ; i doubt things have changed that much in so little time . 
  wait , what ? 
  i just exited high school and i was never told how to write in cursive  . , 
  actually , while i never watched it on tv ( way too old for my age ) ; it was our teachers ' go-to cartoon when they wanted to show us something in an interesting way . 
  hell , i even have 2 episodes on dvd of the human body one !, 
   other people do n't support that spain is in the nato - a very significant minority - . 
  to add to this , we should also mention that we actually did a [ referendum to leave nato in 1986 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/spanish_nato_membership_referendum,_1986 ) , with remain winning 56-43 . 
  however , 4 autonomous communities voted for leaving . 
  those were catalonia , the canary islands , the basque country and navarra . 
  interestingly , the first 3 are the only regions in the entire country that still have nationalist parties represented in the spanish congress in madrid ; and all 4 of them currently have nationalist governors . 
  also , the nato referendum was incredibly mismanaged from the beginning . 
  then-president felipe gonzalez campaigned for leaving nato in 1982 when he was first elected , but when the referendum came he campaigned for remaining !, 
  even worse , the main pro-nato party at the time ; ap ( predecessor to the current pp ) campaigned for abstaning and voting blank !, 
  here 's a pic showing the psoe 's change : http://pictures2.todocoleccion.net/tc/2009/11/27/16114640.jpg also , we got some concessions in order to persuada us to remain in nato . 
  all of them have been since broken . 
  * 1 euro : 3 x germany ; 1 x spain ; 1 x portugal * 50 cent : 1 x spain * 20 cent : 2 x germany ; 1 x spain * 10 cent : 1 x spain * 5 cent : 1 x spain * 2 cent : 2 x spain * 1 cent : 1 x spain ** total : ** * 5 x germany * 8 x spain * 1 x portugal i probably have so many german coins since i live in a touristy area of my country . 
  it seems to have a very slight latin american `` accent '' to it , but i did n't want to translate it myself , so here 's the version i found in a popular argentinian message board named taringa :  \u00bf qu\u00e9 carajos acabas de decir sobre m\u00ed , maldito bastardo ? 
  estoy contactando mi red secreta de esp\u00edas a lo largo de usa . 
  probably . 
  i mean , we get tons of british and german tourists that can barely speak spanish , if you have learned a bit of spanish from mexicans , you should totally be fine . 
  actually , most stuff in touristy zones ( the ones near the beach ) is easier to find in english or german than in spanish ( i once met a shopkeeper that could n't even speak spanish !, 
  according to precise data , 99.87 % of bad experiences with so-called rude french people in shops and such is because of this . 
  [ relevant simpsons clip ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1j2duy_xzea ), 
  i guess that 's because everywhere else cycling paths may as well not be painted . 
  most people do n't respect them . 
  well , here 's a map of the most popular beer on a region per region basis : http://i67.tinypic.com/314cls9.jpg cruzcampo ( the one from the south ) is the most popular overall , but it 's considered to be one of the bad ones . 
  i do n't really know which ones are the best or worst though , i do n't drink that much , and when i do , i do n't really care about the brand . 
  iirc someone wanted to build a tunnel , kind of like the one between france and the uk . 
  i 'd be opposed to it though , for obvious reasons ( * cough illegal immigrants cough * ), 
  well , i live in las palmas ; but i took the prices for a single student or worker living by himself or something . 
  if you split it 3 ways it 's obviously much cheaper :p, 
  well , i also live in an island and prices are quite low tbh, 
  a nice appartment ( 80 m ^ 2 ) for more people . 
  the absolute cheapest i 've seen ( in terrible places , 40 m ^ 2 ; etc ) is like 40k or 300 $ / month,

  we are irreverent and disrespecful of public figures . 
  historically speaking , many potential fathers of the nation were taken down by rivals and political infighting long before they could reach that status . 
  in the last few decades , many people have tried to build a new national myth about the spanish transition to democracy in the late 70s , centered around the figures of king juan carlos and our first president adolfo su\u00e1rez , but revisionist views and recent scandals surrounding the monarchy have damaged that myth . 
  i still think they will end up becoming respected historical figures when the decades have passed , because they 're honestly the closest thing we have to father of the nation figures in our sad history . 
  i have lived in a few `` paper-wall '' appartments and i 've heard neighbors doing all kinds of things . 
  leaving aside the obvious ones like children running and couples having sex , i used to sleep in a room adjacent to a fraily old man 's room , and every night , i could hear him fight not to die in his sleep : lots of heavy breathing and choking sounds . 
  that was lovely . 
  for context , what is generally known as the peninsular war in the context of the napoleonic wars is called in spanish the ( spanish ) war of independence . 
  that period is the foundation of several national myths . 
  the discussion of the events usually focuses on how the spanish decided to fight the invasion as a people , and not because some king ordered them to , and not so much on the british military involvement . 
  desert-like might be an exaggeration though . 
  the summer in most of the country is very dry and traditional houses in rural villages used to have very thick solid walls , especially un ground floors ( ~ 2-3 feet in freedom units ) , among other features , so it was comfortable inside . 
  but poor people had to live like that for centuries , so they put up with it at the beginning of urbanization in the 60s and 70s and it took a few decades before ac was considered a necessity rather than a luxury . 
  as i said , it 's not such a luxury anymore ( it 's pretty common now ) and a lot of younger middle class people grew up with it . 
  definitely , every summer . 
  and we have weeks or months of high 30\u00ba 's . 
  i grew up in southern spain , in a house facing southwest with no ac , so i 'm used to simply riding it out . 
  most houses ( depending on orientation ) shut their blinds almost completely ( we use [ this kind ] ( https://i.imgur.com/tvo7btm.jpg ) ) from 11/12am to 8/9pm , even if they have ac , so it 's pretty dark inside during the day . 
  ac used to be kind of a luxury , so most houses built before the 90s and cheaper appartments rarely have it . 
  i 've never lived in a place with ac because i 'm young and i 've only rented the shittiest , cheapest appartments . 
  a lot of people with a more upper-middle class upbringing has grown up with ac though . 
  schools almost never have ac ( i 'd say none ) so our students have very long summer breaks ( from early june to early/mid september ) , and some places have to delay the start of the school year if there is a late heat wave . 
  people just stay inside until 9pm . 
  streets are eerily empty in the summer during the central hours of the day , but when night falls , after a stupidly late dinner ( probably including some [ gazpacho ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gazpacho ) ) , a lot of people go out for a walk or to hang out in some terrace or park . 
  pretty much every tiny bar/cafe has a bunch of tables outside . 
  traditionally , people in villages used to carry chairs outside and hang out with the neighbors [ like this ] ( https://elkalzador.files.wordpress.com/2015/07/20110818113203-vv.jpg ) , and some people still do if they do n't have ac . 
  it 's a great way to connect with your neighbors and extended family and learn about the latest gossips . 
  i would add the [ spanish protectorate in morocco ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/spanish_protectorate_in_morocco ) . 
  the rif wars had a huge impact on early 20th century spain , and the heroes of the war became the conspiring leaders of the military rebellion that led to the civil war and franco 's dictatorship . 
  it was also the place were the war started . 
  there are many living spaniards that were born in places like tetouan and tangiers . 
  god , you kids make me feel old . 
  i was playing arcade games and figuring out masturbation in 1997 . 
  * ( inb4 some redditor tells me he had his third child by 1997 ) *, 
  it 's also a cultural thing . 
  a lot of people simply prefer using cash regardless of what the shop/restaurant allows . 
  in other words , a lot of people will only use cards to withdraw cash , or to make a big purchase , even if the shop accepts cards with no minimun . 
  what 's to cover up ? 
  that human rights were not a thing a few centuries ago ? 
  the spanish inquisition was n't particularly worse than any other `` justice system '' of the time . 
  you may want to check [ this post ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/askhistorians/comments/2gkjr1/why_is_the_spanish_inquisition_associated_with/ckk6uyx/ ) in / r/askhistorians as well as the [ section on torture ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/spanish_inquisition#torture ) in the inquisition 's wiki page ( or even the whole page ) . 
  civil and religious courts tortured and killed more people in many countries . 
  to be honest , i was surprised to learn about the connotations of the words `` spanish inquisition '' . 
  that 's another reason there is n't any attempt to cover-up or embelish the history if the inquisition . 
  most spaniards are n't aware of the legend that surrounds the institution in the anglosphere . 
  first of all , you should know that in spain , as in many other european countries , there are local police forces . 
  we have : two national police forces , national police and civil guard ( a `` militarised '' police force o [ * gerdarmerie * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gendarmerie ) , similar to forces in other countries ) ; regional police forces in catalonia , navarre and basque country ; and local police forces in big enough towns and cities . 
  local police depends on local authorities and will usually deal with things like traffic , noise complaints , kids drinking in a park , etc. 
   1 ) does having a national police force hurt local policing ? 
  local police forces are usually in charge of most of the local policing and community relations . 
  as far as i know , national police officers are pretty much like other civil servants . 
  when you get your position as a civil servant , there are so many open positions , but they may not be open where you want to go , so you just pick another one and wait a few years until a position in your desired destination opens up . 
  a lot of officers end up in the community they grow up in . 
  there are national police officers that patrol streets and benefit from `` knowing their beat '' , but many officers deal with stuff like terrorism , child abuse rings , international drug cartels , white collar crime , etc. 
  so they 're more similar to fbi or dea agents , and do n't need that kind of connection with the community . 
   2 ) do you think your national police forces are effective ? 
  do you think they police well , and what are your interactions with them like ? 
  national police forces are usually pretty effective , when they want . 
  among other things , they got pretty good at fighting terrorism after decades of experience with [ eta ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/eta_ ( separatist_group \\ ) ) . 
   3 ) are you at all concerned with the national government having police powers ? 
  i have a lot of criticism for national police forces , but i 'd rather have things the way they are , and work towards increasing police accountability . 
  in spain , the lower you go in the government ladder , the more corruption and cronyism you 'll find . 
  [ lentil stews ] ( http://bocadosrayza.com/images/lentejas.jpg ) can look kinda gross if they 're not common in your country , especially when they 're very cooked and literally look like diarrhea . 
  there are also plenty of entrail dishes in spain , like [ callos a la madrile\u00f1a ] ( http://www.segundosanz.com/images/callos-de-ternera-preparados/segundo-sanz-g1.jpg ) , made with cow guts , but not everyone finds such dishes tasty . 
  you know what those people mean by that . 
  it 's all a projection of how that term ( ` basque conflict ' ) is perceived by the spanish mainstream . 
  using the spanish word ` conflicto ' has different connotations , and those editors are thinking in spanish and treating the issue as it 's treated in spain . 
  but trying to ridicule them in english , saying things like `` apparently such conflict does not exist '' is , in my opinion , slightly misleading . 
  you know that , for better or worse , many spaniards believe that the term ` basque conflict ' legitimizes or downplays eta terrorism . 
  ok ... let 's google the eu unemployment rates in 2016 ... found it !, 
  so , who 's number 15 ? 
  slovenia at 7.6 % . 
  i do n't even want us to be first , or top 5 . 
  * spoken * brazilian portuguese is definitely easier to understand . 
  well , the thing is , many of the guys that belonged to neo-fascist groups were just teenagers that did n't have very strong political ideas . 
  they were mostly angry guys that wanted to belong in a group and pick fights . 
  it was a relatively visible subculture in the 90s and early 2000s when i was growing up . 
  but some of them could be dangerous and sometimes beat up some kinds of people , so you had to avoid certain areas . 
  like in many other parts of europe , they often were involved in football/soccer ultra groups . 
  sometimes even small-town , third-division clubs had tiny ultra groups . 
  people called them nazis but i 've never met anyone who referred to himself as such . 
  they call themselves patriotic and stuff like that . 
  we also had our own local fascist history , so many of them tend to relate more to our national fascist myths and symbols , and be more concerned about the traditional enemies of the spanish far-right than about jews and hitler . 
  i 've very rarely spoken to one . 
  i used to have long hair , and that was enough reason to get picked on by them ( i had to run away from them once ) . 
  i only had a real conversation with one in a bar , we were both ( friendly ) drunk and he told me all about his baby-daughter and how hard it was to take care of her with all these ( insert several racial slurs ) taking all the jobs and social benefits . 
  maybe i 'm getting old , but i do n't really see them anymore . 
  madrid 's subway is great , but do n't dismiss buses so quickly . 
  buses are more difficult to figure out , but they can be a better alternative depending on a lot of factors ; especially in shorter 15-20 minute trips , where time spent walking to the stop/station or transfering between lines makes a bigger difference . 
  maybe i was lucky , but i used to find door to door bus trips all the time when i lived in madrid . 
  i 've seen some foreigners ( usually european hippies ) attempting to hitch a ride , but i 've heard it can take them hours to get someone to stop . 
  it used to be relatively common in the 70s and 80s , especially for young people in rural areas travelling to and from the bigger town to shop/hang out/party . 
  i think spanish families face similar challenges than many other countries in the western world . 
  most parents want to be loving and supportive and all that stuff while still trying to teach some discipline without being too strict . 
  obviously , some parents are `` better '' than others at keeping that balance , but very authoritarian parenting is frowned upon and hitting children is rare . 
  many parents never ever hit their children , but smacking an `` out-of-control '' young child in the bum is tolerated . 
  i worked in exchange student programs in the us for a few years , so i got to know a lot of middle class suburban families from several areas in the country . 
  i 'd say they main differences between the us and spain are : * ** freedom : ** spanish children usually have much more freedom . 
  spanish children tend have more unsupervised leisure time . 
  spanish kids usually do some extracurriculars too , but they usually have more time to just do whatever the hell they want without any adult watching .

  amazon is your friend . 
  actually just gift it to me . 
  i 'll make good use of it . 
  imagine how cool it would be to start a new life in madagascar . 
  can confirm there are no gypsies in my engineering class . 
  they are not . 
  from what i know , at least in here , most are second generation or more . 
  yeah that name sounded catalan . 
  i do n't understand this guy 's logic , roma should integrate in the country they are , not go back to their original country . 
  if there is one . 
  somehow i managed to get a sunny week in bilbo some years ago . 
  yes i have . 
  the nicest were germans and turkish people . 
  french were a bit shy and italians were plain rude . 
  of course we spaniards were the party . 
  if it ai n't broken , do n't fix it . 
  \\  implying someone takes siestas also what a shitty picture , honestly . 
  nope . 
  because people are smart enough to know that all the parties in the opposition would do 100 % the same . 
  you are delusional if you think otherwise . 
  moritz is horrible . 
  it 's too sweet . 
  if users went to jail , half of our politicians and cops would be there , i 'm sure . 
  well , except the law system is corrupt but they should be there , anyways . 
  you 'd be surprised ... 
  yeah i 'm sure it wo n't be enforced against small time pirates . 
  maybe the guys hosting the content . 
  but did she ? 
  or you were waiting for the divorce ? 
  i keep hearing romanians say this on reddit , yet i never heard a single prejudice against them in my country . 
  turkish people are very nice , i love them . 
  yeah i was just kidding , i 'd do it . 
  or their treatment regarding our social agreements and general behavior ? 
  yeah it has happened in spain . 
  and get stabbed ? 
  flanders ( from the simpsons ) style . 
  i do n't see how the premises `` low unemployment '' and `` a british lobby says so '' translate into the conclusion . 
  i do n't see it as such a big problem . 
  provided the right tools , most of this people will blend in 1-2 generations . 
  public transportation as well . 
  honestly i do n't know much about turkey and why it should or should n't be . 
  someone enlighten me ? 
  nothing new under the sun . 
  more like minorfucker amirite . 
  there are one-country only interrail tickets , maybe op could use one of those . 
  have to be purchased from another country though , so germany will be fine . 
  and there are versions for less days/selected days . 
  honestly here we do a lot of all of those . 
  man , you can get a franciskaner for 50 cents in a german supermarket . 
  and that 's 500 ml of deliciousness .

  nothing new . 
  but maybe we could negotiate something ? 
  why so butthurt ? 
  just state in your post that you have knowledge of what you are speaking of . 
  or demonstrate it with fact . 
  you have got to be kidding me . 
  lleida is as catalan as it gets . 
  whoever owned it 1000 years ago is irrelevant . 
  oh yeah the infamous tanks . 
  spanish and catalan are more like 50 % , especially in the province of barcelona . 
  you should actually do some research about catalan separatism . 
  it 's not just some corrupt politicians . 
  it 's a whole nation that wants its rights . 
  generalitat wo n't do it , we already tried this and other things in the past . 
  i agree but people care little about the government , trust me on this one . 
  the chances of us becoming a sovereign nation are slim , i agree . 
  but the chances of a bloody civil war are nil . 
  some violent actions may happen but this is not syria and it will never be . 
  no , for a textbook example of populism , some sout and central american governments will help you understand the true meaning of populism . 
  how does norway produce its energy ? 
  most countries have an important share on coal , gas and petroleum .

  dem fighting words !, 
  :( come visit !, 
  i was only half serious . 
  spain is awesome . 
  nice people , very nice beaches/islands/mountains . 
  it has a bit of everything . 
  spain , spain . 
  that 's what i thought . 
  some money might be lost at first as initial investment for a lot of things we would have to start , but 15 % of our gdp is a lot . 
  we do n't buy that much food from spain . 
  a lot of it is made here or exported . 
  we have a big food industry . 
  and why would it be more expensive anyways ? 
  hum i did n't know . 
  why did that happen ? 
  that wo n't happen . 
  we already tried and it did n't end well . 
  catalunya does n't have the privileges euskadi has so i do n't think it would be the same as other cases . 
  did you read what i said ?

  sometimes considered part of castilla . 
  they have a strong regional identity . 
  - canary islands : former berberic islands . 
  other than the [ silvo gomero ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/silbo_gomero_language ) everything is dead . 
  but there is a nationalist government . 
  edit : i hate when some people say that our countries are homogeneus and that the eu is too diverse to work , many eu states have been extremely diverse since forever . 
  there is some hostililty and butthurt between catalonia and valencia , and i say this as valencia . 
  there is an anti-catalanism politcal movement [ blaverism ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/blaverism ) . 
  [ pic ] ( http://i.imgur.com/ltctyuy.jpg ) if catalonia becomes independent we are not going with them . 
  the extreme blaverism is sort of minoritary nowadays but it has been successful in building a valencian identity as a region of spain . 
   high youth unemployment do you that your youth unemployment is high ? 
  that 's cute . 
   a jury on thursday found the former popular party ( pp ) premier of the balearic islands , jaume matas , guilty of abusing his position to coerce a company into paying his wife a net ** 42,000 ** euros for a job she never carried out . 
   the prosecutor has asked for fine of ** 9,000 ** euros to be imposed on matas . 
  that 's harsh . 
  [ matas avoided prison recently because his conviction for other of his crimes got reduced from 6 years to one ] ( http://www.typicallyspanish.com/spain-news/mallorca/jaume_matas_has_escaped_prison.shtml ), 
   however , there is nothing wrong in discussing and negotiating possible changes to the rules if the current model is not working for some as expected . 
  what 's not working as expected ? 
  you remove restrictions to the circulation of labour and it moves where it gets higher returns . 
  the movement is slower than it could be due to cultural barriers and some small legal barriers . 
  but , i do n't understand how somebody can be surprised with the people leaving the poorest countries . .  switzerland is outside , but in fact almost inside the union but , talking about immigration you still can put restrictions to eu immigration . 
  [ link ] ( http://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/swiss_news/limits_on_eu_immigration_seen_as_signal.html?cid=35619210 ), 
  we can use the same argument to impose customs to imports , to restrict international takeovers of companies . 
  if this union is more than a glorified customs union we should have free circulation of labour . 
  your country is n't in the union this is n't your problem . 
  would you restrict internal migrations within switzerland ? 
  we have a big problem with this , because some countries like uk seem to want that , but they want to stay in the eu . 
  do you think that is likely that such legislation is enacted ? 
  we have been seriously fucked by the financal sector and we are n't doing anything to protect us ? 
  it 's at least an offence and if we re talking about billions and damaging the lifes of millions . 
  if this is n't a crime it should be . 
  just remembering that spain is officially the country with the biggest roma population no romania . 
  do you think that the passport should include racial profiling ? 
  how many people is going to jail ? 
  the first modern welfare was established by a [ conservative politician ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/otto_von_bismarck#welfare_state ) . 
   healthcare , unemployment insurence , retirement funds , etc are all early socialist ideas , and not even the most conservative in europe two points : * socialism is/was about socialization of production means that does n't implicate a welfare state or the other way around . 
  * spain is probably special , but here the more hardcore conservatives ( dictatorship nostalgic level ) support the welfare state , the ones that declare themselves liberals are the ones that oppose . 
  you know : * the people should have the right to decide if they want to have unemployment insurance , healthcare and a retirement pension * . 
  it 's not going to happen , the * liberals * are probably the most weaker faction of the spanish pp , but they exist . 
  * austerity * i am not sure if it 's a good idea use austerity as euphemism of corruption and authoritarianism . 
  it 's bad enough that some governments do it . 
  whatever languages evolves . 
   the next parliament wo n't be legally bound , but could be politically bound . 
  are labour really going to campaign on the basis that they 'll scrap the referendum ? 
  my pm campaigned [ promising lower taxes ] ( http://i.imgur.com/7li2frz.jpg ) . 
  promises exist to be broken . 
  ( impuestos means taxes ), 
   that kind of socialism mixed with a free market economy ( aka capitalism ) has been the ideological basis for european governments for the past 50 + years . 
  nothing `` recent '' . 
  european governments ? 
  or only in certain parts of europe actually ? 
  and [ the statue in his honor ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/19/world/europe/in-spain-a-symbol-of-ruin-at-an-airport-to-nowhere.html?_r=0 ) that he ordered as head also as head of the company that runs the airport . 
  and giving more context to this guy . 
  * [ his daugther ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/andrea_fabra_fern%c3%a1ndez ) is mp of the spanish parliament . 
  * his father ( carlos fabra andr\u00e9s ) was the general secretary of the party during dictatorship , mayor of castellon , and president of the province during the dictatorship . 
  it 's hard to find information about him in internet nowadays i found this [ nostalgic document ] ( http://www.elperiodicomediterraneo.com/noticias/sociedad/memoria-carlos-fabra-andres_96370.html ) in spanish . 
  * his grandfather was luis fabra sanz president of the province during the end of the reign of alfonso xiii , was out of politics during primo de rivera dictatorship and then mp for a conservative party during the republic . 
  other members of the family that have ruled the province are : victorino fabra adelantado , victorino fabra gil and hip\u00f3lito fabra adelantado ... 
  this family has been the ruling the province somehow ( directly or with puppets ) since the first bourbon restoration in 1874 , except between 1923-1939 . 
  he is the first member of the family that has been convicted . 
  this is historical even if it 's only 4 years . 
  i am answering , because i ca n't talk about that with second hand only knowledge : my mother is a school teacher . 
  she has lost around 20 % of her salary . 
  but , the cuts have been higher for the employees with higher seniority because the pay rises for every triennium and six year term ( if the teacher assist to 100 hours of refresher courses in the period ) . 
  for a fresh teacher the cut was around 7 % . 
  [ the number of educators in the non-university education has been reduced 4.57 % . ] ( http://sociedad.elpais.com/sociedad/2013/07/09/actualidad/1373381005_487076.html ) ( spanish . 
  but there is google translate ) . 
  but , it 's due to retirements not being replaced and temporary public servants not getting new contracts ) ; the permanent public servants ( funcionarios ) ca n't be fired without going to court . 
  if she was permanent she would be ok . 
  what do you expect of country ruled by a party founded by a dictatorship 's minister ? 
  that 's what the government says . 
  actually the economy seems to stagnate at this point . 
  it 's bad , not greece bad . 
  and it 's not getting worse in the short term . 
  but the real structural issues of spain are n't fixed . 
  what 's going on ? 
  * [ spain is losing population due to emigration . 
  ] ( http://www.ine.es/en/prensa/np813_en.pdf ) * [ active population ] ( http://www.ine.es/prensa/epa_tabla.htm ) * we cut or education and r&d budget . 
  * the government has taken over the regulators . 
  * the energy costs are destroying the industry . 
  * the population is aging and the youth is emigrating . 
  * there are more empty homes than five years ago . 
  * there are still more layoffs than hiring in qualified jobs and most of the new jobs are day unskilled day laborers positios ... * the new economic model is cheap labour in tourism and low value added industry . 
  pb can not into links from other subreditts . 
  the warships : * principe de asturias : aircraft carrier ( commissioned in 1988 ) . 
  it 's not like the americans : its weight is 15,912 tons , 16,700 tons loaded , * p-27 \u00cdzaro : patrol boat ( 1980 ) * p-61 chilreu : patrol boat ( 1988 ) * f-32 diana : corvette ( 1976 ) * l-42 pizarro : tank-landing ship ( 1970 us navy , 1995 spain ), 
  as you can see in my link . 
  spain has both types of immigration and romanian roma . 
  now , that we were getting along with the local roma . 
  but , we will reject kosovo and catalonia still . 
  the world has seen already massive levels of [ romanian immigration ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/romanian_diaspora ) . 
  they do n't seem extremely interested in uk . 
  they have gone to latin countries and germany mostly . 
  some countries are becoming more authoritarian ; at least greece , hungary and spain . 
  and uk is behaving weirdly and talking about leaving the echr . 
  even if / u/johnnytest316 is exaggerating it 's a trend that should concern us . 
  corruption and economy . 
  even if the government is trying everything else : immigration , gibraltar , getting olympic games , promoting the territorial organization debate , talking about reforming the abortion law since a year ago ... 
  we are doing the same with kosovo . 
  good luck with signature of an association agreement .

  i do n't know , in my opinion the best for all is to stick together . 
  every country has immigration problems , and we all know that those problems are not related with the european population with our culture ( or quite similar ) . 
  but ofc , is your country , so its up to you . 
  pd : at least thats what i think he means . 
  yeah , cause they know that they can not get in , so whats the point of trying ? 
  100montaditos is the most known here , almost doubling the number of mcdonalds restaurants . 
  australia is an island and they have the borders pretty closed . 
  border noun 1a line separating two countries , administrative divisions , or other areas . 
  great point , keep the borders open , so more of them can come in and the ones that we already have wo n't feel alone and will be more integrated . 
  and portugal is richer than argentina lol, 
  it seems that scotland is not a country anymore according to argentinians , someone 's got ta tell the scottish the breaking news . 
  but no worries scottish friends , according to argetinians we are a plurinational state , so we can adopt you if you want , 
  come on , do it , our gates are open :d, 
  nah , it was a joke . 
  i do n't have anything against the usa , 
  and why is that ? 
  your minimum salary is one of the highest ( if not the highest ) of europe . 
  your average salary is not at the same level of your neighbours , but it will increase at the same time the unemployment dreceases . 
  remember that you are still growing up ( and extremely fast i must say ) and here we are talking about the future , not the present . 
  plus you have a small country , which means that it 's easier to rule , so i wouldnt be surprised if you get the level of the scandinavian countries in some years . 
  at least its how i see it from the outside . 
  microsoft , google , dell , amazon , apple , facebook , etc , all of them in ireland , i dont think thats a coincidence . 
  the low tax policy for companies seems to work pretty well . 
  you are one of the best countries when talking about hdi ( better than the usa , canada or sweden ) and you are still growing up like no one in the eu . 
  only the `` weak '' economies in europe grow up that fast , as you can see on the map , because its easier for them , and then there you have ireland , rich as fuck at the moment and growing up even more than those countries . 
  the spanish woman should go to the dentist rofl, 
  indeed we are so popular to them , majorca is a german colony now :d, 
  portugal , join us to make the iberia country , people is asking for it from all over the world . 
  finally . 
  i cant wear a cap or a beanie and they can go fully covered by that thing, 
  because of its politics , basically . 
  i really think that ireland is the country with the most promising future in europe . 
  do n't mind me , i just want to start a fight between baguettes and pierogis, 
  do you mean fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric fran\u00e7ois chopin the famous french composer ? 
   for the one than vote no , then , if they want , they can leave catalonia people who feel spanish and catalan : sorry guys you have to leave now , this is not your home anymore people who dislike spain : keep fighting guys , do n't ever think about leaving spain , better break its constitution and territory lol the borders are open , everyone can enter just like everyone can leave . 
  the territory will remaing spanish forever tho, 
  how is that a bad thing ? 
  take a glance at norway or sweden, 
   just because your country is very bad xd no , you did n't, 
  read the map again it says $ / km2 , therefore it shows basically the population . 
  the map is 100 % the same than this [ population map ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0f/eu_nuts_2_population_density_2007.svg/1280px-eu_nuts_2_population_density_2007.svg.png ) i guess the worse country in this map is england , since it is overcrowded af stop showing the world your stupidity, 
  it is $ / km2 , so basically it shows the population . 
  it is basically this [ map ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0f/eu_nuts_2_population_density_2007.svg/1280px-eu_nuts_2_population_density_2007.svg.png ) the op is a brexiter that wanted to show us the red color of england and i guess he did n't even notice that it was $ / km2, 
  i do n't really see where is the interesting part of this map, 
  i know but people usually do n't know that beans , peas or rice are seeds . 
  do you know what a seed is ? 
  cause you are probably eating them in your english breakfast every morning , for example, 
   `` the lights would go out in our biggest manufacturing sector , food will rot in the fields and britain will lose the ability to produce and process its own food . 
  ** that is not what a successful brexit looks like . 
  ** '' did they really think that brexit would be successful in any way ? 
  spain has the same levels of immigration than than the usa or germany actually it is higher than the uk or france https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_sovereign_states_and_dependent_territories_by_immigrant_population, 
  it is decreasing extremely fast . 
  i remember in 2000 you could see people smoking literally everywhere , now all that changed the ads about the risks of smoking/drinking do n't work at all , only restrictions and high taxes . 
  looks like someone got mad and proved my point , thanks and yeah , i have to give you that , france is still important . 
  england in the other hand , some of you still think you live in the glorious british empire , and actually you are living in a colony of your former colony , the usa . 
  actually you got surpassed by all of your colonies , sad, 
  [ nope ] ( http://assets.bubblear.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/17155727/eu.jpg ), 
  i meant that i did n't mean to , even if it sounded like that . 
  for sure do n't do it in poland, 
   i do n't think the british are arrogant at all i was n't generalising , i meant that the amount of arrogants it is higher than in other countries . 
  but here in spain that amount is the same , if not higher , than in britain . 
  i guess it happens in countries that were important in the past , just like england , france or spain . 
  some people seem to think that we are still as much important as we were when we had our glorious empires . 
  they think we spend our lives on reddit looking for good news about the glorious britain so we can downvote them they really have a problem with that arrogance, 
  and what exactly do you want to discuss if what you said to support your argument was a lie ? 
   no wonder the post is being downvoted anything that i said was a lie , the downvotes come from people that just do not like the truth , 
  ok , firstly : terrorism noun the unlawful use of violence and intimidation , especially against civilians , in the pursuit of political aims last time i checked this post , the independentists were trying to intimidate the general prosecutor of barcelona . 
  intimidation , just what the catalan government did with the high school director that didnt want to open her high school to allow an ilegal vote [ ( source ) ] ( http://www.elconfidencial.com/espana/cataluna/2017-02-07/juicio-consulta-9n-institutos-abrir-artur-mas-rigau-ortega_1327783/?utm_campaign=botonerawebapp&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social ) i could show you videos of teachers brainwashing kids in catalonia , independentists claiming that colon , da vinci , and cervantes were catalans [ ( source ) ] ( http://ccaa.elpais.com/ccaa/2014/11/24/catalunya/1416826845_827782.html ) , and many more shits that only a brainwashed person would believe , but since you are brainwashed , i wo n't waste more of my time debating with you . 
  and do you know why i know that you are brainwashed and trying to push an agenda ? 
   the basques still want independence , at least according to the polls and elected parties , but fortunately they are not seeking terrorism as a mean to obtain it . 
  poll by the basque government : only 19 % wants the independence http://politica.elpais.com/politica/2016/03/11/actualidad/1457698284_566725.html obviously you hate spain , it is ok , u are free to do so , but i wanted to make clear some points so you do n't get to trick the people of / r/europe with your lies . 
  have a good night , do n't bother answering , i value my time so much to answer a brainwashed person . 
  you see , intimidation do n't work with us . 
  we already faced independentism terrorism in the past , both basque and catalan , and it did n't work , it wo n't work today and btw , you can read the news again if you wish . 
  as you can imagine , we wo n't leave the future of our country to this brainwashed people . 
  you can always look at the basques , they do n't want the independence anymore , and they have more reasons to be an independent country than catalonia . 
  you may be wondering why , well , because they do n't let anyone brainwash them, 
  and this , european friends , is the real face of our independentists pure fascism, 
  there is no such thing as having a life but if you prefer to waste yours by working like a slave to increase your country 's gdp per capita , who am i to tell you the opposite, 
  the average salary before taxes in slovenia is 1509 $ , while in spain is 2200 $, 
  brexit voters * please, 
  if you want to talk about a country 's salaries , take a glance at the average wage , and not at the minimum ** in slovenia the minimum wage is almost the same than us , and their average salary is 250 $ higher than the minimum one . 
  ** ** in spain the average salary is 1718 $ , 1000 $ higher than the minimum one , meaning that in slovenia the percentage of people earning the minimum wage is way higher than in spain , where is something rare ** we are closer to france or the uk than to slovenia talking about wages that said , our minimum wage is extremely low becuase of the crisis that caused a high unemployment . 
  thankfully the government already accepted a raise to 1000 $ for 2020 if i am not mistaken, 
  yeah , i agree , but people compare the french elections with the brexit vote , and they are quite different i mean , if le pen is elected , it does n't mean that france will leave the eu automatically, 
  le pen already said that she will try to fix the eu from the inside , and if that does n't work then she will call for a referendum . 
  if that happens , i do n't think french people will vote leave and before that , i guess there will be changes in the eu regarding immigration , mainly to stop these right-wing populists, 
  spain 's debt : 99.8 % france : 96.20 % usa : 105 % belgium : 105.8 % are they broke ? 
  those countries have way better economy than the eastern ones , specially spain and italy , maybe stop looking that much towards the south, 
   also , what the fuck is this ? 
  franco is in charge in spain again ? 
  who closes borders in 2017 , come on are you serious ? 
  they closed the border from the inside , how is that our fault ? 
  now they will have to deal with it, 
   trying to enact that would be stupid , just as the current spanish line is utter stupidity . 
  that concrete area should n't belong to the uk , i fail to see the stupidity in claiming that, 
  it is not about buying back , but about returning to spain what belongs to us anyway at this point we know that it wont happen , but it is undestandable the spanish government 's position about this matter ( at least for me ), 
   spain argues that gibraltar airport is illegally located on spanish land . 
  it says the 1713 treaty of utrecht , which ceded the town , castle and port of gibraltar to britain , did not include the rights to the isthmus on which the airport is built . 
  i think this is the key to understand it,

  / r/yo _ elvr ( en la vida real ), 
  actually our `` presidente '' is basically a pm , and is called pm in english . 
  to be fair iirc it depended quite a lot on when the republic won the war to know if spain would turn communist , anarcho-syndicalist ( remember the cnt had a lot of influence ) , or stayed democratic . 
  from what i 've heard there are many scenarios : * the anarcho-syndicalist `` counter coup '' succeeds ( think of 1936 catalonia ) and franco is defeated easily somehow . 
  then spain turns into an anarcho syndicalist country , probably the first ever . 
  * the anarcho-syndicalists fail but franco is also defeated more or less easily , if slightly later ( say , early 1937 ) . 
  then the republic probably stays more or less the same as before * the republic wins but very late , when the pce was the most influencial force . 
  then spain becomes a standard communist state like the ussr of course , hitler could have invaded during ww2 , creating a 4th scenario : * spain is liberated by the allies some time in 1944 or 1945 , becoming a standard democratic monarchy like post 1975 but 20 years earlier . 
  to be fair i 'm not sure if the us would have allowed a communist spain right in the middle of western europe . 
  alternatively , maybe hitler invades and conquers spain after doing the same with france . 
  to be fair , both sides did that during the 2nd spanish republic . 
  when the right wing ceda won the [ 1933 election ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/spanish_general_election,_1933 ) the left did a coup/revolution in 1934 to get rid of them : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/revolution_of_1934 and the right did the same after the 1931 election ( won by the left ) , with a right wing coup led by general sanjurjo : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sanjurjada `` democracy is good only when our people win '' was basically the official motto of both sides before the war . 
  that 's actually an example of a good presidential system, 
  what 's with ceuta and melilla ? 
  ok , so , who should be germany 's next chancellor in your opinion then ? 
  the only real alternative is schulz , which is even more to the left :p ( in fact merkel is a conservative even if t_d trolls do n't know that ), 
  well , they can both end terribly . 
  for bad presidential systems just look at latin america ( the latest example being venezuela ) . 
  however parliamentary systems are not immune to falling into dictatorships either ( a good example being the weimar republic , which fell into nazi germany ) . 
  hey it 's me ur terrorist sympathizer, 
  wait , how would that outside chance look like ? 
  i thought it was almost certain that the spd would end up behind the cdu ( ie no chance of a `` reverse grand coalition '' ) . 
  alternatively there could be some deal with the spd and other parties but still , that would mean her party would n't be in government . 
  is there really the chance of an internal party coup when merkel is so popular ? 
  i mean one allowed by the government . 
  not a unilateral one ( which i still should be legal since it 's nothing more than an elaborate opinion poll but apparently the constitutional court does not agree ), 
  because in the uk just 50 % +1 of the house of commons can do whatever it wants with almost no limitations while spain has a constitution which requires a supermajority to ammend to allow independence ( 2/3 in both houses ) also the largest party in spain is frontally opposed to it and would never pass the required reform . 
  in theory a non binding referendum * might * be legal but if yes won madrid could still not grant independence . 
  to be fair the eu kinda has a clause like that in that if a part of a member state leaves the country , it also leaves the eu . 
  granted , it 's not much and it 's not even a written clause but that 's the limit of what the eu can do . 
  the member states are still superior to the eu unlike us states . 
  incredibly unlikely . 
  there simply are n't enough pro-independence people to get 50 % of the voting population, 
  was the referendum rigged ? 
  did n't know , thanks for pointing it out . 
  still , 55 % yes and 50 % turnout seems fine for a non rigged referendum to me, 
  except barcelona county is one of the most pro-unionist places . 
  http://www.municipisindependencia.cat/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/27-s_vot-independentista_catalunya.jpg only the aran valley had a lower support for independence, 
  iirc they were willing to give the aran valley self determination ( or at least more autonomy ) but not anyone else, 
  not really . 
  not 50 % +1 either though . 
  i personally like using montenegro as a benchmark : -55 % yes votes required -50 % minimum turnout, 
  russia maybe i guess ? 
  venezuela might also do so . 
  but yeah , most likely scenario is if they turn into some sort of kosovo , transnitria or something like that . 
  to be fair spain is weird in that we can get a lot of dubs . 
  some series have up to 5 !, 
  : galician , basque , 2 catalan dubs ( one for valencia and one for catalonia ) and spanish, 
  yeah , funny how it 's official in catalonia , where only a tiny region in the pyrinees speaks it ( aran valley ) and not in france where it 's much more important . 
  we have the best loopholes do n't we folks ? 
  no , just from both castilles and extremadura https://amillan.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/759px-nuts_es7.png, 
  actually , on the standard nuts 1 map it 's even worse , with madrid being independent , leaving the rest as a donut shaped region . 
  yeah , the only ones that really make sense are `` east '' ( ie the catalan-speaking communities ) , and the 2 that stayed in one piece : madrid and canary islands, 
  to be fair while pp is small in catalonia is n't cs the main opposition party and the biggest unionist party ? 
  yeah , i 'd rather live today in the gdr than in say , the congo, 
  fun fact : in the 00s they were called `` bin laden '' notes here in spain , because no one had seen them , just like with bin laden . 
  depends . 
  there are usually 2 models : worthless rubberstamp like our senate , with barely any power powerful on par with the lower house and that can veto laws , like the us senate, 
  why not both ? 
  yeah , with the exception of madrid , the interior of the iberian peninsula is very lightly populated . 
  also the canary islands which i think are on the african plate as well, 
  wait why ? 
  here we also have freedom of associaton but that does not include association with terrorists . 
  there 's a `` belonging to an armed band '' crime after all . 
  to be fair every regional tv station has a huge bias towards the regional government . 
  so telemadrid has a pp bias , canal sur has a psoe bias , tv canaria has a cc ( nationalist ) bias , etc tv3 is n't different . 
  what is different is how they are making it so overt now , denying subsidies to competing companies . 
  to be fair , twitter posts are far from an indication of that . 
  if they were , trump would be the best us president technologically speaking . 
  i mean , it could be better ( my personal ideal model is the usa ) but it 's better than say , france, 
  to be fair did n't one french presidential candidate run on a platform of colonizing mars ? 
  we 've got the best water do n't we folks ? 
  to be fair he went to murcia . 
  that should be considered torture / s, 
  yeah , 2014 was the mep elections . 
  for the first time most euro parties declared candidates , kinda like a uk general election . 
  so verhofstadt was the alde candidate , represented in the uk by the lib dems . 
  then again the snp is also quite good tbh . 
  probably better than labour and definitely better than the conservatives . 
  / r/absolutelynotme _ irl, 
  to be fair , if you support verhofstadt you should have voted lib dem back in 2014 . 
  for scottish elections post brexit the snp is good though . 
  i guess vote snp to holyrood so they can take an independent scotland into the eu and lib dem to westminster so they can take a united uk back into the eu ? 
  i guess they also use soros as a scapegoat . 
  t_d also does that . 
  afd ? 
  tbh i only use google flights to know which airlines i can take , then i just go to the official website . 
  except it can be transferred back . 
  see : uk, 
  to be fair , the time when morocco did n't allow us to use american weapons was in the 60s right ? 
  with the spanish army having to use leftover stuff from the civil war . 
  or are you talking about the perejil island stuff ? 
  i think it would actually be the other way around , with a small-ish eu army and large national ones . 
   and first and foremost let 's have an eu constitution , afterwards have the monetary/financial system fully implemented , a unified army , a cotton candy eu dispenser on every corner and everything else . 
  i totally agree . 
  however an eu constitution was rejected in 2005 by france and the netherlands . 
  and the eu has become less popular , not more . 
  i ca n't see an eu constitution passing unless it has some clause where once approved by say , 66 % of countries , most clauses will apply to those countries . 
  remaining countries may join at a later date . 
  to be fair , the eu was not sold as just an economic union to any country joining after 1992 .

  what they can not ask is for hungary to do the screening , identification and expulsion for them . 
  they made this problem , let them `` eat their brown '' as we say in spain . 
  ( edit : no race connotation , brown as mess ), 
  the sooner they get to germany the better . 
  come on , they go to germany because of the `` free housing + 400 $ '' welfare pack they got there , sweden is the second destination for the same reason . 
  there are other syrians entering through italy ( the ones with more resources ) and they do n't stay there either . 
  and the refugee cuota is going to be a disaster because of this . 
  i got negative - negative , i always get gandhi but this questionary is bullshit ; i find flaws almost in every question . 
  hahaha ... no no no you did n't understand . 
  i mean that countries with these immigrant problem should put buses to the border , but to the border closest to germany ; where the immigrant want to go . 
  it will happen everywhere , its an endless fight against the capital , and you only need to lose once , and you lose forever . 
  moreso when nationality these days means having a paper that says so . 
  probably because the ones arriving to austria are already identified . 
  i would invite him to a beer for trying but at the same time i would scold him for doing it so bad . 
  no , but that 's beside the point it 's about helping the countries that have to do the heavy lifting ; whichever they are , greece , hungary or whatever . 
  meanwhile , buses to the border would be my choice . 
  this is not a contest ; you save/help people because you want to save/help people ; that should be your reason , whatever others do . 
  i do n't understand how his death is pinned on europe . 
  sorry for being blunt , but the kid died in the pass from turkey to greece . 
  turkey not syria ; someone decide to risk the kid 's life not for safety but for welfare . 
  i will say the same i say about sub-saharian immigration . 
  or we do fortress europe and no one enters so they wo n't even try . 
  or we go and take the refugees/immigrants from a safe place before they risk their lifes in the sahara or the mediterranean . 
  this middleground shit , in which the people has to risk their life before being allowed in , it 's plainly wrong . 
  myself , i belive in both things , fortress europe you do n't accept immigrants who came illegally and go take the immigrants/refugees we want/accept/need saving . 
  you are actually pretty damn far east . 
  and we also tend to look west where we left some things . 
  i do n't know much about georgia ; i met an armenian trader once in france ; he spoke pretty good spanish , and was catholic or something . 
  he was ** bonach\u00f3n ** and ** campechano ** ( ** good-nature ** and ** folsky ** is the translation it gives me ) so that 's the character i assign at the people of that zone ; but i 've never met anyone else . 
  because war in syria there are afghan men trading food for sex with nigerians in budapest . 
  this refugee saga is interesting . 
  the best pro-independence campaign is always done by pp tbh . 
  i would like independence from pp too . 
  australia has always been an important part of europe ; i mean , with all the habsburgs and shit . 
  i was n't really playing the `` americans do n't have culture '' meme ; rereading it now , it may look like it . 
  america has this cosmopolitan urban culture where everything goes but at the same time there is very little that they all share . 
  it 's a nice way of living and easy to integrate to ; i like america , but that does n't mean i want rest of the world to become america . 
  we do n't give benefits and we do n't have jobs ; let them come if they want ; go nuts . 
  you may think that , but actually not , if you ask the average spaniard to name kings during the reconquista , which lasted various centuries , you will barely get the catholic kings and that 's about it . 
  here , we talk about the last civil war , a lot actually ; i hate it . 
  this migrant crisis ? 
  you people are overreacting ; it will create ghetos in some northen european countries and that 's it . 
  in the long run we will become a bland america style of nation with some religious problems thrown in , but that 's about it . 
  here comes the dank memes [ andalusia ] ( http://i.imm.io/128nf.jpeg ) - lazy coming back after collecting the per ( a subsidy ) | hey !, 
  it 's siesta time [ catalonia ] ( http://s21.postimg.org/gxylq8pqv/nota_libre_20130407_105126_01_1_1.jpg ) - stingy what a dilemma ; i do n't know if get that cent or save brakes | fuck it, 
  just when we got rid of ours . 
  summer is always slow . 
  right now , apart from migrant related news , we have forest burnings and a little bit of politics because in a month there are some local elections in catalunya . 
  yesterday or saturday , i do n't quite remember , the third story on the news ( the first one was the austrian truck , and the second one was migrants found dead near our shores ) , was that ingrid bergman was born a century ago . 
  merkel , such friendly , much diplomacy . 
  i bet pointing fingers will help negotiating . 
  coming to r/europe to post and translate this pedro j. story from his blog it 's kind of sad , mate . 
  i 'm glad i ca n't answer any of those questions . 
  ww2 is not a thing in spain . 
  so the same as slovakia , about 200 refugees . 
  well , they should remind the good things it brings . 
  if it 's good or bad its for each one to decide . 
   who have the right to stay there is no such right , a country decides to take them or not . 
  the comments entered that circlejerk about how progressive it is while i was thinking that this centre will be pretty useless , and that it may be just a pr stunt to show the political standpoint . 
  now , this makes way more sense ; and it 's not as superfluous as i thought it was . 
  gypsys and old people ; the first ones i do n't care because their culture forbids them to work even if they have to live like that ; but there is plenty of old people that they really have no options , and they are not `` that '' at fault for the situation ; there should be some mechanism to protect them . 
  `` everybody knows someone who 's been evicted '' i do n't know anyone who knows someone who 's been evicted . 
  i do n't undestarnd either why every shit dug out have to become a tourist atraction . 
  then people go expecting something interesting and they are shown a broken wall and feel scammed . 
  a customs officer in an airport ? 
  that sounds very unlikely to happen anywhere in the world . 
  unless you people count a random compliment while dealing with people `` sexual harassment '' , i would not belive that story . 
  it 's summer ; migrant season and slow news . 
  i mean even the newspapers are like this ; terrorism and immigration it 's the only thing they are talking about today . 
  when the brawl ended , the guy kept looking for a fight . 
  and also , did you see how he opened the refrigerator , that almost trip it over . 
  i think there may be a precursor to this story because the shopkeeper appears just a second after that with a stick in his hand . 
  i would guess the wild pig , i 've seen a friend being gored by one when we were camping , it 's an agresive little fella . 
  another thing i wo n't recomend you to do is to go around kicking ( or , god forbid , picking up ) medium size stones in the country side ; chances there is a little scorpion under it who you just fuck up his siesta are higher than you think . 
  yeah , i do n't know about belgium so sorry for the hijacking but when i did my exchange to france and they gave us a tour on castles i was `` these are not castles !, 
  they do n't have walls , moats , towers , these are palaces '' still pretty cool but we do n't call that castles . 
  te creees que somos italianos ? 
  [ r1b - df27 ] ( http://cache.eupedia.com/images/content/haplogroup-r1b-df27.gif ) iberian y haplogroup the most common here ; so for the most part , even though we talk latin , we are natives . 
  and your last part is absurd ; by definition the spaniards that left are not the spaniards who stay . 
  read the article , because they are not closing it , they are going to open for everyone . 
  here people defending exclusivity and private beaches , the things i have to read , seriously . 
  i think it 's totally legitimate to shut down a beach only for nudists , only for bearded men or only for people with funny hats . 
  i 've never understood this `` nudist beach '' thingy unless you have beaches to boot . 
  other thing , as i said , are the reasons for that ; this defender of the faith thing russia is playing at . 
  so what ? 
  they are americans now ? 
  cry to them . 
  we , the europeans today , come from the people who did n't immigrate so we do n't owe anything to other immigrants . 
  moscow as moscow city ; not moscow as capital of russia . 
  i think it 's totally legitimate thing to do , the whole `` depraved '' angle is lost to me ; but i would pretty much agree in closing a nudist beach , moreso in a place like moscow that does n't have that many beaches to begin with . 
  the 's ' is pronounce 's ' it 's just the ` z ' and soft ` c ' in old spanish both were pronounce ` ts ', 
  why does people say that spanish is lispy but none say that about english or greek ? 
  which probably have the same amount of words with th sound . 
  we have plenty of 's ' sound too . 
  anyway ; for me german sounds angry , always been , and the rest of germanic languages ( sans english ) sound like non-angry german tbh . 
  i must say though that to my ear , the only languages i can hear are italian , greek and japanese even though it 's not european ( and english but because i 'm used to it ) ; i can make the words even though i do n't know what they mean , but the rest of the languages , i ca n't hear them ; well i guess i can hear basque too . 
  there is a concept here that there is [ two spains ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_two_spains ) who are always fighting ; between napole\u00f3n and franco there 've been 4 civil wars , 2 revolutions , 3 coup de etat , two dictatorship ; 3 kings abdicating or forced to flee . 
  an endless back and forth between liberals and absolutists until franco got a perfect win . 
  all that without counting independence wars and insurrections in colonies ( and not so colonies ) which in some way are related to the same struggle . 
  i mean the carriage is cool and all , but if the people attending your funeral goes with propaganda shirts and trainers , it wo n't look elegant however much money you put into it .

   but if we go that way , the western values are over . 
  that is completely untrue . 
  first of all , you 're assuming traditional social arrangements * must * come with higher rates of domestic abuse and general shiftiness . 
  they 're not intrinsically linked . 
  secondly , even if it did , `` western values '' encompasses more than just women 's rights . 
  yes , it 'd be shitty if we banned abortion and female contraception and other practical steps that * would actually contribute to a healthy population * , as opposed to just being arbitrarily dickish . 
  you know what would be more shitty ? 
  the people that replace us , who will also be torturing and stoning homosexuals , mutilating the genitals of their sons and daughters , killing each other in brutal , monstrous wars , raping and torturing at rates that would make isis blush , burning libraries and generally reverting humanity back to the bronze age technologically and socially . 
  you 're damn right that i 'd throw women under the bus to prevent that . 
  but here 's the beauty . 
  * we do n't need to do that . 
  * it 's a hypothetical scenario . 
  all we have to do to avoid a population crash is either make child rearing cheaper or cure aging . 
  i 'm banking on the latter but the former would probably be easier . 
   yes . 
  what would you consider a truly religious country , then ? 
   i was n't referring to buddhism . 
  pretty sure the religion europeans are abandoning is christianity not buddhism you did n't specify * which * religion . 
  why does it matter ? 
  should n't thailand 's strong faith mean that it should have high fertility ? 
   i 'm asking which ones are they , because i do n't think the old model of traditional family is compatible with women 's rights . 
  european values are enlightenment values , or their ideological descendants . 
  also , by the way , did you notice where i explicitly said that i do not believe his idea to return to the old family structure would save us ? 
  and then went into detail as to why ? 
  -- what i am arguing with * you * about is your apathy about the decline of western civilisation . 
   except they do n't unless they are only nominally religious , [ is iran `` nominally '' religious ? 
  what about 94 % catholic poland ? 
  maybe libya ; only 97 % muslim -- i 'm sure they 're all muslim in name only . 
  95 % of thai people are devoutly buddhist but maybe not devoutly enough ? 
  ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/78/fertility_rate_world_map_2.png ) you are wrong . 
  i mean , the obvious , rainbow-coloured facts in the graph above directly contradict you . 
  firstly , you have no idea what my values are . 
  and if you believe i 'm more conservative than you , it follows that yours will die first . 
  we 're talking about europeans ( and basically every other western country ) here . 
  when we die , your much-loved western values die with us . 
   you find it depressing that europe is dying off , but you are unwilling to accept the fact that it goes hand in hand with secularism . 
  sounds like you are experiencing cognitive dissonance . 
  and it sounds to me like you ca n't fucking read . 
  some of the most religious countries on earth have comparable fertility rates to some european countries . 
  whatever religious agenda you are trying to promote here is ridiculous in the face of the evidence before your eyes . 
   still better than spain  so what ? 
  anything below replacement is a path to population collapse . 
  i 'm amazed at the things people will turn into a dick-waving competition . 
  `` oh look , we 're going extinct slightly slower than you are . '', 
  ffs, 
  and when you die off , you 'll be replaced by people that * did * care about extinction and your lands will be completely repopulated by them . 
  that 's the very foundation of natural selection . 
  have you seen the birth rate in iran ? 
  at least we 'll fucking die happy , which is more than can be said for those poor fucks in north africa and western asia . 
  having fucked up traditionalist cultures wo n't save us and neither will stupid religions . 
  every single country in the world has seen a massive decline in fertility . 
  including the us . 
  you 're at below replacement level too buddy , and that is only thanks to nosotros los hispanos -- de nada cabr\u00f3n . 
  white fertility in the us is 1.7, 
  certainly better than extinction , if his premise were to be correct . 
  though as i explained below , i do n't believe it is . 
   if it was n't overpopulated , climate change would n't currently be a huge risk to humanity 's survival . 
  climate change is the result of fossil fuel driven industry . 
  regardless of how large the world 's population is , it would have occurred eventually . 
  even more so , with a smaller population it would have taken us even longer to achieve the level of technological progress that will eventually allow us to thrive as climate changes , reverse it if that is what we wish , and ultimately leave this planet behind altogether . 
  people in developed countries wo n't feel any negative effects from climate change for a very long time . 
  we can not speculate on how it will affect us as we do n't know what our technology will be like in a hundred years . 
  we also do n't know if the population collapse in developed countries will be reversed ; but while our technological prospects are looking bright , our demographic ones are not . 
   no thank you . 
  `` aging '' is a diplomatic way of saying `` dying '' . 
  as a voter it is ultimately your choice ; if extinction is what you want , nature will be more than happy to oblige . 
  do you any a point to make that 's actually relevant to the discussion ? 
  every single blue countries is at below replacement level , as are a few of the green ones . 
  once you drop below that number the only difference is how fast the population shrink . 
  it 's relevant to the overall discussion but not to ov3powered 's comment . 
  and as an example of my point , france and libya have the same fertility rate , as do uzbekistan and finland . 
   [ ... ] the demographics are changing and the population is projected to fall slightly but it will reach an equilibrium . 
  why ? 
   well put it this way , there 's something that we 're doing wrong in europe that the americans are doing right [ ... ] i was born in cuba , grew up in the states and now consider myself european . 
  i 'm an immigrant twice over . 
  i have n't noticed anything inherently different about american culture in respect to immigrants vs. spanish culture . 
  -- have you considered that there difference is less about what you 're doing than the kind of people that are coming to your country ? 
  my solution is for governments to subsidize reproduction at every level ; child care , education , direct money transfers , assistance for young adults etc. 
  instead of making child rearing prohibitively expensive we should be trying minimize as many of the factors that make people refuse to have kids as we can . 
  on the other hand , that does lead to single mothers which are horrible for society but then again , not as bad as complete extinction . 
  i think better protecting the reproductive and parental rights of father would n't hurt either . 
  our societies completely fail dads at every turn . 
  -- trying to force people into getting married and following the traditional model wo n't work because countries that already follow that model are still not having kids anyway . 
  says he , without irony , in a thread about europe 's incoming population collapse . 
   well the migrants will be quite different obviously , but their children and their children 's children will be european . 
  well , they will be born in europe . 
  so technically they will be european . 
  but will they hold european values ? 
  do n't have one . 
  if i were to venture one i 'd say it has to do with industrialisation . 
  back in the day when everyone was a subsistence farmer all you had to do was pop up a dozen kids , half of which would die before making it to adulthood and you 'd be guaranteed a safety net and the success of your genetic lineage . 
  these days , kids are a lot more expensive . 
  if you want them to be successful you have to invest a lot more into them . 
  look at chinese sons ; for them to get married parents need to buy them a freaking house . 
  it seems to me that the current shift closely resembles the different forms of parental investment among species . 
  some animals have lots of offspring , most of which will die , and others invest more resources into fewer offspring which have a higher likelihood of survival into adulthood . 
  the issue for us is that you only need one child to continue the family line and pensions -- or the high comparatively higher wages of a single kid -- completely do away with the need for lots of kids to take care of you , while the fertility rate to keep a population from collapsing remains a stubborn 2.1 kids per woman . 
  those are my two euro . 
  yes , those things are exactly the same . 
  for fucks sake .

  but most of them are south americans , which they integrate very well . 
  imagine a city where the average wage for and educated it guy is 1300/mo and he pays 800 for a flat . 
  + 20 % unemployment , 50 % for youngsters , + temporal contracts all time , so you are going in and out unemployment until who knows , 35 ? 
  that 's supossing that you have a job , and you really wo n't save any money . 
  i 'm living by myself , but i 'm also in a cheap city , with a long term contract with an it company and a little business myself . 
  so `` i 'm lucky '' . 
  so more in my favor , it 's an improvement :d, 
  well , i understand your point of view but immigration does not have to be muslim . 
  we 've got lots of south americans over here and it was good imho . 
  because we have much less immigration . 
  greeks are mostly overwhelmed by their situation , and immigration is just another playing factor in it . 
  in my experience spaniards do n't really care about immigrants , unless they are muslims . 
  and that 's not because some reminiscence of our history , but because they really form ghettos and cause a lot of friction with their neighbors . 
  adults not that much , but young muslims really go a lot further than our local chavs . 
  if you want your corruption replaced you just have to ask , we will happily send ours !, 
  i 'm not sure . 
  i 'm trying to build a business online , but it seems that i should aim to a more broad market , because internal demand seems insufficient . 
  the problem is that i do n't feel comfortable enough with my english skills , and i do n't know anyone who i could trust as copywiter etc. 
  id make more working on mercadona with groceries than dealing with it bullshit all day in my work . 
  maybe i 'm dumb and id should move to something more simple and relax . 
  that 's exactly spain, 
  both . 
  they really pay peanuts . 
  i work for a large it company and they really pay low . 
  despite have a 10 % after taxes benefit every year and having really large clients that could afford more . 
  sometimes they come about closing our office , because we , supposedly , have low kpi 's . 
  we always discover that they lie about our performance , but they keep pushing this bs . 
  we are in a place now that most of my coworkers do n't give a shit about their work anymore , so now managers come to ask how it possible that the quality of our work and productivity is lowering . 
  geniuses . 
  and is not even the worst place that i know . 
  on the flip side i 'm going home about 16:00 and i can walk to it in 4 minutes . 
  i dont think that 's good for anyone . 
  plus we need the catalan voters to counter-balance the fu *** pp . 
  our `` comunidades aut\u00f3nomas '' are almost federal states . 
  they can handle most of their budged and manage things like retirement pensions , healthcare and so on . 
  so the reality is different from the narrative . 
  they really are very independent on most of their decisions . 
  accountability is another thing . 
  there is accountability in spain , and many people pay for what the had done ( ive seen a decend amount of politicians going to prision ) , but is sloooow , and still has enough shadows to not consider judicial system entirely trustworthy . 
  the eu do not really seem to push anything on this matter . 
  they just do `` recommendations '' , which of course leads people to think that they see all this corruption and just dont care . 
  is not that simple . 
  a country with +20 % of unemployment is a country where many people are desperate . 
  most of the people just survive month by month . 
  not because they do n't know how to save or do not know how to behave with money ( something that could happen under the housing bubble ) but because they simply can not go any better . 
  so it 's a perfect place for the populist to step in . 
  adittionally , there is a very vague perception of the benefits of the eu , because most workers did n't get anything tangible . 
  salaries did n't increase , the job market didnt ( effectively ) improve ( the eu is the place where you go to find work when you exhausted all your options in spain ) , and you get a narrative where the eu comply with governments who try to dismount public healthcare and subsidies , something on what many spaniars really have to rely on . 
  that 's very hard work . 
  someone has to make a counter narrative then . 
  if you have a generation of , for example , hopeless young spaniards you better have a good idea of how to convince them , because i think most spaniads do n't have a good opinion of the eu either . 
  and of courser , back it up with something . 
  the average spaniards knows very little about what the eu is , and his common knowledge includes a correlation between entering the euro and prices going nuts , but not salaries . 
  asociating the eu with a convervative-populist party with most of their voters in their +60 s doesnt make any better for youngsters . 
  spain is most of the time in a counter-economy-cicle to northern europe , and it probably wont get better with more integration . 
  that 's an structural problem and tbh i have no idea how to fix it . 
  it 's pretty difficult to align southern and northern needs . 
  man , people is just having fun , not threatening her , jesus . 
  the republican side was a mess , with so many factions , so i think that yes , they needed a proper army on their side , say french , say british , say soviet . 
  their internal disputes were just a facepalm . 
  the fracoists were not as organized and efficient as propaganda said , so loads of soldiers were not needed , just a proper organization and a sufficient supply of ammo , medical stuff , etc. 
  yep , but that , while courageous , did nothing against the francoist military + nazis + italians . 
  it was impossible to win without formal intervention . 
  well , most allieds decided to do nothing about the spanish civil war . 
  i vote for burning shit . 
  yep , both spanish police and guardia civil have good reputation on gathering intel and anti-terrorist security . 
  there was n't a break from francoist dictatorship to democracy , so certainly most of the know-how has been recycled ... 
  around 5 $ https://soysuper.com/search?q=nutella&amp;sort=uprice%3aasc, 
  we make a big deal with wines here in spain . 
  i bet that many spanish producers would be upset with your comment :p we did n't get the food marketing i suppose . 
  you dream so much . 
  spain will have to defend gibraltar if someone attacks it . 
  i do n't know where to begin with you masturbation about russia an spain invading together gibraltar , it 's just hilarious . 
  ceuta and melilla are not under nato umbrella , even when the spanish government tried to change that multiple times . 
  basically we wont have any response from nato if we had a conflict with our only natural enemy , morocco . 
  russians are just clients there , and afaik they have plenty right to do it if they are not doing any military manouver . 
  is cost of living decent in porto or lisbon , or high for its salaries ? 
  1k in spain is just a bit beyond survival . 
  and +20 % unemployment dont make it any better . 
  so yes , poland may be difficult to live but greece and spain are way worse imho, 
  people complain too much . 
  maybe the quality drowned but face it , that 's what we have . 
  the beauty of being pissed off by your own citizens . 
  that 's the spanish way . 
  i think that it 's because there was a large influx of poor and gipsy romanians , so that 's what people actually call `` romanians '' . 
  we also got news of `` romanian bands '' who came here to steal , and they where very violent ( they entered houses and beat people , etc ) , so people had fear of them . 
  i had three romanian students in my uni and they were a bit pissed off by that . 
  i feel bad for portugal . 
  we have more unemployed people and still they get called poor . 
  not saying their analysis is invalid , but were n't this guys the ones whose emails where released by wikileaks , saying that `` people could be surprised by our sources '' , because said sources where worthless ? 
  i mean , this article is mainly `` open intelligence '' but just to be careful . 
  it really is amazing to me how a basic need as housing has the same problems everywhere , yet the governments do little to nothing about it . 
  rents are eating a large chunk of disposable income of workers , why everyone is so shy to intervene in this market . 
  could be , i find it strange anyway . 
  i cant look for data now , but if you look for wage distribution in madrid i 'm pretty sure the median ( not average ) salary is way lower , and i would even say that 1/3 of them are under 14k . 
  it needs cheap housing , whatever it takes . 
  maybe public investment , maybe private , whatever . 
  people can not pay up to 50 % of their salary in housing , and that 's not accounting for those who earn under 1k $ . 
  carmena wo n't be able to force banks or sareb to open their stock , so if the only way is more stock competing against the free market , then that 's what 's needed . 
  renting prices are going up again , so there 's a massive gentrification process going on in madrid and bacelona .

  you are welcome ;-) we do n't want a war . 
  we want a vote . 
  that 's it . 
  this radical . 
   obviously , right now catalan support is much greater . 
  exactly what i 've said !, 
  just wait a little ;-), 
  outside spain , much more than in spain !, 
  spaniards close their eyes and think it did n't happen . 
  there 's this site , meneame , something like a spanish digg clone , but with the relevance of reddit , that has downvoted to oblivion every demonstration made for independence . 
  the half million on 2010 , downvoted to hell . 
  the million on 2012 , downvoated to hell . 
  the million and a half 400km human chain on 2013 , downvoted to hell . 
  this one , downvoted to hell . 
  none reached the front page . 
  all endend with negative karma . 
  and most spanish media is the same . 
   let 's say we celebrate a referendum . 
  if the yes wins , it would be final . 
  independence . 
  one way road . 
  no return . 
  why ? 
  people later can vote to integrated into the eu , or federate with spain , or whatever . 
  a generation is 20 or 25 years . 
  the polls , you are adding everything that is not a yes to the no . 
  this is simply dishonest . 
  about reaching the 50 % of total voting population , this is not needed . 
  look , last poll is 54 / 22 . 
  so , with a participation of everyone who has an opionion , this is 70 % yes and only a 24 % abstention . 
  a lesser abstention than in most votings here . 
  and last , you are looking into a multiple option poll , not a poll askind independence yes / no . 
  yes , people might prefer federalism , and world peace . 
  but this is impossible . 
  so , realistic people , who utopically might prefer a federation or a confederantion , in an independence vote would say yes , as the real polls say . 
  what kind of split ? 
  i do n't get what you mean . 
  signs in catalonia are usually in catalan , except the few ones from spanish organisms , and the roads depending on the central government . 
  touristic information , and information on buses , metros and so on is in catalan , spanish and english . 
   why would a catalonian bother to learn it , as opposed to just speaking spanish ? 
  a ) we are catalans , as irish are not irlandians :-) b ) bother to learn what ? 
  spanish ? 
  because of years ( centuries ) of opression and being forced to learn it , and large large amounts of spanish speaking immigration . 
  that kind of federation with spain is a utopia , much much more impossible than independence . 
  to fedarate , both sides must agree . 
  independence is a one side thing . 
  on each picture there was a sentence on their language telling them we catalans want a democratic vote on independence . 
  so you can understand it and complain ;-), 
  there were a few thousand volunteers , people registered during the summer , the 11 km were cut in sections ( about 70 ) and when you registered you chose were . 
  i was on section 65 , on 2nd stripe ( red ) . 
  on the website there was real time information on the ocupation of the different sections and on the last days there were calls to join the less filled ones . 
  last year we did a 400km human chain , from north to south of the country , so they had a lot of experience organizing it . 
  there was no violence . 
  lots of kids and old people . 
  i took a picture of a 103 year old woman , and a friend was there with her 94 year old grandma . 
  not the kind of people who throw stones ... :-) there was a spanish new paper asking for pictures of people burning spanish flags . 
  i guess they got not even one , as they would have publicized it a lot . 
  there were huge portraits of most important world leaders , with a sentence in their languages telling them we catalans want to have a democratic vote on independence . 
  there were calls in several languages , but aside of catalan , main language is english , as an international language . 
  have we lost half a million people in the last year ? 
  we do n't know if we are a minority . 
  that 's way we are asking for a vote . 
  not hard to understand , innit ? 
  not as big as for catalan one . 
  entering into a eu federation ? 
  maybe . 
  are portuguese willing to federate with spain , have spanish as official language , the capital moved to madrid , and so on ? 
  agreeing with me ? 
  it looks as if you say the half a million number is truer . 
  no , they are not . 
  or you can understand dutch , just speaking english ? 
  i said catalan and spanish is something like english and dutch . 
  if you are a cultivated person , who aside of speaking spanish speak also french or italian , and has learnt some latin , you 'll understand with no problem written catalan , and with effort , spoken catalan . 
  on the other side , most catalan speakers speak spanish too , but i 've heard some northern catalans ( from the roussillon , in france since 1640 ) who do n't speak spanish complain about us southern catalans because we mix up many spanish words they do n't understand . 
  edit : all human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights . 
  so , according to you , if on 1982 psoe won the elections , no more elections were needed , innit ? 
  on 1707 scotland gave away independence . 
  they should have no right to hold an independence referendum !!!!, 
  on your poll link i can not see your suppose 50/50 , but something like , since 2011 , minimum 43/28 ( so about 60/40 ) latest 54/22 ( about 70/30 ) . 
  yes , i 'm comparing them . 
  same king , but different laws and courts . 
  and if the king wanted money or the make a war , had to come in front of the courts and ask for it . 
  and get it or maybe not . 
  and , by the way , i guess according to you catalonia came out of thin air just the moment before the crown union with the kingdom of aragon , innit ? 
  by the way , this 99,9 % is not of historian , but of spanish nationalistic historians , as p\u00edo moa , i guess . 
   catalonia would never a independent country , sadly can you lend me you cristal ball ? 
  does it show lottery numbers ? 
  no apology needed . 
  an example : all human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights . 
  they are endowed with reason and conscience and should act towards one another in a spirit of brotherhood . 
  catalonia was `` founded '' as the hispanic march or march of gothia by charlemagne , at the end of 8th century . 
  around 990 , as the franks kings did n't respond to help asked by catalan counts those considered themselves as independent . 
  around 1140 the count of barcelona married the daughter of the king of aragon , and the crown of aragon was born . 
  do n't let the name mislead you . 
  the king and the court were in barcelona , spoke catalan , keep the arms of barcelona counts ... 
  the kingdoms were separated ( aragon , valencia and catalonia and mallorca ) , each with its own courts and laws . 
  all independent , but sharing the head of state . 
  and even if you consider it a single independent country , you must identify it with current catalonia . 
  around 1475 the crown of aragon got together with that of castille . 
  but , again , each had its laws and courts .

  me and my cat will be waiting right here . 
  for some reason i have the feeling that spain cares about theirs too . 
  do eet, 
  portugal is awesome , you shut your whore mouth . 
  each week rather . 
  it gets old really fast . 
  at least i did n't see it in our tv this time , so that 's a plus . 
  protectionism is my favourite kind of thing after luddism . 
  pls no send bombs , will give pork in exchange for no icbm freedom . 
  can someone eli5 ? 
  i do n't understand . 
  those pesky russians funding andalusian separatist rebels . 
  that is mostly people bringing their own stuff . 
  there are rentable beach accessories in big beaches too . 
  it 's necessary . 
  terrorists , rebeld and rogue states like north korea will always have weapons . 
  and it is beautiful from an engineering standpoint . 
  but fear mongering is already here eh ? 
  spain was in shambles , not much to contribute even if they wanted to . 
  more like fascists versus everyone else . 
  not everyone was communist in the republican side , that 's ridiculous . 
  cost of living is radically different . 
  spain , 
  i 'm so sorry . 
  sounds exactly like a monday morning . 
  yeah taxes are terrible . 
  especially wide territory ones , ca n't take away my fiscal havens . 
  too many tourists in the damn metro . 
  also 1h commuting with said tourists . 
  as far as i 'm concerned , and as shown in previous general elections , this country is pretty backwards ideologically . 
  i would rather not be part of spain due to this . 
  hopefully next elections will look better ( 27 september ), 
  i live in barcelona and spend around 300 $ a month . 
  in retrospect that was a bit silly . 
  unless relativistic effects come into account , speed does n't affect acceleration . 
  unlike economic growth . 
  bad analogy . 
  yeah , i 'm interning in an engineering company , was looking for another for september and there were lots of offers . 
  yeah , industry seems to be going strong lately . 
  percent of speed as acceleration ? 
  that 's not even the same unit . 
  in other words , you wot m8 ? 
  that does n't mean anything . 
  i 'm sure looking for `` la gran muralla china '' turns up a lot of results but that 's not its name . 
  we are still not over the civil war here . 
  aznar was right all along . 
  there 's people that still say san cucufato del vall\u00e9s . 
  that 's not the name though . 
  nor teruel is terol . 
  i never heard ensanche . 
  literally . 
  it is always . 
  and spain is sorting itself out , next general elections the pp will go down the shitter . 
  if it was n't for a central gov feeding the flames , the independentist movement would n't be half as strong . 
  no , i have been in all of spain 's communities and know them a bit . 
  in the context of the comment , barcelona is n't in space . 
  we are all , but that 's irrelevant . 
  surprising amount of spaniards without a flair . 
  always speaking crap . 
  that 's not true . 
  hell , even legally navarra and euskadi have more independence than us . 
  every catalan knows this . 
  good thing we are n't in space . 
  where 's your flair buddy ? 
  polygon with 8 sides = square . 
  ok guess i should go back to school . 
  ehhh . 
  lol that 's stupid . 
  how would you feel if your neighbouring country had absorbed you 300 years ago ? 
  well i do n't see why do you bring this up . 
  pls give jobs, 
  wages are n't 300 $ tho . 
  how can you work for 300 $ no benefits ? 
  how is that even legal and what do you do ? 
  duh , barcelona is amazing . 
  there would be need for more production if there were buyers . 
  that 's weird . 
  in spain interns make more than minimum wage . 
  azorubine is n't proven dangerous according to the article you linked , right ? 
  that 's amazing . 
  sounds like whiplash , which makes it even better . 
  i have peed against the wall of the police barracks in my city . 
  relevant username eh !, 
  hey that 's really easy to say when it is n't your friends and family thay got killed . 
  if my life was on stake , free speech be damned . 
  doctors make 500 $ in romania ? 
  holy fuck . 
  fix it again tony ? 
  everybody having a 2 story house and a lawn is dense ? 
  i mean , nyc is dense , but here cities do n't have suburbs like that . 
  it is , but pp would ban it back if they could . 
  high density allows for efficient and cheap infrastructure . 
  see public transportation in american cities ? 
  yeah . 
  yeah you must be almost in university by now . 
  they grow so fast ... 
  we already do that . 
  you think pp has a significant amount of voters here ? 
  lol . 
  for me , i 'm just sick of all the dumbasses that keep voting pp .

  in the local institutions ? 
  absolutely . 
  but that 's not only in spain , it happens in a lot of places in the west . 
  we are trying to get rid of that . 
  maybe 20 years ago noone gave a fuck but today is extremely different . 
  dw we were already, 
  might as well buy a brain, 
  you know , the lion-hunting game might stop now , but the spanish-hunting one never does !, 
  yay !, 
  yeah , to rescue your banks from collapsing like a flan . 
  hello . 
  i 'm the next guy . 
  surprised as well . 
  the hunter has been identified . 
  the original information was wrong .

  bribes are just as common in spain than in the uk or sweden or any other ** western ** european country . 
  you wo n't be able to bribe the police , at all . 
  the political system is much more dirty though and it does n't quite represent how the spaniards are in their lifes for the most part . 
  i give you that , i have a very german mindset . 
  spain is zimbabwe now ? 
  til it would n't surprise me that someone from the north defended so in this subreddit though . 
  not really . 
  a half of spain is republican .

  the new parties are more open to republicanism though .

  many of your friends agree anyway . 
  so austria is western but not spain . 
  hahaha . 
  but really , nah . 
  many people ( like miguel urb\u00e1n ) from podemos have said that they do n't agree with what syriza is doing . 
  supporting syriza when things turn bad does n't mean you agree with everything they do every moment . 
  this is part of the new things that people in this country should understand ... 
  political parties are not soccer teams , you should n't support them unconditionally . 
  oh and critizing podemos because of what is syriza doing even when they do n't agree is simply bullshit . 
  this is unnecessarily stupid . 
  spain and greece are different countries with a different economic status . 
  spain is not at the edge of becoming a failed state ... not at least because of its debt . 
  comparing the situation that syriza faces in greece with the situation that podemos might face in spain is calling yourself an ignorant . 
  if we part from there , then there 's nothing much else to discuss about the syriza/podemos comparasions . 
  well , yes , that * they are commies , omfg , they gon na eat babies . 
  because people is stupid and they do n't know who cooked the figures ( new democracy - the greek partido popular , in case there are still any doubts ) . 
   also , what 's the plural of lynx ? 
  http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/british/lynx?q=lynx lynx or lynxes , both are accepted . 
  from this same article :  what is a lynx ? 
   * a medium-sized cat which lives in the wild  * there are four different species - eurasian , iberian , canada and bobcat  * the eurasian lynx is the biggest - about 60cm tall - roughly the same size as a labrador  * ** the iberian lynx is one of the rarest smaller wildcats in the world ** - mainly found in parts of spain and portugal, 
  not needed , iberia is already part of the eu and also provides funding to the eu and pays for the three greek bailouts as well .

  barbarians !!!!, 
  i have a polish friend that tells me dresy are like the british chavs or spanish canis ( they also wear ch\u00e1ndals aka dresy ) , and they tend to do all sort of things to annoy , screw , offend or beat people around . 
  some sort of hooligans but with even less reasons to be scum . 
  is that exaggerated then or it just depends where in poland you are ? 
  what about dresov ? 
  offensive , arrogant and with a pinch of superiority complex a bit , too . 
  til we were a wasteland with no civilization whatsoever until the guys from the north wanted an union with us too . 
  lol . 
  barbarian peoples these days !, 
  well , valencia or baleares do also share catalan language and culture but you do n't mention them . 
  why ? 
  because independentism is strong in catalonia ( and basque country but it 's not catalan ) and not much else . 
  although a strong independentism does n't mean catalonia is n't as part of spain as valencia or baleares are : they quite are with their differences and similarities , just like other iberian/spanish cultures like with the galicians or the castillians . 
  simple as that . 
  you only need one : delicious [ manchego ] ( http://www.gianteagle.com/productimages/product_node_116/99217.jpg ) . 
  sorry france , ca n't compete with that !, 
  yes , the old people of today \u00b4 s used to marry at 18-19 or so when younger . 
  right now that 's extremely rare , like in most other developed countries . 
  i do n't think that 's a coincidence , it 's the culture , rich way of life etc. 
  culture is a big part i 'm sure , since spanish gypsies still marry at 14-16 and start having kids when not even 18-19 . 
  at least a portion of them , since ethnicity does n't mean having the same culture in all cases . 
  i never said it was made for them but i understand why it has been lower for a long time now compared to other neighbouring countries . 
  `` normal '' spaniards do n't marry at the age of 13 , or 14 , or 15 not even 20 or 30 years ago . 
  it used to be younger but not as low as 13 yo . 
   i know you have taken this piece of information from the / r/worldnews then you clearly have no idea what you 're talking about because i do n't visit that subreddit * ever * at all . 
  it 's a coincidence that i live in an area where romani spaniards are majority so it happens that i actually know what i 'm talking about . 
  gypsies always married much younger than non-gypsies in spain as that 's been part of their culture for a long time . 
  this is simply a fact that i also happen to see on my every day life , wether you accept it or not it 's not my problem . 
  you 'd wonder why 'd you marry with 13 years old and suddenly realize spain has around 1m romani , one of their biggest communities in the world . 
  they do marry when very young - ethnic spaniards tend to do it at late 20s , early 30s on average . 
  industry : +60,800 jobs . 
  those are n't seasonal jobs nor summer-related . 
  the reason why unemployment fell so much is summer plus actually good employment figures . 
  edit : downvotes , lmfao . 
  surely some people find the reality to be a bit harsh for them . 
  no matter how many times you guys repeat it : it 's not going to be true . 
  - spain 's debt prior to the crisis : 35 % - spain 's debt today : 100 % what happened ? 
  unsunstainable goverment spending that raised the gdp to debt ratio from 35 % in 2008 to 100 % in 2015 ? 
  nationalization of private debt from the local banks that owed the german and french banks carried over to the public treasury . 
  this happened in both spain and greece . 
  i do n't know about the other peripheral economies , but i 'd say in portugal happened something very similar . 
  keep thinking it 's all about government spending if you 're happy with that tale , but do n't try to confuse the people with lies . 
   but we do n't need a second catholic wave yes , apparently you do n't , they 're already there .

  i support a referendum on immigration ( and i 'm all for controlling the borders ) but as i said , democracy is fun . 
  then it 's just the law being inconsistent , because i can speak in catalan with most government workers , but when you have to talk to a police officer i could either talk him in catalan or in persian , because i 'll get a fine anyway . 
  not by me . 
  democracy is fun , huh ? 
  at least they are trying to make something great again , even if they do n't know how to . 
  they went there but came back because they were afraid of the real nazis of voat . 
  if catalonia is n't real how can my eyes see ? 
  i was going to start a political revolution and change spain for good , but that sounds better . 
  i just found [ some website ] ( https://www.idescat.cat/pub/?id=aec&amp;n=358&amp;lang=es ) with the gdp of the comarques , but it 's from 2014 . 
  i hope people do n't get from this headline that we should end these loans and benefits , as they are more beneficial to society than perjudicial . 
  our decisions are n't black and white , we do n't cut our leg when we just wan na shave it . 
  the latest education law was aimed to better these pisa scores , so i would n't be surprised if we 're scoring good even if we have a really bad education .

  we can have culture without having belief . 
  most religious people in other countries actually believe most of these things , but i would have a hard time finding anyone here who gives too much importance to religious scriptures and what they say . 
  when i think about nazis they are the baddies , not my ancestors . 
  i know we are aiming for a united europe here , but i do n't feel so european to feel guilty for crimes that happened a century ago in another country .

  barcelona pakistanis are pretty chill . 
  i believe this has something to do with the gang culture : once you start having them in your city everything goes downhill . 
  i imagine they know their vote wo n't make a difference anyway , so they prefer to `` send a messsage '' . 
  huh , seems fair . 
   catalan left-wing pro-independence erc also abstained , but because they considered the proposal to be insufficient .

  we are n't in a modpost . 
  this is a user submitted post . 
  i 'm explaining myself or it 's me not understanding you ? 
  i 'm taking about this subreddit , and nobody is hiding that it 's proeu . 
  we even have the eu flag in there , the fact that it 's named `` europe '' means nothing . 
  it 's not like this is some kind of official website that has to stay neutral . 
  both macron and le pen are getting 100 % of the support in these elections in reddit , and both of them are in varying degrees right wing . 
  really ? 
  i do n't think so . 
  do you think macron is a leftist ? 
  everybody wants to be like germany . 
  yes , this subreddit is a geopolitical power now . 
  macron is leading the polls . 
  yes , / r/europe is pro-eu , who would have thought . 
  i just looked at the prices and the cheapest i found was more than 1.000 euros .

  for what i know muslim andalucia was a lot more advanced than the rest of the peninsula at that time . 
  following that rule contemporary al-andaluces would be progessive homosex loving muslims . 
  nationalism , and fear of writing anything contrary of nationalists . 
  this is what their website said . 
  in any case , hating spain would only make us more spanish . 
   because making sure children of french expats will carry the french culture and language with them in the future is an investment for the entire country , we want to invest in french schools abroad and make them free again . 
  do you believe expats from other countries should be free to express their culture and mantain their values in france , or do you think more along the lines of `` in rome , do as the romans do '' ? 
  the whole peninsula is awesome for touristic purposes . 
  brazilian ? 
  israel is controlled by jews , leaks show . 
  maybe because most of spain 's population is concentrated in cities , so we see that many spikes .

  there is a pretty good oscar-winning documentary about this : `` saving face '' , by sharmeen obaid-chinoy . 
  she has also made some other good documentaries recently . 
  i wonder how these traditions start . 
  hmm ? 
  it 's not just french . 
  it 's bad french in italics . 
  that 's actually true . 
  most of our words are from french , and they teach us in school to write in italics . 
  and as you know , catalonia is still a part of spain , so i 'm literally a spanish guy trying to speak french with an italian accent . 
  the roman empire gave us our language , customs , cities , roads ... 
  i can see our ancient origins perfectly .

  cool , now they can also make watches .

  you decide to read my comments , and you are free to filter them .

  [ article in english ] ( http://english.pravda.ru/news/society/sex/06-08-2004/58504-0/ )  in the financial report about the trip to moscow they included tickets to an ` erotic theatre . ', 
  spanish guests paid 129 euros for tickets , although they indicated them as ` taxi expenses . ', 
  you can have a pm owned by corporations with executive and legislative powers and a king . 
  and it 's not fine for the countries that are seeing how taxes that should be paid in their countries are avoided thanks to the fiscal heavens ( most of them commonwealth or part of the uk ) . 
  seeing the guys that we have been electing does n't make anybody optmistic . 
  i know that our elected pm is an order of magnitude ( or three ) worse than the king . 
  and the position does n't have power ; only money , legal immunity and diplomatic immunity . 
  the constitution reserves some power to the king but he has not used it . . 
  however , if i am going to pay somebody to hunt , whore and drink with my taxes while ~ ~ he ~ ~ his family is in shady deals with his shady friends ; he should be at least be elected . 
  i disagree . 
  gibraltar is fiscal heaven and there is a serious smuggling problem specially with tobacco . 
  gibraltar has the right to be a fiscal heaven and spain has the right to have a strict border policy . 
  therefore the situation is perfectly fine . 
  what 's wrong with having an actual border ? , both countries can make their own decisions . 
  it 's a message to them ( and other things ) . 
  if you declare independence spain would close the borders .

   ii 've seriously been saying we should legalize marihuana since the recession started , not because i smoke ( i do n't ) but because of the jobs and tax revenue it would create i have said the same with heroine and i am not kidding , it would be better than afghan war lords . 
  i ca n't find anything about that now . 
  but there are popularity polls , maybe i was thinking about the popuarity [ polls ] ( http://politica.elpais.com/politica/2014/06/02/actualidad/1401704469_632570.html ) the monarchy has popularity of 3.72 . 
  edit : spain has n't included in the official cis polls the monarchy [ since 1982 ] ( http://www.lasexta.com/programas/el-objetivo/noticias/1982-pregunta-espanoles-prefieren-monarquia-republica_2013110300391.html ) . 
  this was the last one popular printed . 
  there is also [ mongolia ] ( http://www.revistamongolia.com/ ) that is independent , but it 's not very well known . 
  all the printed media and tv-channels are monarchist . 
  there are two sort of popular online publications http://wwweldiaro.es and http://www.publico.es but that 's it . 
  well and the pro-independence basque and catalan media that 's true . 
  you need to remember that most of the media needs the favour of the government to work . 
  and all the printed newspapers live from things like institutional adds ( the government annouces that is doing some construction work and pays overprice for telling in the media , or campaigns for vial security ) or less transparents subsidies like the public adminsitrations buying thousands of copies for libraries and offices because reasons . 
  you need to have a good relation with the government for getting adds from the government . 
  it has n't been censored by the writers of the magazine . 
  it 's an order of the main shareholder rba .

  edit : the company has decided that they are monarchist . 
  nobody expected the republican reaction , due to it the editiorials are starting to restrict republican opinions and put a strong monarchist campaign in the media to try to change the public opinion . 
  i am republican , but i did n't think that the question is so important . 
  i am surprised of the strong defense of the monarchy by the establishment and by the surprisingly strong public hostility that has been shown these days . 
  edit2 : why are all the spanish media groups monarchist ? 
  it 's weird that with a support in the polls of 38 % all the newspapers , tv channels , radio and magazines owned by big companies and if the journalist or cartoonist do n't like it they know where is the exit . 
  i do n't understand why our ruling class wants the monarchy so hardly . 
   when you make a investment you can make money and lose money thats the way things work yep and now the financial sector is broken , 90 % of the construction companies died , millions of families have underwater mortgages , we have millions of long term jobless that only have worked in construction or picking oranges who are n't going to work in the rest of their life . 
  the effects of the mixture of unregulated of a wild west were you were allowed to build everything , cheap credit , and tax breaks for buying with mortgages are going to last decades . 
   goes down at least you got the housing we are going to end tearing down half of it sooner of later . 
  * 3 years of net emigration . 
  we are expected to have a net emigration of 2 million of inhabitants the next ten years . 
  * the birth rate is falling even more and we will have more deaths than births starting on 2017 according to the government * higher taxes on property , expensive utilities . 
  lower pruchasing power of the population . 
  nobody is going to live in the new suburbs . 
  * high unemployment that keeps the families together for sharing expenses * for the public administrations is also a waste to provide services and utilities to sparsely populated areas were almost nobody lives but that are full of houses , parks and stuff . 
  a construction bubble is more complicated to fix . 
  spain has a third of the empty homes in europe , and the population of spain was growing then . 
  and this houses are new no old houses in rural areas of romania and bulgaria were everybody has left . 
  spain got billions in loans for its private sector and built millions of homes were nobody lives . 
  the lost opportunities on this hurts . 
  london is the biggest metropolitan area in th eu . 
  how big and dense has to get it ? 
  uk can let london grow even more . 
  but we may want to make grow also other areas . 
  did n't we do that ? 
  sort of the laws regulating it by the spanish government were declared illegal because it was a local and regional matter . 
  and the local governments authorized everything . 
  it 's true the prices of housing have fallen 7 years in a row , but massive construction has had more effects in our economy . 
  can spaniards emigrate to wherever the jobs are created ? 
  putting the head of the imf there in these conditions . 
  this would be a great gift to the left in spain specially to podemos . 
  if they managed to stay in the eu it may be better for them . 
  they would keep all the money that they are sending to territorial cohesion and do n't lose any access to the internal markets . 
  but , spain wo n't let that happen . 
  if they leave the have to be worse to teach a lesson to basque country . 
  spain has made clear that spain will force the eu to either not recognize the independence or if it actually happens to put borders . 
  i already said what i actually think about the a republic [ here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/273in4/the_king_of_spain_juan_carlos_i_has_resigned/chx926u ) ( tldr : nice , not actually critical )  do n't forget that it was a right-wing government of the republic that ordered the bloody repression of the 1934 revolution ) . 
  an answer logical to an attempt of overthrowing a democratically elected government even if too brutal . 
  and the germans are already w\u00f6rking that plan . 
  hey !, 
  our monarchy is also corrupt . 
  do you wan na trade ? 
  that did n't happened on the week that finished the first of june . 
  it 's a possibility of course . 
  the outcome is n't clear . 
  i think/hope that it is n't the more likely . 
  spain would need to do serious reforms to avoid it . 
  he was a king in a democracy . 
  he got a 10 millions euros/year to spend in whatever he wanted , read discourses written by government officers , went to honorary dinners , give medals approved the government and a lot of protocol activities ... and his heir was replacing him in that more and more often lately anyway . 
  this is n't going to change a lot . 
  unless the new king wants to get involved into politics you know like negotiations about a change in status of catalonia and/or the catalan language . 
  but i do n't that nobody wants to see somebody a royal involved in actual politics . 
  i am republican ( check my flair ) , but honestly the king has been a small parasite that drained money and has n't done anything in 30 years , but he has n't done a lot of damage either . 
  he was n't in my top ten of people to get ride of ; like [ the pm that financed ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/aug/01/mariano-rajoy-denies-illegal-funds his campaign illegally , the [ galician premier ] ( https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=es&amp;tl=en&amp;js=y&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=es&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fwww.eldiario.es%2fgalicia%2ffeijoo-narcotraficante-dorado-politica-gallega_0_116888510.html&amp;edit-text= ) with drug dealing connections , the non-existent * opposition * leader ( he has finally step down after the european election results ) ... 
  if i had to choose between a working judicial and protected in the constitution and a republic i would choose the first . 
  even if i want both . 
  for me the flag is only a symbol of that i want a new/better country . 
  no removing the king and business as usual . 
  the options were constitutional monarchy and non-constitutional monarchy ( surprise !, 
  surprise ! ) .

  it 's not a disqualifying factor , but for me it 's a con . 
   and us being blonde porn stars/sex-crazed people . 
  i was n't aware of that one . 
  the stereotype here is more like hot but shy . 
  i think most europeans would agree that sanders was at the very least your best choice given the pool of candidates you had . 
  my main concern about him , that i share with most candidates , was his age - 74 while starting a potential 8 year old presidency is crazy !, 
  when the concern is not only that he 'll be too old to understand the young , but that * he might be too old to be alive at the end of it all * you know you need to think about it . 
  spain is harmed by our lazyness stereotype . 
  we have this terrible work culture where we tend to work far more than other european countries , it is culturally shunned to leave at the hour specified in your contract , extra hours are n't paid , etc. 
  as a result people loathe going to work and performance is abysmal . 
  we need to follow a more european model where people work less hours and use their hours efficiently instead of staying forever checking the internet and the news - also providing flexible schedules and telecommuting as much as it 's possible . 
  but good luck trying to sell that spain will reduce working hours despite its economy being fucked under our lazy stereotype . 
  a similar problem occurs with science , english and math , where we are at the bottom of europe by skills of the general population and the only solution ever suggested is to increase the school hours allocated to those subjects , without improving the way they 're taught and the teachers ' skills . 
  i 'm on my phone right now , but try to use the search function on askreddit because there was a thread some days ago with a very similar question ( it was something like `` americans who went to europe for free education , how did it go ? '' ) . 
  i think their consensus was that germany offers the most for non europeans , but the caveats are that they offer a small amount of courses in english ( the rest requires german ) and that the first/second course are harder than in other countries ( since they use it to weed out students ) . 
  we 're also 47 million people . 
  even receiving several hundred thousand people would n't be as `` scary '' a number as it would be for a nordic country whose entire population is the size of madrid 's . 
  and talking about muslims destroying our culture would sound kinda silly when we have 700 years of muslim culture behind , 
  not exactly - there 's a ( limited and shy ) law/project from 2007 addressing the issue , but it 's been stopped ever since rajoy was elected . 
  his party did n't dare to repeal the law openly , but the budget allocated for it to take effect has been set at 0 $ so it only exists on paper . 
  as some others that have posted here , i also consider it a necessary evil . 
  as for its reppeal , honestly i do n't care . 
  justice ca n't be done ( the death wo n't come back ) , it 's to late for rehabilitation , and revenge does n't lead anywhere . 
  i think that a lot of the deals that resulted from the transition need to be reviewed , but punishing francoist criminals is pretty far down my list . 
  up in the list would be : - proper treatment of the victims ' memory ( some of them are still buried in random holes in middle of nowhere ) . 
  - political reforms that the country needs and can now be addressed after we 've achieved stability . 
  - removal of political symbols related to francoists - there are still street names and symbols in old buildings that should be removed . 
  - a german-style criminalization of denialism and displays of francoist symbology like the old flag . 
  i mean , we 're 46 million people ... 
  cutting all contact is fine but i think you can risk it at that point . 
   there is no bad weather , only bad clothing . 
   that 's what i tell myself when i 'm cold and miserable waiting for the bus in a blizzard . 
  the cold can probably be fixed by clothing ( if you 're willing to put on and off 23 layers after entering and exiting buildings ) , but it 's the sunlight i would n't be able to live without . 
  i worked for some months in a company where i started working before sunrise and went out when it was already dark , and it was probably the most depressing time of my life . 
  there 's something about that sort of `` hug of warmth '' that you get from staying in front of sunlight that makes you feel like everything 's gon na be ok , whatever your problem is . 
  the key to understand how widespread piracy is in spain is that the agency that takes care of author 's rights ( sgae ) behaved in such a cartoonishly devilish way they put the whole population against them . 
  a decade ago they were making the news constantly with stories like entering a wedding party to check what music was being played to sue them , or trying to push a `` piracy tax '' on all media where pirated content could be stored , from writable blank cds to memory cards - that they managed to get in effect for some time . 
  there was a lawyer ( david bravo ) that became famous at a national level just as the go-to guy to push against the organization in tv debates and other media - hilarious guy btw , he later became a congressman for podemos . 
  there 's an old mating ritual that goes something like dale dale dale dale dale dale dale mr worldwide . 
  there 's a day of the week that 's free for eu citizens iirc . 
  that explains it haha . 
  the inside of the palace is n't really that cool , just several ostentatious rooms ; but the visit also includes the royal armory which is impressive . 
  [ i usually have lunch in the grass of spain 's royal palace ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/88/palacio_real%2c_madrid%2c_espa%c3%b1a%2c_2014-12-27%2c_dd_15-17_pan.jpg/1200px-palacio_real%2c_madrid%2c_espa%c3%b1a%2c_2014-12-27%2c_dd_15-17_pan.jpg ) . 
  the empire was once ruled from the place where i have a sandwich . 
  we learn uk english in school in spain . 
  however , i mainly use english to enjoy american media or in american centered sites like reddit , so at this point it 's probably a mix . 
  the dialect i have in my phone 's auto correct tends to be relevant too , and that language is usually us english ( due to it being more easily set ) . 
  wallapop is huge here , it 's an app used for buying and selling second hand - pretty decent for everything from improving a personal collection to getting rid of your old tv . 
  there 's also badi , an app that lets you use tinder-like selection to find people to share a house with - not like airbnb , but long term housemates . 
  fintonic is an app that connects to your bank account and provides both push notifications when events happen ( bills are passed , you got your pay , etc ) and also automatically organizes your data so you know how much you spend on clothes , food and so on - it even lets you set goals and keep track of them . 
  edit : also justeat : one single website that shows all restaurants that deliver food near you and lets you order from there . 
  they take care of the payment and consumer service , and you can see reviews . 
  one could argue the opposite , that a proportional representation would not make sense for larger countries . 
  i think a mix of both is needed . 
  i know about euronews , but i 'm looking for something in a classic magazine format - including also opinion pieces , interviews , etc. 
  / r/europe runs a weekly thread called `` what happened in your country this week ? '', 
  where users report summaries from their own countries . 
  perhaps you could skim through past weeks . 
  [ here 's the list . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/search?q=what+happened+in+your+country+this+week&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all ) you could also download past issues of magazines that publish monthly or weekly like the economist , which is far more palatable than a giant pile of newspapers published daily . 
  i do n't mind a militarization of police ** gear ** : cops have always carried guns here yet misuse is extremely rare , i ca n't remember a single case of a cop shooting in an unwarranted situation . 
  as long as proper use of force is respected i do n't care if they 're carrying a stick or a bazooka . 
  i think the problem of militarization in the context of police would be an application of military tactics against citizens , or training based on a `` us vs them '' mentality rather than being trained as public servants . 
  but as far as i know that does n't happen . 
   tortilla chips are specifically the chips that go in nachos , here they are eaten with salsa almost as much as with cheese then we use different terms , cause we do n't call the whole dish nachos . 
  it 's nachos con queso ( with cheese ) , or nachos con salsa x ( with x sauce ) , the implication being that nachos is the name of the thing you dip in the bowl . 
   edit : i also never expected to see them in reference to omelettes , but then it kinda makes sense , as the action for making an omelette is fairly similar to making a half quesadilla the spanish term tortilla is older than the mexican use or quesadillas - older than europe 's arrival to america in fact . 
  in spanish , tortilla literally means `` little torta '' , torta being a generic term for food made by a mass of flour ( it comes from an old greek word for bread ) . 
  how it ended up being used to refer to omelettes is unknown , since both are very basic dishes known from immemorial times in one form or another : you do n't really need an advanced civilization to throw a couple of stirred eggs in a pan after all . 
  spanish from spain uses the term tortilla for either [ omelettes ( which we call french tortillas ) ] ( http://www.demoslavueltaaldia.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_detail/public/tortilla_francesa_3.jpg?itok=js8wazga ) or , well , [ spanish tortilla ] ( https://www.hogarmania.com/archivos/201209/tortilla-espanola-patatas-668x400x80xx.jpg ) , which is a kind of omelette too . 
  if you speak about tortillas in spain , it will be understood that you 're referring to one of those , unless you 're specifically in a mexican restaurant . 
  tortilla chips are called nachos , unless there 's a distinction i 'm not aware of . 
   how much latin american food ordinates from latin america instead of from spain itself ? 
  a huge amount , to the point that if you see a latin american dish you can assume with safety that in general it does n't come from spain : arepas , tacos , empanadas , ceviche , chip\u00e1 , quesadillas ... 
  it makes sense after all . 
  we have n't been the same country for hundreds of years , and even if we were , gastronomy tends to be regional as it depends a lot on what products are geographically more available . 
  and if you visit spain , you 'll see that an hour drive in any direction is enough to be in a place where typical dishes are wildly different . 
  there 's * a lot * of variety concentrated in such a relatively small area . 
  i made a comment yesterday to a mexican user that i think answers this question , so since it was buried in an old thread i 'll repost it here :  for what is worth , i think mexico 's behaviour towards spain during the civil war is really underrated and unknown . 
  not a lot of people know of the support you gave , and that the very president of our republic was saved of a humiliating death by the mexican government . 
   when he died in france in exile , he was refused a proper burial by french ( nazi collaborationist ) authorities , who wanted him to be buried under the new ( dictatorial ) spanish flag . 
  mexico 's ambassador intervened , facing the french authorities by saying :   lo cubrir\u00e1 con orgullo la bandera de m\u00e9xico - para nosotros ser\u00e1 un privilegio , para los republicanos una esperanza , y para ustedes , una dolorosa lecci\u00f3n   ( the flag of mexico will cover him pridefully - for us it will be a privilege ; for republicans some hope , and for you a painful lesson ), 
  i have not used firearms nor i have a particular interest in that . 
  i see automatic weapons relatively frequently in madrid ( police near important places like congress , soldiers protecting buildings that belong to the army , that sort of thing ) . 
  to be honest , after several conversations with gun owners , i think despite all the supposed logic behind owning a gun ( what i 'd the government turns evil , etc ) most people just like them as adult toys . 
  i would n't like guns becoming commonplace where i live , i think they create some sort of arms race between criminals , citizens and police , which is not worth it . 
  i 'm not scared by them , i know they are just tools , i just do n't think that the benefits of having them around outweight the risks . 
   i would very well say giving people the option to deny the right to exist to other human beeings is against life . 
  its not the state issue to support everybody with tax money , but it is verry well its issue to defend everybodies given rights , and the right to life is a right . 
  if a women gets pregnant from one of the said situations thats indeed a problematic situation , but the person that is responsible has to be punished , not the innocent child . 
  everybody would agree that killing a one year old because the circumstances of its existence are n't in favour of the mother is a crime , but somehow its totaly fine killing it if it still in the womp . 
  all that logic relies on the implication that the fetus is a child or a human life already , which absolutely is n't a given . 
  the scientific way of aproaching the problem would be that what defines a human is his brain ( a person without a leg is still a person , yet if you take the brain out then what remains is not a person but an empty body ) . 
  so a human would be a human once it has a somewhat functioning brain . 
  at one point of the pregnancy , the fetus is little more than a pool of goo , and at the other it 's become a human being with a somewhat developed brain - human life and consciousness start somewhere in the middle , but definitely not at the very start , since certainly there is no brain in that pool of goo . 
  the only way to escape the former reasoning is negating that a human is defined by its brain , and instead relying on the idea of a soul or something similar - and also believing that said soul is created at conception . 
  if you believe that , it 's your right , but then you should recognize that legislating on this idea would be imposing your religious/spiritual beliefs on the rest , which is unethical and illegal . 
  for what is worth , i think mexico 's behaviour towards spain during the civil war is really underrated and unknown . 
  not a lot of people know of the support you gave , and that the very president of our republic was saved of a humiliating death by your government . 
  when he died in france in exile , he was refused a proper burial by french ( nazi collaborationist ) authorities , and wanted him to be buried under the new ( dictatorial ) spanish flag .

  if this was your thought process , i do n't get your reference to french immigrants and comparing them to other groups . 
  what you should compare is `` total people/immigrants whose mother tongue is not english '' vs `` total people/natives who were taught french as second language on school and are suppose to be able to speak it '' . 
  so , yeah , it 's normal french is first second language in the uk . 
  i guess you mean outside catalan speaking areas . 
  in catalan speaking areas there are about 12-13m people , of which about 8m have catalan as mother tongue and the remaining 4-5m have it as a second language . 
  so , a the second language of about 10 % of total spanish population looks enough to make it third most spoden second language . 
  and people like me , my family and most of my friends ... ;-), 
  `` languages people speak who are not their mother tongue '' . 
  are you really saying that everyone living in cyprus has greek as their mother tongue ??? 
  the english on the map is the second language of the people who have any other language as their first , not just irish language . 
  so , a polish living in ireland whose second language is english would be there . 
   but are n't the mother tongue of the country improve your english reading skills !, 
  :-) it does n't say so . 
  it talks about their mother tongue , that of the people living there . 
  french immigrants have mostly english as main second language , and most , if not all , will have french as first language . 
  any idea to explain the difference between lithuania and estonia and latvia ? 
  and the government knows where your permanent address is because you have registered !, 
  if you did n't , i do n't think you 'd be able to vote . 
  so , that 's it . 
  with your registration in the town comes your vote , as many other things . 
  because your parents registered you , or when you changed residence , you registered on the town council . 
  but without this registering , you would not be able to vote , i 'm quite sure . 
  do you have a national id card , maybe ? 
  with your address , or that asked for your address ? 
  you have to register for voting and many other things , all together . 
  but , to vote , you have to be registered . 
  no register , no vote . 
  my point is , how did you get to that list without , according to you , having been registered previously ? 
  i love your wording . 
  no need to ** register , ** but you get the card mailed to your ** registered ** address . 
  well , op and many others answering here do n't seem to think they have ever registered in any way . 
  and you were on that list just by magic , innit ? 
  and if you change your residence , also by magic , you 'll disappear form your old town list and appear on your new town one , of course . 
  so , if you never registered , how come the polling card reaches you ? 
  magic ? 
  and if you go live elsewhere , and register nowhere , do you really think you 'll keep on getting your polling card ? 
  to all the ones saying no registration is needed , how do you know where to go to vote ? 
  can you go to any polling station in the country ? 
  i do n't think so . 
  here you must be registered on the town you live , not just to vote , but to access other benefits . 
  and if you go to live to some other town , unless you register there , you 'll be expected to vote on your old town . 
  excuse me ? 
  what are you talking about ? 
  ( in this case , it 's catalonia ) well , lots of reasons . 
  historical , cultural , linguistical , economical , political ... mostly , we think we would be better without spain . 
  we do n't feel well treated ( in any of the previous topics ) . 
  no reason ? 
  not paying taxes to cross catalan borders ? 
  having direct road and rail access to the eu ? 
  not losing the eu a net contributor who might give them money ? 
  if spain does not acknowledge catalan independence , then catalonia would be by definition part of the eu . 
  spain can not veto the admission of something that , according to them , would be still part of spain . 
  argh !, 
  not * catalonian * but ** catalan ** or do they say * englandian , * * francian , * * germanian ... ? 
  well , that ural river is the border between europe and the rest of asia is widely accepted . 
  look on any map . 
  the part west of ural river . 
  in the linked map , you can see it just over the caspian see . 
  it 's the western part of west kazakhstan and atyrau provinces . 
  they forgot to paint the european part of kazakhstan . 
  again , this is a mean . 
  not just strict spain . 
  you live in catalonia , i guess . 
  do you think it is such a catholic place ? 
  it 's on the poll , under spain label . 
  you know this poll does not only include strict spain , do n't you ? 
  neapolitan is indeed a different language than italian , according to linguists . 
  are you sure you are talking about a dialect , or about another language ? 
  well , i think maybe i 've met a couple of people my age ( 40s ) or younger who does n't have at least a non catalan grandparent . 
  and many of the people who have three or four non catalan grandparents are now proindependence . 
  there 's a book called `` the catalan system of reproduction '' or something similar , by a demographer , explaining that for the last centuries almost all population growth has been through assimilated immigration . 
  occitan people on 18th century , spaniards on 20th , south americans and africans on 21st ... just without the immigration from 20th century , it 's calculated we would not be 7,5 m people , but something like just 2,5 m or 3m . 
  well , this indicates problems assimilating people , innit ? 
  no idea about druids in wales or scotland . 
  i 've been to england a few times . 
  but i was talking about the general vision . 
  thanks . 
  as a culture , music , history ... respected . 
  as individuals : pale white skinned people who get extremely red with the first sun rays , drunkers , shouters , annoying and pissing everywhere . 
  if claiming heritage is saying `` i 'm swedish '' , because some of your ancestors was , even if you have never been there , and you do n't speak the language , i feel like they are idiots . 
  if they say `` my granma was swedish '' , that 's ok . 
  no view at all . 
  slavs , that 's all . 
  now , with the recent events , people may have some special simpaty . 
  but . 
  there are ( almost ) no ukrainian immigrants , people know nothing about the country , culture , whatever . 
  edit . 
  after reading the other answers , maybe there 's the idea of beautiful women , but mostly prostitutes ( i think the only ukrainian to appear on a catalan tv series was a prostitute ) . 
  italian , due to the musicality . 
  occitan , because it sounds like some weird ancient catalan . 
  what 's '' / int / '' ? 
  hey , we got into the 0,1 % list !, 
  right now , you are losing lots of discussions on catalan independence :-), 
  so , what 's your suggestion when you want to get independent from another country when this other country does n't want to allow you ? 
  if democracy , a vote , a referendum , is not an option , what 's the idea ? 
  are you suggesting we should start a war ? 
  because borders drawn thru blood seem to be recognised . 
  why should we change the spanish constitution if we do n't want to be spaniards . 
  it 's their constitutions , it 's them who must decide if they want to change it . 
  polls say so , but we want to have a vote , a democratic vote .

  i think your government wants to be sure that their people wants to be harder in negotiations . 
  and the support of greeks will be as well a good argument in them . 
  the question that your government makes is clear , i have read it in the ballot . 
  what i do n't know is if in your media they are trying to create confusion instead of helping . 
  i think you are understimating too much your ancestors . 
  things are complicated . 
  what are you going to do for your future an your nation 's ? 
  you are an adult , so it 's time for you to decide about your country . 
  you are saying that nothing was done in greek the last 2000 years . 
  look around and see how other countries in the world are . 
  greece , even now , is not among the poorest . 
  it 's a great country , with great history , with great hard working people , with a beautiful nature . 
  do n't believe that greece is worth nothing , because it 's not true . 
  now we have to swallow that the crisis comes from pensioners . 
  this is getting sinister . 
  they wasted the money ? 
  the money was in a 90 % to pay debts . 
  or do you mean that not invest it for growing was wasting it ? 
  in this moment , after 5 years of deep crisis , pensions are a humanitarian question . 
  for growing is necessary investment . 
  with the amount of debt they have it will be impossible . 
  it 's not only wondering . 
  it has been already proved . 
  so why should we continue with the same ? 
  to get the same results ? 
  how much unemployment and poverty does europe need to see to wake up ? 
  yes but it 's not the moment of cutting pensions because many families live of it . 
  when they begin to grow and create employment then could be cut . 
  now , it will only provoke a descend of the demand , that would be bad for commerce and wo n't be good for anything . . 
  yes , and then we will say : ` you can live because i want you to live . 
  give thanks ' . 
  when the truth would be : ` you are poor ( and we have lost 300,000,000,000 ) because we have acted like idiots ' . 
  they have made a lot of change in the direction you want and this has been the result . 
  with more of it we wo n't get our money back . 
  you are obsessed with pensions . 
  they do n't want to cut them anymore because with an unemployment of 28 % , 50 % in young people , many families are living of that pensions . 
  if they cut more they wo n't solve any problem , there will be less money in circulation for the companies , shops , etc , not to die . 
  what they need is restructuration and investments . 
  otherwise the debt wo n't be paid , and many countries , like spain wo n't get the money that are owed . 
  the problem is that the measures of troika were wrong . 
  they failed in their predictions , and they have brought an unsustainable situation . 
  they do n't want to recognise that because they would have to assume responsibilities . 
  it 's a huge problem because they would look like idiots if they said : ` sorry greeks , we were wrong . 
  sorry because we have made you lose a 25 % of your wealthness ( like happens after a war ) and sorry also to all the creditors countries because we made you lose 300,000,000,000 $ . 
   sorry guys , bye bye . '', 
  romania did n't owe 300,000,000,000 $ so it could n't negotiate anything . 
  if greece exits many countries will lose a lot of money . 
  spain included . 
  we need them to grow and pay . 
  many countries are concerned . 
  i 'm sure that if you greek people arrive to a point of starving to death , european citizens will make a crowfunding for giving you food . 
  they will be so happy feeling that theyare so kind ... that 's how the brain of stupid people works , they cant preview situations they need to have them in front to be able to understand . 
  europeans are solidary but they need to see the suffering . 
  i hope they wake up . 
  this is a stupid challenge that greeks do n't deserve for the fact of having a government that says the truth . 
  i 'm with greece citizens whatever they choose . 
  if things go worse europe will have to do a humanitarian rescue . 
  or are we going to permit hunger in greece ? 
  if we allow the grexit we 'll lose 300,000,000,000 ... all this is stupid . 
  european leaders are thinking only in politics , in winning the next elections . 
  but remember we were fascist because franco declared the war to the republica , democratically elected , and won the war with the help of nazis . 
  in spain you already had to apply for a permit to hold a demostration . 
  this goes much further . 
  terrible . 
  shame . 
  reduce a complex problem into a single cause is ... well , i do n't want offend . 
  every greek has a degree in austerity . 
  they know what it is , and they can imagine how it would be a little bit more of it . 
  it 's exactly what they are doing with pablo iglesias speech . 
  if you have that proof , you can ask for it some millions of euros here in spain . 
  and yes , listen to pablo i. speaking in the parliament for example . 
  that 's the bullshit that right wing media wants you to believe . 
  go to the real sources , avoid newspapers . 
  in spain , after 7 years of austerity we are still with 25 % of unemployment , 50 % for young people , 30 % of poor children . 
  salaries lower and lower . 
  400.000 people emigrated last year . 
  this is not the story of a success . 
  pp has lost a lot of support in last local elections and is quite sure that are going to lose next elections in november . 
  the parties that will win have an anti-austerity speech . 
  they know what austerity is . 
  so it is , do you accept more austerity from europe or do you prefer make something different and risky that can be worse , equal but also better ? 
  your nick matches perfectly with your speech . 
  they even eat . 
  what a simple thinking . 
  situation in greece is little bit more complicated . 
  they have been acceptig troika austerity reforms for 5-6years , after that their situation is much worse . 
  they have lost a lot because of this wrong measures . 
  nobody is guilty of this . 
  greece is not the first country ruined by ecb and imf 's austerity measures . 
  look for infomation on the web . 
  why germany 's debt after 2ww was pardoned , and now something like that seems so imposible ? 
  why imf recognises that austerity does n't work and keeps on with it ? 
  if greece leaves the euro , creditors are going to get their money back ? 
  if they are not , is a honour problem ? 
  a fight of prouds ? 
  will be that good for economy ? 
  what about other countries like spain that are seeing that after 7 years of austerity we do n't see any improvement ? 
  do you really think that what they want is to still having free money ? 
  they are paying debts with that money , they do n't enjoy it . 
  this is clearly not working , everybody knows that .

  yet , you all , all of you , want more . 
  i do n't want more . 
  i am not asking for money . 
  it 's not going to solve anything . 
  if nothing else changes they are going rob it . 
   above all , what irritates me is that you want to shift the responsibility to us , to me . 
  i do n't talk about blame , i talk about consequences . 
  what do you think that sweden should ? 
  * leaving the eu and schengen , to protect yourselves from the consequences . 
  * keep throwing money . 
  * try to fix the eu and the countries . 
  i do n't believe that the status quo can last a long time , and the problems are n't being fixed . 
  imf published that they do n't expect significant recovery in spain until [ 2018 at least . 
  ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/1joo5o/spain_will_have_an_unemployment_rate_above_25/ ) * what do you expect me to do ? 
  * what do you think that the rest of the eu should do ? 
  if that means accepting corrupt and authoritarian governments i am not interested . 
   it is your country , you have the ideas , start implementing them . 
  saying is very easy . 
  i have given up with spain . 
  i emigrated . 
  : /  why ? 
  * italy , spain , greece , romania , bulgaria participate in the process to make laws that affect you . 
  our corrupt and failed countries . 
  * we can migrate freely to sweden . 
  are you ready for massive immigration ? 
  * you are giving funds to development of poor regions . 
  this funds are misused . 
  how do you feel about that ? 
  you are right in that is more important for us . 
  but , it also affects you . 
  like the authoritarian government in usa . 
  * the government is ruling by decree * government appointed more party members to the judicial power and to the constitutional court . 
  * government is messing with the regulators to favour some companies * director of the central bank is a party member . 
  * previous government passed a law to make the public radio and tv independent . 
  they rollback that . 
  * government presented a proposal to unify all the market regulators in a single body controlled by the president . 
  eu is blocking that and threatened with sanctions . 
  * spanish pp was founded by a former dictatorship minister and has creepy attitude towards it . 
  * government is avoiding the parliament * government is repeating the same bullshit as dictator with gibraltar . 
  however there is n't anything ideological in this the government only wants : * take over the regulators to favour the cronies * missuse public without restrictions * handle the utilities to private monopolies * keep the power * do n't go to prison * do whatever they want in general . 
  i would expand later , if it 's posible . 
   so , what exactly do you want me to do ? 
  i have the same question . 
  you ca n't pretend that this is n't your problem . 
  you are also a member of the eu . 
  should i say that the drug dealing connections of the president of the spanish galicia is only their problem ? 
  it affects all of us . 
   for example , how fix southern italy and corrupion ? 
  i do n't how to fix that in spain either . 
  :( i would say that we need : * independent and well funded judicial system * independent regulators * restrict the capacity of the government to pass laws by decree * a clear political framework where you can know what public has a competence . 
  * transparency : the accounts of the parties , workers unions , business unions , private companies should be public . 
  * a better elite selection system . 
  maybe we should regulate the organization of the political parties and change to a electoral law without closed lists ( but italy did that and they keep the old politicians * we should do something about the corrupt , drunk , womanizer that we call king . 
  * more incompatibilities between private sector * jobs * and * consultant services * and political jobs . 
  this is easy to say , but hard to do . 
  rajoy is trying to do the same in spain . 
  but we do n't talk about that . 
  there is ideology worse than fascism in spain for most of the people neoliberalism . 
  the conclusions are the usual . 
  eu should keep giving them money and the problems will fix by themselves . 
  how we can fix the massive corruption problem ? 
   let them get on with whatever they want to do and pursue sanctions after the fact . 
  you need to complain you if you want to pursue sanctions . 
  and you should pursue sanctions . 
   which could partly explain the growth ? 
  yes , but italy was bigger than uk or france . 
  now it 's shrinking very quickly and nobody cares . 
   who do you think will absorb bail out costs if france refuse ? 
  i hope that the bailouts would stop they are n't solving anything . 
  [ italy was a big economy ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/economy_of_italy#from_stagflation_to_stagnation_.281970s.e2.80.9380s.29 )  as a matter of fact , in 1987 , italy had a period when it surpassed the british economy ( an event known as il sorpasso ) , becoming the fifth in the world . 
  on 15 may 1991 italy became for a while the fourth worldwide economic power , overcoming france , with a gdp of us$ 1.268 trillion , compared to france 's gdp of us$ 1.209 trillion and britain 's of us$ 1.087 trillion . 
  despite this , however , italy 's alleged 1987 gdp growth of a phenomenal 18 % , it was shortly re-overtaken by both france and the united kingdom during the 1990s , when italy 's economic growth was particularly stagnant , with an average of 1.23 % compared to an eu average of 2.28 % . 
  italy was the biggest economy of the eu . 
  but the average growth of the las ten years [ is negative ] ( http://www.gfmag.com/component/content/article/119-economic-data/12369-countries-lowest-gdp-growth.html#axzz2bgvic9bi ) france has grown a 1.0 . 
  why this obsession with the french decline ? 
  italy and spain are having a bigger decline and nobody seems to care . 
  what 's your proposal to feed that people ? 
  is the subsistence agriculture our future ? 
  :( and , how would you get the farmland if you are poor ? 
  spain there is plenty of unused farmland , part of the farmland is owned by the government . 
  however , government wants that its farmlands stay unused . 
  there was a riot recently because unemployed members of a farm workers union started to work a estate that used to breed horses . 
  government sent the militar-civil riot police . 
  the union leaders are being tried . 
  [ the prosecutor ask for seven months of prison ] ( http://www.elmundo.es/elmundo/2013/07/15/andalucia/1373880437.html ), 
  spain is not going to allow the referendum . 
  government said they would send catalan government to prison before allowing it . 
  there are more jobless out of town that in town . 
  what 's your point ? 
  it 's not like the people can be picky with the retail jobs ( or unskilled in general ) and work only near their home because there is a big supply of jobs and they can be picky . 
  who can afford children ? 
  spain is going to have an unemployment rate over 25 % until at least 2018 , [ according to imf ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/1joo5o/spain_will_have_an_unemployment_rate_above_25/ ) this is not a crisis . 
  this is permanent . 
  it 's also like that in spain . 
  but , that 's due to that they are firing employees . 
  if the demand is a 15 % lower you fire 15 % of your employees and you pay a lower salary to the ones that stay with you . 
   comparing spain to north korea is quite insulting to one of the worlds greatest nations yep , best korea should protest . 
  you will have to conquer us and rule this shithole . 
  yep , thanks . 
  it depends in the municipal level is usual .

  like , i get the 2011 elections were shitty , they were shitty in general . 
  but after that of just basically giving up because it was impossible to work with a single government in the middle of a crisis hardly seems like `` trying everything '' . 
  constitutional changes require a long view and patience . 
  if you , who i personally believe are a very sensible person , thinks this shit , then i ca n't begin to fathom what the average spaniard thinks . 
  i was talking about unionism vs. independentism . 
  and a unilateral independence bid , even through a non-recognized referendum is a pretty big shock to the other side , too . 
  the truth is no referendum is fair unless both sides feels it represents them and that 's just not going to happen with the current trajectory . 
  as it is , it would just end up as another 9-n ( the case in court right now for outsiders ) since one side does n't even agree about it 's legality . 
  there is a fair amount of difference in supporting the idea of a referendum and supporting any specific one that is organized . 
  because why would they protest what they already have ? 
  i do n't see many protests in croatia or slovenia about freedom from yugoslavia either . 
   realistically , how likely is such a scenario if catalonia were to secede ? 
  it would never get to that point . 
  why use tanks when you can use banks ? 
  you just make a point that any company must pay their full share of taxes to the spanish government for their operations in catalonia while the catalans would attempt to tax instead . 
  the government suspends their autonomy and they get funding completely cutoff while forcing companies to essentially choose between operating between catalonia or the rest of spain . 
  it would absolutely cripple the economy there . 
  the biggest issue i see is formal control of the border . 
  i do think spain would possibly send guardia civil to man the airports and sea ports to handle processing as catalonia would not be accepted as a schengen member . 
  but in short ... no way in hell does this escalate to violence in the streets , at least not from madrid . 
  worth remembering a large portion of catalans themselves are fiercely unionist , too . 
  it 's often presented as hugely one-sided but the truth is it 's about even right now . 
  i still do n't agree with the quotas . 
  yeah , some farmers will go bankrupt , but that does n't mean the governments should actively protect them if others are able to do it better . 
  they can move to other products , use the land that was for grazing for crops , change profession ( a huge percentage of farmers are part time commercial drivers already ) , etc. ... 
  the governments should n't promote agricultural inefficiency . 
  that said , when they leave the common market , that 's not the eu 's problem anymore . 
  that was the best government we 've had in awhile . 
  ( only half joking ), 
  also , it 's uk registered so it could be they just kind of stopped where convenient from not knowing . 
  yeah , trump feeds his support based on divide and conquer and the other side buys into it fully . 
  i 'm mostly worried about how an attack in the us would fuck things up right now . 
  trump will crack down and there will be a very widespread belief on the left that it was a false flag attack which will just make them even easier to paint as crazy people . 
  i defend spain a lot , but one thing to keep in mind is that the crisis has been really hard on the youth ( you know , the people you will see on reddit ) . 
  the average person over 50 has had their income go up since 2008 but the average person under 35 is something like 20 % poorer . 
  it should get better as unemployment goes down , but we 're still a couple of years away from that but it will definitely influence how people see the country . 
  you 're crazy if you think people thought that hard about him . 
  i am from a red state in the us . 
  people elected him because of his bravado and i 'm still not convinced he 's any less popular than the day he was elected by those same people . 
  i am very , very scared for what will happen to my homeland as the polarization gets even worse . 
  i 'm wondering how much is related to what 's going on in the us and people might have a second thought of `` oh shit , what if we win ?! '', 
  as many people may have just wanted the vote as a protest . 
   i would say it 's definitely creating a division , but her economic policies were widely considered good here in northern europe well yes because they benefit you guys at the expense of the southern europe countries . 
  particularly the currency ( and since denmark is in erm ii , they get help , too ) in that exporting countries benefit from the crises in the south because it keep the euro cheap so it makes exports artificially attractive . 
  something really has to be done about the difference in trade deficits across the monetary union to help even it out . 
  i think calling it `` fiscal transfers '' would never work , but a vastly increased eu budget with investments disproportionately in the countries that need it . 
  ( be it military , scientific research , even more infrastructure , etc. . . ) and honestly , for the single labor market to work , something has to be done with combining pension systems . 
  it 's an absolute nightmare right now . 
  yeah , and those purchases are accounted for in ppp . 
  the vast majority of most people 's spending is housing and food which does indeed vary massively . 
  is n't the biggest issue airline leasing ? 
  like there are a lot of irish registered planes in the world that count toward ireland 's gdp , even if they are not physically in ireland . 
  yes , enough to seriously mess with the stats . 
  not saying ireland is n't rich , but i agree beating norway and switzerland is a stretch . 
  god , it reminds me of when i went to cambodia and how there 's just not very many middle aged people and in particular middle aged men . 
  that 's what really gave me an idea of how bad their genocide was . 
  en eeuu , una botella normal de 500 ml cuesta como $ 10 . 
  well , it is a problem of being both artificially cheap and having no inflation . 
  it needs to be cheaper , and there also needs to be some way to deal with fiscal transfers to handle the internal trade surpluses and benefits . 
  they are n't mutually exclusive problems . 
  basically that germany benefits disproportionately from monetary union without fiscal union . 
  i actually agree with that . 
  spanish food is a lot more about natural flavors . 
  garlic and paprika are the main spices used . 
  i introduced my wife to spicy food and now she can handle more than anyone i know . 
  we were getting the extra spicy stuff for locals in thailand . 
  i could n't take it but she was a champ . 
  the only spaniard i know that loves spicy food that much . 
  it 's absolutely what we want , but right now the entire structure of how telephony works in each country is national . 
  integrating that would be a massive project , though theoretically feasible . 
  i 'd be ok with eu pitching in some money to make it happen to the point where dialing a country code is just like dialing the codes for the different regions locally . 
  yeah , i 'd really like a single , integrated telco market . 
  but i realize what a huge task that would be . 
  it would also open up a huge amount of competition . 
  vodafone here also offers usa included in it , which is nice . 
  there was an article that came out yesterday about trump about modern autocracies and how they are n't like what we imagine from the past . 
   the benefit of controlling a modern state is less the power to persecute the innocent , more the power to protect the guilty . 
  but that would have required trichet to see beyond ideology . 
  we ca n't ask so much , can we . 
  to add to this , in spain , vocational courses can count as well as university studies . 
  so our rate is probably higher than anyone comparable . 
  seriously , the fed had 8 years of qe on an incredible scale and the ecb just started and germany had to be dragged into it kicking and screaming . 
  thank god there 's an italian in charge of the money . 
  would n't the fact that the ez is finally pursuing some sort of aggressive monetary policy help ? 
  i mean , the fed and boe were on massive qe kicks for almost a decade , we just got started a couple years ago . 
  australia is actually really easy to immigrate to for skilled labor . 
  it 's unskilled that has a really hard time . 
  they are actually the only other country that has an unlimited number of skilled visas that can be used for immigration intent in the usa , too . 
  the us has a special category for them but australia does n't have one for the americans because their general skilled labor visa process also includes americans . 
  well , to start with placing a political operative on the national security council while removing the director of national intelligence and the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff ( the head military officer for those who do n't know ) declaring the media the opposition and giving white house press credentials to alex fucking jones . 
  and the travel ban invalidating existing visas is a big deal . 
  even permanent residents of the us are now unable to return to their homes until they get an additional screening process unless they are also uk/aus/can citizens . 
  now moving on to the much more opaque side of things . 
  the steele dossier mentioned that russia would give 19 % of rosneft which has conveniently just been sold . 
  the complete and total lack of any sense of trying to eliminate conflicts of interest in the executive with things like having ivanka on a call to pm abe of japan while she is working on a deal involving a significant stake of the japanese government . 
  or the whole not so blind trust fiasco in the first place . 
  democracy is about respect for the rules more than the outcomes and trump has no respect for those rules . 
  i mean , that 's an eu law thing . 
  all eu citizens have the right to vote in local elections . 
  i 'm not an eu citizen , though .

  people seem to think that because us does n't join this organization they will immediately start dumping nuclear waste into the ocean . 
  the problem is that the world still needs us leadership and the us is now showing itself to be an unreliable partner because why would you spend years negotiating a hard deal for the future if it can just get thrown away on a whim ? 
  the actual impact of this move is minimal , but the problem is it sets a very bad precedent since it 's nearly impossible to get so many countries to sign onto something and it 's only going to get more challenging from here . 
   i do n't know when i bought american products the last time ... posted on reddit , owned by cond\u00e9 nast . 
   when was the last time you read an online article from an american website ? 
  reddit itself is an american product . 
  that was true in the 90s but i 'd say it 's mostly all about the same these days . 
  also ... yes , some cars break and some do n't break even with minimal maintenance . 
  anecdotes are n't really useful for this . 
  would they play in the nfc very , very east ? 
  also , scheduling around the time changes would be a nightmare . 
  full disclosure : i 'd definitely travel there to watch when chicago played and having a team in europe would make it easier to follow the league in general as i try to but it 's hard with the time change . 
  he was an investment banker . 
  some of the older people in that world can get away with bad english , but any younger person in that world absolutely has to be able to speak english pretty well . 
  netherlands will soon be reclaiming all of doggerland . 
   yes republicans obstructed him mitch mcconnell literally filibustered his own bill because obama supported it . 
  that level of obstruction is something you just ca n't deal with . 
  like i said , only one uses the brand of aldi . 
  the other has a completely different brand and most people have no idea it 's owned by aldi, 
  it 's still aldi nord . 
  `` aldi '' is actually two companies that are n't related . 
  i 'm from chicago . 
  i know what cold is . 
  but 0 is n't weather to be sitting around outside either . 
  agreed , but it 's not sit out on terrace and enjoy type weather , either ( well , except for an apresski or something ), 
  bernie is n't much better for us-eu relations honestly . 
  also pretty cool on nato and a general trade protectionist and is for putting up rather than taking down trade barriers . 
  it 's not as vitriolic , but not too much of an improvement imo . 
  actually both aldis are there . 
  aldi s\u00fcd uses the aldi brand and aldi nord is remarkably successful using the trader joe 's brand . 
  absolutely agree . 
  but i think i smoked a whole pack in the bar the night it went into effect here . 
  now i wonder how i used to smoke at all . 
  but yeah , i was surprised at how much better it was as a smoker . 
   there are also cigarette vending machines everywhere in germany , which is , quite frankly , demented . 
  in spain they need to manually enable the machine . 
  so you walk in and basically say `` hey i 'd like to buy some tobacco '' and they turn it on . 
  in theory they should check your id if you look young . 
  it 's not really done in practice , but it 's possible to have machines and able to enforce age restrictions . 
  you have no idea what you 're talking about . 
  i live in madrid and it 's not unusual for it to be zero outside in winter . 
  the whole country is n't mallorca or costa del sol you know ? 
  you ca n't dump in a single market . 
  that 's the whole point of a single market . 
  within 6 months you 'll wonder why you did n't do it sooner . 
  same thing happened here in 2011, 
  corporation taxes are still terrible . 
  income , capital gains , consumption an various pigovain taxes work far better . 
  ideally a progressive consumption tax ( i.e. 
  you subtract your starting assets and earnings from your ending assets and tax that amount ) could be implemented , but we 're still awhile from that being feasible on an administrative level . 
  `` hold my sovereignty , i 'm going in ! '', 
  but seriously ... this is good . 
  no idea , i had just heard a lot of stories of military families that came back with german families . 
  no idea of how prominent it actually was . 
  of course quite a few also ended up staying there , too . 
   but us soldiers stationed in germany do n't get resident status in germany . 
  they have a nato sofa status . 
  i thought there was quite a lot of marriages with locals . 
  i 'm wondering how many are children born in germany to us military parents . 
  those points are n't exclusive in any way and actually complement quite well . 
  i do n't understand it . 
  i really do n't . 
  he was a national joke for almost 30 years and then ... bam , somehow taken seriously . 
  i left in 2010 and i lived in a rural state that voted for obama and now they gave us his vice president . 
  ( hell , i even voted republican for my state governor before him ) i do n't recognize my home anymore . 
  probably the biggest foreign policy goal of the ussr and then russia for the last 70 years has been to sever the us-germany alliance . 
  thank fuck for macron who might make it so it 's feasible for the eu to stand on its own , but without that , russia would be able to absolute dominate european politics . 
  while bay area is hyper expensive , london or paris ai n't exactly cheap . 
   silicone valley is n't that just los angeles ? 
  it 's like how people always seemed surprised to learn that it snows a fuck ton in turkey . 
  * that 's the joke *, 
  would russia be willing to make that bet , too is the question ? 
  france is more than capable of handling it themselves ( france and uk are the most capable military forces in europe by a lot ) and putin wanted trump because he 's unpredictable , destabilizing and generally detrimental to us power , not because he 's an ally to russia . 
  well a situation like that would really paint everyone else into a corner because putin would need predictability to know what to do and now , thanks partly to his own actions , does n't have it . 
  basically his master plan also needs europe to be unable to step up for itself but if germany and france are able to give a strong , unified response , putin may have realized his gamble failed immensely by moving us western leadership to european western leadership . 
  france is hardly known for military intervention in its sphere of influence , after all . 
  nobody knows yet . 
  i do n't know that i 'd bet on it since european companies probably do have a slight airbus bias . 
  also , it 's rumoured that the 737-10 might be announced at the paris air show . 
  we 'll find out a lot of what 's going to happen in the industry after that event in june . 
  i thought it was the fokker 100 . 
  regardless , the point stands and / r/aviation is leaking, 
  and we have yet to see what afklm will decide on for the 737 replacement . 
  they may want to go for common types between af and klm and af is already buying 320neos, 
  portugal seems to have the same general attitude about it as spain , which is . 
  yes , race is real . 
  no , we do n't give a fuck . 
  fwiw , portugal seems to have colonized the parts of africa with absolutely gorgeous people . 
  italians are no longer allowed to use tomatoes , that 's appropriating aztec culture . 
  it just seems insane to me that they are promoting no racial mixing in the name of racial justice . 
  i left the us in 2010 and it 's so weird now . 
  like i have a deep cultural connection to the place , but increasingly it feels like a connection to a place that no longer exists . 
  i go back and obviously do n't have an accent , but feel like a complete foreigner now . 
  just out of curiosity , how does it look like he 's doing for the legislatives ? 
  i was in toulouse this weekend and barely saw any em posters . 
  ( i have no idea where geographic strengths are in france so i 'm assuming that 's part of it ), 
  ahh ... figures i 'd just read the comment , i figured it was the in english section . 
  you seriously do n't see anything about trump being weird for going for melania or that he 's a dirty old man ? 
  the whole melania needs help schtick only works because he 's clearly the more powerful member of the relationship but yeah ... there 's lots of that going around , too . 
   even a medical part come on el pa\u00eds , you 're supposed to be good at english !,

  they are purposedly confederalist , and favor a referendum . 
  but if anything , they might be considered more unionist than anything , as most pro independence members left it and joined the pro independence coalition .

  if you are talking about the ** catalan ** results , 21.30 good results , 22.00 really good one , about 23.00 or midnight , final results , just awaiting the post votes . 
  where does in that article mention catalan culture or language ? 
  you are talking about the spanish republic , are n't you ? 
  also , in what part of spain 's constitution is there any mention to catalan culture and language ? 
  you know this is about languages , do n't you ? 
  i think lithuanian is the most conservative indo-european languages , innit ? 
  about age , all non invented languages have the same age .

  au does not make o in occitan . 
  the difference would be the u is more like \u00fc . 
  are you talking about contamination , water misuse , having less food , antibiotic resistence ... ?

    the president will still be artur mas  when have i said anything about who will win ?? 
  so , mas will be the next president without winning ? 
  great !, 
  so , against treaties , no 2 years negotiation ? 
  again , where does it say so ? 
  not your interpretation . 
  where is this stated ? 
  and this in a country of 7,5 m people . 
  almost a 20 % of total population . 
  mostly , identitarian reasons , according to the polls . 
  unlike those who favor independence ( more wealth , better administration , better treatment ... ), 
  why do you lie ? 
  pro independence people do n't call nazis anyone . 
  on the other hand ... well , one week ago former spanish president compared the situation with that of italy and germany on the 30s ... 
  the idea is to never leave the eu . 
  to negotiate remaining in it during the process of becaming independent . 
  also , if spain would block it , they 'd block the main ( more than 50 % ) way to export to and import from the eu . 
  also , i guess they 'd like to have spanish debt split with catalonia . 
  otherwise , they are headed to bankrupcy . 
  barcelona police have never been much progressive nor pro independence , and the mayor and her party did n't attend or support the demonstration . 
  what party ???????????????? 
  and by a lot of foreigners i guess you mean maybe a couple thousands . 
  unless you mean immigrants who we consider catalans . 
  just curiosity , in what treaty or law or whatever it 's explained how a part of the eu gets out immediately ? 
  i thought the only written rules were that they should be 2 years of negotiation before getting out !, 
  so you know junts pel s\u00ed will have an absolute majority ? 
  do you also know the lottery numbers ? 
  and what 's your suggestion ? 
  going back to russia or to sweden ? 
  catalan . 
  unless you say englandian , germanian , francian , spainian ... 
  big catalan newspaper ? 
  :-) hey , there are four national catalan newspapers . 
  this is the third or the fourth ... 
  the organizers did n't give a number . 
  jordi s\u00e0nchez just said that , according to some media , there were 2m people . 
  i 'd say it comes from latin * refugium , * shelter . 
  but you distinguish between two names of dutch . 
  you ask for flemish ? 
  why not for spanish ( or castilian , whichever is not on the map ) ? 
  syria is just having `` a shitty economy '' ? 
  wow , a swiss who knows about catalan poetry !, 
  great !, 
  cool !, 
  celtiberians means celts living in iberan peninsula . 
  we were real iberians . 
  i 'm the only one who had never heard about this disease ? 
  hey , you were celtic . 
  real iberians is us !, 
  ( and the georgians , of course ), 
  nothing . 
  i guess most of catalans do n't even know georgia even exists . 
  i think the thing was not being arian , and in fact they are not indoeuropean . 
  a lot more tourists ... compared to the local population ? 
  i really doubt it . 
  and their tourists are not mostly german or austrian looking for cheap beer . 
   per capita czechs drink the most beer in the world you know that `` per capita '' is all the beer sold divide by czech population , do n't you ? 
  a lots of beers are sold to tourists on vacations , who drink a lot . 
  you can see boars in ** barcelona , ** on some streets near the hills . 
  not really so scared .

  an id is usually required in order to access the plane for security reasons , but no check is done if travelling by road . 
  the uk and ireland decided to stay outside the schengen area and therefore anyone coming from those areas is required to show a passport to enter the area ( although it is usually not enforced ) . 
  they are still free to move and reside inside the area . 
  summing everything up : - free movement of goods : european union customs union - free movement of people : for european citizens - no checks in the border : schengen area gibraltar is not part of the schengen area or the eucu and therefore there 's no free movement of goods between spain and gibraltar and there are border controls . 
  gibraltar citizens are also citizens of the uk and therefore are free to move and reside in spain , they still may have to show their passport when they cross the border . 
  this kind of bonds can be resold ( in a secondary market ) and brokers can act as intermediaries so knowing who bought what becomes hard , if not impossible to know . 
  in case you are wondering if ireland should stop paying those who invested in them , the problem that arises is who will buy more debt from ireland . 
  actually that would help , however it will also mean the end of the tax heaven that gibraltar is , screwing the economy there . 
  gibraltar is not part of the schengen area , nor the european union customs union , as a result , there is not free movement of goods or people ( the custom is like that with a country not in the eu ) . 
  actually gibraltar is not part of the customs union ( eucu ) and therefore it 's not part of the common market . 
  eucu is about goods and the schengen area about people ( passports ) . 
  this means that even if the citizens of gibraltar are british ( and therefore , eu citizens ) goods imported from gibraltar are considered as if they were imported from another country , not in the eu ( for example , usa , argentina or australia ) . 
  only greece has n't paid completely their debt . 
  ireland , spain and italy have paid to those that invested in them . 
  and anyone can invest in government bonds , the minimum is usually around 1k or 2k $ . 
  it is usually really hard to know who has invested in these bonds ; for example , if you have a pension fund , the money you put in there is invested in hundreds of different things , as a result perhaps bank `` x '' has a lot of money on greek bonds , but only as an intermediary of a pension fund . 
  the judge will like the opinion/information of the politician many times , for example : someone denounces that x politician hit him . 
  the judge asks the politician what he has to say about it . 
  repeat 1000 times and the politician will end up quitting . 
  ( and if it is an important politician , more than 1000 people will hate him ) . 
  in any case immunity usually is not complete , there 's usually a special court that can investigate politicians ( only for certain crimes ) , the congress or assembly he belongs to can decide to withdrawn that immunity or once the politician stops having immunity he is judged for everything . 
  the purpose of immunity is n't only to allow hate speech in the parliament but to make sure that meps are n't excessively prosecuted : just imagine some politician is not liked and starts to receive hundreds , if not thousands of stupid judiciary demands from angry citizens or other parties ; he will have to quit as he wo n't have time to defend himself from everything and ... goodbye democracy . 
  the tordesillas traty did n't say anything about slavery directly , however , as spain could n't conquest anything in africa ( not even fish to the south of the canary islands ) getting slaves there was not allowed . 
  the new laws are what forbid to slave the american natives . 
  i 'm sorry but no : spain had forbidden to capture africans slaves as a result of the `` tordesillas treaty '' ( spain and portugal divided for themselves the world : america for spain and africa for portugal ) . 
  also , thanks to bartolom\u00e9 de las casas ( and the passing of the `` new laws '' , http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/new_laws ) slavery of western indiands was forbidden , although many land owners did n't respect it . 
  nevertheless , selling slaves was n't that common and many spanish ended up in jail because of that , including the first viceroy of america and columbus . 
  or you know , they just copied another map . 
  well , you can choose three different dates : -1291 : the first confederation was made , it was basically an alliance of small cities that were part of the holy roman empire ( they had to pay money , send soldiers if requested ... ) . 
  they were no more independent than hamburg , or k\u00f6ln . 
  -1648 , peace of westfalia ( end of the 30 years war ) : after this treaty switzerland became `` de iure '' independent . 
  nevertheless it would hardly be considered as a single country , it was a cluster of small independent countries ( cantons ) with an alliance between them . 
  -1815 , congress of viena ( end of the napoleonic wars ) : switzerland became a completely independent state , was given valais , neuchatel and geneva and its neutrality was recognised . 
  after 20 or 30 years a civil war happened and in 1848 switzerland became a truly federal state . 
  personally , i would use 1848 as the true starting point of switzerland . 
  before that , only small states , that would n't be included in the map existed . 
  technically they belonged to the holy roman empire which was dissolved during the napoleonic wars . 
  switzerland would be formed as a completely independent state after kicking out the french ... 
  and also you had free transport ( it 's going to be now a reduction ) . 
  a chinook would hardly fight , it 's a transport helicopter . 
  i was n't negative at all , my point the waste would happen if we do n't get the olympics . 
  well , to be fair this is the third time in a row madrid tries , as a result , a good bunch of stuff is already built . 
  technically 112 is the carabinieri , and if the emergency is not for them you will be redirected to another number . 
  ( still , you lose time ) . 
  to be fair , `` la mula de parenzo '' makes sense in spanish ( it would have been something as `` la ragazza di parenzo '' in italian . 
  the only problem is that `` mula '' in spanish is the breed between a horse and a donkey ... 
  please no . 
  r/europe is a nice place to be , but reddit in general is n't exactly the best sample for a poll , more likely , the complete opposite . 
  this leads to misleading polls . 
  misleading polls are crap that should have never been produced . 
  and all that is much harder than being forced to go to the army ... 
  not necessarily , broader gauges allow bigger trains and with a bigger train you can get a bigger motor . 
  ( specially for steam locomotives ) . 
  well , that 's with high speed trains , currently we have this available : http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/file:spain_high_speed_rail.svg, 
  i am not , there are usually two things to consider for the track gauge : geography and politics . 
  the track gauge defines the radius of the curves , if you have broader curves you will get problems if your country has too many mountains . 
  and politics : having the same gauge as your neighbour has one disadvantage : you do n't need conversion systems/change train and one advantage : you neighbour would have a worse time invading you and he ca n't use his trains for his supply lines he either has to build some or capture yours . 
  check the neighbour of india !, 
  ( if you check the map for enemies you should remember the political differences at the time for example spain had been recently invaded by france ), 
  i do n't think renfe is guilty for that : between madrid and vilar formoso ( first city in portugal ) the trip takes 3 hours and 45 minutes , from madrid to lisbon it takes 11 hours ... 
  there are 6 stations is spain and 11 in portugal ... 
  i would say it 's your fault . 
  i do n't think it 's healthy for a democracy : you are giving military training to everyone , including people you do n't want to know how to shoot . 
  and on the other hand you are giving military training to everybody , including groups you might not want to . 
  nah , it 's mostly the vowels , we only have 5 sounds , you had like 14 sounds or something like that . 
  spain is indeed quite barren , most the population lives in the coast or in madrid and a few more cities in the centre . 
  in fact spain is one of the most countries with a higher average height in europe , after switzerland and austria ( and smaller states like andorra ) . 
  this plus a lack of water in the centre pushed people to the coastline and the rivers ( you can see a few lines in the map ) . 
  madrid is an exception as it is the capital . 
  through normandy ... ( happened twice ), 
  to be fair , they 're as much far away as you can , it is the antipode of spain : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:antipodes_laea.png, 
  plus madrid . 
  the rule of thumb is that if you have two separate leagues you must have your own national team , if you play in the same league , you must have only one `` national '' team . 
  exceptions exist ( specially with very small countries ) . 
  lucky you , we had 166.386 to 1 , that more or less became 100 to 1 . 
  specially for small things ( for bigger things , the ratio 1000 to 6 was more common ) . 
  if you consider spanish history , the legend and what the maps seems to represent , it may not be that inaccurate : if you translate the title of the map ( it 's spanish ) it means `` map of the genetic structure in europe '' , you can try to decipher what it means xd . 
  the legend for red includes both celtic and basque . 
  basque were ( and are ) quite abundant in spain and took a major role in the reconquista ; hell , even the new dutch queen has a basque surname . 
  if you check celtic history you will realize that they come from centre europe and that the considered celtic nations are actually the places where they survived as a culture , not necessarily the places where they were more influential through history , you can check wikipedia page about this , specially the map : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/celts, 
  i would say people from paraguay are quite aware of the economic situation in spain , as it affects them quite heavily , even more considering what this article is about . 
  no , i do n't know how to cook mexican food . 
  that goes for you ` murica . 
  which will have to be paid by someone if the bank has n't money to give it to you . 
  if you can either give 20k per account to the bank and save it ( so you do n't have to pay 100k per account ) would you do it ? 
  ( 20k is a random number ), 
  i 've studied both and while dutch may have more exceptions it 's more simple : only two genres and no declinations make things easy . 
  to be fair , dutch grammar is something like simplified german grammar ... 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/italian_east_africa it did n't last much though . 
  so , i guess that then we know more about you colonies than yourself ... interesting . 
  ( spain was forced to sell many of it 's islands in the pacific to germany by usa after the spanish-american war , not so many years later usa was fighting against to japan to retake them ) . 
  and the british have contests in chagos , bases in cyprus , gibraltar , north ireland , the falkland islands , antartica ( several countries , yep you still claim that one ) and rockall . 
  i see a pattern here ... 
  sorry , they do n't use the metric system . 
  seriously malta ? 
  the last one are indeed almost desert , but older ones are not , others are in the middle ; for example you have sese\u00f1a which is desert , aranjuez not so far away worked well enough ( with it 's own casino and hospital ) and many close to madrid worked quite well . 
  it 's hard to answer your second question , many years ago it would be hard to find a builder ( constructora ) with houses to sell one the houses were finished , but you could find a flat on them easily as some people would just speculate with them . 
  after 2007/2008 builders would start to have many houses after finishing them , however builders usually worked on credit so all the houses would be embargoed and the bank will be the one losing money . 
  ( and spanish bank crisis started then ), 
  a nice one is related with spanish surnames : as you may know we have two surnames , our first one is our dad 's first surname ( as is usual in the rest of europe ) but our second surname is the first of our mother ( take into account that women do n't change names when married ) .

  firstly , indians are considered `` model immigrants '' , like the chinese . 
  africans less so . 
  that said , we 're not talking about a minority group here co-existing along the majority with similar fertility rates after a couple of generations . 
  the population of europe is * aging * . 
  once a population goes below replacement level , it will continue to contract indefinitely unless there 's a boon or the factors that led to this low fertility in the first place are addressed . 
  so we 're not talking about the people that will live alongside us as a minority of the population , but those that will * replace * us when we 're gone . 
  -- it seems to me that people like you fundamentally fail to understand how population growth works . 
  many in this thread already have made posts that makes it obvious they seem to be believe that after our population starts to collapse , it will magically stabilise at some desirable , environmentally conscious and `` sustainable level . 
  ** that 's not how it works **, 
  that 's sarcasm right ? 
   [ ... ] if anything it will be enhanced by the diversity . 
  can you give some specific examples about how we 'd be enhanced by this diversity ? 
  something beyond the usual asinine `` oh their food is nice '' would be good . 
  if you 're referring to cultures from other developed countries , yes it might have a positive effect even as it lowers social cohesion , but they wo n't be the ones from where our immigrants come from . 
  * diverse * implies existence along a spectrum -- unless you believe all cultures are of equal value -- then for optimum maximum diversity you need to integrate cultures from every region of that spectrum . 
  that 's a fucking dumb idea . 
  as a gay dude , i for one would prefer not to be `` enhanced '' by the diversity of being stoned to death or thrown off a building . 
  just saying . 
  if only it were that simple . 
  [ some of the most traditional countries around the world have fertility rates indistinguishable from socially progressive european countries ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2e/countriesbyfertilityrate.svg/2000px-countriesbyfertilityrate.svg.png ) this shift is due to something a lot more fundamental than that . 
   it is good news in fact . 
  it means that the average life length is increasing and that the size of the population is at a stable , sustainable level . 
  that is ** not ** what it means . 
  life expectancy is rising very , very slowly and by 2060 will only be around 82 in europe , if you project the same current trends that this graph is based on . 
  these numbers are almost completely due to blow-replacement level fertility . 
  post-communist collapse . 
  all former soviet countries saw a massive depopulation that is still ongoing after the fall of the soviet union -- also , eastern european immigration to the west . 
  what 's the point if european civilisation collapses ? 
  personally i 'd rather see the whole continent turn into a wasteland than north africa . 
  they 're going to other parts of europe anyway so the map remains the same . 
  casuals . 
  i 'd tell them to get on my level but in this instance i think i 'll pass . 
  only for two generations ; after that the fertility rates are indistinguishable . 
   the world is overpopulated . 
  overpopulation is a function of how many people a certain region can support at a certain standard of living ; by this metric the developed world is the least overpopulated part of earth . 
  in the same sense , we 've yet to hit peaks of any significant resource . 
  scarcity is dropping across the entire world , be it water , energy or food . 
   better to have a country of 10 million living in absolute comfort enjoying the benefits of ever increasing automation , than a country of 100 million where most are poor , a detriment to the environment and a threat to human survival . 
  that 's a false dichotomy . 
  you can have a large , productive population that , thanks to technology , is not dependeant upon of the environment regardless of its state . 
  what we 're seeing here is the opposite of that . 
  the fertility rate required for population replacement is 2.1 , anything under that and you 'll see contraction and demographic collapse . 
  and once this collapse begins , it 's not going to stop at whatever amount of people hippies believe that `` mother earth '' can carry unless the underlying reasons why people are not reproducing are addressed . 
  it 's a perfect example of a tragedy of the commons . 
  -- at the end of his book * apex * , the transhumanist novelist ramez naam wrote :  * `` this is about people power , dr , '' she said . 
  `` you told me once this century 's most vital raw material is the human mind , did you not ? '' *  * lakshmi dabir nodded again . 
  *  * `` good , '' ayesha dani said . 
  `` because we seem to have more of those than anyone . 
  now go unlock them . 
  this will be the indian century . '' * this is not meant to be a cautionary tale about how the poor , foreign masses in developing countries are going to make us irrelevant . 
  that process is already in motion , we could n't stop it if we wanted to and i for one do n't believe we should ; it 's a good thing . 
  what it should bring to mind is the fact that the human brain is a * resource * and having more of them is a boon , even if the byproduct of producing the handful one minds that will drive technological progress is hundreds of thousands of less productive ones . 
  a large population is a boon in the long term , not only for any specific country but for humanity as a whole . 
  we 're looking at a whole continent withering and dying . 
  i was n't being completely serious with that comment ; just throwing his scorn back in his face . 
  so britain will go the other way ? 
  reduce tensions by slowly adapting all muslim customs . 
  that sounds ideal . 
  except you know , for the whole gay rights thing that i just mentioned . 
   i would say that currently there is not so much of a differance between them if anything the republicans focus more on principles and the democrats focus on buying votes with free stuff taken from any productive person they can find . 
  you sound like a fucking ideologue . 
  i went as far as to concede that * both * parties have rights issues that they are concerned about . 
  but that 's not good enough for you ; you need good guys and bad guys . 
  well , how 's this for you ? 
  as a gay man , republicans have been the enemies of my kind since the inception of the gay rights movement and even * now * they 're still grumbling and trying to roll back progress . 
  [ the two things are nothing alike . 
  what you 're citing happened a very long time ago , and a lot changed after that . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/southern_strategy )  however , there actually are people who will try to tell you that the democrats are the ones that defend civil liberties . 
  as a gay man , i 'd say so . 
  to be fair , both parties care about * certain * kinds of civil liberties . 
  the republicans are all over religious rights , gun rights , etc. 
   misogynists that word does n't have the power it used to . 
  you 're not going to cow or shame anyone by invoking it . 
  due to people like you it 's lost all meaning . 
  [ here 's a breakdown of the numbers presented by the cdc here , without the fudging that the cdc attempts to do to hide male victims . 
  ] ( http://i.imgur.com/shfmnpb.jpg ) [ and here 's a good article highlighting that dishonesty ] ( http://time.com/3393442/cdc-rape-numbers/ )  he fact that you do n't make a thread about violence against men , but instead ( ab ) use it to answer to concerns about sexual violence against women , puts you in company with the very worst kind of people . 
  and saying this makes you a dishonest cunt . 
  did you somehow miss the post i was replying to ? 
    if they did , then it is right to frame this as an issue about refugees . 
  if they did n't , ** then it is an issue of women 's safety from men in society . 
  ** women in germany society have nothing to more to fear from men in this context than men do from women -- or at least they did n't before the whole migrant crisis . 
  to paint the issue of sexual assault as the bitch quoted did , and this poster reinforced , is fucking disgusting . 
  the * overwhelming * majority of people in the middle east are muslims , specially so in north africa -- about 91 % . 
  those numbers would narrow even further if you weigh them against the ethnic distribution that currently lives in germany . 
  in the context of this discussion , thehandsominator 's quote above can not be anything but ridiculous . 
  how about we call her a bigoted , sexist cunt and leave it at that ? 
  [ here you go .

  ** no , rape it 's not in fact an issue of `` women 's safety from men in society '' . 
  not in the us and i strongly doubt the numbers are any different in germany . 
  unlike what you 've been lied to and manipulated into believing by gender opportunists , rape is not a gendered problem in the west . 
  how about you stop being a sexist , bigoted twat ? 
  a straw man is the refutation of an argument that 's not actually proposed by one 's opponent . 
  i 'm not refuting your argument here , i 'm refuting your premise by flipping around the evidence you 've brought to the discussion . 
   statistics what is that even supposed to mean ? 
  do we suddenly live in a different universe where statistics somehow show that women are responsible for any of the things i mentioned ? 
  i 've got some statistics for you , pulled directly from the [ u.s. bureau of labor statistics ] ( http://www.bls.gov/ ) * 99 % of coal miners are men * 100 % of oil drill workers are men * 99 % of garbage collectors are men * 88 % of patrol police officers are men * 100 % of power line installers are men * 95.5 % of firefighters are men * 92 % of construction workers are men the list goes on , and it 's a very long one and it would look not much different if i started to add in scientific and technological research and discoveries . 
  according to you , it 's only fair if we * generalise * men by these numbers . 
  they sure as hell are a lot more definite than the graph you linked . 
  if we 're going to generalise men for the bad they do , in contrast to women , why not do the opposite ?

  [ poinsettias ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/poinsettia ) are also quite widespread . 
  * the holidays start properly on christmas eve ( 24th ) . 
  it 's a day to have dinner with family , mostly . 
  there is usually too much food , including king prawns , some baked fish or meat , and of course a bunch of traditional sweets like [ turr\u00f3n ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/turr%c3%b3n ) , [ polvorones ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polvor%c3%b3n ) or marzipan . 
  there 's usually too much drinking as well , and after the dinner people fight , play cards , sing carols , or just end up sleeping on the sofa while the tv plays some very tacky gala . 
  the truly religious ones go to the [ misa de gallo ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/misa_de_gallo ) , and young people go out and party . 
  * christmas day ( 25th ) is not very special . 
  traditionally it was not the day for presents , but cultural pressure has made it more common `` for santa claus to pay a visit '' and leave some toys for the kids . 
  some families have a special lunch and others just eat the dinner 's leftovers , which can be quite a lot . 
  it 's a lazy day in general . 
  * the 28th of december is [ the innocents ' day ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/massacre_of_the_innocents#feast_day ) , which is our version of april fools . 
  once upon a time even the public tv channels made pranks , but now it 's mostly internet jokes . 
  * on new year 's eve ( 31st ) some families also gather to have a dinner , which tends to be a bit fancy but not as much as christmas eve 's , and others just dine out . 
  our two biggest traditions are [ the twelve grapes ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/twelve_grapes ) ( which i find incredibly stupid and has made a lot of people choke ) , as well as the special tv show played by the public channel featuring whichever comedian is popular at the time . 
  those who can will go out after dinner , and it 's sort of a tradition to try and stay up all night . 
  those who do manage to stay up will go eat churros at 8am . 
  * on the 1st of january those who do n't work just get up for one ( or both ) of two things : the vienna philharmonic new year 's concert , and the new year sky jumps . 
  the rest of the day is spent nursing your hangover and wondering why the hell you insist on staying up all night . 
  * the holidays end ( finally ) on the [ three kings day ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/epiphany_\\ ( holiday \\ ) #spain _ and_latin_america ) ( january the 6th ) . 
  there are parades the afternoon before , featuring the three kings , their pages , some other bible-related stuff , sometimes santa claus as well , and maybe leftover floats from that year 's carnival if your town is not very wealthy . 
  the most famous parade is of course the one in madrid , which is broadcasted on public tv . 
  then the kids are told to go to bed because the kings are coming to bring them presents while they sleep , not before leaving some sweets for them as well as some water ( or carrots , or whatever leftover produce the family has ) for the camels . 
  and in the morning of the 6th the presents are opened . 
  sense does n't matter . 
  in this country we just sign up to whatever we see in american movies that sounds like a good excuse to party and/or sell stuff . 
  way too many `` real madrid ! '', 
  i mean , i 'm happy we are known for something other than flamenco and paella , but since i do n't like football the conversation always ends quite awkwardly . 
  in the south ( at least ) there 's ordinary barbershops , hipster barbershops , north-african barbershops , a ton of women 's hair salons , and now there 's dog hairdressers as well . 
  it 's getting ridiculous , but the manufacturers of hair products and tools must be making a killing . 
  screw all that . 
  i get my hair cut with a trimmer by my wife . 
  please , as if legality has ever stopped someone in this country from doing or hiring work under the table . 
  not in spain . 
  in fact , it 's not very common for high school students to work . 
  mostly those whose families have a small business or a farm so they have to help out . 
  summer jobs are a bit more common , but the law is quite restrictive with minors so it 's usually something casual and paid under the table . 
  spain is not the one to speak , we also had protests very recently because some people do n't accept the outcome of the last election . 
  circumstances are different ( a party ousted their own leader so they could allow their main rival to govern , which was kinda shady , while trump won quite cleanly ) , but the spirit is the same . 
  i for one understand the need of the people to express their disappointment , but i also think protests like this are useless . 
  i do n't think anybody here plays actual christmas music until well past december 1 . 
  however , i already saw some stores stocking [ turr\u00f3n ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/turr%c3%b3n ) ( the traditional christmas sweet ) before halloween . 
  and i 'm pretty sure other stores are already selling christmas decorations ( we do n't have any celebration in between , like thanksgiving ) . 
  yes , but spanish and spaniard do not mean the same , so we have to be careful how they are used . 
  in spain : 1 . 
  the adjective is * spanish * . 
  the language is called * spanish * if you are using it in a neutral context , or if you are listing languages from different countries ( french , italian , english , ... ) . 
  however , it is called * castilian * in academia or if you are listing our national languages ( castilian , galician , basque , catalan , ... ) . 
  someone from spain is a * spanish * man/woman/person . 
  however , since that term is also used for people from latin-america countries we sometimes use the ethnic term * spaniard * instead to avoid confusions . 
  we were n't involved ( not officially , some spaniards did fight in it ) , so we do n't care much about it . 
  i mean , it 's taught in schools and all that , but it barely had any impact culturally . 
  things were not going well for the country at that time , so we had other things to worry about . 
  and this is the tl ; dr. 
  if i had included figures , the role of the minor parties , the concerns about unfair seat distribution , the catalonia issue , the ripples of the 15m movement , the press ' dirty war , and all the other stuff that has influenced the outcome , i would still be writing :d, 
  it 's quite simple , really . 
  for a long time we had a virtual 2-party system . 
  psoe , the centre-left party , and pp , the centre-right party , alternated in power . 
  but in the past elections two new parties threw their hats in the ring : the leftist podemos and the liberal ciudadanos . 
  a lot of people were tired of the old parties ( for many reasons , including corruption scandals and the financial crisis ) , so they voted for the new ones . 
  that meant votes were more spread , which resulted in that not only no single party could form a government on their own , but the two more logical coalitions ( psoe-podemos , and pp-ciudadanos ) did n't have enough seats either . 
  some other combinations were attempted , but clashing egos and irreconcilable policies did n't allow it . 
  so we voted again , but the result was basically the same . 
  after coalitions attempts failed once more because of the aforementioned egos and policies , there was increasing pressure on psoe to abstain and allow pp ( which had more votes than the others ) to form a minority govern . 
  otherwise we would have to vote a third time , and nobody wanted that . 
  the problem is that the psoe leader refused to give the government to their arch-nemesis . 
  so recently there was what a lot of people have called a ` coup ' , and that leader was ousted . 
  the new leadership agreed to abstain , and the pp candidate has finally become president . 
  now they have to rule with the only support of ciudadanos , and they will have to reach agreements with the rest of groups for almost everything . 
  i think this is the first time it happens , and there are betting pools on how long it will last ( i say no further than next summer ) . 
  serving alcohol to minors is a pretty serious offence in spain , so proper drinking places will card you if you look a bit too young . 
  also , after the [ botell\u00f3n ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/botell%c3%b3n ) became widespread the government increased fines for stores , so they have also become quite cautious . 
  that is not to say everybody respects it , though ; there 's always a hole-in-the-wall bar or a seedy store that does n't care . 
  no , but kinda . 
  if you are an immigrant that has achieved that legal status instead of someone born in a spanish family that can be traced back to medieval times we wo n't consider you less of a citizen . 
  we are all equal in the law and our hatred to politicians . 
  nonetheless , for most people you will still be an immigrant . 
  spain is an ethnically homogeneous country for the most part , and the big influx of migrants ( from latin-america mostly ) has been fairly recent , so they have not yet been assimilated in the same way as , say , indians are in the uk . 
  we are starting to have 2nd and 3rd generation migrants that were born in the country and are full-right spanish , so it will be interesting to see how things change . 
  i beg to disagree . 
  at any given point at least half the songs in the top charts are in english . 
  and i know you were probably joking but reggaeton is not nearly as dominant . 
  i 'd even say other latin music genres are more popular . 
  but i guess it depends on which stations you listen to , by choice or because that 's what your neighbours do all day long . 
  yes , i 'm talking about you , 3b and 4b . 
  buy you some headphones , for crying out loud . 
  in my patch of mediterranean coast the weather is usually mild ( with temps no lower than 5\u00ba and no higher than 30\u00ba ) , but for the past two or three years summers have been too hot for too long ( we 're almost in november and people are still going to the beach ) , and it has barely rained . 
  not really . 
  we do have people who move to the countryside and try to be self-sufficient , but normally it 's because they are fed up with city life . 
  i think they do n't last long anyway . 
  it did exist in spain at some point but they stopped selling it long before you were born . 
  definitely not in the south . 
  i 'm pretty sure that only happens there , maybe in asturias as well . 
  we probably are , but it all actually comes down to practical reasons . 
  since this is a pretty warm country , and not a particular rich one , we had to find ways to preserve some things as long as possible . 
  hence why we drink uht milk and [ torrefacto ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/torrefacto ) coffee ; we pickle olives , garlics , and [ aubergines ] ( https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/berenjena_de_almagro ) ; and we cure ham and sausages . 
  i miss british milk so freaking much . 
  even if i had to make extra trips to the supermarket to buy half a pint because we had run out of it ( usually on sundays , why do you always run out of milk on sundays ? 
  prostitution is not illegal in spain * per se * ( there are some exceptions , though ) but it 's not legal either ( as in regulated ) . 
  it 's one of those things we consider it 's wrong but it 's so widespread and hard to deal with we choose to ignore it . 
  even during the conservative , catholic dictatorship it was consented in some places because local authorities did not dare take the weekly relief away from people who would probably became a nuisance otherwise .

to be fair , i would n't fly the eu flag in my house ( or even the spanish flag , that 's actually badly seen here ) , but it look very nice alongside the spanish flag and the regional flag  i like the design a lot . 
  simple and effective . 
  i actually live in one of the overseas territories ( canary islands ) . 
  it 's pretty much considered an integral part of spain by everyone , and there are no relevant independence movements . 
  there is a nationalist party , which rules the region , and has 1 seat in the congress , but they are not independentists . 
  in fact , if you want to get technical , 6 out of the 7 canary islands were conquered before granada was conquered , and the muslims finally expelled ( 1492 ) , so yeah , not exactly a colony there . 
  there 's only so many jobs tourism can provide , even with all time high tourist arrivals . 
  in fact other than tourism ( and mostly low end jobs there ) , there are very few other jobs . 
  actually i quite like the taxi service in my city ( las palmas de gran canaria ) . 
  i do n't use it unless i do n't have another choice ( i much prefer riding the bus for 30 min +30 min walk , paying 1,4 $ ; to getting there in 15 min but paying 8 $ ) , but whenever i 've used it , the service is great , and very cheap :d an 8 km ride costs around 9 $ . 
  though actually our taxi fares are the lowest in the entire country , so yeah : /,

  if that 's a normal estonian cartoon , i ca n't imagine how the weird ones are . 
  anyways , a normal spanish ( half british ) cartoon looks probably like this ( from our 24/7 public tv channel , i 'd say this is the most famous spanish cartoon . 
  english dub available ) : http://www.rtve.es/infantil/serie/pocoyo/video/regalo/1568859/, 
  yeah , i know . 
  i added them because they belong to the eea or something like that though, 
  really , though several eu countries could federalize themselves , the entire eu definitely ca n't . 
  some unions i could see happening though ( even if it 's incredibly unlikely for that to happen ) are : - netherlands + dutch speaking part of belgium - france + french speaking part of belgium + luxenbourg ? 
  - spain + portugal - uk+i reland - germany + austria + lichtenstein - sweden + finland + denmark + norway + iceland ? 
  of course , all of this unions have their share of problems , but they are probably easier than the entire eu federalizing . 
  when did the us go to war with us on 1939 ? 
  that definitely did n't happen . 
  ( though seeing the end result was franco 's dictatorship , i wish they had ) as for 1898 , it was definitely not for fixing our '' '' '' `` democracy '' '' '' '' at the time . 
  it was to get a friendly cuba ( and philippines and puerto rico while they were at it ) . 
  iirc they first offered a buying option , like with florida , but in the end that was rejected and they went to war ( a short war though . 
  this image sums it up perfectly . 
  the us went to war with modern steel ships . 
  spain with wood ships ), 
  that 's probably a better way of deciding our president probably : /, 
  i 'm from spain . 
  we did a referendum to see if we stayed or not ( probably because we never made one to enter in the first place i guess ) : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/spanish_nato_membership_referendum,_1986 also , 4 regions voted for leave ( canary islands , catalonia , basque country and navarre ) , but the overall result was remain . 
  and also , i 'm sort of surprised that the eu would n't do something . 
  then again , i doubt ireland or austria will be attacked any time soon . 
  actually , i 'd like my country to leave nato : / ( though increase military spending slightly to compensate ) . 
  we actually had a referendum in the 80s about the matter , resolved like 57-43 or so for remain ( oddly enough , only one party campaigned for remain , but apparently it was absolutely huge then ) . 
  actually , does the eu work as sort of a nato-ish thing ? 
  i mean , if say , austria or ireland ( 2 eu but non nato countries ) were attacked , would the eu defend them ? 
  considering cuba used to be spanish until right before the xxth century , it would n't surprise me at all . 
  though i also live in the canary islands . 
  things might be different in the mainland . 
  here in spain from what i 've seen the number 1 strong ( not counting beer/wine ) alcoholic beberage is rum , not vodka . 
  vodka is probably a close second though . 
  apparently they have 1 seat in the uk parliament . 
  had they gotten none , the uk would be yellow . 
  i pretty much went to wikipedia and searched for parties labeled as far-right populist or similar descriptions : / not the most accurate method by any means , but better than nothing i guess, 
  i suck at reddit xd i thought i could put it below the photo as text . 
  then uploaded and realized i could n't edit the submission . 
  as a desperate measure i 've uploaded it as a comment, 
  if it 's not clear : green = no far right parties with representation in their national parliament yellow = no far right parties with representation in their national parliament , but they have parties with representation in regional parliaments or the eu parliament red = they have far right parties with representation in their national parliament white = not in the eu, 
  i doubt that happens here in spain though unless you attend private schools . 
  public ones usually use french . 
  actually i went ( and still go lol . 
  i finish this year with the pau ) to a private school and we were required to bring uniforms only the days we had sport . 
  the private school i attended from years infantil 2 a\u00f1os ( kindergarten 2 years ) to 1\u00ba eso ( year 7 ) did require us to take uniforms at all times . 
  2 sets in fact . 
  a better looking but more uncomfortable one for days we did n't have pe and a more comfortable one for days we had pe . 
  actually the 81 ' coup resembled more the 23 ' primo de rivera coup than the 36 ' civil war one . 
  the only unknown thing was whether the king would support it or not . 
  had the king supported it , then it would have succeeded , and no war would have broken out ( that was what they expected ) . 
  since the king did n't support it , most of the army did n't too , so it failed . 
  rocinante is probably just as neutral though, 
  a spanish community named forocoches tried to call it blas de lezo , but they banned the name . 
  i 'm guessing it 's self made trolling , since they follow on twitter the guy who uploaded the name, 
  trafalgar or nelson would be more fitting though, 
  well , he was indeed a great sailor and made great contributions to the british undersea research :p, 
  rocinante is definitely not a gunship though . 
  it 's don quixote 's horse . 
  that was the last attempt , but people were tired already , so it never succeeded :(, 
  what about rocinante though ? 
  what they do n't mention is that it was overtaken by other names twice . 
  once by blas de lezo , another by rocinante ( it might have been overtaken , or almost , by donald trump , i lost track after that ) both names were disqualified for trolling , yet boaty mcboatface was n't ?? 
  why are we allies with saudi arabia anyways ? 
  they are a fucking terrible country that exports terrorism and treats their citizens horribly . 
  i know they have oil and stuff , but ca n't we buy that from someone else ? 
  venezuela is a better country ( never thoughy i 'd say that ) and they have more oil reserves for example . 
   north america is a melting pot because it is constantly changing it 's national identity preferably for the better . 
  til mexicans and other latin americans do n't follow the us ' ( and canada 's ) laws and do terrorist attacks there . 
  then we should kick put non citizens and put those who somehow got citizenship in jail . 
  well , before they are illegal here are some rajoy memes [ i have more friends in jail than snoop dogg and 50 cent combined ] ( http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-cc0we23bwqs/vg6yeftfvpi/aaaaaaaac0g/x0zbuqgd_w8/s1600/memes%2brajoy%2b1.jpg ) [ intelligence is following me , but i 'm faster ] ( http://www.elcorreo.com/multimedia/201512/06/media/memes-rajoy/meme6.jpg ) [ rajoy starring as cover for mafia iii ] ( http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-qyph7xmyrf8/vg6yfn7cezi/aaaaaaaac0o/lojeedgdgum/s1600/memes%2brajoy%2b2.jpg ) [ the curtains open , rajoy appears , the curtains are cut down ] ( http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-kvop50uuzvg/vg6ynuat3ti/aaaaaaaac1y/6_dwdbsrjjo/s1600/memes%2brajoy%2b8.jpg ) in reference to his government cuts, 
  also former leader of the current prime minister 's party xd, 
  realistically , an eu army would be for defense only, 
  yes , but it would require a huge amount of luck from one of the parties . 
  the closest we 've come was this year , when podemos was scheduled by polls to be pretty safely ahead of the psoe in the popular vote in the 2016 election , but in amount of seats they were roughly tied . 
  of course in the end the polls were terribly wrong and the psoe ended up ahead of podemos in both the popular vote and seats, 
  iirc the polls us national actually predicted the result ok ( like 1 or 2 points off ) clinton did win the popular vote after all, 
  oh , sure , we might need to wait for like 2019 or so , but an eu army now is a matter of when , not if, 
  if le pen loses in france in 2017 an eu army is now likely . 
  if trump withdraws the us from nato as well , an eu army is basically a certainty, 
  yeah !, 
  make eu elections great again !, 
  to be fair , this last season has been ridiculous the writers must be running out of ideas, 
  rip in peace : united states of america ( 1776-2016 ) maybe they should have found better candidates, 
  well , we lacked a government for a year and the country did n't implode ( the economy actually inproved ! ), 
  seeing how some us politicians love small government , trying no-government should n't hurt xd, 
  ca n't the spd run the same candidate multiple times ? 
  all but one ( zapatero , and he got very lucky ) of our pms has lost at least 2 elections for example . 
  suarez lost in 1982 , 1986 and 1989 ( he was n't really trying to win though ) , gonzalez on 1977 and 1979 ( and 1996 , when he was ousted ) , aznar on 1989 and 1993 , and rajoy in 2004 and 2008,

  it may be sad for you , but it is still the reason why you are not getting a referendum . 
  feel free to cross the border towards france whenever you want . 
  but watchout , they are stricter than spain about catalonia . 
   hmm ... maybe if there was a way to know which side has more support ... 
  i do n't know , something like a piece of paper where catalans would write their opinion , you could count those papers later and according to the results let them do what the majority of catalans want !, 
  https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/64j41i/independent_scotland_would_be_most_welcome_to_be/dg44dff/ you really have to renew your repertory . 
  why would you ask me in the first place if you had your answer already prepared ? 
  this is the reason why i refuse to debate with people with biased mindset, 
  the main one : half of the catalan people feel both catalan and spanish . 
  you can not go and tell them `` you see , you were born in spain , just like your parents and grandparents . 
  i am sorry if you feel spanish , but you are not that anymore . 
  now you live in a new country , whether you like it or no '' some catalan people want to have their own identity ? 
  fine for me , just like they are doing now . 
  they should protect their language and their traditions . 
  some catalan people want to secede 3.5 million people from their country ? 
  wo n't happen, 
  our constitution does n't allow an autonomous community to secede from spain for many reasons that i would explain to you if your opinion was n't totally biased according to your other comments . 
  anyway it is not hard to understand . 
  it is hard only if you do n't want to . 
  [ los serrano ] ( https://imagizer.prod.carbyne.ps.ooyala.com/1800x635/https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/ingest-mediaset-production.carbyne.ps.ooyala.com/o2nc5y74bsbb_masthead-losserrano.jpg ) if i am not mistaken it is known in europe , please confirm ? 
  at least someone once told me that in finland it was pretty famous . 
  also it has the best ending in the history of the series . 
  our connection with scotland is the same that with the irish : the historical common hate towards england, 
  what triggers me is that aparently one gibraltarian smokes 4.700 packs of cigarettes per year . 
  somehow also there is this other little thing . 
  there are 3 times more companies than people . 
   why do you care ? 
  or are you afraid you wo n't be able to keep milking them if they go ? 
  here we go , at this point i realised that it is retarded to talk to you since your opinion is totally biased . 
  catalonia contributes 3 times less than madrid , is the region of spain with the highest debt , a debt that only spain buys , cause it has the same rating that bangladesh 's . 
  actually , even the balearic islands contribute way more than catalonia if you keep in mind that the industry in spain is located mostly in madrid and barcelona , you can see that no one is milking catalonia , actually it is the opposite , they are contributing way less than they should . 
  https://gyazo.com/568f00a9a5f03b6202b28e066a40a051 they ask spain for money literally every 2 years ( but i guess you do n't know those things ) , and you still have the balls to talk about milking ? 
  well , you just do n't understand anything , so i will try to explain to you , even knowing that you do n't give a fuck about facts since you will not change your biased opinion , but luckily someone else will understand the problem here and wo n't talk from the ignorance just like you are doing . 
  but see , the people from scotland , are scottish , and not english . 
  the people from catalonia are catalans , and ( according to the last poll ) the majority consider themselves as spanish . 
  let 's say that scotland and catalonia get their independence together . 
  from one day to another , the scottish people wo n't be part of the uk anymore ( there is not even a term for people from the uk , since british is the people from britain , not uk as a country ) . 
  but they will be always scottish , no one will ever change that . 
  from one day to another , half of catalonia will stop being spanish . 
  people who is catalan and feel spanish , will lose what they are . 
  one day they are living in their country , and another day they are suddenly in a new one . 
  that ca n't happen with scotland , cause the scottish people will live in a country called scotland , without regarding if they are part of the uk or not . 
  are you able to understand now the difference between actually being a country , and an historical region ? 
  if catalonia was a country , no one would care if they got an independence or not , since 100 % of the catalan people would be catalan and not spanish at all . 
  i ( and all the spanish people ) could n't care less about what the independentists do in their life . 
  they could just leave the country if they want , no one is stopping them . 
  but do n't be mistaken , we will fight for that spanish and catalan people that want to remain in our ( their ) country . 
   i do n't have to do that in order to tell you that catalunyans have their own language and history and all the requirements to be called a nation thus have the right to self determination . 
  what do you mean by history ? 
  even the smallest region in the world has its own history . 
  that does n't make you a nation and for sure that does n't give you the right to self determination , as the united nations already stated . 
  and it is `` catalonia '' and `` catalans '' . 
  your efforts trying to say it in catalan when talking in english , tell me that your opinion is widely biased . 
  plus it is a bit awkward aswell as i said , if your argument is that catalonia is a nation , please provide the nations that compose spain in order to take you seriously . 
  i am not asking for much , just to show us that you really know what you are talking about . 
  btw , inform yourself before talking , you need to meet some criteria to have the right of self determination backed by the international law . 
  http://arengel.edublogs.org/2013/10/12/catalonia-and-the-right-of-self-determination/ and to back my argument , here you have a source of ** ban ki-moon , secretary-general of the un ** , saying that ** catalonia it is not one of the countries with the right to self-determination ** http://internacional.elpais.com/internacional/2015/10/30/actualidad/1446231111_709046.html when you talk about breaking a country , i expect you to talk far from the ignorance in order to take you seriously . 
  then spain is a country of nations right ? 
  everyone can name the nations that compose the uk . 
  can you name then what nations compose spain ? 
  i 'll be waiting, 
  if the vast majority of the parliament wants to change it , they can do so without a referendum . 
  but keep downvoting the things that you do n't like even when they are true , that 's so mature, 
  but for that you would need the approval of the majority of the country . 
  so it seems kinda impossible , at least in the next 20 years . 
   of nations exactly , such as scotland, 
  no national constitution in europe allows the secession of an autonomous region , so i do n't think that 's possible at all . 
  scotland is the only one possible , but it is not a regional autonomy but a country, 
  no idea what you are talking about, 
  the 2 meninas on the right side of the infanta were dwarves . 
  people with disabilities were often used as buffoons . 
  economically better than i expected . 
  socially meh, 
  yeah , he is from argentina so i guess he has about less than 10 % of native american heritage and 90 % european he fails to understand that the ones who colonised the native americans were his own acenstors , not mine that never left spain . 
  you hate a country for what it did 500 years ago ? 
  the problem is only yours , not ours . 
  you can keep crying and shitposting about spain all you want . 
  here no one cares about that stupid hate that some southamericans have for spain , since we all know is their way to feel better about themselves . 
  to blame other people is always easier than to assume your own mistakes . 
  you are hating other people for your own problems , exactly the same behaviour that those racist bigots that insulted you have towards immigrants . 
  if you hate other people irrationally , you should n't cry when other people do the same to you . 
  spain may have many problems , but it is one of the most open-minded countries in europe talking about immigration and homosexuality acceptance specially . 
  in my entire life , i 've never heard anyone calling `` sudaca '' to another person in his face . 
  if you had a bad experience here i am sorry for you , but it is not normal . 
  if southamericans were treated badly in spain , we would n't be full of them . 
  edit : you seem to have an irrational hate towards spain https://www.reddit.com/r/askreddit/comments/634vuq/comment/dfrdvsd that explains a lot, 
  i watch it and enjoy it , but i do n't take it seriously the singers are worse every year , but the shows and the special effects make it a bit better , so i guess it is still watchable if they only sent the best singers of every country 's got talent ... 
  europeans are the most open-minded people in the whole world . 
  i do n't know where u are from or what ur cultural background is , but you will have fewer problems in europe ( if any ) than anywhere else . 
  i am curious now about what ur cultural background can be to be afraid of coming to europe, 
  in our case , we had some rough times during the 2nd spanish republic . 
  some fanatics are going to deny it , but the truth is ( and i am not blaming the 2nd republic whatsoever ) that this country was a total mess back in that time . 
  the population was totally divided and the hate towards other people for thinking different was extremely high and rising . 
  the justice was non-existent , and due to all that , some people started killing each other for thinking different , and sometimes they did n't even need a good reason ( my grandgrandfather got killed for going to work during a strike ) . 
  most of the time those murderers were n't punished . 
  then , following those killings , the mess , and the hate , the army tried to take the control claiming that they had to fix the country , and the republicans defended themselves claiming that they were the democratic elected government . 
  all this ended up in a civil war . 
  the fascist side won , and that 's pretty much the reason . 
  since the population was very divided we ca n't really say that we turned fascist . 
  if the republicans had won , we would had turned communist instead .

  he could fail or have success , but i think that 's the most likely thing to occur based on the experience of similar politicians in the recent decades . 
  let me be skeptical . 
  macron was a hollande 's minister ( the most detested president in the french fifth republic ) , but the magic of marketing has achieved macron appears as if he was a politician who has stemmed from civil society for regenerating french politics and as if he was n't related to hollande 's government nor his policy . 
  too much optimism , in my opinion . 
  it 's useless to discuss ideas with someone who has renounced reason for a ideology that has written the most awful pages of the europe 's history : nationalism . 
  have a good day . 
  abstract concepts ( like ethnicity ) can have many meanings because there 's nothing such * ethnicity * in the material world . 
  ethnicity is a human construct . 
  i only say i do n't like your definition of ethnicity because for me ethnicity is another thing . 
  you do n't know me , nor my ideas . 
  and if some ideas coincide with * `` textbook '' college freshman * , it does n't mean i 'm wrong or right , but [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ad_hominem ) . 
  you believe citizenship = * ethcnicity * . 
  you have more in common with some political movements in the 30s than with a western european . 
  yes , that 's a reality in spain , above all in the south and in the mediterranean coast : there 're many unregistered jobs in spain ... and you can receive money from the state if the government does n't know you 're working ( * picaresca * ) ... 
  very sad . 
  i did n't deny ethnicity , i deny your definition of ethnicity . 
  that 's different . 
  moreover , i defend the concept of citizenship . 
  do n't discuss about me ( i 'm not the issue ) , nor despise my arguments , discuss my statements with arguments . 
  who knows ? 
  i can change my opinion if someone convince me through reason . 
  interesting and thanks for your response . 
  i met two estonian girls in an esramus + program , they spoke russian and they consider themselves estonian , but also russian . 
  they have both identities . 
  i will label it * estonian nationalist supremacism towards russians * . 
  thanks for the idea . 
  you 're very kind . 
  did all the russian estonians invade estonia ? 
  did all the russian estonians repress people ? 
  do all the russian estonians deny all crimes ? 
  do all the russian estonians make propaganda ? 
  do all the russian estonians criticize the country * for not liking this situation * ? 
  obviously , not because every person is different . 
  stop generalizing against a collective , please . 
  you 're offending me for thinking different from you . 
  that 's not fair . 
  * russians * who live in estonia deserve respect and i defend it , maybe i 'm wrong , but i believe in human rights and dislike all kinds of nationalism . 
  past is past . 
  estonian russians are not your enemies , but they 're your fellow citizens that have a different background from you . 
  always , respect . 
  if you have ill-will towards fellow citizens for something that happened in the past and it 's not the current * ethnic russians ' * fault in most cases , it 's an evidence that estonia can not into nordics . 
  have you thought that in non ex-communist countries those labels among people of a same nationality may soud racist ? 
  that 's what i say . 
  because in wetern europe , nationality only matters . 
  it does n't matter if your native language is esperanto at your home or your parents are from kiribati islands , you have blue hair and many tattoes and believe in jewish god . 
  those labels are very subjetive . 
  but if their nationality is estonian , they are estonian . 
  the rest is racism or ill-will for something that happened in the past . 
  if their nationality is estonian , they 're estonian . 
  in andalusia , there 's a long tradition among artists to use the mother 's surname : diego rodr\u00edguez de silva y ** vel\u00e1zquez ** luis de argote y ** g\u00f3ngora ** federico garc\u00eda ** lorca ** jos\u00e9 ** antonio ** dom\u00ednguez ** bandera ** moreover , the factor that the first surname could be very common as a user said before . 
  is it necessary to label people as * ethnic russian * ? 
  in many western european countries it can sound racist and from the 19th century . 
  they 're only labels of a political axis that is not enough to explain how complex political reality is in the xxi century , in my opinion . 
  not supporting macron \u2260 not being anti-fascist . 
  for example , i can not support macron , nor support le pen because my left-wing political ideas are incompatible with macron 's socio - ( neo ? 
  ) liberalism and the far-right . 
  anyway , fn is not a fascist party . 
  it 's a far-right party , but not fascist . 
  it 's a different phenomenon , imo . 
  we do n't live in the xx century anymore . 
  i think we should n't use labels from the past to refer to new phenomena , although it 's far-right . 
  how many times have catalan nationalists declared the independence in the last 100 years ? 
  i lost count . 
  this is a media subsidized by the catalan government ( while they do not pay pharmacies ... ) with the aim of making foreigners believe that the catalan * process of independence * is being successful ; but it 's quite the contrary if you read the spanish news ( not * ara * or * el punt avui * ) . 
  most times in history catalan nationalists have been disunited like now , although they say the opposite . 
  at least , cup is sincere . 
  the most likely scenario is we 'll have another election in catalonia ( and erc may win ) . 
  i do n't agree . 
  my country is in the top 10 by scientific publications input ( if i 'm not wrong ) , and ... well ... 
  i was thinking about the tradition of analytic philosophy . 
  about scientific publications , what 's more important quantity or quality ? 
  in my opinion , the second one ; that 's why , germany , south korea or japan are technological potencies and the usa and the u.k. are scientific potencies . 
  at least , most scientific publications i read are from anglo-saxon countries . 
  it 's not because of the language , in my opinion , but those countries have a long tradition in scientific research ; although it seems the opposite in that statics . 
  i think it 's intellectually imprudent to compare catalonia and kosovo . 
  they are different cases . 
  in spain , most people watch eurovision to laugh at countries ' songs and performances ( included spain ) and how bad spain scores ( we love hating ourselves ) . 
  in the gay community , it 's a very famous show ( not all gay people like it , obviously ) ; but , almost nobody takes it seriously and that 's why , spain usually sends bad songs . 
  in the gay community , it 's a very watched show . 
  my parents had two children ( my sister and me ) i hope i 'll be able to adopt a boy when i 'm more than 40 years old . 
  a sensible answer , hallelujah . 
  false.the mission of rae is prescriptive for speaking a * good spanish * . 
  the norm is built by the users of a language everyday in every act of speaking , not but any state organization . 
  the standard spanish is composed by all the varieties of spanish . 
  that 's why , the next dictionary will be edited by the asale , not only by the rae . 
  and that 's why , in spanish we lack of ortological rules and it 's right to say * jacinto * as [ xa\u0325\u02c8\u03b8in\u032ato ] or [ ha\u0325\u02c8s\u033bin\u032ato ] so what ? 
  it 's intelligible . 
  so what ? 
  it 's intelligible . 
  i am not a historian , but i have a friend whose father was born in caracas because his grandparents ( galician ) had emigrated there , but in the 80s , they came to barcelona because in venezuela there were a lot of problems , like a high murder rate , and spain had improved economically very much in the two last decades and it has always been a very safe country . 
  what 's the point ? 
  the problems of venezuela ( the situation in venezuela ) are long-standing . 
  it 's not because you 're * socialist * now . 
  e.g. , if you go to google data and look for the inflation rates under carlos ' andr\u00e9s p\u00e9rez and following presidents , you 'll find out that venezuela 's inflation rates [ were also very high ] ( https://www.google.com/publicdata/explore?ds=d5bncppjof8f9_#!ctype=l&amp;strail=false&amp;bcs=d&amp;nselm=h&amp;met_y=ny_gdp_defl_kd_zg&amp;fdim_y=inflation_type:1&amp;scale_y=lin&amp;ind_y=false&amp;rdim=country&amp;idim=country:ven&amp;ifdim=country&amp;hl=es&amp;dl=es&amp;ind=false ) , although it does n't reach to the current inflation rate , and venezuela was n't socialist . 
  i 'm going to say something that does n't sound very good for you : most latin american countries have been an economical , political and social disaster for most time since they became independent from spain , except * cono sur * countries ( argentina , chile and uruguay ) . 
  e.g. , your homicide rates , as other latin american countries ' homicide rates , has been [ very high ] ( http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/vc.ihr.psrc.p5?locations=ve-co-mx-es&amp;view=chart ) compared to a normal wester european country . 
  moreover , you can not compare an eastern european country with any latin american country . 
  they are different cultures , situations , histories ... 
  i have just explained it on another comment . 
  i know that .

  catalan nationalist do it for the money . 
  catalonia has a gargantuan debt [ link1 ] ( http://www.datosmacro.com/deuda/espana-comunidades-autonomas/cataluna ) and its leaders are always asking more money to rob . 
  it seems that ada colau victory means that barcelona citizens have awaken . 
  what about women breast size ? 
  i do n't get it , `` the devourer of towns '' ? 
  [ enjoy non-partisan vote counting ] ( https://dolcacatalunyadotcom.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/captura-de-pantalla-2014-11-11-a-las-0-01-20.png ) for those that do n't know , he is oriol junqueras , catalan nationalist politician counting votes of independent referendum . 
  seriously ? 
  i have n't had a nap in years . 
  in fact , i eat lunch at work and go back home in the afternoon so , i ca n't take a nap even if i wanted . 
  citation needed ... 
  yeah , a referendum voted by less than 30 % of the voters ... 
  i mean that the bigger parties are national , not regional . 
  the bigger regional parties are ciu and pnv , i think . 
  i think that one of the main differences between our system and yours is the presence of the same political parties in all our regions while you have the walloons and the flemish parties ( if i 'm not wrong , of course ) . 
  ah , yeah i do n't speak castillian spanish either , 
  flag mad ? 
  what ? 
  please take note that i 'm not talking about current english ( maybe british ) people or american . 
  the citizens of these countries have no relation with the xviii-xix century people apart from being their descendants . 
  it 's stupid to ask for reparations to people that take no part in some old events . 
  take a look to [ autonomous communities of spain ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/autonomous_communities_of_spain ), 
  comparing with what the english and their colonist , no , we did n't exterminate them . 
  in fact , there were several important figures that fight for their rights like [ bartolom\u00e9 de las casas ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bartolom%c3%a9_de_las_casas ), 
  we ( spaniards ) ... - we do n't take siestas . 
  - we are not always partying . 
  - we are not a conservative country . 
  - we are not racists . 
  we are bitter about ourselves and has no problem calling a black man `` black '' ( negro in spanish ) . 
  - spain is hot but also has mountainous and cold zones . 
  - we do n't worry about gibraltar , we only worry about its money-laundering issues and our territorial waters . 
  - you can be spaniard and also basque , catalan or whatever . 
  there are many ways of being a spaniard . 
  - each region has as almost the same level of autonomy than a real country , including their own taxes , police , language laws , etc. 
  spain is the most decentralized country in the world . 
  - spanish inquisition did n't kill as near as many as it is believed . 
  it is product of the [ black legend ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/black_legend ) . 
  - xvi century spaniards did n't exterminate the south-american natives ( like the english or americans in north america ) , they mixed with them . 
  that 's why there is so many biracial people in south-america . 
  - bullfighting is an old tradition perpetuated by old people and our `` rednecks '' . 
  young educated people do n't like it . 
  - our country is in europe ( not in south america ) . 
  - we are a developed country . 
  yes , currently we are in a big recession but even now , we are a developed country . 
  it 's third position in votes says otherwise . 
  congratulations , ireland !, 
  yeah , i know the english passion for queueing :d, 
  not sure if serious or joking but there was a queue in the school i 've just voted . 
  hahahaha , excellent !, 
  c'mon please someone make a video of juncker \u00e0 la thug life :d, 
  so , why is cameron pushing for a referendum in the 2016 ? 
  i suppose that if only a minority of conservative voters have a pro-secession stance he wo n't dare to do that , is n't it ? 
  no , we are talking about the common mentality of `` i do n't like the eu '' that happens to be in the uk at the moment . 
  racism not so subtle ... 
  i did n't expect anything else from a truly uk citizen like you . 
  i suppose not all people voted conservative for the brexit , but , indeed it was one fundamental points in the last elections . 
  not all europeans want uk in the eu . 
  if its citizens do n't want to be europeans i respect their opinion . 
  if they wish to be independent , i prefer an independent uk set apart from the eu . 
  it is not a crime , but it is a fact . 
  if the majority of your citizens wants the brexit ( horrible name by the way ) , why not give it to them ? 
  in fact , i 'm in favor of controlling eu immigrants , [ included british national ones that enjoy benefits in france , spain and other eu countries ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/jan/19/-sp-thousands-britons-claim-benefits-eu ) . 
  when you have just chosen a conservative party that has pledged to make a referendum for the uk exit of the eu in 2016 ? 
  i do n't see any racism in my statement , only the truth . 
  most of your fellow citizens have voted for a secessionist party and in fact , this party has had a major victory in the polls . 
  being from the uk , i 'm not surprised by your opinion . 
  so , why do you it in your flair ? 
  and eu flag is a symbol of peace and unity ... 
  so i do n't see the issue here . 
  best answer ever :d, 
  it would be nice if this flags become used in real world , instead of national flag + europe flag . 
  why is ada a liar ? 
  current mayor , xavier trias has some issues everybody should know : * [ trillas spends half a million euros in official travels ] ( http://vozpopuli.com/actualidad/53217-el-alcalde-de-barcelona-acumula-gastos-en-viajes-oficiales-por-mas-de-medio-millon-de-euros ) , including a 11 days trip to miami , medell\u00edn , bogot\u00e1 and rio de janeiro . 
  * [ barcelona mayor spends 9 million euros ] ( http://vozpopuli.com/actualidad/60830-trias-se-gasta-9-millones-de-euros-en-publicitar-sus-obras-en-barcelona-antes-de-las-elecciones-de-mayo ) making propaganda . 
  it 's easy to spend money , when it is not your money ... 
  there is a wall in the alhambra built with muslim tombstones . 
  it was built by the christians when they took the city in 1492 , [ photos ] ( http://nuestragranada.blogspot.com.es/2010/02/el-muro-de-la-alhambra.html ) . 
  because they are not official languages of a nation of the eu . 
  they are official languages in a region of a country . 
  using regional languages in the european parlament would be a costly measure and would achieve nothing because all the residents in these regions can speak spanish . 
  in fact , i support the use of only one language in the eu governing bodies because the money spent in translations is atrocious [ 1 billion of eur in 2006 ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/cost-in-translation-eu-spends-83641bn-on-language-services-407991.html ) , because of the translations between 24 languages : http://www.pri.org/stories/2013-05-24/european-union-prepares-adopt-24th-official-language-costs-mount-calls-english . 
  he means that they are official in their respective regions , not in spain . 
  cyprus had stronger ( cultural and historical ) ties with europe ( greece ) than israel . 
  thus , above all , including israel in eu would be equivalent to hit a wasp nest . 
  no , they are not europeans . 
  even if they were , its government is helping isis and is progressively leaning to islamism so , hell no . 
  israel is not in europe , so no . 
  sorry for giving my opinion and asking for more information . . 
  i 'm not comparing the situation with anybody apart from luxembourg . 
  is the language topic a taboo in belgium ? 
  there are no efforts for finding a common tongue , even a foreign one ? 
  foreign trade is not an affair of the belgian government ? 
  so strange , i did n't know that . 
  will take a look to the wikipedia article , thanks !, 
  the `` fiscal deficit '' is not a thing , for example , madrid and balearic islands pay more than catalonia [ link ] ( http://www.expansion.com/2014/07/26/economia/1406386572.html ) . 
  i seriously think that all this stuff of `` fiscal deficit '' and comparing every time with the rest of spain is done with the intention of not talking about [ pujol corruption case ] ( http://www.economist.com/news/europe/21613309-jordi-pujols-confession-undermines-catalans-hopes-independence-scandal-catalonia ) . 
  i 'm not `` grasping for straws '' , in fact , it 's the same for me if you go away or stay with the rest of spain . 
  what i do n't like is calling people like me `` lazy '' and insulting spanish speakers because we live in other place than catalonia , or use spanish , english or whatever language we like . 
  yeah , take a look on how some independent catalan nationalists insult the rest of spain : * [ a catalana councilman asks for sponsoring extremaduran children ] ( http://elpais.com/elpais/2008/07/30/actualidad/1217405834_850215.html ) * [ laporta , former football club fcb and current leader of nationalist party solidaritat catalana per la independ\u00e8ncia , insulted 20 times extremaduran president ] ( http://www.elmundo.es/elmundo/2009/10/09/barcelona/1255068730.html ) * [ duran i lleida , catalan leader calls andalusian countrymen lazy and accuses them of being drinking in the bar because of agriculture subsidies ] ( http://www.laopiniondemalaga.es/andalucia/2011/10/09/nacionalismo-catalan-nuevo-andaluces/455734.html ) * [ a catalan nationalist insults andalusians calling them lazy because `` most andalusians work less than 4 hours a day '' ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25yqj8txr_e ) * [ nationalist party ciu makes propaganda calling the rest of spain subsidized regions on behalf of catalonia ] ( http://www.eldiario.es/catalunyaplural/ciu-espana-subsidiada-cataluna-productiva_0_171133066.html ) * [ montserrat candini , mayor of a town in barcelona province calls the parents that ask for shared spanish-catalan education with fascists and compares them with islamic salafists ] ( http://www.vozbcn.com/2011/09/14/85511/candini-insulta-padres-bilinguismo/ ) at least we know that only the radical nationalist catalans think that way . 
  i do n't like one country meddling with another country 's affairs . 
  i can understand that flemish government would want an independent economic mission to usa ( the same way quebec has one in london ) .

  definitely worth reading . 
  * ... he was prepared to do three things : issue euro-denominated ious ; apply a `` haircut '' to the bonds greek issued to the ecb in 2012 , reducing greece 's debt ; and seize control of the bank of greece from the ecb ... * * as the crowds were celebrating on sunday night in syntagma square , syriza 's six-strong inner cabinet held a critical vote . 
  by four votes to two , varoufakis failed to win support for his plan , and could n't convince tsipras . 
  he had wanted to enact his `` triptych '' of measures earlier in the week , when the ecb first forced greek banks to shut . 
  sunday night was his final attempt . 
  when he lost his departure was inevitable . 
  * * `` that very night the government decided that the will of the people , this resounding ` no ' , should not be what energised the energetic approach [ his plan ] . 
  instead it should lead to major concessions to the other side : the meeting of the council of political leaders , with our prime minister accepting the premise that whatever happens , whatever the other side does , we will never respond in any way that challenges them . 
  and essentially that means folding . 
  ... you cease to negotiate . 
   `` abstain or we will get the majority from podemos '' that 's political suicide , and podemos is sustaining several regional goverments : aragon , castilla-la mancha , extremadura , valencia , baleares ... 
  the easy route for psoe is psoe+p odemos . 
  ha ha !, 
  what a fool , in spain he would still be the leader of the party , eh ... ? 
  people in spain still talk with anger about things that happened during the civil war , which ended 75 years ago , so do n't hold your breath . 
  not sure why the fuss about this present . 
  liberation theology is essentially communist , and i 'm pretty sure that pope francis is familiar with the phenomenon . 
  there are some christian communists . 
  i have met several of them in spain , and there are far more common in latin america . 
  afaik , just some articles , like those referred to collective bargaining . 
   firing somebody in spain is incredibly costly to the point that many companies have to close if they do badly a year because they can not afford to let go of a small fraction of their employees . 
  that changed with the last laboral reform . 
  now they can do `` objective layoffs '' with just a prediction of losses . 
  previous one ( from zapatero ) required actual losses in the books for 3 quarters iirc ( anyway some companies just cooked them ) . 
  edit : iirc , companies now just need to forecast a loss of profit , not even real losses . 
  as long he does n't brag about having done with her anything more sexual than a kiss in the cheek , all will be fine . 
  on the contrary ... well , everybody will know he 's lying ;-), 
  it 's fine . 
  we knew it because your flair , which signals it pretty strongly . 
  i sincerely respect that , but sometimes you guys remind me about [ this monologue ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxdggcq5yg4&amp;t=5m36s ) . 
  can be move along until there is news in that front ? 
   what is wrong with construction ? 
  nothing , unless a housing bubble just popped ... 
  thank you !, 
  i appreciate your help . 
  do n't worry about the subjunctive . 
  basques historically have n't used it and they are fine . 
  just pretend to have learnt spanish from a basque gf :-), 
  which is sad , at so many levels ... btw , i think it was n't the constitutional court , but the supreme court of catalonia . 
  my subjective impression is that 's improving , but very , very slowly . 
  in my inner circle of acquaintances i do n't know anyone who is unemployed anymore , but they got temporal , low-paying jobs . 
   well , no shit , thanks to the laws brought by the government in the name of the holy austerity the corps got rid of everyone who actually was skilled and employed a bunch of overworked and underpayed noobs . 
  i 'm sure tha fits your experience , but i do n't know how generalizable it is . 
  what i have seen is a lot of companies doing regulated layoffs ( ere 's ) , and trying to fire the older workers , very expensive to layoff in normal circunstances , who also enjoy higher salaries and benefits . 
  the sad truth is that a lot of times that older workers were n't the most experienced and skilled , but old farts who were too comfortable in their positions . 
  some big companies and even the public administrations do n't hire interns anymore , who are demi-gods , while almost all the heavy duties are performed by `` consultants '' . 
  spanish labour market is badly broken . 
  edit : of course , also can be argued , and rightly so , that sometimes the older workers just had decent wages and benefits , and younger workers are overworked and almost unslaved . 
   most good runners i know are super skinny . 
  certainly not sprinters . 
  anyway , the point was that we can found physiological explanations about why males are better runners . 
   the reason they are better runners is because they are better runners ? 
  no that was the conclusion . 
  the explanation was the previous sentece . 
   i can make one up just like you did , it does n't mean it will be true . 
   examples : women are not as good as men at climbing the ladder , women are not as good as men at standing their ground , women are not as good as men at negotiating , women working less ( not just due to the child thing ) , women caring less about climbing the ladder , women choosing to be dependent ( e.g. 
  finding a provider rather than working hard for decades ) . 
  i did n't made up anything . 
  do i really need to point to scientifical articles which show why males are better at running ? 
  those you mention must be proved . 
   scandinavia also has few women studying stem , whereas iran has very many . 
    maybe scandinavia needs to introduce the gender politics of iran to solve this problem . 
  a war with irak ? 
   i do n't know . 
  there can be tons of reasons for it . 
  including sexism . 
  if sexism is the reason , that contradicts your premise ( equality of oportunity ) . 
   how do you explain that men are generally faster than women at 100-meter dash ? 
  the evil patriarchy ? 
  human males are bigger and stronger than females due to selective pressure . 
  also their body is biomechanically better adapted to running , since they do n't have to give birth . 
  they are naturally better runners . 
  do we have a similar explanation about why women do n't reach managerial positions ? 
  so , how do you explain the different outcome ? 
  so basically you sent him to bruxelles to get rid of him ... good move . 
  so we can deduce that their plan was always that : debt relief or grexit ? 
  or maybe they just went with the flow ? 
  not sure about that . 
  spain 's public opinion is openly anti-austerity and anti-banks ( whatever that means ) so it could be a good strategy . 
  or maybe they actually believe what they say ... 
  the result of the referendum got them off guard . 
  `` who would have think that ? '' were tsipras first words after the first results , an anonymous source reports , followed by `` yanis , you have prepared something , right ? 
  right ? ... 
  yaniiiiis , do n't run '' / s, 
   i 've worked on one product that does clever things that relies on being able to mitm such connections , i 've worked with people who have built systems specifically to perform these sorts of attacks for monitoring purposes , and i assure you that it can be done . 
  even squid can do that , and of course commercial systems ( palo alto , etc. . . ) , but those systems rely on a `` fake ca '' whose certificate is deployed in every device of the company , effectively breaking the ca trust system . 
  i do n't think that this would work . 
  it would be discovered sooner or later and the ca would be instantly bankrupt . 
  also , iirc root ca keys must reside in hardware devices , so you ca n't just copy the keys . 
  as i said in a [ recent comment ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3bqs65/david_cameron_is_going_to_try_and_ban_encryption/csozf0s ) , the only remotely sensible i could think on is a ban on perfect forward secrecy and/or plausible deniability software . 
  in that case , with a warrant you could decrypt intercepted communications or be sure that the key that a suspect is giving is really the true decryption key . 
   if you want to look at what real communism looks like , look up the town of marinaleda and , to a lesser extend , the mondragon corporation . 
  both spanish . 
  do you realize that marinaleda is tiny , and its budget is subsidized by other administrations by up to a 70 % ? 
  that before accounting services like healthcare and individual subsidies tied to the agriculture . 
  that model is not scalable . 
  at all . 
  the mondragon group its a cooperative company . 
  its owned by its workers but by no means is communist . 
  i have lost somewhere , sorry .

  do we want to set up mass surveillance systems so that the workers can [ spy on their spouses/lovers ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/loveint ) ? 
  it 's not worse than anything we 've seen before . 
  madrid and bali suffered greater death tolls , and spain has mostly not changed its stance about things ( it helps that we have two muslim-majority cities since the 14th century ) . 
  he came from corsica to undermine the french dominion over his motherland . 
  they 've had two decades at this point to adapt to the needs and wants of their customers . 
  however they still want to keep operating as though they were moving paper sheets around the world . 
  the publishing industry must not die , the current big figures certainly have to . 
  alas , the police has shown its limits . 
  they 've alienated the muslim populations , they 've asked to hack into phones , they 've shown their complete inability to cooperate with each other ...  deep rooted cultural change is what needs to happen to solve this issue and yes that generally comes from the citizenry . 
  it 's not something you can legislate . 
  no , but it 's something that can be imposed to you . 
  the secular regimes in syria and iraq were deposed by us-backed islamists . 
  the feudal regimes in saudi arabia , bahrein et al are allies of the usa . 
  turkey is still a nato member . 
  egypt and tunisia have also been shaken . 
  isis was funded with seed capital from the us as the current frontrunner for the presidency has admitted . 
  maybe instead of deep-rooted cultural change , what is needed is to stop bringing cultists into positions of power from which they can affect the culture of a country . 
   i do n't think i 'm the one in the minority . 
  i think the majority of people are concerned and taking this issue seriously , at least where i live . 
  terrorist cults are not new and they 've been crushed in the past with no need of vague `` calls to action '' . 
  if anything , you should be asking your government to pursue the avenue which pays off : following the money . 
  no , you can talk about it all you want . 
  being taken seriously is something else , though . 
  do you agree that you have to proactively police your fellow citizens ? 
  this is not a matter subject to any kind of democratic control . 
  muslims in european countries are being criminalised and all we get are terrorist alert changes , laws to allow even more intrusion into our daily lives and a big wall of silence . 
  how is discussing the threat consequential if we have no information , no means of opposition and no way to make the decision makers accountable ? 
   me personally ? 
  very little . 
  can you do something about the usa backing every single theocratic nutjob between the indic ocean and iran ? 
  turkey buys oil from isis and there are hundreds of rich saudi backers behind them . 
  if you can , please do something about it . 
  odds are that you ca n't . 
  `` the full cooperation of the muslim community '' is a way to shift the burden of policing onto the citizenry . 
  as long as the people who finance them are unchecked , we 're stuck with them . 
  if you go against those who fund the cult it vanishes , if you do n't it grows . 
  ask yourself who they are and who are they allied with . 
  unless they attend the occasional unemployment training course which everyone knows is bullshit so that they do n't lose the benefits , you mean . 
  you just got memed away . 
  the canaries have always had 20 % + unemployment in general , it 's just that during the real estate boom loads of young people stopped attending high school to earn money hand over fist on construction work . 
  once the market went bust they were out of a job and they 're not qualified to enter the already saturated job market . 
  you only need so many waiters , chambermaids and cashiers , which is the sort of job that one can see around . 
  loads of people are not even integrated in the market system , they just grown their own food and subsist that way . 
  the french high command 's insanity of keeping the flow of troops towards attacking hougoumont , a position which was easily defensible , while starving the more successful generals of much-needed men should not be understated either . 
  tourism is real . 
  its ability to generate sustainable development and links with other high-productivity industries is not . 
  the communities with a higher proportion of their gdp stemming from tourism are also the communities with the highest unemployment and lowest gpdpc . 
  you need to establish that there is a pattern first . 
  that requires for a pattern to exist in the first place : how do you establish a pattern for someone unemployed , or someone who does n't earn regular wages but does things here or there ( like a down-on-his-luck trucker ) ? 
  if you can predict someone 's activities reliably they were never a threat in the first place . 
  the argument is old as dirt . 
  there are no really available means to control my * relevant * activity . 
  the guy with the truck in nice was controlled , but you ca n't simply predict that he 'll enter a truck and drive it against a crowd . 
  no echelon or five eyes are going to stop that , because they do n't have the means . 
  treat me like an adult , and i 'll do the same for you . 
  sure they are . 
  i 'm sure you overexerted that software of yours by finding that out . 
  that dastardly hacker , 4chan , yes , i know the tale . 
  use your fucking software and tell me where i am and what am i doing right now . 
  while you 're at it , show me the recordings of my voice that are available . 
  i 'm one of the easiest people to track . 
  what am i doing right now ? 
  come on , use your software . 
  yes , with the idea that british voters did n't vote for making hungarian citizens ' lives in the uk harder . 
  it 's important to run the campaigns early in order to nip issues at the bud . 
  otherwise you find yourself in front of a legal text you ca n't alter much and you have to swallow the crap . 
  frankly i would n't mind . 
  especially since accessing the eec we could be operating as one country and no one would be the wiser . 
   strengthening local authorities [ that 's against the constitution ] ( https://www.thespainreport.com/articles/638-160216233313-spain-s-constitutional-court-suspends-catalan-decree-creating-regional-foreign-ministry ) . 
  the current autonomy statute is basically as much as they are going to get , and it also got fiercely contested by the pp back in the day . 
  [ except when they 're hungarian , apparently ] ( http://hungarytoday.hu/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/6sohrcpy6iwqcgg8s.jpeg ) . 
   how many countries have participated in creating safe zones in syria ? 
  sounds like a question , to which you answered in the negative . 
  the constant state of fear is fabricated , and explicitly plays into isis and the fn 's goals . 
  i live in spain , where eta killed more than 800 people during its whole run , and we still got to be a great touristic country which is enormously safe today . 
  since we have statistics 15 years ago , more women have died at the hands of their husbands / partners than during eta 's 40 year activity . 
  during our short lived real estate boom more construction workers died due to negligent behaviors from workers and businesses than eta killed . 
  the induction of the military in the basque country ( which was done during the francoist period of eta 's activity ) did n't help : it was proper policing , arresting the financial backers and getting international help . 
  i 'm not sure what 's that different with this terrorist cult that other approaches that do n't work should be pursued . 
  france is also really safe . 
  lack of safety is indeed something else , like getting your house pounded over and over again by fighter-bombers . 
  i 'd ask you that instead . 
  you 've seen what is happening in turkey , with the president willing to reinstate the death penalty and having arrested tens of thousands . 
  what is [ fundamentally different in the front national ] ( http://europe.newsweek.com/marine-le-pen-calls-bring-back-death-penalty-after-paris-shooting-297742 ) ? 
  with a sufficient majority every single legal definition can change . 
  everyone can be a traitor and every traitor can receive the death penalty . 
  that should be known , especially in * france * . 
  the sauds and the turks are much easier targets , and more relevant to this problem . 
  squeeze the sauds and the ruling turkish party and the `` nation '' and the `` economy '' crumble . 
  they 're laughing at the world at this point . 
  your daughter can also get killed in a massacre happening overseas , or in a much more probable car crash stemming from drunk driving . 
  fear to the abstract is learnt , and since you 're scared and unwilling to do anything about your fear , you 'll likely transmit her your feelings of fear and powerlessness , and then she will live in her own state of fear , where not even you will be able to reach her . 
  fear breeds lies . 
  and yes , if you have to ask me , bombing the civilians who remain in syria is not a good strategy . 
  you can get buried in articles which tell you the aftermath of `` mistaken '' plane or drone bombings , with a death toll that dwarfs all the strikes which have happened in europe combined . 
  they are a saudi satellite and it 's turkey , the oil companies buying cheap materials , and saudi millionaires who are bankrolling the whole thing . 
  if you want them to call that an economy and have them join the un though , that 's your opinion . 
  we already have enough cults in control of states as it is . 
   had authorities done their job they would have found that evidence of course , there are always ways to make people confess crimes , no matter whether they committed them or not . 
   he was just a kid whose file was shoved under the rug by bureaucrats .

  i mean , opposing the mou of the coalition you are a part of seems pretty damned close to that point already . 
  for people that are using it a lot , it is a pretty good idea to help keep it in tact . 
  i used to not use one , but the spine on mine is feeling pretty weak these days . 
  that money is due no matter what . 
  and it 's due in euros . 
  a new drachma will be vastly lower valued and make exchanging them for euros to pay it back even harder . 
  it is for some of us . 
  i 'm very happy that i 've only had to fly twice this month . 
  ( also i 'm not european , so i need my passport even for schengen flights ), 
  upyd basically have nothing anymore . 
  they used to be a way to be angry about bipartisanship without actually doing anything about it . 
  now that other parties are getting significant votes , people actually care about what rosa d\u00edaz thinks and she 's a terrible human being . 
  we use a fence , not a wall . 
  and there is a big difference in using the fortifications to keep people from entering uncontrolled than from keeping people from leaving . 
  you know it 's possible to honestly believe in fair markets as a tool to better society as a whole ? 
  pp is for business so long as it is an entrenched interest . 
  they are more concerned with the status quo and keeping asesores and gestores in business . 
  they are sectors that only exist to make money navigating the complicated bureaucratic system . 
  yeah , bigger companies might need something like that , but smaller ones should be able to handle it on their own . 
  i really think a vast simplifying of the way business works in spain would promote economic activity like nothing else . 
  the whole contrato \u00fanico thing is probably the single best idea for the spanish labor market in a long time . 
  stop trying to play traps with temporales and periodos de prueba . 
  basically by simplifying how business is done , you free up a lot of resources that are spent right now on staying on the good side of the state to actually work . 
  from my pov in the corporate world , yes . 
  less so to the catholic base , though . 
  they are definitely your type of party . 
  ( mine . 
  too ), 
  more or less . 
  they are born as a catalan party that is pro union with spain so there is some additional cultural baggage . 
  people in all of spain tend to stick to what they have . 
  that 's why we have so much bipartisanship . 
  it 's an objectively bad result for people looking to break the system . 
  they ca n't even force a coalition because they will be competing for favors for one party to abstain . 
  i know in spain there is no fixed amount , you just have to meet the economic contribution criteria . 
  i have the issue with my us bought 360 that i have to order games from us amazon or buy them when i visit due to the encoding . 
  transnistria is more useful being a destabilizing force in ~ ~ romania ~ ~ moldova . 
  it basically means moldova wo n't get into the eu while the problem is in place . 
  edit : lapse in geography . 
  it 's a small and unimportant bank . 
  i did n't even know it existed until this story broke and i live in madrid . 
  that may be what the demonstration are about . 
  but there are even posters in my local consulta saying to support the public system , do n't use a private doctor . 
  again , it 's not logical . 
  maybe it 's just my local one , but they absolutely hate the sanitas clinics and all of the like ones . 
  as was already mentioned , the freedom of movement gives you the right to live or work in another country . 
  schengen just means there is no physical border preventing you from going from one country to another ( there still are `` random '' checks ) . 
  an example is i am a non eu citizen residing in spain . 
  i have the right to live and work in spain but i do not have the right to go live and work in portugal , france ( or any other eu country for that matter ) despite the fact that there is no physical barrier . 
  free movement within the eu is for eu citizens only , residents do n't get that right . 
  that 's why i think this proposal could work , countries are allowed to set their own visa policies and the only thing the eu has said on the matter is that a residence card for any eu country has to be treated to mean visa free entry is allowed for visiting that country as a tourist . 
  ( it was actually a case against the uk and the uk lost ) but that is a moot point for these countries anyway since they all already qualify for visa free tourist entry . 
  itt : nobody still understand how freedom of movement works and the difference between schengen and freedom of movement . 
  your impression is incorrect . 
  schengen just basically makes life easier , but at a border of an eu country they are not allowed to hold up eu citizens ( nor ask certain questions without prior evidence ) . 
  people from all over the eu already have free movement to the uk but everyone except the irish have to pass through border controls to get there . 
  nobody is talking about the common travel area . 
  it 's about having the right to live and work in various countries , not about having to pass through border controls to get there . 
  border controls have nothing to do with the right of free movement . 
  schengen only concerns border controls . 
  that seems strange as visa policy is still dictated by country . 
  for example , i , as a non eu citizen , have no right to live and work in any country except spain . 
  my spanish residence card effectively functions as an unlimited schengen visa , but i ca n't just go move to another eu country ( well , unless my wife does , but that 's a different story ) . 
  well , in my clinic , they actively hate the private system . 
  they will definitely make comments about supporting the public system if you mention going to a private doctor . 
  it does n't make any sense to me . 
  i would add people ( even wealthy people ) will generally go to the private system not for the quality of treatment but for things like getting a private room if hospitalized or being able to have a much more flexible schedule . 
  i travel on short notice for work , so while i 'd like to stay public , the schedule issue is making it impossible . 
  that said , i do n't get why the public health workers hate the private system so much . 
  i am happy to pay my part for social security and that means i 'm contributing but not taking out as much and freeing up their time to do more work . 
  eh , life 's good . 
  most of us do n't actually do the siesta . 
  in my experience this is completely false . 
  because the anti-abortion people see any movement toward their side as a victory but the other side sees any readjustment toward anything even slightly more restrictive as a complete loss . 
  at least in spain i can say i think the current law is pretty adequate . 
  and i 'm saying that if you do n't think either of their views are adequate , you just get yelled at more from the pro legal abortion side than the other way around . 
  again , if i say i am for legal access to abortion but think 24 weeks is far too permissive timeframe . 
  i get lobbed in with the same people that want to give personhood status to a zygote . 
  seriously , there is room for debate on the issue but nobody is willing to give anything on either side so it just becomes a shitshow . 
  it 's been almost a year , and i have yet to see a felipe euro yet . 
  i actually use a us based card with no fee when not in the eurozone because it 's cheaper to just send an online conversion to dollars and not get charged for the transaction . 
   you 're writing as if the pro-abortion camp wants no limits all abortions legal up to the ninth month . 
  that 's obviously not the case and the pro-abortion camp is precisely the one that wants sensible limits on abortion balancing both rights . 
  in my experience , favoring any restriction further than what already exists means you are the exact same thing as an ultrafascist and best buds with the opus deis and all that . 
  i am also originally from the us , so that might color my views a bit . 
  remember that woman from texas who was on a rampage to not limit abortion restrictions and everyone lauded as a hero . 
  she was fighting to keep the limit at 24 weeks rather than 20 weeks which is something that seems like a pretty minor disagreement but it was being lauded as the attempt to destroy all freedoms . 
  both sides have a really hard time talking about the issue . 
  i can say it would be a big deal here for the president . 
  that said , it was an open secret that the old king used to step out all the time . 
  i think it would be a big deal if the new king would get caught in that sort of thing , though . 
  see the conversations in this thread for why the argument is so retarded for so many people . 
  there is clearly a need to balance the needs of an unborn child at some point but also to protect the mother . 
  i mean why would it be murder of a premature baby born at 30 weeks but a late abortion at the same time depending on where it 's located ? 
  it 's a fucking complicated issue and trying to boil it down to slogans is dumb . 
  personally , i do dislike the idea of all abortion on an emotional level ( an no , i 'm not religious ) but i recognize that there is a need for some sort of legal access as a lesser evil . 
  i think it 's also really clear that there needs to be some sort of limit at at some point it is definitely should be considered an independent legal organism . 
  but the debate is so damned emotionally charged and culturally loaded that nobody can talk about it . 
  for example , i think the us limit at 24 weeks is insanely late as thanks to medical technology , that 's a viable premature baby at this point ( high risk , but survivable in cases ) but saying i 'd like to see a limit at 16 or 20 weeks means i 'm some sort of right wing fascist to lots of people . 
  the thing is i do see some sort of need to protect the rights of a fetus while balancing it with the rights of the mother and it 's a fucking complicated thing to deal with , especially with an instrument as broad as law .

  i d n't think your assumption is true . 
  many people , including me , still think that precisely markets are one of the effective-est tools to maximize public utility , which is , in plain terms , `` public good '' . 
  and i consider myself left-wing ... 
   but you 're spanish , you could n't know about it living in one of the least populated countries i live in barcelona , literally two orders of magnitude more densely populated than _ anything _ in the uk , austria , or the netherlands ( in fact , it is around the 4th most dense city in the entire continent -- not a single region from these 3 countries even appears on this list ) . 
  this all just proves how biased is your perception of the world . 
  and by the way , also quite a few `` cities of glasgow '' in size move internally from one spot from the uk to another . 
  uk-external migration is a drop in the bucket . 
  you are insane if you think for a second that outside-uk migration has anything to do about the population density in your `` area '' . 
  probably a victim of the people usually exaggerate the apparent number of migrants by several orders of magnitude problem . 
   or in other words , to whom does the state of austria owe allegiance ? 
  its people , or its labour markets ? 
  why are these incompatible ? 
  the new order : international press exaggerates and focuses on `` terrorists attacks '' that local press do n't ever bother putting on the front page . 
  similarly , in spain we had the [ gals ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gal_ ( paramilitary_group \\ ) ) , effectively being state-sponsored terrorism with the supposed goal of `` fighting terrorism '' . 
  i 'm middle age , old enough to remember this crap , and _ always _ been more scared of the political reaction to terrorism than to terrorism itself . 
  completely . 
  ask the average spaniard how did portugal 's transition to democracy work and you 'll a blank stare . 
  no wonder the government can get away calling spain 's one `` exemplary '' . 
  good . 
  now that the definitions are clear , can you explain to me why does terrorism affect a country , a culture , or a society any more than the common cold ? 
  or traffic car accidents ? 
   in the case of islamic terrorism are targeted western values the western values of nightclubs ? 
  ( obviously , the reason you reach such mental epileptic trees is because they really do n't target anything special -- thank the loose definition of what constitutes terrorism these days ) . 
   i said `` the concept of culture can have a strong effect on society '' which is different , do n't misquote me . 
  could you elaborate on the semantic difference between `` the concept of culture can have a strong effect on society '' and `` culture can have a strong effect on society '' ? 
  and if so , could you elaborate why either of those is not a tautology as per your definitions above ? 
   the highest courts in france , the french parliament and the french government have found no loss of human rights . 
  i fear for democracy if you think for a second that `` because government said so '' is a valid justification for the removal of a right . 
   are recovered in full force after the policy expires . 
  which is why it is becoming easier and easier to declare it , as well as to extend it almost indefinitely without reason at all . 
  but no , this not a problem , it 's all legal !, 
  as defined by the guy in power !, 
   an imminent peril consists in an immediate danger to public order so where is this immediate peril again ? 
  where are the nation-wide revolts ? 
  why are n't all the other european countries following ? 
   the high pollution could have been enough of an immediate danger , that is my opinion , but it does n't take away that terrorist is a valid way to establish the state of emergency . 
  except that in this case , calling `` tu quoque '' is not a valid argument , because what i 'm precisely criticizing is the unbalanced response by the government to one specific problem . 
   terrorism does n't have to happen every day for it to be a problem that has to be addressed so terrorism does n't actually have to happen at all in order for it to be a problem ? 
  at some point , we 'll be in a state of emergency over something that happened last year ... oh . 
  we already are . 
   besides , as i said numerous times , the death count or the amount of terrorist attacks do n't give the full picture on the intensity and impacts of terrorism . 
  no , so we have to measure its impact in weasel words , such as `` may affect the culture of a society '' . 
  great for a politician to do as he pleases . 
   we are in a period of high occurrence of terrorist acts and the dynamic is not going for the better , the problem is not fixed the dynamic is actually going for the better . 
  much better actually . 
  much better than many other periods in which , oh goodness , no state of emergency was deemed required . 
   but since you dismissed my arguments with brilliant comebacks such as '' ... '' maybe i wo n't bother putting the list again why would you put the list again without changing a thing . 
  specially since `` terrorism is important because it is a crime '' is as useless as an argument as it gets , since you 're basically repeating the premise . 
   `` it 's almost fixed because it 's almost non-existant . '', 
  how can you find that even remotely logical ? 
  a problem however how intense it is ought to be fixed . 
  of course it has to be fixed . 
  but there are many , many other problems that come first and where the government does n't even remotely fight with the same energy as this non-problem . 
  which , again , is my criticism . 
   you ask me to define the common concept of `` country '' but complain when i take it on myself to detail the one of terrorism . 
  once again you 're illogical . 
  illogical ? 
  you literally said :  terrorism is a serious problem [ ... ] because it is trying to trigger terror inside a population aka :  a is a serious problem because < definition of a  why does the definition of `` country '' have to do with the fact that this is yet another completely empty argument ? 
  good , cause i hope you realize that `` evil '' and `` good '' are just viewpoints . 
  i hope your misquote is because you wanted so bad to make that joke and not because you failed to comprehend a long sentence . 
  so ... what is your definition of evil then ? 
   pujol has been the figurehead of independentism for a long time : rollseyes : i guess it 's true the average voter has no long-term memory . 
   free from repercussion thank god corruptg\u00e8ncia is not `` free from repercurssion '' , whatever that means . 
  and please note that the only people around who have the power to actually `` free from repercussion '' pujol is the executive branch of the spanish government , also known as pp . 
   pragmatism is skewed if you ca n't accept that basic concepts such as a country and a culture have very strong effect on a society what is a country , a culture , and a society ? 
  `` culture can have a strong effect on society '' is a total tautology . 
  these are weasel words in any way , and that 's precisely what i 'm arguing . 
  either you can define why your particular problem of the day is going to `` affect a culture '' or you 're just imagining things . 
   a security policy , with time limits , a control by the parliament , a control by the judge , that has been validated multiple times by the french constitutional council is an attack to society ? 
  more than terrorist attacks ? 
  yes , _ loss of human rights _ is a much more significant threat to a country 's citizens than _ any _ terrorist attack . 
  for starters , history shows that these rights are usually only recovered by revolts ...  stroke , cancer , diseases , pollution ... they all kill more in france than terrorism that 's true . 
  but they ca n't in normal conditions trigger the state of emergency because they are not an `` imminent peril '' so can you objectively define exactly what is an `` imminent peril '' ? 
   is as serious a problem as them because it is a crime ...  a human is attacking other humans oh , like pollution . .  because it has an international dimension , oh , like pollution ...  because it is trying to trigger terror inside a population `` terrorism is serious because it is terrorism ''  and saying that we almost fixed the problem of terrorism a day after the last terrorist attack is quite weird . 
  it 's almost fixed because it 's almost non-existant . 
  it is not weird to say that you cured polio after the last case of polio . 
   no idea how to stop this . 
  everyone knows it 's mostly north african descent young thugs , but they were born in france . 
  all this talk of `` sending them back '' does n't compute . 
  there is nowhere to `` send them back '' . 
  why is this a problem ? 
  i assume there is a way to deal with people who do property damage , right ? 
  why is their `` north african descent '' important ? 
  if they are treated differently _ in any way _ , positively or negatively , because of their `` descent '' , then that 's ... wait for it ... racism . 
  it 's extremely easy for people to start with the pm threats here in reddit . 
  i once got one because i criticized the microsoft surface pro ( of which i 'm ironically actually kind of a fan ... ) . 
   also , do you really think the rest of the country 's top priority is if the basques collect their own taxes or how they spend them ? 
   most people give a fuck about how basques spend their taxes . 
  please fix . 
  i see catalonia 's secession as the first step towards an actual federation . 
  its not clear to me how to get a federation of equal states when people in other states are already _ refusing _ to recognize the sovereignty of one of the states . 
  so , according to you . . why does anyone care about the secession of catalonia again ? 
   independentism is a pain in the ass for more than half the population in catalonia , but your reality wo n't let you see that oh for god 's sake . 
  and you got that knowledge right from god ? 
  he put you on a holy mission to defend . . something . 
  the truth ( and i refer to cie yearly polls for that ) is that the amount of people in catalonia that want to keep with the current centralist state or even centralize it further is ridiculous ( even less than people who vote pp in catalonia ) . 
  while it may be argued that it is not entirely clear if the majority wants secession right now , its a a fact that most people would be more annoyed by another 4 years of pp than by secession . 
  really . 
  collect their own taxes and spend them wherever they want ( eg . 
  basque-only schools ) without the rest of the country going batshit insane ( as if they cared about education ) is not a political thing ?

  this is only true if you are an eu citizen ( granted the vast majority of people living in the eu are eu citizens ) . 
  i live in an eu country and do not have the right to move to any other eu country because i am not an eu citizen but rather a resident of spain . 
  basically if i wanted to get a job in , say , the netherlands , i would have to apply as any other non-eu national would . 
  schengen has always had exit controls . 
  also , immigration policy is set at the national level and has nothing to do with `` europe '' . 
  the only thing residing in a schengen country gives you is the right to physically be in another schengen country . 
  you have no right to live , work , benefits , etc. . . in any country other than where you have your residence . 
  i think it is , but we love to stamp everything down here . 
  everyone seems to have an official stamp for everything . 
  the bureaucracy is n't the complicated mess it used to be , but that 's definitely one of the remnants . 
  i would care more but i really hate my passport picture and my job will pay for my replacement since i need it to work , so i 'm hoping to fill up the pages faster . 
   as of recently , they do n't stamp your passport any more if you have a residence card . 
  they most certainly do at mad . 
  the only other airport i have left schengen from recently is hel and they did n't stamp me there . 
  also i do get the uk stamp . 
  first us immigration is pretty on par with uk immigration control in my experience . 
  at least for non eu citizens . 
  also , what relevance at all does people doing something illegal elsewhere have on the argument at all ? 
  it 's just a clusterfuck of a fudge to make the border with n. ireland work well with the locals . 
  freedom of movement in the eu makes it not much of an issue for eu citizens . 
  for citizens of other countries , it can be horrible . 
  for example , you are allowed 6 months visa free in the uk but say you enter via london and then enter ireland via ferry or bhd and drive it , then you have no irish entry stamp so you could spend 3 months in england , go to ireland , spend another 3 months , and then go back to england and appear as an overstayer even though you are perfectly allowed to be there . 
  or say , a citizen of bolivia that can enter dublin visa free but then requires a visa to be in the uk , even though they can just take a bus across the border with no enforcement . 
  not to mention the ludicrous arrangement of needing to prove you 're from the cta to not require passport control at dub . 
  so you need your passport to show that a passport is not required . 
  the most amusing part of ber is that they completely failed to build an airport where an airport already existed because they failed to properly account for the fact that smoke goes up . 
  that said , as someone who does large projects , i can just imagine the feeling of complete dread that will slowly overcome you when the verification tests come through with `` failed '' . 
  so you have a meeting to discuss the punch list and you slowly realize that it is a complete structural problem that existed from the design phase and makes all your work pretty much worthless . 
  but how would they know they overstayed prior if there is no record being kept of departures ? 
  seems as of right now there is no real way to enforce overstaying by itself and generally goes with getting caught for something else . 
  it seems schengen has also gotten much more strict recently on these rules as well ( at least in spain and other airports i 've been to ) . 
  it used to just be a stamp without thinking for me ( us citizen ) but now i definitely have to show my residence card every single time . 
  i 'm 1.85 and being in nl is a dream in that respect . 
  it 's like everything is designed for my height . 
  public transport seats do n't crush my knees , my feet do n't stick out from beds ( not a problem in nicer hotels in spain , but definitely happens in some cheaper ones ) . 
  i can even buy shoes ( though that 's pretty much any northern country ) . 
  since it seems most of spain is incapable of selling more than a 46 and i need a 47 . 
  at least decathlon has running shoes for me . 
  i 'm not freakishly tall , but it 's really obvious this country was designed for smaller people , especially older infrastructure . 
  ( i will always hit my head on madrid metro line 1 ), 
  seems reasonable . 
  i mean afaik , they have no way of determining who is an overstayer if they do n't actually get caught . 
  and it wo n't be that much of a hassle since you have to go through controls when leaving anyway . 
  my biggest issue is that the mess that is the cta needs to be fixed . 
  cta works great for eu citizens , but for other citizens , the whole different visa regimens for both ireland and uk makes the matter more than a little complicated . 
  though it means my passport will fill up that much faster ( non-eu citizen resident ), 
   teachers with barely passable pronunciation . 
  i remember i met an english teacher once so i decided to switch over to english since i miss it and like to speak it as much as i can . 
  i 'll give you i have a strong american accent , but it was crazy how little she understood at a natural pace . 
  i do n't even know how to handle it when i have kids and they will be native speakers but will still have to learn grammar and spelling and everything . 
  spanish food is all about exploiting natural flavors and not so much through spices ( though of course we use them ) . 
  you have to search to find good asian food and good mexican is even harder to find ( the poorer mexicans that tend to be better cooks all go to the us ), 
  they have the exact same veto power as germany . 
  who knows how it would be after elections but even the government here is fairly hostile to the greek position . 
   it is an attempt to win support for syriza 's actions now and in the future by creating a common enemy . 
  netherlands and finland are probably the biggest problems for the greeks , but they are happy to let germany be vilified . 
  i see a couple of those in madrid from time to time , i 'm mostly shocked they are able to find street parking . 
  my biggest regret moving here was not buying a ridiculous car or mustang or something to be able to resell it for double the value without paying import taxes . 
  if i ever move back to n. america for an extended time , that 's definitely on my list of things to do . 
  heh , when i 'm back in the us and i get to have lots of spicy food and i always say how much i enjoy it , i invariably get `` but do n't they eat lots of spicy food in spain '' at which point i have to go through the spain ! = mexico speech . 
  also they may have spent a fuckton , but they have several fucktons left . 
  en madrid concretamente . 
  it 's kind of shocking to see all the bilingual stuff at the regular supermarkets on the coasts . 
  it 's not chilly for most of spain either , but when you have construction designed to make things cooler at 40 degrees , it actually is quite chilly inside . 
  i doubt even norwegians like to keep their interior below 15 . 
  well a lot of people will just use private insurance since navigating the public system is next to impossible if you do n't speak spanish and you can guarantee an english speaking doctor with private visits . 
  the biggest issue for health costs is for the more expensive urgent care that requires a hospital stay . 
  it would be really weird to go to a private hospital for an a&e type situation . 
  children of working parents would also count , no ? 
  that could eat a fair percentage . 
  i agree that it 's way too high of a percentage of workforce but there are plenty of other options . 
  ( stay at home spouse , children , etc. . . ) 1 worker could easily be supporting 3 others that are in the country and not working . 
  the biggest issue is most do n't register with their local council so the funding can be wildly inappropriate for how many people actually live there . 
  there 's a lot of younger people that are there to be able to serve the older people in english . 
  also , i 'm in madrid so i do n't see retirees , but there are a decent number of brits here just working normally . 
  today i learned i do n't need heat in the winter because apparently it 's always hot here . 
  even on the warmer coasts , the housing is built to get rid of excess heat so when it 's 10 degrees in winter , it actually feels fairly cold . 
  not uk , but i have to go into my phone 's network settings and manually enable it . 
  it 's `` itinerancia '' in spanish but i think it would translate to roaming . 
  contracts for a big infrastructure company . 
  when you see headlines about companies selling more abroad ... that 's me, 
  fair enough . 
  going abroad for me is like once or twice a week recently . 
  it was stupid but as someone who travels to the rest of europe a lot for work , it 's really convenient . 
  i usually do n't show id in germany . 
  even though it 's iberia policy . 
  there is an obligatory id check in spain though so i 'm used to it . 
  i 'm pretty sure the uk has a method to remand criminals prior to trial . 
  sarde\u00f1a is galician . 
  cerde\u00f1a is in spanish . 
  nowhere near 50 % of all citizens are going to be in the workforce . 
  another issue is still calling numbers not from your home country . 
  i have a good deal but it only really works when calling to spain . 
  that said , my new company phone just includes all of europe so ... whatever . 
  france took sardignia ? 
  as much as it hurts me to say so , i actually kind of agree with rajoy that the imputados thing should be on a case by case basis . 
  otherwise you are giving the state a manner to punish simply by accusing , they do n't actually have to pass any judgement . 
  you are aware that ciudadanos is very pro union , no ? 
   solved within months when major eu countries turn their back and see that independence has been reached and is unnegotiable at this point and understand that it would be a loss for their economic interests not to recognise us . 
  remember , money goes before everything now , and if that money is backed by a democratic majority , even better justification actually , you end up with a laissez passer and in legal limbo rather than a passport .

  it 's only technically false . 
   it 's only an issue for nationalist nutters outside catalonia . 
  it 's contested by pp and c 's in catalonia , who accounted for ~ 25 % of votes in last regional elections . 
  by contrast , basque model which allows parents to choose , is contested by nobody . 
  you are mixing things . 
  you can defend immersion or deny it exists , but not both simultaneously . 
  a fascist who had to scape from franco 's regime ... 
  void/null votes are n't intentional ( blank/white are ) , so you ca n't forbid them , just not disclose the number . 
  the figures you show also aggregate both kind of votes for previous rounds , while i have seen them individually accounted in other reports . 
  it 's not used as a vehicular language , only as a subject . 
  so he is right , unless you are very picky . 
  edit : downvoting a fact ? 
  boadella also comes to mind ... 
  it 's a sort of a catalan * reich * ... 
  i have n't read anywhere the amount of void and blank votes for the third round . 
  it 's a bit fishy . 
  may be they have seen that the difference was so close , a couple votes or so , and have preferred to declare a draw to avoid suspicions . 
  anyway , mas did it again . 
  everything he touches breaks in two halves . 
  i do n't want this to end anymore , it 's better than any fictional political series . 
  i do n't want to argue about an undefined term such as `` touristic city '' but 9million visitors/year , it 's a decent enough amount to expect some english proficiency among policemen . 
  ha , ha , ha . 
  take that , logsers !, 
  sorry to hear that . 
  i would have expected a better outcome in a touristic city as madrid . 
  it reads : absolute majority ... of assholes, 
  if you have n't already , read [ this ] ( http://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2015/12/on-juniper-backdoor.html ) . 
  the thing about the loop who never gets executed because a inner function changes a global variable blew my mind . 
  it does n't matter what we think . 
  public opinion is against it , and no ( spanish ) politician will dare to say anything remotely positive about nuclear energy ever . 
  we 'll have to wait for the cold fussion . 
  sorry if misunderstood , but i read the same . 
  spainiards think most romanians are gipsy ... what do you mean then ? 
  that 's not true at all !!, 
  romanian and romanian gipsies are very definite different * classes * of people romanian = hard working and ridiculously strong . 
  a bit shy and direct but kind nonetheless . 
  romanian gipsyes = an even worse kind of gipsyes exists , who would 've thunk ? 
   -- what 's the world 's most profitable business ? 
    to buy a spaniard for what he 's worth and sell him for what he thinks he is . 
  we have this joke with argentinians ... 
  so you are a french in disguise making a belgian joke ? 
  note that i will pass up the chance of making a joke about how hard is getting laid in the basque country . 
  you 're welcome . 
   how can a party not be . . partisan ? 
  adherent to a party or faction ; ** especially , having the character of blind , passionate , or unreasonable adherence to a party **  by number of parties willing to negotiate with them , podemos is at this moment the head of the list . 
  by number of parties , yes , by the popular support of those parties , no . 
  spanish humour is a bit gross , you have been warned ... 
   parties like podemos seem healthy to me . 
  if they were in germany they would seem very healthy to me too ... now seriously . 
  what is in fact healthy is to watch two opposite parties agree the diagnosis of the problems and reaching tradeoffs . 
  or see unions and bussinesmen to reach agreements , and not just to throw insults at each other . 
  those things do happen in germany but are ** unthinkable ** in spain . 
  here there is never any merit in the opposite views , there is no middle ground . 
  the example of this last legislature is staggering . 
  pp received a big majority to push for reforms and mostly because economic concerns , and they used that majority also to push their national-catholic agenda , as far as they could . 
  podemos is not a step in the good direction . 
  on the contrary , if they reach the power their actions will be as partisan as pp 's ones , we are seeing it in the municipal councils they control . 
  i see lots of `` others '' . 
  could be lamb a significant part of them ? 
  that 's pretty popular where i live . 
  do n't worry , that 's sealed in the constitution . 
  art 68 * the electoral circumscription is the province * . 
  i think that 's possible in the uk , but not in spain , iirc . 
  he ca n't overrule the congress . 
  i do n't think so , but this is all uncharted territory ... nobody knows . 
  a foreign ruler to unite the country ? 
  great idea !, 
  that worked really well in the past ( bonaparte , esquilache ... ) . 
  bonus points for being perfid brits . 
  imho , more pp for sure . 
  this is their floor . 
  the question is how much they could improve without changing the candidate . 
  first reactions regarding the new goverment . 
  pp : rajoy says will try to be elected pm , and will look for the support of other parties . 
  psoe : officially , it 's up to the pp to try to form goverment so they wo n't take the initiative . 
  they will vote no to rajoy 's investiture . 
  some prominent socialists have ruled out the pact with podemos , but this is not the official stance of the party ( still ) . 
  podemos : it 's not the time to talk about investitures , but about constitutional changes to `` shield the social rights '' . 
  en comu podem ( podemos catalan wing ) : a referendum for independence in catalonia is a red line to support any investiture . 
  c 's : will abstain and have asked psoe to do the same . 
  stay tuned . 
   though the outcome of this will be very interesting to watch . 
  from the outside . 
  from inside it 's going to be painful . 
   a soldier enters your house and points at your wife with a rifle , making sure you look . 
  what do you do , try to talk him out of the military or prevent it by fighting in the front line ? 
  i would n't call that a political cause . 
  warning . 
  this video is heavily edited and is anti-podemos propaganda . 
  said that , there are some long unedited cuts where he can be seen unarguably supporting chavez and maduro policies : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=btiyap0imeo&amp;t=6m12s basically , what he said is that venezuela was a reference for southern europe . 
  in all fairness , his discourse has changed a lot since then . 
  it 's comparable to the usa republicans . 
  people think they know how to run the economy . 
  true or not , that 's how a lot of people perceive them , and prefer competent evilness to well intentioned incompetence . 
   ( if it was n't clear enough , i voted for him , and i 'd go to war if you ever declared independence , so no , it 's not because he 's a `` catalufo '' you shithead ) no political cause is worth dying or killing for . 
  you voted for c 's , but i think you are very far from their values . 
  yes of course . 
   podemos would just scream at how they 're closeted pp members who allowed rajoy to remain in power and people would agree . 
  i did n't say they would ask nothing in return . 
  rajoy 's head , derogation of some laws , and the permament threat of a motion of no cofidence .

  that 's why you see so many people here that say `` i 'm all for them having a legal referendum , but if they ca n't , they ca n't '' . 
   for a their shitty political agenda haha in every single thread about catalonia you sneak in that phrase . 
  how is it living with that much hatred inside ? 
   but pro-independent parties choose to antagonize the rest of spain and look for international support instead . 
  you must be new here, 
  it 's always so depressing to see the shit history they teach you regarding catalonia . 
  catholic kings were around 1492 , so according to you the decreto de nueva planta which abolished all catalan institutions , all catalan laws and catalan as an official language , which took place in 1714 , was nothing but a concession and a gift . 
  we greedy bastards . 
  `` exact '' i think you need a dictionary, 
  why do you keep spreading these myths ? 
  if all these big companies want out in case of insependence , how come amazon has build a delivery hub last year and why did vw build new facilities ? 
  ( i 'm forgetting a few other big companies , but the point stands ) in fact , i think the balance between companies established and companies moved out is more positive than madrid xd . 
  same thing was supposed to happen with brexit . 
  you know that wo n't happen . 
  erm , that consultation took place on the 9th , but you can go ahead and lie, 
  just been to liverpool . 
  fell in love with the total eclipse of the sun campaign . 
  felt moved by the unity of the city against the s * n. 
  eh , i hate to enter in these pointless discussions , but all you really need to rebel is vocal chords and hands to grab a club or something . 
  hell , you only need one of those things . 
  annyway , that 's not going to happen . 
  good god , what he said is historically accurate . 
  do you want to give history the middle finger so no-one feels `` downplayed '' ? 
  go look it up anywhere , valencia was settled , just like the balearics , by catalans , although some aragonese did settle those lands ( not the islands afaik ) , albeit in a lesser degree . 
  mate my whole `` possessive rant '' came about because of his use of `` having a say '' . 
  i thought he was saying that spaniards should be able to effectively have a say ( he 's now explained that was n't what he meant ) , to which i replied like that . 
  it 's not possessive as a spaniard to think catalonia is part of his land , his people and his nation . 
  i never meant that . 
  it is , however , possessive if that spaniard thinks he 's got something to say besides `` please do n't go , i 'd be very upset if that were to happen '' in that he can decide for us . 
  very simple . 
  that 's why i said considering girona as part of my country is n't possessive since girona is part of my country because they want to . 
  because no-one is not respecting a spaniard for feeling that way , but rather for opposing to a referendum . 
  valencians do speak catalan but they are n't catalan . 
  there 's a kind of nation that the people from catalan speaking regions share , we do n't have the same identical identity . 
  think of the `` cetic nation '' and the cultural similarities between scots , irish , manx , etc. 
  probably one step farther . 
  in other words , by saying that valencians , and balearics are catalans you will upset more people than not . 
  that feeling is n't shared with north-catalonia and the bit in aragon that speaks catalan , they do n't mind from experience . 
  it 's not possessive at all because i 'd let girona have a referendum to decide whatever they want to be . 
  the whole point is that girona wants to take part into this idea called `` catalonia '' . 
  ah ... this thread was being the nice exception to the rule of shitshows regarding catalonia , then i get your classic `` quit your bullshit '' . 
  you know how this sub works with the uk-scotland-eu trinity . 
  well , you know how this sub works with the uk , pay no mind or you 'll go insane . 
  taking a side is n't rude by all means as long as you 're aware of your `` position '' as a brit . 
  i as a catalan , despise trump and would 've voted clinton , but i wo n't be going about believing my opinion has any weight . 
  you 're free to take a side , really . 
  it is good to have opinions about everything . 
  anyway , as i always tell the foreigners in these threads , you can support the option that has nothing to do with feelings and is applicable to all countries and peoples on earth , support a referendum and everyone is happy , 
  edit : we 're having the most civil discussion in years and you people ( not you areshian , i 'm sure ) still flair-downvoting . 
  must be the habit . 
  indeed . 
  it appears it tends to grow , i remember checking that number a few years back and it was depressingly low . 
  the problem here is a different one . 
  the is no chance in a million years that psoe , cs or pp start supporting a referendum . 
  perhaps some voters from psoe support one and , who knows , maybe even some voters from pp and cs support one . 
  as things stand , though , they wo n't give up their vote on those parties just because they do n't support a referendum . 
  at the end of the day , the referendum is n't anywhere close to the first place in the priorities list of all the spaniards ; it is totally normal that they keep voting either of this parties whilst giving up on the referendum . 
  another thing to consider , following this note , is that the only party that supports it is podemos , so in order to translate your support for a referendum into the parliament , you should vote podemos , and that rules out basically all the right-wing and centirsts sympathisers of spain , regardless of their possible support for a referendum . 
  is n't that a bit possessive and submissive ? 
  their idea of spain you 're picturing clearly lives on the subjugation of catalonia . 
  i understand the sentimental attachment they may feel , but that does n't make for legitimate grounds to have an effective say on the issue . 
  during the scottish referendum i saw a lot of brits showing a lot of concern , albeit from afar . 
  you kept your distance , as you lot knew from the very start that it was all up to the scots , and your involvement was reduced to trying to friendly persuade them . 
  that 's what we 're asking . 
  we do n't want the spaniards to reluctantly give their back on us and forcefully be taken out of the picture . 
  the greatest show of affection is granting us a referendum whereby they lend us some trust . 
  if they want to get involved in a positive way ( for both , but especially for that idea of a united spain ) , they should try to persuade us too ; to show affection , to respect us as people and our right to pursue our future ; to not make an inescapable dungeon out of spain , but rather a place which you can leave at any moment but ca n't find any reasons to . 
  any sort of involvement different from that , i.e use of force ; prohibition to vote ; a state-wide , meaningless vote on independence , would actually be shooting themselves on the food and would actually fade that idea of spain they 're trying to keep together even more , because we catalans wo n't have any of it . 
  lol , with a tear streaming down your cheek . 
   there are millions in spain that would agree to a referendum and do not agree how the central government handles the situation . 
  yes , there are many spaniards that support a referendum and respect catalonia as a nation and whatnot . 
  the truth is that the figure is actually too low to ever translate into parliament and the constitutional change required to hold it . 
  for example , in this two links i found with a quick google search , the figure does n't go higher than 45 % , while explicit opposition is above 50 % . 
  http://www.lavanguardia.com/politica/20161219/412729479551/espanoles-referendum-catalunya.html http://metroscopia.org/referendum-sobre-cataluna-cual/ the actual figure may be even lower if they had counted the opinion of the catalans in this spanish whole , because then the 70-80 % of support would skew it vastly . 
  if the population of catalonia is indeed included in the polling , then the actual support from the rest of spain hovers over 25 % or so . 
  well , either way it 's better than nothing , but any of those numbers help us too much for the time being, 
  dang it , i see what you did there . 
  assemble millions on the streets yearly and you 'll have my support . 
  hell , assemble thousands and you 'll still have my support . 
  it was very good indeed . 
  both had tons of data to back their opinions and it was very civil and polite . 
  we should have more of these instead of the shitfests that resemble bar counters . 
  it was . 
  heard so somewhere over / r/food, 
   disputes within the parties driving the secession process , along with upcoming trials of a number of some of their leaders , are undermining morale among wide sections of the catalan electorate . 
  we do n't need a referendum anymore because it appears someone has a crystal ball in their hands . 
  lucky you , you could 've said that some years early and we 'd be done with it by now . 
  if we 're talking shit about el pa\u00eds , is because they 're going down the drain . 
  in this thread you can see the problems with this article alone , and if you want something non-independence related , you just have to take a look at the coverage of psoe 's primaries , which was absolutely disgraceful . 
  fuck him , such a great day to be a culer . 
  hope he stays for a long time in jail and takes his filthy hands off the club, 
  it is indeed , but in the light of these events , all tv shows become brief news broadcast to inform the public . 
  at least in spain is common practice to notify the audience of such an event or event cut the transmission to connect with the actual breaking news . 
  your job momentarily becomes that of a news reporter , and you just ca n't pull this kind of shit . 
  good lord . 
  you , rainymeadows and veracius are the spanish holy trinity of this subreddit , thanks for existing . 
  it is perfectely reaosnable to wonder whether the bombs went off in the stadium of two of the most important football clubs in the world . 
  what followed * after * is disgrafecul however you look at it . 
  it 's not controversial because it is clear-cut tastelessness , which has no place when reporting a terrorist attack . 
  imagine bbc pulling this shit , the journalist would 've been lynch by his co-workers by now .

  if you even try to get down on the complexities , people downvotes and insults you . 
  it 's sad . 
  i think she 's still in charge because she has no one standing against her representing a better choice . 
  the migration crisis would have destroyed the president of any other country . 
  well , the only country to pose a threat is supposedly morocco . 
  it 's not because they are a real threat , it 's mostly because they do stupid things like this one https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/perejil_island_crisis here a bit of the actual situation : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/morocco%e2%80%93spain_relations and here about our colonial wars : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_spanish_colonial_wars_in_morocco afaik morocco is considered by the military to be a country that should not be trusted . 
  that there is not a high probability of conflict , but that is not unreasonable either . 
  tbh that would be cool , but spanish industry got shot so hard in the 80 's that we are too busy trying to recover our economy , specially after the housing bubble . 
  i mean , we have companies to cooperate with italian ones , and i have clients that do so ( i can not give names ofc ) but it 's not even comparable . 
  in addition , spanish investors seem specially risk averse , so as you can see we have a complicated situation . 
  edit : i 'm remembering that i did a brand study on spanish brands in europe and usa , and spanish companies had problems promoting themselves as spanish , except with food or `` traditional '' products . 
  customers associated spanish with less value when it was about technology or industrial stuff . 
  which was exactly what our clients were selling in those countries . 
  we do , basically because we earn much more for even less work . 
  i am resisting the idea of moving for a number of reasons , but i would be earning like x3 times more just in france . 
  i feel like the world is going to explode if i do n't go to work , while i 'm being paid just slightly above what i need to not just survive . 
  i 'm a bit tired of the spanish market tbh . 
  i like it . 
  i find it more simple than i imagined . 
  it is . 
  even galician , which has mostly a very open pronunciation causes them trouble to understand . 
  well , that poor petty criminals managed to have an impact in the spending budged of one of the biggest clients in my company . 
  like , they really steal a lot . 
  is that real ? 
  did n't know about it . 
  damn ... 
  tbh i 'm a bit busy to play with it now . 
  i was just curious about your reasoning process . 
  is n't qgis very unstable ? 
  that 's what i 've read . 
  i was looking for a free alternative to arcgis , do you recommend it ? 
  nope . 
  it 's totally real . 
  i live in galicia and we more or less talk about portugal sometimes , but i never had the same sensation in the rest of spain . 
  it 's a never ending cycle !, 
  i 'm one of them :d of course we relate with portugal in galicia , but it 's not the same in the rest of spain . 
  it 's a conspiracy !, 
  nah , for real , idk why it is this media silence about portugal . 
  it does n't make any sense . 
  bud , ok , i did n't want to be rude . 
  i just wanted to manifest this reality . 
  do you have any blog post about this ? 
  also , more of a curiosity , what tools did you use for the map and for the regression ? 
  i 'm sorry for portubros , but this is real . 
  most people in spain know nothing about portugal . 
  media almost never talks about them . 
  media in spain says almost nothing about portugal , so most spaniards only know the cliches / jokes of women with mustaches and towels . 
  heh , you better be concerned , or did you forget the history of your land ? 
  you are very naive , or you dream a lot . 
  for someone to dispute the political space of the pp has to present an alternative as a kind of national pnv . 
  in galicia , for example , if there were something like the pnv , it would win the elections clearly . 
  the monarchy is only a small part of the collective imaginary of the pp 's voters . 
  and i bet most of them , except for the more right-wing and elderly groups , do not care whether there 's a monarchy or not . 
  you are confusing your desires with reality . 
  yeah , is like catalonian industry never had the support of the central government , and never ever happened that they handed out law protections for their textile industry against other regions like galicia , collapsing its flax industry . 
  if spain loose catalonia , it wo n't get back , no matter if the block them or not . 
  you got it . 
  we need alternatives for conservatives in spain . 
  ciudadanos is playing the role for liberals ( despite they often look stupid ) and podemos for leftists . 
  oh , it 's all because it 's a female . 
  sharp observation . 
  sometimes i wonder why americans do n't import all this stuff they find so fascinating in europe . 
  they have the money . 
  they just have to replicate it . 
  this tone of always putting down usa is getting tiresome . 
  southern european lifestile is cool , but i 'm sure she 's not depending on an average croatian wage . 
  hahaha , i 'm with you dude . 
  it has nothing to do that i want to study other things isnt it ? 
  funny how people like you need to validate their beliefs using childish comments like this , because you did n't even make the effort to read my conclussions , but i suppose you are butthurt because what i wrote in the introduction . 
  here are my conclusions : https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5kxjd9/are_refugees_andor_migrants_really_linked_to/dbrspv1/, 
   maybe leave out the pre 2015 data if you know it has to be wrong and the foreign law data can not be excluded . 
  eritrea rising from 117 to 1386 in 2 years is just stupid . 
  we can not know if that 's stupid or not . 
  maybe something happend that year and they detained lots of eritreans . 
  anyway , if you feel uncomfortable with it , just look at gross numbers , looking at all the pks reports it seemed consistent over the years . 
   little difference ? 
  with and without show completely difference results in ranking and absolute numbers . 
  in addition different trends are shown with foreign law and without . 
  with is dropping very hard , without is raising in particular in 2015 . 
  if you look at the correlations chart , it is n't changing that much . 
   i am also curious for he population link from eurostat since i could not find it . 
  you have to download the population by citizen . 
  it wo n't allow you to play with it properly in their online tool . 
  it was migr_pop1ctz . tsv iirc . 
  this is based on data from 2008 to 2015 . 
  i wo n't say it 's perfect because it 's not , but man , this is not statistics for a plastic bag from the grocery store . 
  having +100 or -100 suspects wo n't change anything . 
  i suppose it 's because i 'm assuming everyone knows what a pearson correlation is , or understands easily my chart . 
  next time i 'll try to make it easier to understand , but i did n't want to just explain what i found , rather to make people see the charts and let em draw the concussions . 
  could you elaborate ? 
  the pks data has it 's limitations . 
  i 'm sure it 's because they have problems excluding crimes against the foreigners law , but they do n't explain exactly why , so it 's the best i could do . 
  anyway , if you look at the correlations between variables for both scenarions ( with and without crimes against the foreigners law ) there is just a little difference . 
  nationalities change their order but the ones with high crimes rates are the same in both scenarios . 
  if you can get me the data in english i could try , but i 'm not very enthusiastic about this topic any more , to be honest . 
  i 'll give first an strict answer , and later i 'll explain it a bid . 
  you are on point in 1 , 2 and 3 . 
  i do n't like how is worded but we could say it 's true . 
  the points 4 and 5 are wrong . 
  the correlation is very weak .

  in this issue for sure . 
  the uk is actually a very healthy example of democracy , despite its faults . 
  quebec , scotland , ireland ( armed conflict , not just an `` act '' , do n't kid youself ) , even southern sudan . 
  iceland too . 
  i do n't really have the time for these big write ups you do , just know that the more words you give it does n't make it more right . 
   are they undemocratic or democratic countries ? 
  less democratic than the uk , for sure . 
   yes they did , but afaik that 's a completely different situation , an union of two kingdoms . 
  nope . 
  the right of self-determination is the same . 
   you 've been seen by so many to get angry about not seeing any genetic evidence of difference between your people and the rest of the country . . false , but either way , let 's do the bingo :  brings up 1 year old out of context random comment downvoted to hell and back  calls me a shill  uses logical fallacies  insults have a nice day , you just earned a block . 
  you may check why referenda are so often used there and why they work that way . 
  oh really ? 
  so i guess allowing people to speak their mind is , too , anti-constitutional beacause ... ? 
  oh i know , but francoist is such an endemic term it would just lose meaning . 
  should 've said authoritarian , but it 's less direct . 
  he was a dictator either way , and ruled with an iron fist ( executions happened until the very end ) . 
  eu-federalists i meant . 
   the fact that political corruption in catalonia is the same as in the rest of spain it is n't , * percieved * political corruption is . 
  corruption cases in catalonia are blown out of proportion to make it so , and if they can they just invent them ( happened twice already , targetting the mayor of barcelona and mas himself , for example ) . 
  the fact that he was `` above the law '' for allowing citizens to vote just tells you how much spaniards value democracy . 
  not in france , maybe in germany but its doubtful . 
  neither of those states has had a real seccession issue ( or at least , as big as catalonia ) so it 's really just pure speculation . 
  [ sweeden on the other hand did , for example ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/norwegian_union_dissolution_referendum,_1905 ) . 
  i mean , you just admitted what i said before . 
  now it 's `` garbage '' . 
  anyway , i guess you all just do n't like to defend this issue that much ( or should n't , beacause , you know , it 's kinda fascist . 
  but they , keep on insulting ) . 
  spain was a fascist state for much of the xxth century and it just got out of that by allowing much of its machinery to continue ( basically , a `` transition '' to `` democracy '' ) . 
  much of the mentality , beacause of the fact that it was never really condemned , remains ( there 's still even streets named after francoist volunteers who fought for hitler in major cities , for fucks sake ) . 
  you ca n't question ( and by that i mean seriously question , not just the `` cutesy folk dress dance they do '' or the `` weird dialect they have over there '' ) the nation-state of spain , or express any sort of difference from norm . 
  just look at what 's happening here . 
  here in catalonia we 're federalists . 
  you 're working to change that . 
  just so you know . 
  oh , flair bashing , moving on , nothing to see here . 
  not in the uk it would n't . 
  or switzerland . 
  or sweeden . 
  to name just a few . 
  many use fake flairs , or are immigrants living in spain from other countries ( which are , surprisingly , often anti-catalonia ) . 
  but yeah , many others have n't noticed that we 're even pro-eu federation and just bash us beacause they fear that we would de-stabilize the eu . 
  they want status quo , whereas in scotland they just see a net gain . 
  it 's just all a big ol' pile of cynicism . 
  oh , but you see , the spanish troll brigade is strong . 
  they do n't really care about the scots , they might even like them beacause they 're fucking with the brits , who they never liked anyway ( but wo n't tell you ) . 
  follow the upvotes , check the flairs . 
  there you have it folks , democracy at its finest . 
  thanks !, 
  i hope that we do n't have to organize an unilateral referendum , whatever happens . 
  you 're welcome !, 
  the [ sanfermines , of course !, 
  nope , it 's in bunyol , val\u00e8ncia . 
  it 's the [ tomatina ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/la_tomatina ), 
  you did n't read the comment chain , of course . 
  i did n't even know atlanta was in georgia . 
  i know both , but i did n't put them together , so for me that is n't even an argument :p !, 
  true , but we need to be able to show these results to the world . 
  a 60 % abstention is too big a margin for something like this , it would signify that the goverment does n't have popular support beacause people do n't care for the mandate ( which actually is n't true , it 's just that the `` no '' camp did n't vote ) . 
  this is the current mindset here too , but thing is , `` no '' camp can easily boycott and just leave us with 30-40 % participation and skewed results . 
  well , the thing is , those elections were a kind of `` referendum '' by themselves , in the sense that a major party allied itself with the second biggest and togheter they formed a coalition that promoted itself as a `` yes '' ballot as a referendum of sorts ( a plebiscitary election ) and the rest of the parties too more or less aligned in terms of a yes/no vote * except for one * , which put us in this situation . 
  the situation was weird , beacause since we won a mandate for independence we could push for it , but we did n't win an absolute majority of votes for independence , since the plebiscite was not perfect and one of the parties declared itself `` neutral '' ( meaning that 47,5 % vs 39 % of votes registered for the plebiscite , neither gaining absolute majority ) . 
  this is the cause of the stalling , and meanwhile we 've at least built a consensus and state-level structures such as legislation and a fiscal department among others so that the transition is as smooth as possible . 
  we 're better prepared now . 
  it 's planned for september , but we 'll probably do it months before that, 
  i mean , of what relevance the state of georgia is outside the us ? 
  beacause we might decide here in catalonia to do the same and they ai n't havin ' none of that . 
  tough shit though . 
   catalonia is sometimes called the most autonomous region in the europe that 's not independent . 
  i wish , but not true . 
  navarra and the basque country have way more autonomy than us , and neither of those have more autonomy than a german lander . 
  a minor reason in favour of independence given the major ones , but a reason nonetheless, 
  or lapao hahahaahaha, 
  catalan is the biggest non-official language in europe ( 11m , bigger than most official languages ) . 
  we 've demanded for it to be recognised , and while the eu would agree ( as an exception , i suppose ) , spain does not . 
  welcome to the party of non-official languages !, 
  true in spain too . 
  i was quite confused when i first saw the stereotype swtiched in english, 
  oh alright . 
  what the hell is that flair ? 
  100 % also , i have about 0 clue . 
  we can never have too much embotit though . 
  i 'm a bit lost . 
  that is n't [ fuet ? 
  ] ( http://www.esdemercado.com/images/thumbs/0002515_300.jpeg ) , a catalan ( so just south of the pyrenees ) type of `` embotit '' ? 
  or maybe it 's [ llonganissa ? 
  ] ( http://www.gastroteca.cat/content/imgsxml/galerias/agenda/286/llonganissaextra_garrotxa_4.jpg ) tbh we dominate in these kinds of foods , so you 've got no chance :p, 
  yeah this is true , yet you wo n't see a village of over a 100k people . 
  in that sense , a town is always bigger than a village , both in spanish and english ( pueblo  aldea ) , that 's where i get the translation from , since i do n't think there 's another equivalent . 
  but is n't a small town a village ? 
  not really . 
  i 'd say town translates best to pueblo and village is an aldea . 
  perdona ? 
  nicolau is obviously a catalan name . 
  of course , he was named nicolau teresens . 
  the village in barcelona is literally a new district of the city , which opened and cleaned the coastline , creating most beaches . 
  our stadium was re-used from one that dates from our international expo in 1929 ( talk about repurposing ) , we develop most of our modern infrastructure that is used to capacity today and the publicity the event created firmly put us as at least top 3 worldwide tourist centers . 
  barcelona is what it is today thanks to the 92 olympics . 
  imho it was the best return on investment in the entire history of the event . 
  professional languages maps do not make this cutoff for a reason ( except you know `` map of official languages of bla bla '' ) .

  i could stay 30 seconds or so , but it was just endless suffering . 
  but the worst was the snow bath . 
  because water , if liquid is at least around zero , but snow was easily -20 \u00ba or so . 
  it felt like knifes trying to frostbite your heart . 
  i think you are right . 
  when i was in finland , we actually take the supper before going to the sauna . 
  i was worried because my mother always told me to wait 30 minutes before going into the water and we were planning to enter in a hole in the ice after being in the extremely hot sauna . 
  but it was ok . 
  i now think that the finnish are not humans , but some kind of yeti without hair . 
  it is clearly false , since they are not inside a sauna . 
  well , it is a set in itself . 
  a set of citizens , a set of land or a set of countries which only element is iceland . 
  in all the previous ways , for example , iceland is not a subset of the eu , but spain/germany/france / etc are . 
  yes . 
  there are people who see the glass half empty . 
  there are people who see the glass half full . 
  and then , there is you . 
  you see the glass completely empty and stained with blood . 
  but you can skip the brackets , and it would be true , then . 
  iceland , norway , switzerland \u2284 european union, 
  having it better than italy is a success in my book . 
  at least our politicians hide their mafia roots . 
  next step , those damn * gabachos * . 
  schles-what ? 
  do you mean north-north-north bavaria ? 
  i do n't have any idea why galicia is in red ? 
  people is so much into politics that even the deaths vote !, 
  it is a short and safe path to france , is n't it ? 
  and they have very good fries and waffles . 
  my experience is exactly the opposite . 
  maybe is caused by the flags . 
  people tend to give you less credit when you are * poor * because , * what else would you say ? * . 
  the kind of answer i receive are not very different with the ones i would receive by republican americans in worldnews , for example . 
  i have noticed different kind of response to people saying the same that i was saying , but with a german flag , for example . 
  maybe it is just that i express myself worse . 
  varoufakis said that either the eu accept the greek conditions or there wo n't be a half-life 3 . 
  you better believe that man has the contact to fulfill such a threat . 
  the problem is , it does n't matter how peacefully protest 99.9 % of the people , the 0.1 % are going to be very * loud * and are going to make into the news . 
  and there is not much the other 99.9 % can do . 
  even if they shun them , people wo n't see it in the news . 
  i am aware that it is incorrect and yet i use it every frigging single time . 
  thank you for the correction . 
  by the way , sadly , there have been some dead people caused by the rubber bullets , such as i\u00f1igo cabacas . 
  he was hit in the head directly and that killed him . 
  he was killed after a football match ( not a protest ) , but it is just to show how powerful are those weapons and why they were outlawed by the eu . 
  i am not arguing the reasons for it to happen ( more than a lack of solidarity , the problem in spain is more the rampant corruption and the societal complicity in many cases ) but anyway , that is not the aim of my comment . 
  i am just saying that what you have said is quite insulting for many people . 
  in europe there is a problem with homeless people and the ecb is the same for those people than for the finnish , the germans or the french . 
  this is your original comment , with bold annotations with the summary of my previous comment :  where the hell do you live ? 
  ( ** spain ** ) acute homelessness ? 
  ( ** yes , quite a lot ** ) where ? 
  ( ** almost in every city and town ** ) you do understand that not everybody can live in the center of paris , berlin or helsinki ?!, 
  ( ** people want a place to live , they do n't need a mansion or the center of the capital ** ) you can say that the protesters are wrong , and it is not ecb 's fault , which is ok , but you are dishonest saying that there is no reason for them to be angry to start with since there is not such a problem of homeless people ; and going and step further , stating that the real problem is that they want to live in the center of the european capitals . 
  that is a malicious oversimplification about the situation for many people . 
  like when on the other side of the pond , they say that the * poor people is poor because they want or because they are lazy * . 
  i guess it infuriates me so much because it hits home . 
  and countries like spain ? 
  i am glad that you live in a country with such strong social security and government help for those who are hit by the crisis , but finland is far from the `` average '' european country . 
  because of the destructive cycle of the crisis , thousands of families are left to live without a roof . 
  literally . 
  each month on average in 2013 , 5600 persons were evicted out of their houses . 
  with no help at all , and they are lucky if one of the parents finds a job or still have some income through the unemployment aid ( which only last two years and after that , nothing , not like in other countries ) . 
  not everybody wants a place to live in the center of madrid of barcelona , but rather , they want a place to live . 
  the only reason they are not homeless is because of the strong social bonds among peers in spain . 
  it means not only one or two families living in the grandparents ' houses , but even with friends or split among various houses because there is not enough space . 
  the fact that you oversimplify everything and use that blatant demagogy * so reasonable !, 
  everybody wants a mansion !, 
  * is insulting . 
  that ~ ~ remembered ~ ~ reminded me the protest in spain , in which the protesters where shoot with rubber balls . 
  mind you that the protocol requires the police officers to shoot into the floor and only hit the target indirectly ( therefore , reducing the extremely powerful impact and always aiming to the lower , non-life threatening and not so delicate parts of the body , mainly the legs ) . 
  however , police where so brutal that they aimed for the head of the people . 
  in the news , there were revelations about internal bets and so called , * eyes hunter * , because they bet how many people they could left one-eyed , which at the end , it was many . 
  there are thousands of photos of police officers hitting old people , people pacifically sit in the floor with hands up , kids ( literally , school and high-school students in valencia , for example ) , or even people in wheel-chairs . 
  there is no way that can be denied to be police brutality . 
  i thought that in germany was slightly different . 
  i saw a video about a protest with people throwing stones and all , and the police seemed way more proportionate than it was the case in spain . 
  edit : by the way . 
  the rubber bullets used by the spanish police were outlawed by the eu because they were too dangerous . 
  additionally , the eu has warned many times to spain about the overall repression , such as the negative to investigate the torture denounces in police stations and so on . 
  edit : and lets not speak about the police officers infiltrated in the protest to boycott them . 
  '' ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azhcw4h8674 ) is just one of the cases that was taped . 
  for those who do n't know , the charge against the protesters started because two of them started to throw stones to the police , the anti-riot caught them and started to bruise them until one of them identified as police officer . 
  edit : every . 
  frigging . 
  time . 
  a memory can not remember me . 
  welp , i think i prefer to walk . 
  my aversion for the mass mobs causes me shivers watching that photo . 
  so ... maybe is an exclusive tradition of europe too but . . but we do not try to pack 200 people in a single bus of . . 50 ? 
  sure we go quite * tight * sometimes , but . . how on the earth are they going all in ? 
  is there a second ( and third ) bus out of the photo ? 
  p.s : in spain the queues for the bus are quite weird , albeit usually very calmed . 
  since the stops are not that big , usually three queues are formed and the law of the zip is applied . 
  `` great , a news from spain !, 
  so long i have never heard anything about my country and ... well , fuck . '', 
  being spaniard is a depressive job . 
   jeb bush for president 2016 !, 
  that is what the world needs , another son of a bitch leading a major force in the world . 
  like the other brother did n't create enough problems . 
  it is probably a [ squat toilet ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/squat_toilet ) .

  it 'd be completely unsustainable . 
  these government services are n't cheap , and whatever potential for improvements always may exist , in general tax revenue is pretty efficiently turned into services . 
  at least in europe . 
   why , though ? 
  this is a simple one : because i elect it to be so . 
   i mean , you do n't equate your interests with those of any other provider , do you ? 
  but you see , government is not just a service provider . 
  it 's also the embodiement of the will of the people . 
  it 's innacurate to compare them to an isp , for instamce ( even though they could also , in fact , provide internet services if the people will it to ) . 
   is it because you get to vote once every 5 years ? 
  you got it ( saving of course the extreme oversimplification of this : we vote at least every year and a half or 2 , and there are many other ways to interact with the government in a causal manner ) . 
   a tax is introduced as a minor percentage of the overall system , and gradually augments to take over the system itself as time goes by . 
  you do n't make any mentions to the kinds of services that have been introduces by european governments in the last century as opposed to countries with lower tax rates . 
   realising that every day since new year has been spent working for someone other than oneself . 
  i 'd be surprised if many people at all actually felt this way . 
  i know i do n't . 
  i get plenty of services that i would n't in other places . 
  it 's a big reason for why i decided not to stay in the us , actually . 
   when you look at smaller and more streamlined nations giving citizens as well as corporations a better service for a lower price ( luxembourg , for example ) please do expound on what `` services '' does a nation offer to a corporation other than a low tax rate ? 
  at any rate , luxembourg 's income tax rates [ are n't particularly low as compared to the rest of europe , so i have no idea of what you 're talking about ] ( http://europa.eu/youreurope/citizens/work/taxes/income-taxes-abroad/luxembourg/index_en.htm ) . 
   it comes from corporations that choose nations where they will be treated in a business-friendly manner , i.e. 
  not like cash cows did i understand you wrong , or did you just say that corporations make governments lower the taxes on the citizenry ? 
  no ; citizens via democratic pressure , make sure the taxes on them are kept at the lowest levels possible for the services as a society we 've decided we want them to provide . 
   london now has over 600,000 french people you 're , again mixing up citizens and corporations.we can debate both , but please do n't use them interchangeably . 
   given that corporations pay a fee ( taxes ) for services they 're receiving it 's hard to make this argument when via loopholes some companies end up paying almost nothing at all . 
  apple pays 2 % of revenue income in ireland . 
  is it better than 0 ? 
  sure . 
  is it a fair taxation for the services provided ? 
  hardly . 
  ireland decided to allow this for a variety of reasons , from lobbying and corruption to a few jobs formirish people . 
  but make no mistake about it . 
   when either of them gets a bad deal , they vote with their feet , get out of the country and find a better deal elsewhere . 
  precisely , which is what this proposed law would minimise , by preventing some countries from allowing their citizenry to subsidise the services provided to some corporations . 
   but you 're still equating the interests of a state with the interests of its citizens oh , i most definitely am , at least on a large enough timescale . 
  i do n't subscribe to the various conspiracy theories on unchallenged and unchallengeable nepotism and oppresive governments , based on my lifelong experience as being an informed citizen of the european union . 
  and i see this proposed law as an extension of that democratic process . 
  parkinson 's law was never a serious hypothesis describing an economic phenomenon , much less a proven one . 
  in tax revenues , it makes particularly little sense , given the constant political pressure to lower taxes on the citizenry , and which , rest assured , happens all the time whenever the budget allows for it . 
  a fact you also overlook is that even if this were n't the case , a country having a superavit in the budget does n't mean that money magically vanishes ; it gets converted into governmental services . 
  and you 're again , equating the consumer market with corporate headquartering , in a manner that does n't make sense . 
  corporations are not customers countries want to sell anything to . 
  if a corporation moves to another country due to lower taxes , its overall effect is detrimental to the citizens of both countries ( and the redistribution power of both countries as it relates to this company becomes greatly diminished , leading to more concentration of wealth towards the top executives of the corporation , leading to more economic stagnation ) , even if comparatively the country where the corporation moved to benefits somewhat with more jobs and a tax revenue that it did n't have before . 
  you could frame it as a game theory problem , and one where if all the countries in a given market agree to set equal rules , all would stand to benefit . 
  earlier in your previous comments you made a comparative argument with the us , while obviating the fact that the us , being a single country , collects federal taxes irrespective of the states ' laws , and then somewhat redistributes it through federal programs . 
  this is essential because some states can only function due to this federal aid , due to the gross inequality between some states . 
  i 'm not sure this is a model we should be attempting to mimic , at least not as long as we want to maintain some semblance of national sovereignty . 
  i not only remain unconvinced by your arguments , the more i debate with you the more i realise how good of an idea this law is . 
  perhaps if you had any kind of source whatsoever to backup any of your claims ... 
  but , you did n't actually answer my question . 
  you seem to be equating companies with people , and countries with companies , and drawing parallels between the consumer market and corporate headquartering . 
  none of this makes sense to me , so i 'm afraid i must insist on a source for your claims . 
  sounds like an excellent point , but if this were true ( and i do n't know for sure that it is n't ) , i think huge multinationals would not seek out these `` tax heavens '' . 
  something does not add up . 
  well , if they 're arguing for it , i guess we 're about to find out whether they 'll put their money where their mouth is . 
  i 'm not an expert in macroeconomics , but your argument does n't seem to make any kind of sense to me . 
  would you care expounding a bit more , and perhaps even sourcing your claim ? 
  imo if we 're all going to be beholden to a single currency , with no country having the control to inflate their own to make themselves more competitive in the exports markets , it only makes sense that we 'd have a unified taxing system . 
  these companies are allowed to operate union-wide while being able to choose to pay as little taxes as possible ... which of course can only be to the detriment of the taxpayers/consumers . 
  how can an increase in corporate tax revenue ** not ** lead a lower need for income taxes ? 
  oh by all means , please do clarify ... 
  do you then mean bbc in this case , then ? 
  i ca n't say i saw them misrepresent the technology . 
  or is the rumours that she was `` fired '' ? 
  because that , of course , even she denies . 
  i do n't see how this is relevant . 
  the scientific consensus is that gmos so far ** are ** pretty safe . 
  this is not to say that we should automatically open the floodgates ( and i personally support the eu 's general rulings on gm crops ) , but seriously , where 's the anti-s ` ience there ? 
  i do n't agree with the death sentences , but 20 years minimun without parole seems like a good starting point . 
  i completely agree , most people do n't treat this kind of stuff with the severity it deserves . 
  a while ago i read in a bok about the philosophical implications of increased life spans that when we get to live for , say , 300years , a murder would have to be considered a much greater crime than it is today , on account of the expected years of income generation , establishment of relationships , etc. 
  following this logic ( which i agree with ) , destroying the physical evidence of livimg things from millions of years ago , it should indeed be conidered a very , very serious crime . 
  but it has yet another implication : many of these sorts of fossils/ruins/sites get routinely demolished ** on purpose ** every decade in order to further commercial or political interests ( the recent destroying of the viking site to build a government building in dublin comes to mind ) , which i absolutely bet that are much more numerous than the atrocities perpetrated by single individuals . 
  so while i support that people who destroyed these nests get rightfully punished , i would n't want it to become yet another situation where individuals get punished but people or organisations with power or money do n't . 
  i 'm truly sorry for this , have an internet hug . 
  i genuinely do n't know what the solution is : on the one hand i think * certain * risks are to be accepted for the sake of saving some lives of people fleeing from a war zone , but on the other , i 'm not sure that all the integration classes in the world can make an adult who was brought up to believe child rape `` is no big deal '' , suddenly change their mind ( i hope i 'm wrong on this though ) . 
  the fact that this situation seemingly does n't have a happy solution m makes me really uncomfortable and preoccupied for the future . 
  in actuality , it 's about proper places of sleeping . 
  nobody in finland ( or sweden for that matter ) who really wants to have a warm bed has to sleep on the street . 
  pretty much the o ly requirement is to ask to be let into the shelter , follow some basic norms ( schedules and such ) , and like , not kill anyone , generally be violent or obnoxious , or consume drugs or alcohol while inside the shelter . 
  considering anyone who has a drug/alcohol withdrawal problem can also simply walk into a hospital to get help ( both immediate for the deprivation and an inclusion into an addictions programme ) , what we 're left with are people who simply do n't want the help , or are unwilling to pay the small price not to sleep on the streets , who 'd sleep in benches . 
  and from that perspective , expecting these people not to use up useful urban furniture seems far more reasonable . 
  the path that got us here and allowed isis to consolidate and continue o convince and recruit new militants ( includings people on the west ) , had quite more to do with us meddling in their affairs ( playing to support their enemies from centuries ago ) , quite literally labelling all of them `` terrorist states '' , and turning their countries to shit in the span of very few years . 
  and all of that for the single purpose of ensuring our access to cheap oil . 
  if you lived in one of those countries , had a reasonably high standard of living , and suddenly had this happen to you ... 
  i don ' know if you 'd be a terrorist , but i guarantee you you 'd be ** at least ** pissed the fuck off at the west . 
  hell , i am , and i 'm from here . 
  that said , this , too ( terrorist attacks on the west ) is a relatively new phenomenon , that is vastly predated by muslim immigration and integration . 
  so , surely , even though full integration might not be achievable , it does n't necessarily have to be problematic . 
  actually going back in time to before 9/11 ( or even better to the late 60 's ) would be a pretty sweet spot to live in terms of our cohabiation with muslims . 
  it is a difficult `` problem '' to hack , no doubt . 
  and i quote problem because perhaps `` full cultural integration '' is n't a realistic , or even a necessary goal to achieve peace . 
  perhaps muslims can coexist with europeans in europe , as long as we all respect each other , all the laws are being followed , and a minimum set of core values is shared . 
  of course i 'm talking about basic things like freedom to practise religion ( meaning no considering us infidels worth killing ) , gender equality , and no discrimination . 
  a big catch -- 22 i see with this situation , is that the muslim-origin people i know that posses these values have for all intents and purposes abandoned islam . 
  i do n't know whether there 's a denomination of islam that 's compatible with these things , but so far it looks unlikely , in my very limited experience . 
  the fact that it 's a difficult problem to solve , though , does not mean we should resort to turning our until-now ( badly ) repressed racism and xenophobia back up to 11 . 
  `` they '' ( observant muslisms ) consider us morally corrup because of our lifestyles , and that 's a problem they have . 
  but if we do the same thing , and use it as justification for all sorts of segregatorial or anti-immigration policies , then we are not being any better than . 
  i would n't say that 's what they 're doing .

  and you are not helping much . 
  more like not crying but remaining silent , they probably would try to justify how it would be a very good thing for europe , because of the calling effect , etc. 
  or anyone , not only a child . 
  are we seriously discussing about if this is correct or not ? 
  is this the new level of humanity ? 
  `` yes , i kicked that girl , but at least i did n't shoot her ! '', 
  shut up , you random hungarian person . 
  we know more about the daily live in your country than you do . 
  i certainly do not know the law in hungary specifically . 
  in other countries , it is forbidden . 
  people understood that mob lynching is not a good idea . 
  because she was doing journalism , independently on the source . 
  well , more like pretending to do . 
  the girl was dangerous . 
  she had one of those hello kitty brushes and could injure you . 
  according to what we have to read in this subreddit in other threads , that woman is fulfilling half europe 's wet dream . 
  if taking some photos is what it takes to make people move and help other societies around the world ... 
  i think it is worth , is n't it ? 
  do us a favor , read your own nickname , and stop being a loser . 
  yeah , if i have to choose between a syrian and you , who do not consider that kicking someone 's running with a kid in arms shows a complete lack of humanity , i definitively would choose the syrian . 
  at least the syrian may be a good person . 
  you are n't . 
  even the police , who were hunting them down to arrest them , are like `` wtf is wrong with your brain , you bastard ? '', 
  except it was a clear intrusion of a foreign country with the result of a death man even . 
  and only 30 years ago . 
  were jean-luc kister and minister charles hernu convicted at the time ? 
  i can not find the information , but i bet that they were n't . 
  let 's not forget , as it is said in the article , that france , after bombing a non-combatant vessel in the harbor of a friendly nation killing a civilian , france ** threatened ** nz to forget about their legal system and release two of the murderers or face economic sanctions . 
  that is also fucked up too . 
  `` hey , i know we have just done something very badly . 
  but you better find this apology sufficient and release our agents or else '' . 
  that sounds like a bully . 
  yeah , i guess why the kiwis are still upset about it . 
  yes . 
  sure . 
  no offense , but whoever has selected it , has n't traveled too much . 
  i think your endless nights are the issue of your winter depression and alcoholism . 
  and , sadly , that is not going to change : <, 
  it does n't make any sense . 
  i think that is the only way the referendum would be fair . 
  after all , we are speaking about changing fundamentally people 's rights and i do n't think that two or three regions should obligate the others to secede . 
  p.s : `` break free '' , like if barcelona were not free nowadays . 
  for example . 
  why not ? 
  at the end of the day , people should decide if they want to leave or not , not because their neighbors want . 
  is n't it the whole point of the referendum to begin with ? 
  if the unity of spain is not something to be preserved , why should catalonia 's one be ? 
  i think , because i have family and friends there , that the independent movement is very heterogeneous in catalonia and i do n't understand why should not reflect that fact . 
  it was just a joke . 
  i do n't have any formed opinion on the issue , actually . 
  i am another redditor . 
  i just happen to learn the same thing while being spanish too :p, 
  actually , that is a very big issue . 
  barcelona , for example , is way less independentist than the rest of catatonia . 
  i am in favor of a referendum . 
  however , different regions should be able to have different results . 
  i do n't get why if in some parts they do n't want to secede , they would have too because in other places they want . 
  since it seems that unity of countries is not an issue , i have been always confused about why catalonia 's one seems to be sacred . 
  switzerland had agreements . 
  a new catalonia would need years , if they finally are allowed . 
  so , for years there would n't be erasmus to or from the hypothetical catalonia . 
  the un would probably have a stake , in favor of against , but nobody would care because , you know , it is the un . 
  ok , that is nice . 
  today i learnt too . 
  thank you . 
  maybe because it is an ad of sabadell bank . 
  as far as i know , there is only one way to rescue someone without violating national waters of other countries . 
  well , that is your opinion . 
  i have another picture in mind . 
  the international law reclaim you to rescue people in problems in the sea . 
  italy has been warned many times for failing to do it . 
  cdu is a very important member of the epp . 
  how am i supposed to no compare them ? 
  i do n't care how people define themselves . 
  the psoe in spain stands for `` socialism '' in their name , and they have been doing the opposite in the last two decades . 
  pp in spain is also a `` center party '' , which we prefer to refer as `` far-center '' . 
  i do n't consider a right wing the opposite side of die linke . 
  die linke is in the middle of the left and far left spectrum . 
  just to compare . 
  are the european people 's party or the tories right wing in your book ? 
  because in my book , they are . 
  on the other hand , what is spd then , for you ? 
  in my book , they are a left wing party . 
  i will read and think about that . 
  thank you for your suggestion . 
  yes , it is the fault of the border countries . 
  it is not like they are acting according to the law . 
  those are far right , not just right . 
  npd is actually a neonazi party . 
  what are they , then ? 
  i do n't know how germans will call them . 
  for me , as a person living in germany , their policies are clearly european right wing . 
  they even define themselves as liberal conservatives . 
  they are a member of the european people 's party , which contains the biggest right wing parties in most countries . 
  how does germany have the lowest amount of votes for right wing if the cdu is ruling the country ? 
  and many other parties are right wing too . 
  as i said , if now they do n't do anything , after saying that , then they are hypocrites . 
  maybe far right is too much , i agree , but i do think it is a right wing position . 
  at least in europe , right wing and conservative are the same . 
  it is like saying republicans , who are the right wing , and conservatives in the us .

  whenever i get to read anything in portuguese i can understand almost all of it , but when i hear someone talk in portuguese it sounds like the russian and spanish languages had a baby . 
  although , i find the portuguese spoken in brazil way more intelligible than portuguese spoken in portugal . 
  portuguese in brazil just sounds softer . 
  for example : the sentence '' i like to go to the market every saturday '' in portuguese and spanish spanish - me gusta ir al mercado todos los sabados portugese - eu gosto de ir para o mercado todos os s\u00e1bados ( off of google translate ) accents : [ brazil ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zanh1ik9iwa ) | [ portugal ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkmf4rqszqi ) also , i 'm curious to know if any portuguese speakers find that it is easier to understand spanish depending on the accent .

  my mother rushed to tell me to be quiet, 
  i honestly do n't know if this is a troll or not . 
  you just sound ludicrous . 
  i get that you have valid concerns , but you are exaggerating everything way out of proportion . 
  the united states is a first world country and it 's citizens do not need any sort of asylum . 
  syrian refugees * need * asylum , they are being killed left and right , either by their own government or by extremists . 
  you are probably just scared for trump , i am too , but you * do n't * need asylum . 
  if you feel you are being discriminated against , this is a reality , but it would be easier to move to a different , more liberal state than to europe . 
  if you wish to come to europe , i suggest getting a job here . 
  i 'm assuming by your comments you are a minority in the united states . 
  if you happen to be latino/a and can claim citizenship from one of those countries it might ( ? ), 
  make it easier to come to spain to work as you may know spanish and english , but i would n't really know . 
  if you are actually serious about asylum [ scroll down to art\u00edculo 7 . 
  motivos de persecuci\u00f3n in the ley 12/2009 , de 30 de octubre ] ( http://www.interior.gob.es/web/servicios-al-ciudadano/normativa/leyes-ordinarias/ley-12-2009-de-30-de-octubre ) [ here is a quick english rundown ] ( http://ciutatrefugi.barcelona/en/international-protection-and-asylum-seeking-spain ) but again , you do n't meet any of these as no one is really being persecuted . 
  you claim  the usa has daily mass shootings , the kkk , trump , police shootings , no healthcare , no drinkable water , if i do n't get asylum i will die like the millions of other americans who die every year . 
  first off , the kkk has a very very small presence in the united state . 
  [ the anti-defamation league estimates kkk membership at 3,000 people nationwide , while the southern poverty law center puts the number between 5,000 and 8,000 . 
  ] ( http://www.cbsnews.com/pictures/the-kkk-today/3/ ) now a days all they mostly do is hold rallies and spout their bullshit to other members . 
  they for the most part do not engage in violence , but more so hate speech . 
  this does not constitute persecution . 
  there are extremists like these in europe too , and i am in no way defending the klan . 
  second , donald trump has been elected by the people of the united states ( even though not by a popular vote , but hey , its your system ) and he has said some really awful shit . 
  some of what he has said is unconstitutional and can not even pass . 
  he has not done anything wrong * yet * and even if he does pass some conservative laws regarding education or religion or sexuality , it would n't constitute persecution . 
  the united states can not pass a law to suddenly restrict people of things such as public services and other things because of their race , religion , sexual orientation , nationality , etc. 
  even if some questionable laws are passed , you better believe they will be challenged in the courts . 
  liberals will not be put in jails , and gays will not be given therapy . 
  just chill out . 
  regarding police shootings , it is clear that some or a lot have been perpetrated towards african americans and other minorities . 
  genocide against minorities is n't and will not happen , and most police violence happens in places with high violence and crime rates and people are often wrongly victimized but again , this is not grounds for asylum . 
  i feel that the united states also does a very bad job dealing with drugs , rather than treating addiction like an illness they treat it like a crime . 
  many people are being incarcerated and it is also unjust . 
  you 've also said you want to move to a place that has drugs legalized , but in europe drugs are not legalized , they are * decriminalized * and only in a few countries . 
  healthcare is a problem as well but it is nowhere near in a situation like it is in countries such as syria . 
  you do not need asylum . 
  you and millions of others americans will not die , you make it sound like a second holocaust is happening .

  yeah , the uk ia full of xenophobic attacks against spaniards but spainiards welcomes them with the arms open . 
  smh .

  if you want to justify ukfobia with that you have a problem , cuz then they couls also rightfully call us p.i.g.s. 
  i 'm antibrexit and antieu at the same time ( + later ) , but proscottish referendum . 
  1 ) i 'm againt the eu as how i see it today . 
  i 'd be willing to give all my sovereignty , or found any * superstate * , but not at any price . 
  i want nothing to do with countries who 's mps say that women are less smart and weaker . 
  i want nothing to do with countries ruled by parties foundeds by fascists . 
  i want nothing to do with countries who 's mps suggest putting pog heads on fences to scare refugees . 
  and so on . 
  this said though , i would n't think it twice to give up any sovereignity my country had in order to build an humanitary and democratic country . 
  so why i 'm against brexit then ? 
  well , brexit had the oposite point of view of the eu than i do . 
  2 ) being from catalonia , you can probably underestand why i support their referendum ( and kurdistan 's , vall d'aran 's , hong kong 's . . ) . 
  but if i was scottish , i 'd probably opt for the no ( maybe brexit could change it ) . 
  i mean , although not knowing as much as i wish about their situation , i 'd probably be closer to scottish independentists than to prouk 's side , but having an state that cared for you ( even a little bit only , idk ) would make a hughe difference against an state that ... well , called you * nazi * for the same .

  and to make it even better , the far-right organitzation dol\u00e7a catalunya as source . 
  btw , there 's plenty of catalans that are proindependentist too and do n't feel the need of demonstrations too , so your argument is pointless, 
  different languages . 
  in balearic islands it should appear catalan ( as you can see in catalonia , and although its political debate , valencia ) . 
  about ukraine , if i 'm honest , idk much about their linguistic situation .

  i was like ` what is this guy even saying . ', 
  it 's not blatant support , but rather a ` look , you ( uk forces ) were worse , etc. ', 
  or something like ` there are political explanations to this terrorist phenomenon ' , which some people translate to ` there is a justification for x. ', 
  it happens here ( in spain ) too . 
  disclaimer : potato translation from google . 
  i will try to give it a look later . 
  the national police and the mossos de esquadra are carrying out two operations against jihadist terrorism that , for the moment , have been settled with three detainees . 
  according to the interior ministry reported on twitter , the police have arrested in benet\u00fasser ( valencia ) to a man of 45 years and of moroccan nationality for trying to capture people for daesh through internet . 
  the detainee was an active member of the ` jihad of the word ' and his proselytizing activities had made him a real threat to public safety by employing social networks to carry out effective terrorist indoctrination . 
  for their part , the mossos are carrying out an operation in the town of roda de ter , in the osana district ( barcelona ) in which two people have been detained for their alleged connection with jihadist terrorism . 
  the detainee in valencia , through the use of different virtual profiles , under names associated with the jihadist epic , repeatedly published messages on training in combat tactics , extolling of jihadist attacks committed by the daesh in europe , syria and other countries , making special emphasis on their followers in basic radical concepts , before any terrorist activity : `` jihad is an inescapable duty , '' as well as `` the imposition of shari'a , fighting and action against the enemy . '', 
  he was very integrated in the muslim community of his locality of residence , although it developed the work of indoctrination and terrorist capture through the internet . 
  during the investigation , the agents verified all the phases of the radicalization process , such as the exaltation of victimhood with the dissemination of contents about supposed suffering of the muslim population , messages of hatred towards the western society and the search for the solution in `` authentic faith . '', 
  in this last phase he urged his followers to '' strictly comply with religious dictates `` and to activism , encouraging the commission of terrorist attacks and extolling those carried out by d\u00e1hsh as an example to follow , the statement said . 
  part , the detainees in the operation in barcelona are two people of moroccan nationality , aged 26 and 37 , who have been arrested for allegedly engaging in capturing and radicalizing people through social networks . 
  the mossos d'esquadra ruled out that the two men were preparing any attempt . 
  according to the minister of interior , jordi jan\u00e9 , the research focuses on actions to support and disseminate radical messages . 
  also in the recruitment of two women to whom they would have radicalized . 
  jan\u00e9 himself has ruled out that the two women will be detained . 
  the women they had captured , aged 19 and 31 , had a close relationship with the two detainees . 
  in fact , the 19 is a sentimental couple of one of them . 
  the investigation , carried out by the services of mossos specialized in the antiterrotista fight , began after detecting the activity of capture of the detainees . 
  in addition , the investigators would also have carried out acts of terrorism and incitement to commit terrorist offenses . 
  the investigators also would have carried out acts of enrichment of terrorism and incitement to commit terrorist offenses . 
  in this subreddit , things like ` they smell like shit ' could be banned for antiziganism , so maybe you want to rephrase that . 
  more reasons to do something about it in romania then , i guess . 
  we have huge problems too . 
  in my city , for example , they stole three times in my father 's company ( computers and tvs , mostly ) . 
  the police knew who they were , but nothing could be done . 
  when we were kids , gypsies used to follow us through the streets to beat us ocasionally , not sure why . 
  one time , when i was 14-15 years old , they entered to my friend 's house and stole the furniture in front of him . 
  they move a lot of drugs , and some parks are no-go zones . 
  the cousin of my girlfriend was stabbed and robbed in one of these parks . 
  and these are just some examples from my experience . 
  there are a lot more that i know from friends or other citizens . 
  most of the time , you know where you have to go and when , so you do n't have to deal with them . 
  and that 's precisely how we deal with them : avoiding interaction . 
  i wish we could walk safely for some parts of the city . 
  yep . 
  the only way for le pen to win would be a second round against fran\u00e7ois fillon . 
  man , i 'm having a hard time with this accent . 
  i thought my english was much better :(, 
  now i can say that my grandma and albania think i 'm handsome !, 
  thanks !, 
  hurrah ... 
  we should rename it for [ princess padme plaza ] ( https://www.google.es/url?sa=i&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=images&amp;cd=&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0ahukewiato-zyoxsahxkbxqkhbnjbyyqjrwibw&amp;url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.traveler.es%2fviajes%2frankings%2fgalerias%2fespana-set-de-rodaje-de-hollywood%2f361%2fimage%2f16820&amp;psig=afqjcnewqbrezlsz5az38cju_ppabdtbkq&amp;ust=1490115843379841 ) . 
  picture i took a couple of weeks ago during a trip to seville . 
  sorry for the bad quality , i took it with my mobile . 
  the plaza is just beautiful . 
  it was my first time there , and i thought the rainbow was a nice touch . 
  hope you like it !, 
  they fucked up , though . 
  our pend\u00f3n ( flag ) is and was rojo carmes\u00ed ( crimson ? 
  not sure how to say it ) . 
  i did n't imply the pujol thing , i just said it happened during years , which it did . 
  now we have ` l'espoli fiscal ' from time to time . 
  well , that 's another debate , an economic one . 
  and do n't worry , it was a joke because it actually helped me to know if i posted it or not . 
  reddit is hard sometimes :(, 
  because natives are only huge minorities in bolivia and guatemala , are n't they ? 
  most of the people are mestizos , so it makes sense that they have more representation in all the social spheres . 
   it ca n't have been `` years of bashing '' because the mainstream independence movement has only been a thing for 6 years at most so years of propaganda , as i said ? 
  i do n't understand your point : it has not being years because it has taken place for ` only ' six years ? 
  that 's literally * years * . 
  it was a lie said time and time again during the worst years of the crisis , and only dropped after we were out of it . 
  how convenient . 
  i did n't know you ca n't post twitter images . 
  here it goes again , now with the twitter itself . 
  i hope it to work now !, 
  [ the graffity ] ( https://twitter.com/miguelrosar/status/641989985231609856 ) it stays in the argumentary of a lot of people , as you can see from the debates in the media . 
  years of bashing with that message does n't disappear even if the independentists movement has changed the strategy in the media . 
  [ and it was n't said as kindly as you imply ] ( http://www.eldiario.es/catalunyaplural/ciu-lespanya-subsidiada-catalunya-productiva_0_171133131.html ) . 
  you perceive more ` hate ' from ` the other side ' because of media bias , i would assume ; who are you following in twitter , etc. 
  edit : i have being downvoted , so it works !, 
  the struggle was real . 
  i 'm not arguing in favour of afd , i 'm just trying to analyze why some gays prefer a ` downgrade ' to their current situation in germany . 
  there are also attacks from ciu , esquerra , the cup and some catalan media against spaniards , especially from the south . 
  graffities from the cup comparing spanish football fans to apes , the well-known ` espanya ens roba ' , andalusians are lazy and catalans are paying for their laziness , etc. 
  i do n't like the ` look at me , i 'm a victim ' game , but if we are going to play dirty , let 's show all the picture , shall we ? 
  i wish we the republicans could let some symbols go , like anguita has been proposing for years . 
  a civic renovation is needed , not just in the right . 
  it 's hard to see it on your side when the government is acting irresponsibly time and time again . 
  because if i were gay i would be more cautious about going to some parts of the city with high muslim population . 
  the cultural crash is to be expected , as most muslims have a more intolerant view about homosexuality . 
  that 's a good point ; the electorate from uk seems to be more ` right-wing ' than the continental one . 
  but what i see from greece , spain , netherlands and maybe france is the same story : the incapacity of socialdemocracy to clearly distance itself from the conservatives , at least regarding economy . 
  if there 's indeed a distance between them , the people do n't percive it . 
  and the implosion of labour parties across europe just keeps going . 
  i wonder if they will learn something eventually . 
  our democracy is yuge . 
  we are the best at democracy . 
  believe me . 
  we had to accommodate a lot of people coming from the countryside to the cities in a relatively small frame of time . 
  that 's my two cents , but i do n't know for sure . 
  as it says , that 's the classical usage , when the anarcho-mutualists were a thing ( with benjamin tucker and his group of the newspaper liberty , or even some in europe ) . 
  only the recent group leaded by kevin carson could pass as ` free market socialists ' , i guess . 
  but most of the anarchists are , economically speaking , marxists , and so deny their affiliation to the movement . 
  in spain , we used ` libertariano ' for them and ` libertario ' for us , for example , which are both pretty similar to the english words .

  and i never said we had the same culture , we are different , but comparing with other countries , we may look `` similar '' . 
  p.s : you are the one that compared spanish food with italian food ;p, 
  food/drinks ( wine over beer , similar stuff , big lunch , usually with bread ) , art ( both old and new , you would be surprised by the number of italian singers that have been in spain ) , the language , the importance of family ( and the big meetings in christmas/other celebrations ) , similar weather ( yes , north italian weather is not very far from central/north spain ) and many more ... edit : i 'm curious , why do you think we are more different than usually stated ? 
  she was from the north , i lived there too . 
  i live in madrid , and i have seen belgian , german and alsacian in supermarkets , german/english are very common in touristic areas full of ... germans/english . 
  dutch cheap ones are also common ( heineken , i have seen a couple of grolsch ) . 
  i only have seen american in dedicated stores . 
  beer culture does n't exist , we only drink beer during meals and when we go to bars ( `` irse de ca\u00f1as '' ) during the afternoon ( rarely during night , we prefer whiskey/rum/vodka / gin to get drunk ) . 
  we are more interested in what is served with the beer , you always get a free tapa . 
  note : you can search estrella damm double malta ( doble malta or voll-damm ) , it 's stronger than the normal one . 
  not much , but you can do it ( after running i go directly to my flat ) . 
  the current government , right-wing and mostly catholic , has announced a change in the abortion law though . 
  indeed , it 's some kind of shandy . 
  you might be able to find `` shandy cruzcampo '' or `` mixta '' but those are `` industrial '' and i would go with the `` homemade '' . 
  not a clue about the berliner weisse with syrup . 
  and indeed , it 's not a drink to get drunk ( we do n't drink beer for that ) , but a refreshing , cold drink . 
  now , you can think about how many people was necessary to build all that , and everything that comes with a house ( pipes , doors , house appliances ... ) and you will understand spain unemployment . 
  sure  we got rid of most double consonants : nn -  \u00f1 , mm -  nm or mn and so on . 
  only rr and ll remain , both with different sounds than r or l. 
  really ? 
  i do n't live there but i just checked schedules for alcampo and mercadona ( two big supermarkets ) and all have non-interrupted workdays . 
  do you remember the name of the supermarket ? 
   much like greeks that have they weird attitude that they are really close with italians in matter of culture and way of life , which is imo not true , and many are left deluded after living in italy for a while . 
  having dated an italian , and lived there for a short time , we do have many , many things in common . 
   there was another carthage on its eastern coast carthago nova , nowadays cartagena , annibal campaign started there . 
   housing bubble that burst to understand the extent of this , i recommend this webpage : http://www.nacionrotonda.com/ you only have to scroll the thing in the middle of the images left and right ( left -  around 10 years ago , right -  nowadays ) . 
  `` entradas antiguas '' in the bottom to see more . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/joan_pujol_garcia edit : a quick glimpse ( from wikipedia ) : in 1940 , during the early days of world war ii , pujol decided that he must make a contribution `` for the good of humanity '' [ 3 ] ( and to oppose the franco regime ) by helping britain -- which , with its empire , was germany 's only adversary at the time . 
  [ 17 ] [ 23 ] he initially approached the british three different times , [ 3 ] including through his wife ( though pujol edited her participation out of his memoirs ) , [ 17 ] but they showed no interest in employing him as a spy . 
  therefore , he resolved to establish himself as a german agent before approaching the british again to offer his services as a double-agent . 
  [ 17 ] pujol created an identity as a fanatically pro-nazi spanish government official who could travel to london on official business ; [ 3 ] he also had created for himself a fake spanish diplomatic passport via fooling a printer into thinking pujol worked for the spanish embassy in lisbon . 
  [ 26 ] he contacted friedrich knappe-ratey , a german intelligence agent in madrid codenamed `` frederico '' , [ 27 ] and german intelligence accepted him and gave him a crash course in espionage , including secret writing , a bottle of invisible ink , a codebook and 600 pounds for expenses . 
  his instructions were to recruit a network of british agents . 
  [ 3 ] he moved instead to lisbon , and -- using a tourist 's guide to england , reference books and magazines from the lisbon public library and newsreel reports he saw in cinemas -- created seemingly credible reports that appeared to come from london . 
  [ 3 ] he claimed to be travelling around britain and submitted his travel expenses based on fares listed in a british railway guide . 
  a slight difficulty was that he did not understand the pre-decimal system of currency used in britain , [ 28 ] expressed in pounds , shillings and pence , and was unable to total his expenses . 
  instead , he simply itemised them , and said he would send the total later . 
  that would be [ fideua ] ( https://www.google.es/search?q=fideua&amp;safe=off&amp;espv=210&amp;es_sm=122&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ei=v6z3upmldqep0awdoocida&amp;ved=0cakq_auoaq&amp;biw=1280&amp;bih=675 ), 
  congratulations , you have found the best ones . 
  being from a hot country i would recommend you a `` clara '' , that is , beer mixed with `` gaseosa '' ( carbonated water ) or lemon fanta ( yes , we have that flavour ) . 
  em , i usually run in the street with sport clothes , and many people do . 
  when i go to the gym i go on the sport clothes , but i usually come back with normal clothes ; after the shower you do n't want to wear your old , wet clothes . 
  1492 : not only the americas were discovered and the expulsion of the jews , the first [ spanish grammar ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gram%c3%a1tica_de_la_lengua_castellana ) was published , in fact , the first grammar of an european language beside latin/greek . 
  basically , once the agreement is signed and implemented , there wo n't be customs between the eu ( and a few other countries : norway , switzerland , iceland ) and canada . 
  important detail : a few products will have taxes , albeit lower , such as dairy products , cow and pig meat and spirits . 
  there are a few more details such as canada accepting patents/branding laws from the eu . 
  for example , champagne can only be advertised , in the eu , as such if the grapes come from the region of champagne in france . 
  from now on , anything sold as champagne in canada will have to follow the same rule . 
  i have seen a `` salsa sauce '' in more than one mexican around europe , i did n't dare to ask for it . 
  not only the old aragonese kingdom is `` related '' to italy , andalusia ( specially with south italy ) and central spain have more in common with italy than portugal . 
  many artists from spain spent a lot of time in italy ( vel\u00e1zquez , goya and cervantes , for example ) . 
  this led to a bigger cultural exchange with italy , not portugal . 
  food is also more similar in italy ( except for pasta ) ; the same with weather ( portugal is an atlantic country , not mediterranean ) . 
  i doubt that any museum opens at 10 pm thus i would say just 10/11 ( diez/once ), 
  the sentences of fissileport1 are impersonal , you are saying that visiting the cathedral is obligatory . 
  that will depend on the specific noble . 
  in any case they probably will say something in very formal situations and in those cases they have specific treatments . 
  the king , for example is `` su majestad '' , the rest of the royal family `` su alteza real '' , the `` grandes de espa\u00f1a '' ( maximum nobiliary title ) `` excelent\u00edsimos se\u00f1ores '' and so on . 
  french is the language that has changed more in pronunciation , you should try spanish or italian . 
  note : it 's quite probable that you can use the phrases given in portuguese and italian for spanish speaking people . 
  in spain some people can feel uncomfortable if addressed with `` usted '' , specially girls/ladies . 
  in america , in spanish speaking countries the situation is the opposite : `` t\u00fa '' is n't used . 
  on the other hand , impersonal sentences avoid this and sentences in plural ( `` you '' is different in singular/plural in spanish ) so i would recommend the sentence of fissileport1 . 
  you 're not the only one ... 
  well , you must understand that with the current schedule we would be working 6 hours working before lunch . 
  if you do that your productivity is going to go down in the last hours ( and you feel tired after 4 hours which is one the first break usually takes place ) . 
  my point is that our lunches are pretty much at the same `` solar '' time than the rest of europe , but the time we start is not ( it 's the same `` clock '' time than the rest of central europe ) . 
  then your employer usually demands you to stay one or two hours more after the `` official '' end of your work time . 
  all this results in two 5-6 hours chunks ... 
  so the breaks start . 
  at the end we work 4 chunks of around 2-2 .5 hours so we work the same as you do , but we stay a couple more hours in the workplace . 
  nope , actually lunch usually starts between 14:00 and 15:00 which after reducing one hour ( difference of solar time with germany ) results in 13:00 or 14:00 which is rather close to the lunch time in germany . 
  changing time is stupid : the time in your clock is just a label , i already gave this example in / r/europe : let 's imagine we turn crazy and decide to change time ( forward or backward ) 12 hours ... we would keep doing everything at the same time , but instead of am , pm and vice-versa . 
  now , it is true that there is a problem in spain : we stay in the workplace between 10-12 hours ( in the case of 12 hours it 's usually unpaid overtime ) , including a break for lunch of 1.5 / 2 hours and probably one or two small breaks for coffee . 
  considering the breaks we end up working less than those who work 8 hours plus half hour for lunch . 
  how to solve this ?? 
  as the example with iberdrola : go for 8 hours shifts . 
  this can be achieved reducing the lunch break ( 45 minutes-1 hour ) , starting later ( it does n't make sense that we start working at 8/9 am , the same time the germans/finns do ) and not working overtime ( in those jobs where this happens ) . 
   pretty much everyone knew greece/spain had cooked their books to get into the eu . 
  greece recognised , but , could you give a citation about spain ? 
  rowers were slaves , in part from those areas , once a galley was defeated those slaves/servants/prisoners would change hands . 
  well , most slaves/servants in spain came from the battles between barbary and spanish galleys , the winner would take the survivors as slaves or asked for a ransom ( miguel de cervantes , for example ) . 
  black slaves that the barbarian pirates took from southern parts of africa ( used mainly as rowers ) changed hands and were sold in spain ( spain , due its treaties with portugal , could not go to africa for slaves ) . 
  and i feel outraged because sinterklaas takes bad kids back to spain !, 
  or at least change it to italy , as bari is not in spain anymore ... or you could stop thinking about these stupid things and just carry on ... 
  the law did n't ( and does n't ) state how the time reductions must be applied . 
   tried to apply that law retroactively technically it is not a law ( no law states if time reductions are applied on the total sentence or on the 30 years ) , it was an administrative change . 
   in sweden that only applies to citizens . 
  perhaps residents before application ? 
  you will have tuition fees as anyone from germany would , i had a friend who was also german but had lived since he was born in the usa . 
  we were both studying in the netherlands , he was paying the same as the locals ( masters degree ) which was pretty much nothing compared to what he would have payed in the usa . 
  prices in general are low since you are an eu citizen but will vary depending on the country , or even region ( for example scotland is free , germany depends on the l\u00e4nder and so on ) . 
  you should take more into consideration the cost of living . 
  some countries may also demand you to have a enough money to survive , at least one year , before arrival . 
  you can easily find masters programs taught in english and you might find many bachelor programs as well , but this will depend heavily on the country and what you want to study . 
  every country in the eu has a nice list of universities on wikipedia so i would start looking there , you can pick a few and visit their `` international '' section on their webpage . 
   each ticket costs 20 $ . 
  you can buy smaller parts ... 
  the same , but it became something unimaginable around ten years ago , you can check this page if you want : http://www.nacionrotonda.com/ it shows many villages and cities 10 years ago/now . 
  that study , that the telegraph recently talked about , includes that number , but it is the number of `` non active '' , not unemployed .

  well , nothing / u/neutrolgreek has said is false , that events happened . 
  what happened the following days are a different matter , but not mentioning them is different from denying . 
  that sounds like a very reasonable way to deal with problems . 
  thanks for the clarification . 
  do eurovision votes count ? 
  lol , joking . 
  i meant anything that might have hurt their own economy , be it bad political decisions , having suffered a civil conflict , a dictatorship or simply cultural differences , whatever . 
  it does n't matter how clear it is or how illegal you make it , if people in the neighboring countries face misery or war conflicts you will always have a constant flow of illegal immigrants . 
  you wo n't stop it acting over the consequences . 
  i do n't think this statement needs any kind of justification , it 's trivial . 
  of course you ca n't stop all war conflicts , but closing your eyes and pretending they are n't happening ( which to my poor knowledge the eu has experience in that ) wo n't help at all . 
  a lot of british support for the eu since the 1990s has come from the left wing but the perception of the eu as pro-austerity has damaged its standing amongst them i beg your pardon for my ignorance ( and my english ) . 
  do you mean conservatives reject austerity too ? 
  if tatcher was considered so good there , how can austerity policies be something undesired by british citizens ? 
  i mean , here in spain her mandate was used as support and model by the current government in order to sell austerity and liberal policies to the voters . 
  edit : thank you all for your answers . 
  i really doubt tougher measures work , they never do . 
  even then , the situation in our countries will be more attractive to them . 
  unless the root of the problem is faced ( misery in their countries ) this wo n't stop , ever . 
  thank us , the day spain exports politicians instead of engineers and nurses the entire ez will go bankrupt . 
  you talk like if greek people had n't rioted against the previous bailout . 
  not only that . 
  given greece 's situation a fm should at least have a plan for that or even the intention to do so if necessary when going into negotiations . 
  otherwise you can only accept what you are offered because you ca n't bluff ad infinitum . 
   michel sapin , the french finance minister , suggested they just `` get it all out and tell one another the truth '' to blow off steam . 
  many in the room seized the opportunity with relish . 
  the fact this has to be done after months of negotiations is really sad . 
  that should have been done the first day . 
  and it 's about time we start to drop stupid past differences . 
  every country has done shit in the past , and all of it was brown , here and at the north of the ~ ~ wall ~ ~ europe . 
  the ` wages are excessive ' part really got me . 
  not sure if i 've heard that before ... 
  yes , but they also benefitted from free financing thanks to the crisis in southern countries , which was accentuated by not devaluating the euro or ecb inactivity . 
  so why not taking advantage of this as well ? 
  nothing was actually done until that attitude threatened to create a spanish default and recession in france . 
   it would harden the ez and establish a precedent of how to deal with nations that cant play by the rules . 
  it would be a harsher , not so friendly eurozone . 
  but also a more stable one . 
  i am not sure if throwing more debt into an already insolvent entity can be called ` deal with ' . 
  and if this has brought something you can be sure it is n't stability to the eurozone . 
  with all due respect your statement seems quite naive , specially when trust in a common european project is so important . 
  to be honest , it was n't until the ecb went all-in buying public debt of european countries , thus devaluating the euro , that countries like spain were able to escape the deflationary spiral they were into . 
  it was only this and none of the imf austerity measures what allowed spain go finance itself in the markets at normal rates . 
  i do n't know exactly why the ecb did n't act sooner , i guess revenues of 7-10 % at 10 years ( like the spanish ones ) were too juicy to let them go for some of our ` partners ' in the eurozone . 
   the problem is not that the solutions do n't exist , the problem is that no one is willing to implement them because it would mean that we 'd have to acknowledge that our almighty austerity gods have failed us to be honest , i see too many people whose positions have been acquired or reinforced after becoming ` austerity saviours ' to see that happening , ever . 
  that and a failure monetary and fiscal union seem completely taboo . 
  thanks , internet stranger . 
  as an spanish engineer who is soon emigrating to start over , your comment both saddened and cheered me up at the same time . 
  and that debt was previously owned by and large by the private banking of each country . 
  i am not saying germany ( or france , spain ... ) has less debt , just that the initial debt ( which suffered a cut down of \u00bf 50 % ? ), 
  has been transferred to the taxpayers ( in each country ) . 
  i think that was the point of the first bailout in order to avoid a contagious effect . 
  my apologies if that 's wrong . 
  it 's funny germany pushes for a grexit now that the ruinous investment of german and french debt ( mostly ) has been transferred to european taxpayers . 
  what a fucking cynical attitude . 
  do n't worry , spain will never enter another crisis because we never left it behind . 
  with a public debt of 100 % gdp and unemployment rate above 24 % ( 50 % + for youth ) it 's only a matter of time we become insolvent too ( even if our gdp is said to be growing ) . 
  and if you think greek government is bad at taking responsibility for his acts just wait to see ours . 
  we have elections in november and 4 years ago the party who is currently in the government hid debt in the regions where they were ruling for as much as 2.5 % gdp . 
  so i would n't believe a single economic indicator or liquidity data from spain until after the elections . 
  i am not sure which was the amount expected for the 3rd bailout in the previous ez/iwf proposal , but 27b $ of debt relief and 74b $ of a new bailout seems quite a lot for the untrained eye . 
  i do n't think it is likely that psoe+p odemos receive enough support from only minor parties to form a government . 
  most likely scenario , there is no agreement , ciudadanos does n't veto rajoy and vote against psoe or podemos . 
  pp would govern , then soraya is named pm and everything keeps being the same shit that brought us here . 
  we shout when talking . 
  but just because others shout and we ca n't hear , duh !, 
  and not a popular stereotype ( i think ) , but a real one : we never leave immediately after saying `` ok , i have to go '' . 
  if someone does it he 's clearly fleeing . 
   my problem when in the rest of europe is that everything is closed when i 'm hungry . 
  people seem to think i 'm nuts looking to eat dinner at 21:00 . 
  ( though it does n't help that i 'm not originally from spain and i look pretty guiri ) friendly advice , get used to eat 5 meals a day instead of our usual 3 . 
  otherwise you 'll need to adapt drastically by having heavier breakfasts and such . 
  wow , i had never thought we were scammed also on this ( not that i blame sellers though ) . 
  spain : * men\u00fa del d\u00eda * consisting on 1st dish , 2nd dish , drink , dessert and coffee , 10 $ ( on average ) . 
  depending on the region , you can find something similar for 7-8 $ . 
  if it 's edible ( which usually is in galicia ) is another matter . 
  since i was working for several months in panama , i will leave it here : 8-10 $ for a single dish , drink and coffee . 
  cheaper if you do n't have prejudices and consider take away from street sellers or similar . 
  if you have a problem with eating rice & lentils 24/7 , do n't even consider this country . 
  thanks . 
  any explanation on why these two indicators are now so similar ? 
  it was n't long time ago the difference was much higher . 
  a 1.4 % drop ( unseasoned ) in just 3 months seems hard to believe to be honest , even if it is the epa . 
  i 'm still trying to figure out if this is registered unemployment or a poll ( i think it 's the former ) . 
  there 's about 1 million people of difference between both . 
  but you just wait , we have elections in december ( and we had local ones on \u00bf march ? 
  ) , so government spending has driven the whole year . 
  and we already know we 'll have to cut at least 10b $ on 2016 due to the government failing to reach the deficit goals . 
  i 'll be the one who thanks you for the porn . 
   but do n't companies * already * prefer people younger than 30 because they work for less ? 
  you have already answered your own question . 
  we have this in spain and it only creates a distortion on the labour market : it puts labour cost way before experience ( low youth salary + tax deduction = 30-50 % salary of an experienced worker ) . 
  under those conditions most employers opt to rotate graduates so they can renew the subsidy . 
  it 's an undercover way to cut down salaries , since those 30 + that are unemployed are now less attractive to employers , so they end up accepting lower salaries . 
  and if you think it at least help those young workers that qualify for this type of contract , just look at our ( spain ) youth unemployment rate : it 's over 50 % . 
  it does not work because most of the time companies need experienced people . 
  tl ; dr : lowering taxes just on certain age 's brackets create harmful distortions on the labour market , and do not help at all to reduce unemployment compared to overall lower corporate taxes . 
  say what you want , but i am saving this thread because reasons . 
  wow , we are so similar !, 
  cash bonuses wo n't work , family conciliation and labour protection does .

  what can change this ? 
  besides regulation at the short term , over the long term having more money spent in a market sector could make the calculus change and trigger a turf war to start . 
  local companies can also enter with a different set of financial constraints that allow them more freedom to compete . 
  and so on . 
  but sadly , entering a market is quite hard in many cases . 
  lets say that you noticed that nutella in your country is bad . 
  if you 're a professional confectioner in bulgaria great , but bulgaria is small ( ish ) so there are n't as many professional confectioners able to start a product line as compared to france or germany . 
  even if you are one , having the ability to lead , the knowhow to go through the product design and marketing phases and the company startup process is a big challenge . 
  and if you somehow make it through all these hurdles , you still have far more at risk than the large companies so competing with them will be difficult , especially since you as a bulgarian entering a completely new market with no other bulgarian companies involved will present a slew of challenges in its own right . 
  and so in small ( ish ) , poor ( ish ) countries of the east , competition can be hard to foster . 
  and acting as if it were easy will not result in positive change happening for consumers so much as treating the market as hard to penetrate and requiring `` help '' along the way . 
  but all of this is a sidenote . 
  my main concern was simply that customers should not be impaired from knowing what they are buying by being subjected to identical labelling on different quality products without any sort of qualifiers . 
  most especially within a single market . 
  my main point is that consumers can not know without doing market research that they are not buying the same product they expect to buy , as the branding and labelling hide that from them . 
  they might know a product through experiences in a different country and wish to buy that product , but can be deluded into buying a different product because the manufacturer puts the same label on it . 
  as for your remark : sometimes there are options . 
  sometimes manufacturers produce one variant and push that into a market forcefully by selling it as the only locally approved version ( this is the biggest problem and you see it especially clearly with digital products , but it exists in many , many other areas ) . 
  with nutella you have market impairment : nutella has created a version for some markets and pushes retailers to use this version . 
  thus competition is not easily possible . 
  for other things like detergents your point is a fair one . 
  yes , there are many detergent types and retailers can choose which to stock . 
  the same point about mislabelling still stands in this case . 
  in addition , in this case there is also market collusion , this time between retailers which know that they can charge a certain price for a certain level of product and know that consumers will have no choice but to buy such a product because all the other retailers will stock similar products knowing how much they can charge for it . 
  a smart consumer could buy product accross the border . 
  a nice retailer could buy the superior product and hope that his customers will realize the difference in product quality . 
  but if a customer buys ` tide ' detergent in one store that sells the superior product , likes it , and then sees the same ` tide ' detergent label on a cheaper package in a different store , he will prefer to buy from the cheaper store as he expects to be purchasing the same product given that it has the same label . 
  and he would be deceived . 
  meanwhile , the nice retailer will be out of a customer because his customer thinks he has found a better cheaper retailer elsewhere and will likely not know that he has actually not bought the same product . 
  free markets are great and truly fair , balance , and appropriately regulated markets are the best economic system we have . 
  but here we have breakdowns in fundemental properties of free markets that result in the benefits of free markets breaking down . 
  for free markets to work , parties need to be properly informed and have readily available access to information to allow them to make decisions in their best interest . 
  competitors must not have unfair advantages , and there need to be sufficient competitors for competition to even happen in the first place . 
  by protecting the core elements of free markets we can do a better job of ensuring that the benefits of such markets are available to everyone and that no country is unfairly affected due to a breakdown in free market structure . 
  i think you did n't really get my point , so let me elaborate on this fictitious scenario . 
  prentend that i 'm a bulgarian and that i visited france and liked the nutella there . 
  i want to buy it in my country . 
  i go to the store in my country ( not france ) and see nutella . 
  i buy it because i liked nutella . 
  but i am not actually buying real nutella . 
  unbeknownst to me , what i am buying is actually `` cheapo nutella '' , sold only in my country and nowhere else and hidden under the nutella label as if it were the same product . 
  that 's misleading customers , just as much as selling a `` hamburger '' that contains only horsemeat and rice filler is deceptive and selling `` wine '' that is actually grape juice with vodka added is deceptive . 
  it 's putting a label on a product that is not what customers expect to buy in order to sell a cheap unwanted product and to increase profits . 
  the uk has a major problem with restaurants offering customers certain fish and actually serving a different cheaper fish variety knowing that customers will not be able to reasonably do anything about the switch . 
  the same thing happens with extra virgin olive oil . 
  france in the past had an issue with such improper labels on certain wines . 
  it 's an issue of truth in labelling . 
  in addition to this , some products by their nature are not open to competition or can not effectively be competed against given an economy 's constraints . 
  how many chocolate + nut spreads do you expect to find in bulgaria ? 
  not many , and therefore if you want such a product you basically have a ` virtual ' monopoly within the country . 
  the chocolate + nut company could do whatever they want within reason and anyone who wants chocolate + nut products would have no choice in the matter besides simply having to go without any chocolate + nut product if the difference in quality got to be too bad . 
  let 's try another example : let 's say you want to buy a computer , but intel in your country only sells processors that run 70 % as fast despite using the same labels . 
  who are you going to turn to ? 
  amd does not provide sufficiently similar products in many categories , and they have n't the resources to equal intel in most . 
  who else is there for x86 ? 
  you 're stuck because there exists a ` local monopoly ' of sorts where your product category has essentially only one real option available and therefore there is not free and open competition . 
  it 's nice to say ` oh , just help there be more competition ' , but the barriers to entry into the x86 chipset market are just too high . 
  likewise , as sad as it sounds , it 's not really possible for local nutella-like companies of high quality to suddenly pop up in bulgaria all of a sudden to be able to compete properly with nutella . 
  it 's just not realistically possible . 
  what can you do ? 
  at least just regulate it so products sold under one label can not be switched for other products using an identical label without qualifiers , for starters . 
  ensure customers know that they are buying ` nutella bulgarica ' vs actual ` nutella original ' so that they can make informed decisions . 
  also demand quality standards where possible , and regulate the use of fillers and unwanted elements in products if appropriate . 
  lastly , open up the european maket further so that barriers to international trade and sales are not unduly hindered so that spaniards can buy portuguese towels without a hassle and germans can buy french wines without the barriers to trade that currently make that challenging ( language difficulties , tax issues , excessive shipping charges , etc. ), 
  i agree wholeheartedly . 
  we really need regulation to ensure that two things happen : treating brands and product names as product definitions to ensure that companies must not mislead customers by improperly labelling different products with the same label/brand/mark ( which would essentially be selling a false product to someone as they expected the `` real '' product ) . 
  and secondly , opening up the european market to ensure that eu citizens wherever they may be have fair access to the same goods and services provided to other eu citizens elsewhere . 
  what i mean by this second point is that it should not be possible to `` region lock '' their product to prohibit the sale of one version in a different country , whether forcefully or simply through contracts and market manipulation . 
  and the barriers to cross-country trade must be lowered to allow for the easier purchase of goods and services from other places . 
  capitalism is n't one company abusing their position as dominant in a certain market to exploit that market for profit . 
  it 's not hiding facts about your product or exploiting lies about it . 
  capitalism is having companies compete fairly in a truly `` free '' market ( not unregulated , but rather free as in balanced and fair ; open to competition and truly free for anyone to join in without unfair restrictions ) . 
  this is not any of that . 
  here , it 's simply companies abusing their good name in some countries to sell shoddy product elsewhere and use their market position to push inferior quality products to maximize their profits . 
  that 's not capitalism . 
  that 's not fair competition . 
  that 's abuse of power to cheat the poor and disadvantaged . 
  that 's greed , deceit , and abuse . 
  an example : back when monopolies were a major threat to various world economies and could simply squash competition , that was likewise not capitalism . 
  was it private ownership of enterprise and the means of production ? 
  yes . 
  was it companies acting to maximize their profits and to act without unfair government regulation ? 
  yes . 
  was there free and open competition ? 
  not a chance . 
  thus a situation where you have a monopoly might have some of the hallmarks of capitalism , but if you miss a big one like `` free and open competition '' then it 's not really capitalism . 
  just some bastardization . 
  here , it 's not a free market either . 
  it 's simply companies abusing their position to put their label that promises a certain degree of quality and identity to their products , and use that label disingenuously to mislead customers into believing that they are buying something that they are not actually buying . 
  here customers do not have complete information and can not make informed purchases between options in a proper manner . 
  therefore , this is not some method of fair capitalism taking place but rather an abuse of power within what should be a capitalistic system but which is bastardized for profit , just as the market was abused and capitalism bastardized when monopolies abuse their power . 
  it 's not capitalism . 
  it is , like i said , companies taking advantage of their position and a lack of proper regulation to ensure the freeness and fairness of the market for their own gain . 
  it 's exploiting weaknesses in the system in an unfair way . 
  imagine this : i really want to buy nutella that i liked in france . 
  nutella only sells inferior product in my country . 
  what am i to do ? 
  forego my desire for nutella ? 
  have a local company blatantly steal their recipe and make an exact copy ? 
  there are no options where i can buy a proper quality product that i desire .

  have my downvote .

my faith xd, 
  love this post . 
  really interesting information . 
  lol, 
  yes , my parents are from galicia . 
  for me i would say the most important reason is self-governance , but i give a significant importance to cultural issues too ( historical not so much ) . 
  i believe that a good and modern culture is key to perform well economically ( and give people a good quality of life ) . 
  and i think catalonia , being an small and independent country will have more tools and `` space '' to improve socially and economically . 
  in fact , 60 % of catalans have family roots belonging to other cultures and parts of the world . 
  which is pretty huge % . 
  yeah , probably is not the strongest one . 
  i would say cultural and historical reasons are more important for `` typical '' pro-independence supporters ( mainly left-wing supporters ) . 
  and for `` new '' pro-independence supporters ( center and right-wing ) economy and self-government ( own political institution and international status ) plays a bigger role . 
  for the same reason you mention , if it 's co-official new comers will not make an effort to learn catalan ( because they can live using just castilian/spanish , and they just ignore catalan ) . 
  the use of catalan is decreasing year after year . 
  [ here ] ( http://www.idescat.cat/economia/inec?tc=3&amp;id=da01&amp;dt=201300&amp;x=15&amp;y=10&amp;lang=en ) you can see how the habitual use of catalan has gone from 46 % in 2003 to 36 % in 2013 . 
  numbers are pretty ugly , reducing the use of catalan by 1 % every year . 
  yes , spain is better than france in terms of centralism . 
  however , being part of spain is not enough to save the language and the culture . 
  also there is no political or economical space ( 0 agreements and debate ) . 
  the push for independence is not random . 
  there are different reasons , and the linguistic situation is one of many . 
  i guess definitions vary across the world , for me : nationalism , is about ideas , develop your thinking according to a concrete social product ( language , gastronomy ... ) . 
  patriotism , is about facts , to be a patriot you must do something to defend your ideas . 
  pay taxes , do social work for the community , resist an occupancy ... 
  this way , you can call yourself a nationalist , but not a patriot , to be a patriot you have to show it . 
  i just do n't want the spanish state to destroy the language i love ( which is not even the language in which i speak to my family because my parents were spanish immigrants ) . 
  catalan is a beautiful language , endangered by the supremacy of castilian ( aka spanish ) and deserves to be preserved . 
  and the only way to make it possible is through independence . 
  the same way as we try to avoid the extinction of species , to keep biological diversity , i believe in avoiding the extinction of cultures , to keep cultural diversity . 
  i guess that makes me nationalist , but always based in liberty , social progress and science . 
  in catalonia there are areas with millions of immigrants which are non-catalans-speakers ( 2.6 millions ) where you rarely listen to catalan language . 
  because of this , a big part of the new born generations do n't use catalan at all , abandoning catalan , and using spanish only . 
  then ( i guess is something similar ) , being dutch-born does n't mean dutch culture . 
  culture is not a paper , is something you have to cultivate . 
  seems extremely close to the surface and to land . 
  according to [ world bank data ] ( http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/sp.dyn.tfrt.in?order=wbapi_data_value_2014+wbapi_data_value+wbapi_data_value-last&amp;sort=asc ) finland still has 1.8 births per woman . 
  in south europe things are even worst : italy 1.4 , portugal 1.2 , spain 1.3 , greece 1.3 [ catalonia ] ( http://www.idescat.cat/economia/inec?tc=3&amp;id=d102&amp;lang=en ) also 1.3 . 
  finally spain seems to beat germany at something lol, 
  to be fair , when you are a low skilled immigrant is never easy to find a regular job , normally you go from temporary job to temporary job . 
  ok , still got time to be under average .

  / thread, 
  people tend to say catalans are [ penny-pinchers ] ( http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/penny-pincher ) . 
  it 's half true , of course not every catalan is , but it 's true in my case , saving as much money as you can and being very thoughtful with how you spend it is essential in life . 
  lol, 
  according eurostat , in 2060 spain will have 46 millions . 
  and according to the spanish statistical office , spain will have 40 millions by 2062 . 
  you can not trust long term demographic projections , big part of its methodologhy is guessing the future . 
  right now these are the numbers of spain ( aprox ) : < 16 years = 7.5 millions 16  & < 64 = 29.9 millions .  64 years = 8.6 millions total population = 46 millions from that 29.9 , 17 millions are working ( 57 % of 29.9 ) , with an `` unemployment '' of 43 % . 
  i do n't think robots should scare spain and southern europe more than the present situation xd . 
  i give some credit till 2030 - 2040 , far from that , projections are not very likely imo, 
   spain will be in deep trouble with milions of people unemployed . 
  more !!, 
   do you really think that diversity dies by unification of governments ? 
  yes , thats the very first beginning . 
  to be honest , from a country perspective , the answer to that question is not up to us , it 's on eu members and eu bureaucrats , they are the ones who decide . 
  anyway , there are catalans supporting the fact of leaving the eu , and establishing instead agreements with the eu just like switzerland , norway or iceland does . 
  personally i do n't like the direction the eu is taking , but i would n't mind to keep being part of it , because europe is our natural context . 
  but if leaving the eu is part of the price , personally i would n't care and i would still vote for independence . 
  in the sense of citizenship , all catalans now have the spanish citizenship , and according to the spanish constitution , citizenship can not be lost unless citizens individually and explicitly renounce to it . 
  of course if we become an independent state spain might be able to make some changes to avoid that , but i 'm not sure about how realistic is that . 
  these arguments were one of the most discussed in the last rally elections ( september 27th ,2015 ) , and neither the first one ( country level ) or the second one ( citizenship ) can happen if spain does not recognize catalonia as an independent state , which would be a good news for us since there position is not accepting independence no matter what happens or what the results are . 
  at the end , these kinds of things are what independence is all about , self-government to make decisions , and responsibility to assume the consequences, 
  for their history and beauty the balkans are one of my favourite parts of europe . 
  i really do hope some day bosnia can solve some way all the complexities they have in their territory . 
  in my case bosnia is absolutely welcome ( and the rest of the balkans ) . 
  you also have some weird history with iceland and basque whalers xd . 
  andorrans are pretty happy the way they are , do n't think they want any kind of change , even in a million years xd . 
  some relatively small sectors of spain , but with significant influence in politics , that promote catalanophobia and hate to everything which is catalan just because . 
  here an example of 2014 : [ here ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u9wzk8isgmi&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=3m9s ) context : in the major festivity of valencia thousands of people were insulting people from compromis ( a political party of valencia which defend catalan language and close to the catalan culture ) , by calling them fucking catalans , assasins , sons of bitch , traitors ... 
  mmm ... , we 're talking about nations , not states . 
  i would say andorra is part of the catalan nation . 
  different thing is that they have their own state which is great ( lucky bastards xd ) , but i feel as we 're the same nation , and many andorrans too . 
  sure : basque country , spain and occitania . 
  there are certain people dreaming about some united states of europe , which in my opinion is absolutely unnatural , that idea has nothing to do with europe , we are culturally much more complex and actually that 's awesome . 
  we must create our own solution taking into account what we are all together . 
  i believe in free movement of people , goods , capital and labor , that 's essential . 
  and we have to standardize too some things to keep it simple for people ( telecommunications , transport , some documents , some databases as security ... ) . 
  also , we must reinforce strong bilingual 's ( and trilingual 's ) societies ( your language + lingua franca - i 'm assuming english here - ) . 
  but it 's extremely important to respect the language and culture of each territory , i.e. , if i want to go to finland i can not expect to live just with english ( even if i could because of the job ) , i ( we ) should make an effort to learn finnish to be part of their nation and show them respect . 
  that 's tough but it 's the right thing , let 's hope technology can help us in this one xd . 
  and about the fiscal union and the euro , i do n't know , i 've never liked the idea of one currency/one state , however now it 's hard to get out of it . 
  but i do n't think having a lot of currencies is a problem , the exchange is done by computers in seconds so 0 problems . 
  actually i think is the best fit for europe , we have to reconsider this idea for the future . 
  and about fiscal union , well , i 'm trying to escape from spain to have self-government , so you can imagine my opinion about it xd . 
  i really think is a bad idea ( euro sort of ) , i mean , we have to cooperate to compete between us , and for that we must keep freedom in terms of fiscal and monetary policies . 
  europe is very special and unique , so our solution should be special and unique too :d . 
  all right , here we go france , luckily it 's closer to catalonia , i will take a bus or something . 
  yep , that 's right , but in the south this phenomenon is especially accentuated . 
  the pyramid of uk or sweden is way better than the italian or the portuguese . 
  the south has the same situation in general ( portugal , greece ... ) , and i would say that the population pyramid from the current [ spanish state ] ( http://populationpyramid.net/spain/2016/ ) is even worst than the italian . 
  ca n't argue with that , seems accurate . 
  in my case : breakfast : 7:30 am lunch : 13:00 pm dinner : 21:30 pm, 
  i agree . 
  the thing is governments do n't have enough money to change such pattern , maybe in a communist system , but not in the present europe . 
  is something we have to go through until the demographic structure is restored at their new equilibrium ( with families having 1 to 3 children and not 4,5,6 ... ) .

  specially since , not to put too fine a point about it , communism has views about religion and god . 
  listen , pal , we are still waiting for an explanation of the whole suebi , vandal and visigoth thing in 411 . 
  what ? 
  we invited them to eurovision , what more could anyone want ???? 
  i 'm from leon , near galicia 's border , and we could see the galician tv before we moved to the tdt system . 
  while i never actually learned to speak the language , i literally grew up watching cartoons in galician ( they had dragon ball * years * before national tv did ) , so i understand it pretty well . 
  galician and portuguese are quite similar . 
  the worst part with italian is that you could actually understand the gist of it , if the damned italians did not speak so fast . 
  portuguese is much easier . 
   which also means that they can , and should be investigated as to whether they commited any crime of war and , if found guilty , sentenced for it . 
  yes , i agree . 
  i 'm not saying they should be jailed , but they left the nation to kill people . 
  the cops can not simply take their word for it , they must investigate , and , hopefully , find then to be on the clear . 
  not only the euro . 
  for thirty years spain has received billions from the eu ( and the cee before ) . 
  we have build motorways , hospitals , universities , brought our agrarian sector into the 20th century , and many , many more . 
  we have grown from a developing nation to a fully first world one . 
  losing your money hurts , but the truth is that now it 's out turn to pay our share to poland and romania and slovenia and so on . 
  because , even with the worst economic crisis in generations , we can afford it even if it 's not as much as we could have five years ago . 
  greece has been in the union longer than us . 
  by now , they should not be getting aid from eastern europe , they should be giving it , so in 20 or 30 years those nations are developed enough than the can complain about having to pay money to the eu . 
  private banks that had lent billions to the greek government , billions that were spent somewhere in greece . 
  the bailout was to pay loans debt . 
  you get loans debt by asking for loans and spending the money . 
  an , let 's not forget , the army and police are only allowed to kill in very specific situations . 
  why does people always make this false equivalence ? 
  joining the army - or , for that matter , moving abroad and joining your new nation 's army , like many immigrants do here in spain - is a completely different affair that killing people just because you feel like it . 
  they may argue that they joined an army , but they did not join either the syrian or iraki armed forces . 
  none of the other anti-isis militias belong to nations recognized by the spanish government , so that is something that their defence will need to argue to the tribunals and convince the judge . 
  they may even accept the explanation , but that is a matter for the tribunals to decide . 
  isis is a real danger and i will honestly say that i do n't mind if they are killed . 
  but it is a dangerous line to walk . 
  killing armed isis soldiers is perfectly legitimate . 
  what about their logistics people , who organize the weapon depots , transport amno , and such ? 
  most people agree that all those are legitimate targets . 
  what about plain clothes spies ? 
  killing those is not only legitimate , international law actually allows for summary execution in wartime . 
  and once we have accepter those last two targets , what 's the difference between logistics officers and spies in damascus and those in madrid ? 
  do we allow citizens to enter a house or radical mosque where they know a isis cell is working and kill them ? 
  being a comedian is a job , not a lifestyle . 
  you can make your living with humour , and remain serious when off the clock in serious matters . 
  specially if you leave your comedian job , and start a new career in a truly important affair like , say , deciding the future of your whole nation . 
  i probably will be in the minority for saying this , but killing people in spain is illegal . 
  it is illegal even if you do it abroad to `` filthy foreigners '' that do n't like europeans . 
  yes , but then we look a bit silly when we complain about then . 
  picking the proper word is half the fun ... 
  if the eu was named the evil union , complete with black leather uniforms , death rays over historical monuments , and secret underground lairs in brussels were the dread council meets , i think i honestly would like our union more . 
  a lot more . 
  classical supervillains are a zillion times cooler than nameless bureaucrats . 
  of course , if we did we would need to expel the uk , because if the mi6 can not fight us , then the enemy will have to be the cia , and that will not do . 
  if only each nation had one of those every couple generations , the world would be a wonderful place by now . 
  let \u00a1 s all hope , one day . 
  yes . 
  but even if you are the more far sighted president who ever presidented , you can not apply those wonderful policies if you lost the elections . 
   has to be ratified by all 18 parliaments ... not only the 4 as before that is the most glaring omission the greek politicians have made - the other countries also have electorates , too , and european politicians will always , always think on the people who can actually vote for them ( or , more to the point , vote to the , * gasp * , opposition leader ) first , and how liked they are abroad a far second . 
  it is an obvious conclusion . 
  london is one of the - i would honestly say * the * - most important financial capital of the world . 
  of course that would include money laundering . 
  bah , potato poteto or whatever way the english write this proverb . 
  sombrero-wearing straw donkeys are awesome , the only way you can improve them is with a couple of flamenco dancer figurines in the ickle saddlebags . 
  it literally means `` i fear the danaans even when they bear gifts '' , danaans being the homeric name for greeks of the achaean peninsula ( opposed , i imagine , to greeks from the islands , anatolia , or southern italy ), 
  it 's our fault , i 'm afraid . 
  if we had conquered them properly back in the empire they would be cooking in oil like civilized beings . 
  wait , now than i think on it , greece and spain are conquered provinces , so the fault is * italy * 's , not ours . 
  they even have ski resorts in * morocco * . 
  yes , the mediterranean is warm , but not the tropics . 
   canaanite abraham was from ur in southern irak . 
  canaan was in the gaza/israel/lebanese coast . 
  there are roughly 700 miles of mostly desertic land between those two civilizations , which is not something bronze age tourists travelled often . 
   i expect we need to more than those central european ones who can afford to sneer at it !, 
  we should drop those central europeans in , say , cordoba ( such a lovely day , yesterday , with 42\u00ba centigrades ) with no air conditioning ... 
  do n't worry , you only have land border with one nation , we will not partition you with a second enemy ~ ~ when ~ ~ in the highly unlikely possibility we would ever invade you guys, 
  it shows he is american . 
  when in doubt between pissing off the french and literally anything else , any proper european will pick pissing off the french . 
  really stupid , guys . 
  you send a singer - or , i dunno , some busty model , whatever - and then use the warlocks to curse the opposition and rig the votes . 
  the main problem if an invasion of the uk is logistics : if you miscalculate your supply lines , you may be forced to eat english food . 
  so invading israel is probably the better option . 
   it 's just that companies like mcdonalds offer absolutely 0 benefit to a community , yes , it 's not as if all those workers get a salary they spend in the community or anything . 
  sounds like a perfectly reasonable foreign policy to me . 
   would draw resources from cantonal and national sources . 
  what resources ? 
  exactly ? 
  strangely , in these sweeping proposals they never seem specify these mysterious `` sources '' or explain why if all that new money is just out there laying around it has n't been already used up in building two new hospitals . 
  and i am sure 100 % of podemos members wanted an absolute majority win , like all other parties . 
  but they did not get it . 
  a solely left-wing coalition is impossible , so they can choose between trying to negotiate with some of those nasty right-wing parties , or a new election . 
   if i 'm getting blocked off by a site for using them , i wont visit it anymore . 
  they really , really overestimate how much people wants to see their sites . 
  it 's not only excessive pop up ads : if a site gives me even a slight inconvenience , i will not return . 
  i have literal millions of sites to pick and choose . 
  what the hell do you mean there is not third option ? 
  switzerland is a democracy , it does not forbid emigration to its habitants . 
  if they can not stand swiss culture , the family can try to emigrate * anywhere * in the world . 
  it 's not sending back . 
  if a new zealander hates his life in japan , but does not want to return to new zealand , he is perfectly free to try to emigrate to spain . 
  no one is forcing them to stay in japan or be deported . 
  i 'm not asking to `` deport '' them . 
  i am telling them that they have plenty of nations where they will be more confortable in their cultural and religious beliefs than europe , so they can move there if our perversions are so intolerable . 
  if they prefer europe , they must obey its laws .

  i do n't want to see it , i just find it weird that people are able to do so . 
  damn , it 's going to be a bitch to replace those lightbulbs . 
  holy shit you were n't lying , that room is a thing of beauty ( picture one ) . 
  i know is a joke , but what references to god are there in the lyrics ? 
  goddammit , we need to rebuild the tercios . 
  in some situations , sure ; but in this context i think it was worrying . 
  i 'm afraid he 's pandering to the low cultured average joe that have lost jobs in industrial areas to outsourcing ; but every single economist and the ( sigh ) former president are warning constantly that all those jobs are already doomed by automation anyway ; trying to hold on to them could be an economic disaster in the mid to long term . 
  plus from an international perspective i 'm worried thinking about coal ; the environment does n't look like a priority in `` america first '' policies . 
  time will tell ... 
  yet there was . 
  `` america first '' , he said a thousand times . 
  aka `` if i can give people work by subsidizing coal we 'll have tremendous fumes , folks '' . 
  you did n't worry about the mentions to offshore works and abandoned factories ? 
  if i were american i 'd be worried about the potential attempts to intervene in the economy and ignore globalization . 
   his speech could n't have been more worrying ... oh , it definitely could . 
  remember he 's nonchalantly dropped threats to free press and imprisonment of political opponents during the campaign . 
  for a president , it was worrisome ; for trump is was tame . 
  i tried searching in spanish and english media but there 's no mention of it that i could find , just `` fraud with the use of electronic means '' . 
  when things do n't go well people support change . 
  does n't matter * what * change . 
  we 're still trying to figure out if this is all a viral campaign to promote house of cards ... 
  i would do it once , just to get an intuitive idea of the size of the world . 
  planes sort of feel like teleportation chambers , you hop in and after some time you 're at your destination . 
  you do n't get any idea of the distance you traveled and the places you passed through ( or over ) . 
  plus ... there are trains , and [ trains . 
  ] ( https://api.venuelust.com/images/2015/11/grand-hiberian-luxury-train-ireland-honeymoon-belmond.jpg/?source_path=%2f%2fvenuelust.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f ), 
  can we have some context ? 
  i did n't know the man or his shows but it sounds interesting . 
  i think the irregularity of the blocks and floor , as well as the size , are partly meant to give the vibe of a presence looming over you . 
  however it is true that the structure invites to play with it , and even more in the context of tourists passing a holiday . 
  the second thing my tour guide ( shotout to freetours ) said in berlin was not to do this very thing . 
  just after `` cyclists are n't a joke here , they 'll fuck you up if you get in the way '' . 
  as a spaniard , i realize that we have goals to meet but i do n't know what more could be asked of us . 
  in the name of austerity , now if i am ever subjected to illegal treatment , i have to pay for the justice to consider my case . 
  i went to a public hospital some time ago to check a mole that started hurting and increasing in shape and they gave me an appointment for november 2017 due to lack of resources . 
  hundreds of students drop out because of increasing costs of university . 
  how much more are we supposed to reduce public spenditure ? 
  and at what cost ? 
  the economy is recovering , but we still need some space to breathe . 
  otherwise short term budget balance will lead us down a very dark path in the medium to long term . 
   under facebook 's fact-checking system , stories reported as fake by users will be sent to correctiv , a nonprofit news organization based in berlin . 
  if an item is deemed false , it will be marked as `` disputed , '' along with a justification for the label , and the site will warn users before they share it . 
  it 's not depending on source but on the text itself . 
  god no , then we 'd run out of money just by printing a vessel 's name on the side . 
  looking at his wikipedia page ...  in 2007 , his father 's company , kushner companies , made the most expensive single-building property purchase in us history , acquiring 666 fifth avenue . 
  i mean , i 'm starting to notice some signals here . 
  yup . 
  there was a running joke that you should be careful of fishing by never putting your personal data in sites marked as safe , as those could n't possibly have been made by public servants . 
  [ here 's one ! ] ( https://www.murcia.es/ ) . 
  a regional one , but still . 
  i know it sounds petty , but i am fucking jealous that their government was able to come up with such a website . 
  ours usually are even flagged by google because they do n't comply with security certificates :( edit : [ here 's one !, 
  that 's been a trend for some time now . 
  i ca n't tell him apart from the parodies . 
   `` it 's obsolete , first because it was designed many , many years ago , '' if he thinks nato is too old , the reporter should have asked him if he thinks the same of the second amendment , for example . 
  or their whole constitution since we 're at it . 
   jared kushner , trump 's son-in-law , is a natural talent who will bring about an accord with israel hoooly shit . 
  yep . 
  the full story is a little more convoluted : the potential coalition of psoe + podemos upset them not only because they do n't like podemos , but because it would imply reaching an agreement with regional parties ; that is to say , the issue of catalonia would come into play . 
  the establishment would n't want to touch that issue because they consider the unity of spain to be non-negotiable . 
  #spain : we just had quite a plot twist in our current political scene !, 
  ** patxi lopez announced he 'll run for the psoe primaries . 
  ** drama fans , let me add some context : psoe ( the main left wing party ) used to be run by pedro sanchez , from the base militants/popular wing of the party . 
  some months ago , sanchez was in talks to form a left wing government in coalition with podemos and regional parties ; this possibility upset the establishment wing of his party , who used a mass resignation to force sanchez out . 
  the move left the psoe headless - and unable to negotiate a coalition government . 
  thus , the only option left was to consent to a right wing government . 
  since psoe had campaigned * specifically asking people to help them take the right down * , their implicit support to the right was regarded as straight betrayal by many voters . 
  in a few months the psoe , which is still headless , will hold their primaries to see who becomes the new leader of the party . 
  susana diaz , head of the establishment wing and author of the plot that took sanchez down , was expected to run . 
  people expected sanchez to announce his candidacy and fight to take the party back . 
  but now , patxi lopez is running . 
  he is from the same wing of the party as sanchez , albeit more moderate ; so now if sanchez were to run he would split his wing , almost certainly giving his contenders the victory . 
  the move is so convenient to the establishment ( it 's practically a backstabbing of sanchez by his own wing ) that some people wonder if there is something fishy going on . 
  time will tell what happens , but for now the psoe 's reputation is hitting rock bottom due to such internal drama , to the point that podemos will probably overtake them as the reference left wing party in the country . 
  it is not the eu ( or the uk ) 's fault to mention deportation . 
  foreigners are allowed to stay because of being part of the eu , if they are n't anymore you need to fill the legal void with something . 
  it 's not that hard to grasp , if a deal is broken a new one has to be put in place and all the parts need to be discussed . 
  the title is clearly misleading . 
  the spanish royal family does n't provide anything , among other things because they have nothing to provide . 
  they just act as negotiators/ambassators because the saudis like dealing with a royal family more than doing so with an elected leader . 
  the deal is closed with the state . 
  i 'm still against the deal , mind you . 
  but it has nothing to do with the royal family . 
  i did n't even hear about the original news . 
  well , obviously you ca n't propose freedom of movement only for your citizens and not for the others , and expect the others to agree . 
   it 's pretty overcrowded and without freedom of movement it was only going to get worse . 
  but you already had freedom of movement . 
  that 's what guys * did n't want to have * ( ? ), 
  for that to be effective we would need more people in our institutions that understood tech . 
  maybe a europe-wide association dedicated to explain technological matters ? 
  knowing the eu , there is probably a great one hidden in a bureaucratic corner and no one knows about it . 
   thereby eventually getting over 100 % . 
  surely just * reaching * 100 % ? 
  otherwise you would reach a point where increasing your salary decreases what you take home , and you could even end up having a negative salary . 
  i 'm going to guess he is against `` normalizing homosexuality '' , which is somewhat reasonable if you happen to consider homosexuality an illness or vicious behaviour ... 
  which is a silly starting point to begin with , but if you start there then not wanting equal rights is consistent . 
   i just delete my accounts frequently and create new ones because i think it is better for my privacy . 
  unrelated to the conversation , but you can use a script to edit/remove all your comments from time to time . 
  it 's better than creating a new account because that way you do n't run the risk of being caught in automoderator measures that target new accounts and things like that . 
  not bad !,

  catalonia is not spain , it 's the very essence of spain , condensed , and unsuccessfully trying to spread to the rest of the country . 
  it would make more sense though that catalonia is * very * catalan and its `` essence '' has spread a bit toward the rest of the state . 
  after all , we 're where much of the wealth has always started be it beacause of our trading empires , heavy industrialitzation or successful tourism ( those japanese yens !, 
  ) , tactics which have been then more or less succesfully imitated among the rest of the comunidades . 
  i do n't know how to respond to that . 
  i mean , there 's hiperspaniards , we call them `` fachas '' sure , but apart from that ? 
  nope, 
  not directly though . 
  many terrorist organizations in the west did get indirect help from the soviets , but rarely direct, 
  never said that we do n't have some things in common :p, 
   i certainly think barcelona will be pleased with madrid sticking its head above the parapet here , in the hope madrid gets one right between the eyes . 
  what in the fuck . 
  we like to joke about nucking madrid ... * but never seriously * . 
  we do n't hate spaniards , we hate their government, 
  and spain ( eta ), 
  also eta , which is a big chunk of that graphic as far as i know did n't get help from the soviets, 
  but when we 'll say gr\u00e0cies ? 
  :( i guess * thank you * works aswell, 
  that 's beacause it is , investment has grown [ more than ever in 2015 ] ( https://translate.google.cat/translate?sl=es&amp;tl=en&amp;js=y&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=ca&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fwww.lavanguardia.com%2feconomia%2f20150921%2f54435397495%2fla-inversion-extranjera-y-las-exportaciones-se-disparan-en-catalunya.html&amp;edit-text=&amp;act=url ), 
  it 's the 16th most spoken language in europe , with more speakers than finnish , danish , etc. 
  ( which are on the list ) !, 
  we 've got over 11m speakers so we do kind of represent a chunck of europe 's diversity . 
  and what about it ? 
  we do n't hate spain , we just want our own country . 
  after all , the biggest independentist coalition is called `` togheter for the yes '', 
  catalan : * units en la diversitat !, 
  it 's not really clear yet . 
  maybe romeva, 
  in order to secure the transition to the catalan state , which is what all of this is about, 
  it was expected . 
  in order to gain the thrust of the cup ( the other independentist party ) and have an absolute majority of independentists in our parliment , * he must not * be president . 
  we ca n't rely on one person who comes from the most corrupt party in catalonia to push through all of this , the independence is made * with everyone for everyone * . 
  yep !, 
  they tried to make the dumb kids * like * to read appealing to them with that . 
  the result ? 
  the two or three who liked reading made us despise it for a while ( or ignore those books and move on ) and the `` dumb '' ( or not so dumb ) just read the summary online, 
  i mean , it 's not like what they made us read was any good though . 
  living in the redbelt around barcelona ( hospitalet , santa coloma , sant adri\u00e0 ) where most of the people do n't even talk in catalan in their normal life means that you do n't read rodoreda , you read [ this crap ] ( http://www.edetiendas.com/imagenes/la-banda-de-la-placeta-11876.jpg ) . 
  so yeah , great , i did n't have to hate them since they did n't even make us try !, 
  yep !, 
  rodoreda is amazing , but quite complex . 
  it 's hard to grasp on a first read honestly . 
  ausias march welp ... he 's a bit of an older style . 
  and yeah , i * hated * every single book that they made us read on highschool and such . 
  thankfully i was able to differenciate them from what i read at home :p, 
  and camus and celine !, 
  french writers are really good !, 
  ( just to clarify , valencian and catalan are used interchangedly - valencian for valencians and catalan for the rest - , and yes , joanot martorell was one of the best writers in this language ) . 
  another great book in catalan , probably the best in modern literature is `` la pla\u00e7a del diamant '' , written by merc\u00e8 rodoreda . 
  dealing with the second spanish republic and the spanish civil war , the novel is set in barcelona before , during and after the war and pictures a young woman 's struggles in life as well as her conflictive relationships with two men , and her progression from nearly complete submission until she develops a full-fledged outlook in life , personal maturity and independence . 
  it is also a faithful chronicle of life in the city at the time . 
  [ the most badass spy in human history ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/joan_pujol_garcia ), 
  yeah , we think like that here too !, 
  any repressive action taken against our president ( he has been sent to court to answer for letting the people vote in a semireferendum that we did like you say in 2014 which could cost him his title ) or our nation only boosts our hopes and gives us legitimacy . 
  that 's why the spanish government is being relatibly cautious and only using legal and political setbacks for now . 
  beacause spain can suspend our autonomy and send the police/army . 
  they * do * have the tools, 
  we 're not talking about an udi , did you read the article ? 
  it 's a pacted seccession, 
  too much free time that i really do n't have :p, 
  talking about catsiquespot here, 
  we 've been doing this for 4 years already . 
  this `` 1 year more '' thing does n't work . 
  well , if you live under a rock that might seem true . 
  yes , and it was expected that they would oppose this one . 
  i read it , any dialogue without international mediation with spain does n't seem that realistic sadly . 
  we 're not talking about unilateral independence, 
  they voted against a particular plan of seccession , not independence in general, 
  false : catsiquespot ( the party that represents the non-aligned ) today changed their discourse from the elections and voted against it . 
  quite the breach of thrust, 
  even then catsiquespot did n't align , so i 'd say this is quite a breach of legitimacy toward their voters . 
  their electoral campaign explicitly was non-aligned . 
  what they do afterward is their own problem . 
  you do n't get to decide for how we organise our elections . 
  it goes as follows : 47,5 % of the votes were in favour of independence , 39 % against * and the rest choose not to participate in the independentist debate * . 
  that means that they willingly wanted * not to be counted either in favour our against * . 
  since this is n't a referendum you do n't get to count it as such . 
  so does that mean that 25 % of the populace get to decide for the 75 % ? 
  hell no, 
  you do n't get it . 
  an election is not a referendum , we won by a country mile . 
  and `` chaos and harm '' is just your opinion, 
  said rajoy 5 years ago ... 
  beacause it did n't go as you say . 
  47,5 % were in favour of independence , 39 % against it and the rest did n't align . 
  we wanted to organise a referendum but they did n't let us , so elections were the only option, 
  i saw it too over there !, 
  it 's crazy how big it has gotten , you only notice when traveling abroad ... 
  there 's a ton of them missing , literally all of the local brands in catalonia are n't there . 
  i mean , i just read on wikipedia that estrella damm ( our main brand here ) sells well in the us , but i could be wrong . 
  i think i saw it once in nyc but maybe it 's pretty niche ... 
  anyway yeah , it 's pretty us-centric sadly, 
  one thing 's for certain , i can tell for a fact that there 's a ton missing in barcelona and surrounding areas . 
  estrella damm , moritz and all of the local beer are missing . 
  the map is really well done though, 
  nope , it 's a different context . 
  the house of trast\u00e0mara was chosen to rule the kingdom of aragon mainly beacause they had ties to the house of barcelona and since the latter was dead well ... they could n't just revive someone you know ? 
  it was a continium . 
  nevertheless , when you look at how the institutions worked ( consulat de mar , only in catalan , with copies of the code book from 1494 ) and how the laws were written , it 's pretty obvious why the [ * king 's palace * ] ( http://i.imgur.com/f0yamnm.jpg ) was in barcelona . 
  and was descendant of the house of barcelona through the female line , as my article and comment says .

very good summary of the situation . 
  yes , but usually it 's 40 h/week . 
  also , shops open on saturday morning and may or may not close in sat evening . 
  having such numbers of seats in the parliament has helped them be the key party to elect presidents for years . 
  both pp and psoe would pact with ciu to govern , and ciu had been using that for years . 
  they have n't been powerless , in fact it 's been quite the opposite ( but ciu wanted money , talks of independence at this scale are fairly recent ) . 
  i do n't care if they leave as soon as it 's for good ( they still want the spanish citizenship and be able to vote , even if they get the independence ) . 
  i know plenty of people who 'd do this instead of having a couple of hours for lunch , but in many companies ( for some weird reason ) you have to stay until late at the office as if that 'd meant you 're working a lot , and having a long break contributes to leaving later . 
  you 're right . 
  shops open from 10-14 and then from 16:30 -20:30 more or less . 
  if they opened from 10 to 20:30 they 'd need additional personnel . 
  edit : source in case you need the data : http://elecciones.mir.es/resultadosgenerales2011/99cg/dcg99999to_l1.htm look at the votes of both iu and upyd and compare them to ciu, 
  do you know that catalan people have more representation in the parliament than other parties which received more votes ? 
  oh , sure , let 's erase aragon, 
  i really hope it wo n't happen , but catalan nationalists take it for granted . 
  but if you 've followed the debates they said they have the right because the constitution says so , even if they do n't care what the constitution says about the independence . 
  i really do n't mind if they go , but if they do they should go for good . 
  yes . 
  they 'd have the same rights any other spanish citizen living abroad, 
  i 'm all for them voting if they want the independence , but at this time it has become a joke : they recently said they want both nationalities . 
  this is one of the main points . 
  if a country implements it , how is it going to stop people from immigrating there just to get bi ? 
  i ask this because people i 've talked to are in favor of giving bi to every immigrant . 
  yep, 
  this . 
  columbus and cervantes are catalan now . 
  i really want them to go so they can stop insulting the rest of the country and feeling sorry for themselves . 
  oh , and having a huge weight in the parlament . 
  yes , madrid is full of farmland ( farm-asphalt ? ), 
  and empty ( but people are finishing their holidays soon ), 
  we have those too . 
  they 're called torreznos . 
  not only eu , i do n't know if it 's every legal immigrant or if the countries have some kind of agreement , but immigrants from outside the eu can vote . 
  i do n't know how it works in other countries , but immigrants can vote in some elections in spain . 
  nah , in spain is bigger : as you said many people do n't show up in the statistics , like long term unemployed people , people who are taking courses , etc. 
  not really . 
  they deleted a couple of contestants : blas de lezo and rocinante . 
  [ evidence ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/charles_ii_of_spain ), 
  thank you !, 
  heheh , it makes sense . 
  thank you !, 
  wonderful sounds less fun , but great either way . 
  sounds fun but what does it mean ? 
  are we a character from the princess bride ? 
  i 'd go with [ hot chocolate ] ( https://imgur.com/93xhm0l ) . 
  the kind we have with churros and it 's very thick . 
  usually found on chocolaterias ( though the touristy ones add to much milk ) . 
  edit : i love valor 's chocolate with almonds and suchard 's turron, 
  found the republican spaniard . 
  shops open at 10 , offices usually start at 8 . 
  there 's a huge overlap because you have very different schedules . 
  nobody needs an hour and a half to drink a coffee cup . 
  i 'm not sure if that 's fire or a street light , because you can see ( on the ops post ) a guy holding one flare on the bridge , with lots of smoke coming out from it . 
  if it 's fire , it 's a lot . 
  near . 
  [ here ] ( http://imgur.com/xyo5ewt ) you can see the bridge and the mosque . 
  we do n't call it like that , we call it political correctness and civilizations alliance . 
  and revered outside of spain . 
  i would n't say they are revered here . 
  yep . 
  no-one i know would say penelope cruz is a good actress . 
  they might agree javier bardem is a good actor , though i do n't think he 's respected ( there 're plenty of people who do n't like his political involvement ) . 
  for actresses : ana torrent , mercedes sampietro , amparo bar\u00f3 , blanca portillo ... 
  though i think only ampar\u00f3 bar\u00f3 is well known and respected . 
  yep . 
  the public one i use on my 50 km commute . 
  those are romanian gypsies . 
  exactly . 
  i can barely believe we have netflix now . 
  i 'm not discarding cultural relativism : our laws are the product of our culture and history , and some would be unthinkable 50 years ago ( gay marriage , for example ) . 
  morals have changed through the history of humanity many times and usually have been expressed ultimately through the law . 
  the thing is , these are the laws our citizens want and if someone wants to live here they have to accept them , the same way if i go to live in a foreign country i have to abide the local law . 
  we have the law which is a enforced arbitrary moral code the citizens have to abide , if they are here , they have to respect it . 
  exactly . 
  he 's going to lose the party whatever he does , so he 's trying to be president in the way . 
  my bet is that they already have an agreement ( psoe & podemos ) and they 're trying to make it look like this is a very difficult negotiation . 
  interesting . 
  thank you !, 
  only the women get drunk ? 
  i mean , is this a festival just for women ? 
  it 's the first on a pregnant woman , it seems . 
  ooh !, 
  so that 's where they went !, 
  iirc romans used the internal wars against us . 
  iu got 2 seats with 900k votes . 
  pnv got 6 seats with 300k . 
  the relevancy had nothing to do with the votes, 
  thank you !, 
  those pics are amazing . 
  what 's the source ? 
  and froilan shot himself in the foot . 
  literally : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/felipe_de_marichalar_y_borb%c3%b3n, 
  also , we do n't know if it was consensual . 
  what did the girl say ? 
  i 'm guessing she said it was consensual , too or he 'd have to go to jail . 
  bad article . 
  i saw it yesterday and it was huge . 
  not a lens trick . 
  you need to read a bit about wwii : snipers , pilots ... 
  they worked very well,

  the question is `` which kind of political entity should catalonia be with respect to spain ? '', 
  and there are 4 possible answers : independent state , federal state , autonomous community and region . 
  it 's not a binary question , as the use of a line type of plot may suggest . 
  you have the full results in [ this wiki article ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/catalan_independence ) . 
  and here i want to emphasize the effects of the estatut fiasco . 
  the crisis was fully visible already in 2009 , and the support for the status quo ( autonomous community ) kept stable . 
  it starts to go down in 2010 , in particular in the q2 of 2010 , which is exactly when the estatut judgment came out . 
  something similar happened to the `` federal state '' option . 
  many non-independentists in catalonia - including people who was not particularly nationalistic - saw the estatut judgment as an absolute disaster . 
  not because the estatut itself , but because it broke with the pact tradition with the central government . 
  man , when i am starting to feel a bit happier with spain i always find some mad stuff like this to spoil it . 
  blocking the issue of new visas is different from blocking the enter of visa holders and permanent residents ( who for most purposes are basically citizens ) from some countries . 
  i do n't have the data , but very probably less than the catalans . 
  the other region who would have similar numbers would be the basques . 
  so the world may become more like london ? 
  that 's not a problem in my book . 
   chasing a girl with amorous intent, 
  lol , i lived in denmark and now i live in the us . 
  this is absolutely not representative of dk . 
  on immigration at least , us is substantially softer than dk . 
  the main right-wing party in dk , the danish people 's party , makes trump sound like a foreign-loving hippie . 
  which were the risks ? 
  do you really think that before the start of the crisis spain had higher debt than the netherlands ? 
  is that what the media says there ? 
  [ of your interest . 
  ] ( http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-ksn_blxm8oa/us6trp7bvfi/aaaaaaaabck/ciq31txfv-s/s1600/government+debt+2015+vs+2007.png ), 
  the problem is that ... it depends how you build the `` cluster '' . 
  check the [ gdp per capita ( pps ) ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/economy_of_the_european_union ) ( which is a simple way to compare level of life ) . 
  for the 28 eu countries : - 11th . 
  france 30.300 $ - 12th . 
  italy 27.500 $ - 13th . 
  spain 26.200 $ - 18th . 
  portugal 22.300 $ - 22nd . 
  greece 20.300 $ i think you see my point ; right now it 's easier to put italy and spain in the same cluster as france than in the same cluster as greece . 
  it is sustainable . 
  or as unsustainable than half a dozen other developed countries , usa and france included . 
  is it ? 
  belgium and france have southern european levels of debt . 
  belgium has a higher debt to gdp ratio than some southern european countries . 
  that would still make them more similar to the scandinavians than to the italians . 
  actually even in germany there is regional variation : saxons would be clearly for the scandinavian side , while bavarians is a bit more troublesome . 
  but germans as a whole would be closer to the scandinavians . 
  i agree with you ( my french friends love when i say that they are the country that summarizes l'europe ) , but i still think that they are more similar to southern europe than to northern europe . 
  in the same way that germany is more similar to the scandinavians than to the italians . 
   if `` one of the more anti-eu nations '' means that we still have a majority of eu supporters i do n't think we have to worry that much . 
  do you ? 
  i 'm genuinely curious . 
  imagine that pvv is the most voted party in the next election ( very likely to happen ) . 
  do you think they will be able to get a nexit referendum ? 
  if so , what option would win ? 
  trump 's us is a threat for the eu , and not only because they will `` protect less '' . 
  it 's time for us to protect ourselves , that 's something i can agree with the magamob . 
  us may not be a military danger , but an intelligence/propagandistic one . 
  would you be surprised if the us starts helping anti-eu movements , \u00e0 la russe ? 
  with who do you think trump is going to be more friendly with , wilders or rutte ? 
  thanks !, 
  i find hard to believe that the british government is just letting go free money . 
  i mean , you could use the money to fund the nhs instead . 
  :d moreover , the distribution is very weird : with latvia , you do have a more `` logical '' situation ( you get over 20 times what latvia gets from you ) . 
  and why is that ? 
  do you have the numbers ? 
  still , the difference ( 4.6 to 301.4 ) is brutal , much more brutal than the difference in between migrant populations . 
  moreover , it makes more sense for a working person to register ( he needs to ) than for a pensioner . 
  i do n't think that this number is real . 
  and wait , it 's not brit-bashing : i have pretty good reasons to believe so . 
  the article says that there are around 300.000 brits in spain ; the number officially registered is pretty similar to that . 
  which is the problem ? 
  uk passes every year a pretty big sum of money to spain for covering health expenses using the european health card . 
  last year it was 301.40 millions of euros ( [ source ] ( http://www.elconfidencial.com/mundo/2016-10-14/reino-unido-theresa-may-rajoy-brexit-sanidad-jubilados_1274786/ ) ) . 
  and that number does not make sense in comparison ; there are 90k spaniards in uk , and spain only pays 4.60 millions , 65 times less . 
  moreover , if the brits would be registered as living in spain , they would be able to use the spanish health card . 
  what i mean is that it 's more or less assumed that many , many brits living in spain do n't officially live here . 
  i wholeheartedly agree . 
  if russians would care about the economy the way europeans do , putin would n't have survived the current crisis . 
  atm you guys are a bigger threat to us than the chinese , imo . 
  knowing spaniards , you may be more successful asking if we would fight * against * our country . 
  that 's how they did it in the spanish civil war , and it was a massive success . 
  i always thought that of the southern european countries , greeks were by far the most patriotic . 
  this kind of confirms it . 
  11 minutes presentation explaining what they do : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8dd5avxlcc . 
  essentially , they have a much more refined psychological model than your usual demographics . 
  they feed it with social data from facebook that includes geographical position . 
  with it , they can decide not only what position would be the most popular , but which kind of message ( more aggressive , more traditional ... ) to emit for each user or in each geographical location . 
  - barcelona 's unemployment : 6.98 % - santa coloma 's ( barcelona suburb ) unemployment : 37.14 % wow . 
   none of their data is stored on us servers . 
  eu data also needs to be stored in the eu . 
  i work for a us company in the us , and we have two data clusters , the eu one ( in frankfurt ) and the non-eu one ( in sacramento ) . 
  it 's shit for us , but it 's the law . 
  i did n't say that we are the only country that charges , do n't quote me in something i never said . 
   according [ this ] ( http://yaq.es/reportajes/cuanto-cuesta-estudiar-universidad ) , the yearly cost of uni in spain is in between 870 and 1320 euros ( in cat is more expensive , of course ) . 
  taking into account the difference in average salary , i would say that only uk is significantly more expensive . 
  with italy , portugal , netherlands and switzerland being more or less similar to us . 
  according the article , in austria , denmark , finland , germany , ireland , norway and sweden is for free . 
  in france is substantially cheaper ( 189 euros ) . 
  the only country in which the costs are substantially higher taking into account the salaries is uk . 
  according [ this other article ] ( https://www.studyineurope.eu/tuition-fees ) , in greece is also for free ; and in belgium substantially cheaper . 
  the article does not mention the countries in which you get paid . 
  i can confirm that this is the case in denmark - my wife got paid for getting her master - . 
  yes . 
  and spain is one of the few countries in we where people pays for getting educated .

  well ... 
  it 's not official ... but what about the tercios anthem ? 
  or that attempt to give the anthem a letter back in 2008 ? 
  ( yes i 'm avoiding to talk about the franco 's anthem , which was n't created by franco , btw ) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wamkb6qgyms - the tercios anthem , it 's not old at all , but it 's beautiful and epic . 
  i just hope you do the right thing ... 
  i 'm not saying reforming the estatut , but the constitution so that the estatut reform is n't `` ridiculized '' . 
  the psoe is offering a constitution reform , why not take the chance ? 
  i understand that your language is being oppressed , aswell as some other things ... 
  i think if the secession is at any moment about to happen , the pp/psoe/whatever party there is at that moment will offer whatever you want . 
  in that precise moment , i just hope the catalan people will stop and accept that opportunity before making a historical decission as such . 
  i still do n't know what you mean with the second part, 
  `` my major is not in that area '' `` is n't going about it the wrong way though ? '', 
  ( you can simply say that in catalonian ), 
  i do n't know what you mean, 
  well i can assure you they * are * scared of you becoming independent . 
  you can definitely play with that in your favor . 
  i meant spain itself . 
  it was founded on the union of two relatively weak kingdoms : castile and aragon . 
  those reconquered the whole peninsule and defeated the muslim invasor . 
  then , after the fall of granada , colon 's expedition was funded by the catholic monarchs and spain conquered america . 
  it was the first world power for three centuries . 
  what happened ? 
  well , i could write a whole thesis about it , but let 's just resume it : the english . 
  they created the black legend , encouraged the different viceroyalties to sepparate from spain , promote the unexistent hate and be weaker . 
  that 's why the usa is the first world power now . 
  they defeated the mexican empire , but they would have had no chance against the whole spanish empire . 
  yeah , that might sound antiquated and not relevant to the xxi century , but ... well , just look at any recent secession . 
  the ussr , yugoslavia , * the `` gran colombia '' * , occidental sahara ... 
  this is what happens when two countries divide , they think they can do better by themselves but the reality is that they just mess up things and become weaker . 
  no exception . 
  ( the usa is a special case , those were thirteen colonies together with the support of france , portugal and spain against the uk ) revolutions , however ... 
  nobody in the rest of spain ( except for some galicians and basques ) want that to happen . 
  we have seen the fall of a first world power because of separation , that just weakens us all and makes our life status be worse . 
  it 's better to change the things the good way . 
  their only option against the movement itself is to reform the constitution and the estatut . 
  the economy is a plus , but that 's the base for independentists . 
  because the generalitat ( government of catalonia ) is the one who `` counts '' the votes . 
  the result will be altered anyway . 
  just if the constitution was reformed . 
  and in that event , why not to change the things that make the catalonians feel oppressed instead of weakening us all ? 
  considering you are the cradle of hispanity , and all the people who died trying to build what we have now ... 
  this just ... makes me sad . 
  so sad . 
  why does n't it surprise me ? 
  gib back shit rectangle , rightful spanish clay, 
  why ? 
  i could n't find the pirate confederation 's paper :(, 
  he was making a statement , i made the opposite . 
  what 's the problem ? 
  [ fixed ] ( http://about:blank ) ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ jk, 
  why do you care so much about a tiny little village ? 
  how much of a hypocrite must you be to call me that ? 
  [ here you go , i hope i 'm not way too late ] ( http://i.imgur.com/wklgvhd.jpg ), 
  you wish, 
  you should n't link a video in the first place , maybe an article with sources and stuff . 
  i could link you to a paranoid alien conspiracy video , but not because of that you 'd believe it right ? 
  now i 'm not saying all of the info on the video is fake , but it 's more than obviously lacking objective points of view ... 
  i mean , you ca n't possibly be trying to deny the fact that it 's propaganda ... 
  that 's what they want , the only way to convince a majority of people to secede and the international opinion is to be martires , their self-victimism is the only thing that keeps them from being deported or in jail . 
  if they do n't stop them , there 's at least a chance a civil war will ocurr , in which case the army would have to occupy the region and they 'd get what they want . 
  there 's no easy way to stop this shit because sociology . 
   links to junts pel s\u00ed video ... 
  i 'm betting ciudadanos will win this campaign considering how things are going . 
  nah opposing the derogation of the gag law would take away all of their votes . 
  only if he needs it or wants to , it 's not really necessary . 
  that 's what i meant , he might kinda understand catalan enough to get what some signs or text says , and living there for a year or two should be enough for him to understand it and maybe even start speaking a bit . 
  i just checked the five first pages and almost if not all your comments are about that . 
  si alguien la tiene m\u00e1s corta eres t\u00fa :p i meant if he already knew spanish on an advanced `` can hold a fluid conversation using appropriate terminology '' kind of way . 
  at least my post history is n't ** completely ** full of it and although he 'll be missing on some stuff , catalonian is preety understandable if you speak castilian . 
  give him a year or two and he 'll understand most words . 
  we 've discussed this before , you preety much only appear on reddit whenever there 's something involving catalonia , spain or independence of it . 
  yes i am , and although it 's * interesting * to see a foreigner speaking catalan it 's not necessary at all . 
  from my experience big cities like tarragona , lleida , barcelona , etc , where you 'd expect to see ( european ) foreigners speak spanish fluently and most people do so on a daily basis as a lingua mater . 
  i suppose it 's not going to be a problem after the whole s\u00e1nchez thing , rajoy will probably be elected now that most of the psoe is voting abstention . 
   said the known catalan nationalist with the independentist flair preety much every catalonian speaks castilian aswell , do n't bother if you are n't going to work in a very remote village . 
  zapatero won a few consecutive elections and pushed as much of the gender ideology agenda as possible on a country that just got out of a dictatorship and aznar 's shitty leadership . 
  we really changed a lot in a decade . 
  not really , it 's mostly farmland . 
  [ just take a look at any desertic looking area and you 'll see it 's wheat or out of season crops ] ( https://www.google.es/maps/@39.817075,-3.1218343,903922m/data=!3m1!1e3?hl=es ), 
  i kinda figured :p, 
  so let them be one nation !, 
  so much for democracy and the will of the people , it only works with independentists apparently . 
  no it was n't . 
  i guess we were n't on the same contest after all then . 
  if they included the white anglosphere they 'd have to acknowledge not every country the uk put step on was successful . 
  also i think the whole anglosphere should stop using the acronym `` e.t.a. '', 
  as it 's associated with a terrorist group in spain . 
  then again the sagrada familia is absolutely huge and incredibly complex . 
  also there kinda was a civil war inbetween . 
  but seriously though , i hate it when all the media focuses on something , it keeps me from hearing other stories that might interest me . 
  i am okay with this . 
  imagine the benefits of having russia 's gdp and a direct border with china and japan ? 
  plus you could theoretically go from alaska to europe in a few hours by boat . 
  that 's what your `` race '' is called at least here . 
  the only responsibles for the far right gaining momentum all over the world is the far left . 
  i am latino . 
  by lowering the hdi, 
  not only that but the main party considered to be their successors are absolutely supportive of them , and those against it do n't last long . 
  but we are n't talking about the basque country , we are talking about navarre , and except for the two guys who support euskal herria over there , it 's a preety conservative region . 
  yes , i agree people who attack others by whatever reason other than self-defense or a legitimate reason ( like stopping a robbery or a rapist ) should be held responsible for their actions .

  now it is n't that cold anymore . 
  usually we would have around or bellow 0 \u00b0 c but these last years it 's more around 5-10 \u00b0 c. 
  today it 's 12 \u00b0 c here in valladolid . 
  the only possibility you guys have for a referendum is if enough congressmen agreed to reform the constitution , something that is n't going to happen because ciudadanos and pp will always refuse i 'm afraid this can only get worse . 
  the funniest thing is that the unionist nationalists claim that precisely because we are a democracy all spaniards should vote on the independence of catalonia because in a democracy the will of the majority of the society is what should prevail . 
  which is stupid because it shows that they do n't understand or do n't want to understand what is self determination . 
  but it is n't surprising as they do n't understand what a nation is and that spain is a multinational country according ti any definition . 
  so he 's saying . 
  please facebook remove from your website content that is spreading lies and slanders against me . 
  if someone did something similar to any of us , we would also want facebook to delete it because it can gravely hurt our social and professional life . 
  slandering is a crime and it should always be censored . 
  exactly . 
  he 's not underage so his application would n't have any preference . 
  that and fixing the problem of not having a real democracy and illegally occupying west sahara, 
  the greens here merged with podemos, 
  well , it 's winter . 
  and our winters are like northern european springs, 
  was n't it some kind of satellite state ? 
  rejecting refugees is against international treaties that i 'm sure denmark , poland , hungary and finland have signed . 
  spain has never been an influential power by itself in the eu . 
  we have always followed france and germany . 
  adoption is n't a right by itself , but being able to adopt children regardless of your sexual orientation is a right . 
  did you just assume france 's gender ? 
  try to tell that to the pp , who apparently does n't think that going renewable and become energetically independent is a good idea and has reversed many of the policies of the previous psoe government . 
  spain used to be in the lead of renewable energy for a couple of years . 
  if there are already regions within countries that do n't like giving money to other poorer regions ( ahem , catalonia , lombardia and flanders , ahem ) , imagine the reaction and the political problems it could cause if that happened among countries, 
  i thought france was our biggest enemy, 
  castile and le\u00f3n actually produces more energy than it consumes and most of it is renewable . 
  mainly hydroelectric and wind power . 
  portuguese understand us perfectly fine but we ca n't get anything that they say . 
  firstly , because portuguese are way more exposed to spanish due to tourists , not dubbed films and tv series and migration . 
  and secondly , because portuguese has much more sounds than spanish and , even though both languages are really similar when written , they sound very different . 
  maybe they get more brazilian tourists than portuguese . 
  because otherwise it 's kinda stupid . 
  that 's probably because the us is the main country where spanish is studied as the second language , so many textbooks are designed for americans . 
  the main sources of colonisers were andalusia , extremadura and canarias and their dialects are the most similar to the american ones . 
  and when spanish has a mexican flag, 
  because many people ca n't conceive that turkey can ever become a muslim european-like country if someone like erdogan keeps being democratically elected . 
  and i ca n't either . 
  you ca n't pretend that europeans accept you as an equal if a majority of the turkish society prefers to be the opposite of european . 
  turkey has been a democratic country for decades and yet the debate between secularism and islamism is still going on . 
  i 'm afraid people ca n't take your intentions seriously . 
  i 'm sure that nobody would have a problem about turkey joining the eu if a clear majority of the society was liberal and secular . 
  so , if you want to be part of the eu , fight for reforms , for the modernisation of your country and you 'll see how things change . 
  and you should also take into account that this subreddit is a bit centre-right aligned , so it is n't really representative of the opinions of all the europeans . 
  that 's why galicia and castile and leon ( north west ) are the third and fourth communities that receive more money and madrid proportionally gives the double of money than catalonia . 
  sure . 
  catalan speaking territories , madrid , navarra and the basque country are the richest regions . 
  navarra and the basque country do n't contribute more than they receive because they have fiscal privileges called * fueros * that date back to the middle ages . 
  and they refuse to give up on them . 
  and besides all of that , catalan separatist parties exaggerate the data to defend their agenda and the other catalan speaking regions do n't have a strong separatism . 
  we are not forcing you to islamism . 
  but we ca n't accept you unless you completely give up islamism . 
  the eu will never accept a country with the little freedom of press and protests , the increasingly authoritarian government and the political instability of turkey . 
  if that changes , the eu will change its attitude towards turkey . 
  but if people like erdogan keeps winning elections , i 'm afraid you are the ones condemning themselves to islamism . 
  the difference is that ceuta and melilla are integral parts of spain , while gibraltar has the same legal status as other british colonies . 
  it 's an overseas territory . 
  it belongs to the uk but it is n't part of the uk . 
  anyways , we live in a democratic world . 
  neither the people living in ceuta and melilla want to be part of morocco nor the ones living in gibraltar want to be part of spain , so this does n't matter at all . 
  the only real problem that spain ha s with britain about gibraltar are cigarettes smuggling and conflicts over the definition of spanish and gibraltar waters . 
  only nationalist conservatives worry about getting back gibraltar . 
  most guiris are like that , though , wherever they come from . 
  both of my parents were children when the dictatorship ended . 
  and in 1981 we had the failed coup d'\u00e9tat that pretended to restore the dictatorship . 
  it 's crazy how our country has changed so much in so little time . 
  nowadays people barely go to church and we 're one of the most gay friendly countries in the world . 
  if franco woke up , he would pass out again after seeing what his dear ultracatholic spain has become . 
  even if there are many people with very conservative and nationalist views , they vote pp , not an actual far right party . 
  new netherlands did n't exist when the netherlands were part of the glorious hispanic monarchy . 
  so , can we have our 3/4 of the americas yet and use nationalism casus belli to conquer portugal , the french basque country and french catalonia ? 
  forget about belgium . 
  make ** burgundy ** great again . 
  what is a briton doing here so late ? 
  do n't you guys wake up in like three and a half hours ? 
  ps : i 'm staying late because i do n't have class tomorrow . 
  we spaniards go to bed late but we 're not that hardcore lol, 
  wait is voting electronically something usual ? 
  in spain we vote with paper ballots and they are all counted by hand , theoretically to avoid electoral fraud, 
  i 'm leftist and many of my ideas are n't precisely centre-left . 
  and still , my country 's leftist parties piss me off as much as the right winged ones . 
  r/europe is clearly centrist/moderate and i honestly appreciate it . 
  it offers me a fresh view of many controversial topic without falling as easily as other subs in extremism and insults . 
  why exactly am i not in the same level as you ? 
  are you justifying discrimination ? 
  yes , we have a higher rate of stds because there are many uninformed people who are n't conscious of the dangers of sex without condom and think it is n't necessary because homosexual unsafe sex ca n't obviously cause undesired pregnancies . 
  so what if we do n't contribute to the birth rate ? 
  what really harms the demographics of a country is straight couples not having enough children to sustain the population . 
  the higher rate of paedophilia has always been a myth used to justify discrimination against us . 
  i 've read many studies about the topic and i 've seen as many supporting that statement as denying it . 
  and usually those that supported were done by some christian fundamentalist organisation who also happens to support `` conversion '' therapies that haven been proven to be incredibly psychologically harmful and not effective at all . 
  and if there are twins that have been raised in the same house , in the same atmosphere , and have had in general really similar lifes during their childhood an teenage , when sexuality develops , how is it possible for them to have different sexual orientations if sexual orientation is caused by the environment ? 
  we are a small percentage of the society . 
  we do n't affect your life at all . 
  why are you so keen on getting rid of us ? 
  and , well , just so you know , just because i 'm homosexual it does n't mean that i 'm a really thirsty guy who simply likes to have sex with other men . 
  that explains why there are so many italian restaurants in brussels and why waters spoke to me in a very weird mix of spanish and italian trying to convince me to go to their restaurants . 
  catholics are also decreasing in europe . 
  christianity in general is falling in the most developed countries except south korea .

  the greens ? 
  never said it did . 
  le pen is definitely worse . 
  to be fair , our main conservative party is also called people 's party and no one calls them populists : /, 
  he is anti eu ( albeit to a lesser extent than le pen ) and very far left, 
  both are nightmares ; just in different ways . 
   2/3rds of labour voters also voted to remain , and labour have pretty much ignored them whilst trying to park tanks in the opposite direction . 
   even within the tory party , there are those that are still very anti-brexit and see the party going too far to the right , my family and i included . 
  would n't all of those go for the lib dems ? 
  if they got 2/3 of labour 's vote and say , 1/3 of the tories plus their own voters they would probably have a shot at winning the election , or at least of coming in second, 
  i guess they could present candidates in england ? 
  for all what 's worth rajoy was defeated twice here ( 2004 and 2008 ) before finally becoming prime minister . 
  same thing with aznar ( 1989 and 1993 ) and gonz\u00e1lez ( 1977 and 1979 ) . 
  only pm who had never been defeated before in fact was zapatero ( 2004-2011 ), 
  according to polls he would have , polls overrated podemos . 
  but yeah , neither psoe nor podemos want deals with each other now , especially if diaz wins the primary in the psoe . 
  the likely coalition then was podemos + psoe+n ationalists psoe was opposed to it though , but the common thought was that they might concede that or something, 
  i guess that was ukip but that is falling because brexit already happened, 
  to be fair the only advantage is that mps are elected directly , which means they can vote against their party a lot easier . 
  here we use party lists and if you ever vote against your party you are most likely expelled unless you know very well what you were doing ( most likely you were already planning on splitting or something ) then again you can get the same with irv ( all the benefits of fptp with only some of the disadvantages ) but the uk dumbly rejected that in 2011 . 
  does romania have a large tourism industry ? 
  because if not then it makes sense . 
  most temporary contracts for students are usually temporary hires for like 3 months in the high season in summer . 
   it happened before brexit . 
  to be fair it technically happened after brexit . 
  brexit was the 23rd of june , spanish election was the 26th of june ( admittedly the 1st election was before brexit though , back in december 2015 ) . 
  but i do agree with everything else, 
  it 'd actually be the other way around . 
  the uk has to follow almost all of the eu 's laws but has not vote in them . 
  never . 
  they have come close ( 2 holding an election one year , the 3rd in the next year or the year before ) , but never the 3 at the same year . 
  here 's a list of all elections on those 3 countries france : 2017 , 2012 , 2007 , 2002 , 1995 , 1988 , 1981 , 1974 , 1969 , 1965 germany : 2017 , 2013 , 2009 , 2005 , 2002 , 1998 , 1994 , 1990 , 1987,1983 , 1980 , 1976 , 1972 , 1969 , 1965 , 1961 , 1957 , 1953 , 1949 uk : 2015 , 2010 , 2005 , 2001 , 1997 , 1992 , 1987 , 1983 , 1979 , 1974 , 1970 , 1966 , 1964 , 1959 , 1955 , 1951 , 1950, 
  any chance of labour coming in 3rd , even if it 's only in the popular vote ? 
  well , it technically is . 
  the uk could remain on the eea . 
  of course that 'd be dumb though , basically stripping the uk of their voting rights only to get farming and fishing back ( thoguh i think it would fit an independent scotland pretty nicely , almost more than standard eu membership ! ), 
  i think they won an mp , but that mp has since left ukip and become an independent so i guess no . 
  would n't the lib dems be the `` stop brexit '' party though ? 
  considering their terrible polling numbers , would labour block that ? 
  wait , what happened to that `` fixed parliaments act '' ? 
  is it getting repealed ? 
  is may voting `` no confidence '' against herself ? 
  i wish we had a 20h workweek :( but fine , you are welcome !, 
  kind of reminds me of `` el pais '' here . 
  very pro psoe , but only of its most conservative parts ( heirs of former pm gonz\u00e1lez ), 
  i guess the guardian is kind of a liberal newspaper ? 
  who do they generally endorse in uk elections ( assuming they even do endorsements ) ? 
  labour or the lib dems ? 
  honest question : why is everyone worried about a hypothetical `` president melenchon '' ( even if not as much as president le pen ) while no one was worried about a hypothetical pm pablo iglesias here ? 
  i mean sure , maybe iglesias was not going to pull spain out of the eu at all ( though he does want to reform it like melenchon ) , but he was a lot more in bed with venezuela than melenchon ( and iran . 
  oddly enough no russian connection ) is melenchon that much more extremist than iglesias here ? 
  seems like melenchon 's momentum has stopped . 
  in spain while most of our stikes have failed the last successful one was in 2002 . 
  an even more successful one happened in 1988, 
  to be fair not all referendums have ballots with questions where you put an x on the box . 
  here are [ the ballots ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/59/referendum_constituci%c3%b3n_europea_2005_espa%c3%b1a_%281%29.jpg ) for our 2005 eu constitution referendum . 
  they have the question but the answers are printed on the ballot already, 
  actually , spain at the time used a system very similar to the uk at the time ( fpfp or block voting ) . 
  ca n't find much info as most stuff is centered on the corruption of the system ( for example after the 1907 reform intended to make spain democratic , if there was only 1 candidate he was automatically elected , which made the system worse actually , giving more power to the powerful landlords ) . 
  for all what 's worth the democratic 2nd republic did use a system that forced a 2 party system ( partial block voting i think , which usually gives 75 % of seats in a constituency to the winner and 25 % to the runner up ) . 
  had it not collapsed and ww2 not happened , spain might have seen a 2.5 party system , with the 2 main parties being the `` popular front '' and the ceda , with maybe nationalists thrown in . 
  well , not even reddit as a whole is representative of us voters . 
  / r/the _ donald is also not representative of trump voters ( maybe of young trump voters ? 
  probably still not ), 
  yeah , i do n't know why he chose to mock that out of all things, 
  if what you think is that france needs thatcherism , i 'd say your candidate is fillon , not le pen , but i 'm not french so, 
  deport brexiters to england or wales and deport remainers to scotland/ni/london ? 
  sounds like turkey needs some freedom ^ ^ tm, 
  so just like turkey ? 
  they needed 3/5 + a referendum . 
  i personally think that 's better than 2/3 without it, 
  not really . 
  what led to the civil war was probably a long clash between the interests of the poor peasants and workers and the rich owners plus the instability of the 2nd republic those rigged elections ( although as more people became literate they were less rigged especially in cities ) did lead to instability when even when rigging the elections the 2 established parties could not rule , leading to primo de rivera 's dictatorship, 
  to be fair same happens in spain . 
  probably . 
  if franco had lived forever either he 'd have been removed in some sort of coup/revolution ( like portugal did ) or he 'd still rule spain to this day : /, 
  yeah , if you switch to a democracy when most people ca n't read and write , most likely you 'll get rigged elections . 
  it 's actually what happened in spain in the late 19th century . 
  on paper spain was a democratic country much like the uk at the time , with even universal male suffrage !, 
  on practice elections were not free , but instead were rigged for the 2 main parties to alternate on power giving the illusion of democracy when in reality it was more of an oligarchy of large landlords ruling the country people did n't notice as they could not read and write , especially in rural areas . 
  franco was definitely not the founder of a democratic state though . 
  the spanish equivalent would be either carlos arias navarro ( pm at the time of franco 's death , skipped in official counts as he is considered a `` francoist pm '' ) or adolfo su\u00e1rez ( next pm , is considered 1st pm of democratic spain , but of course he did win ( re ) election in 1979 after the constitution was ratified ), 
  to be fair , there 's nothing inherently wrong with presidential regimes if there are enough checks and balances . 
  the us do fine for example . 
  it 's just that they are very easy to turn into a dictatorship . 
  not just turkey ; venezuela is a text book example of turkey 's future ( minus the hunger and the oil ), 
  not exactly the same but we do have some notoriously conservative cities over here ( most notably madrid and valencia . 
  they did elect left wing mayors in 2015 and even a governor in valencia 's case , but in the general elections they went back to the right ), 
  actually , which was the largest city that did vote for trump ? 
  i think phoenix but i 'm not sure . 
  for all what 's worth there 's thankfully no relation between left/right and city/rural here . 
  madrid consistently votes for right wing candidates for example, 
  depends on the exact method of counting . 
  not a direct equivalent , but here in spain we usually have 50-60 % counted after 2 hours . 
  for all what 's worth spanish elections are also incredibly quick , with something like 50 % of the vote counted after 2h and 99 % after 4h . 
  we know the results before midnight, 
  it 's a turkish legend . 
  darth erdogan was a dark sultan of the turks , so powerful and so wise he could use religion to influence the turks to create dictatorships ... 
  no gaining ground too slowly :(, 
  do n't call it a grave , it 's the future you chose,

  that yes , it does with 1.9 million fewer jobs . 
  of the 3.8 million employed , only half have been recovered . 
  and how can you explain this ? 
  the economy has experienced a brutal competitiveness gain . 
  the same happens with 1.9 million fewer workers . 
  in part , this is explained by the different composition of the economy . 
  it has swept a sector like construction that before the crisis paid well and was very labor intensive . 
  and this has been replaced mainly with two sectors : on the one hand , tourism and the hotel industry , which needs many workers but which rewards much less than the construction . 
  and the export sector , which is much more productive and , therefore , less of the labor factor . 
  regarding the increase of the gdp in the second quarter , the economy accelerates and grows above the 0.8 % registered in the previous quarter . 
  the bank of spain , the fiscal authority , the panel of funcas , bbva or bankia had already made upward revisions in this regard . 
  just when it seemed the economy could start to slow down , it shows greater robustness than any analyst could predict just a few quarters earlier . 
  it seemed that consumption had to lose its boom or yes after months of growth over other headings thanks to robust job creation , lower saving rates and low inflation , which provides purchasing power . 
  with the crisis there was a lot of stored demand that had saved and stopped consuming durable goods due to uncertainty . 
  as soon as the uncertainty dissipated , that triggered consumption soaring above even what rents grew . 
  all this led to the idea that domestic demand would lose force as savings fell and inflation rose . 
  and the indicators point out that it does . 
  but not much , at least according to the latest consumer data . 
  and the answer can be in several factors : on the one hand , inflation is moderating and is giving back purchasing power to consumers . 
  in addition , employment continues to grow strongly . 
  moreover , between april and june rose to 0.9 % according to bbva research calculations , practically at the same pace as gdp . 
  from which it is inferred that all the growth is destined to the creation of jobs . 
  on the other hand , despite a slower pace between april and june , investment has resumed the growth path after stagnating during the second half of last year due to political uncertainty . 
  although from levels still low compared to pre-crisis levels , investment in construction is gaining momentum . 
  and lastly , the euro zone is recovering and pulling hard from spanish exports , although the latest data indicate that the strong increase in imports may be offsetting the effect of this strong growth in sales abroad . 
  not just catalonia , it 's all of spain . 
  hence why i drove to work in madrid . 
  that said , this should have nothing to do with the strike . 
   but once the unemployment goes down , companies will no longer be able to get away with shitty conditions . 
  to add to this point , it also helps put upward pressure on wages because you know you have alternatives . 
  and some of the shitty jobs may turn into less shitty jobs as it helps to be able to jump from job to job . 
  the biggest complaint i see is that unemployment rate does n't measure the employment rate . 
  and it 's absolutely ridiculous because it 's not like that 's a hidden statistic . 
  to top it off , ine is an absolutely respectable institution and they are pretty good about being free from state meddling . 
  i agree that there is fuckery in the government but it 's pretty much just around procurement and actual operational corruption is very low and institutions run by the government are generally pretty good about doing their jobs without political interference ( rtve excluded ), 
  that 's not how it works . 
  unemployment data is taken from a survey and has a very specific definition . 
  you know , because it 's an encuesta ( survey in english ), 
  there 's really not enough data for an economically stable , democratic spain to be able to say what the real structural unemployment should be . 
  that average included two big crises and also the aftermath of the transition . 
  just based on my gut , i 'd say structural unemployment here is 9-10 % it could probably be lowered to 6 % or so if they really went after tax fraud . 
  yeah , i would definitely put trina for spain . 
  i have never heard of mirinda myself . 
  this is basically unquestionably good news . 
  yes there are more workers with short term contracts , but that 's a hell of a lot better than with no contracts and once you get enough demand and a worker knows they can find a job somewhere else , they can start to demand better contracts . 
  things should be better , but you ca n't move an economy that fast and it 's moving in a good direction at a fairly good pace . 
  edit : [ here 's the data since 2002 ] ( http://imgur.com/a/n521l ) edit2 : yes it always falls for q2 and q3 and then tends to move slow until the following year . 
  this year 's q2 will have an extra boost since holy week was entirely in april and had fantastic weather ( it 's common for it to rain that week ) that said , i think getting below 16 % by the end of the year is not an unrealistic goal . 
  i mean , considering the direction , it 's clearly a lot better . 
  only a year ago we were very happy to be getting below 20 % we were in a really , really deep hole and things have been getting better for awhile . 
  clearly not as good as it should be , but we are moving in the right direction fairly quickly . 
  they are really good at charging ridiculous roaming rates . 
  the department stores have better prices than airport duty free shops for things like perfumes/colognes that i buy very occasionally . 
  the skiing is absolutely amazing . 
  they seem to be pretty happy to consider themselves catalan but not be involved in the hot political mess that is catalonia . 
  i want to go to one of those over water bungalows for vacation so badly . 
  ar baltic c series is a damned fine looking aircraft . 
   aer lingus is still the official flag carrier in ireland is this true despite being fully owned by iag ? 
  i thought they were legally just another airline with an irish aoc . 
  i mean , i 'd hesitate to call something they are calling for in 23 years a decision . 
  there 's going to be a lot of elections between now and then . 
  politics does n't work well on that time scale . 
  i think it 's just the government trying to signal and that 's about it . 
  they almost certainly would have . 
  it 's very distinct . 
  my vision for battery swapping is that the car owner never actually owns the battery . 
  they pay a bit each month to basically be allowed to use the shell battery network or something and they get x swaps per month for free . 
  if you need to use an bp battery swap , you 're allowed , you just have to pay a fee so it gets returned to its original owner . 
  i imagine in europe companies would have networks that span countries either through partnership agreements or just being multinational . 
  yeah , if it gets to the point where they are not the prominent vehicle choice at all , i do n't get why they 'd be banned . 
  i 'm sure they will serve a niche role and so long as not everyone is using one , the pollution worries are n't that bad . 
  and yeah , even `` rich guy wanting to go fast in a circle '' is a good enough reason for a niche role as there are a lot of engineering developments that come from supercars . 
  they 're out of money . 
  etihad said they 'd like to take them over ( they already own 49 % ) , but that 's illegal since they are n't an eu company . 
  rumors lufthansa may come in and buy it up , but they have some serious structural cost issues . 
  also could be that they just stop operating and other airlines come in and service where there is demand or a completely new airline is created without the structural cost issues ( like what happened with swiss ) at the end of the day italy just ca n't support two major hubs between rome and milan with a single airline . 
  but the point is that does n't happen because they are 100 % private companies . 
  the state has no say in their procurement decisions . 
  there are still a few government owned airlines in europe , the two biggest being finnair ( doing well ) and alitalia ( probably going to cease operations this year ) and alitalia certainly does have a sizable boeing widebody fleet and yes finnair is all airbus , but it 's not like they are in the core of the former eads group . 
  except almost all of these are completely private companies . 
  and neither lufthansa ( owner of brussels , swiss and austrian as well ) , airfranceklm , nor iag ( owner of aer lingus , ba , and iberia ) are government owned in any way . 
  i mean , the companies will `` lobby '' them but when it 's transactions between private businesses , that 's just called `` sales '' . 
  technically `` flag carriers '' should n't exist anymore in the ecaa . 
  of course we know they still do but every airline in the ecaa ( note not the same as eu ) should have the same rights regardless . 
  though there are old bilateral agreements that are still in force for many countries . 
  also ... let 's see what happens with alitalia . 
  honestly , we just do n't know . 
  would you assume an obviously disturbed person with a knife shouting `` oh my god ! '', 
  repeatedly was referring to religion ? 
  the phrase is actually used fairly similarly and all indications are that the man was very obviously mentally disturbed more than anything . 
  and as i mentioned , anyone trying to attack with a ham knife is doing it very , very wrong . 
  i 'm inclined to believe it was just a case of a very disturbed person with a mental breakdown as is being reported and seems to make more sense with how they were handling the situation . 
  in fairness , while there is a huge moroccan population in spain , there is also a large venezuelan one and the situation in venezuela is orders of magnitude worse than morocco right now . 
  nobody is worried about a civil war breaking out in morocco . 
  also , venezuela is one of the latin american countries that continues its links with spain . 
  on par with cuba and argentina . 
  on a much more cynical point of view , spanish business people are also waiting for the situation to change because it will almost certainly be spanish contractors that handle the reconstruction of the country after decades of neglect . 
  eh , it would strain infrastructure but venezuelans tend to be educated and mostly share a culture . 
  helps that we also speak the same language . 
  there are a ton in spain .

  usa 's debt exceeds that threshold ... 
  it 's high , for sure , but at the end , the important thing is wether you will be able to repay it in the future . 
  borja is the spanish ( aragonese ) town where the creative `` restoration '' of the ecce homo happened . 
  members of a noble family from there settled in valencia and later in italy where they italianized their surname to borgia ... may be you have heard that surname before ... 
  so that 's how it feels being in the reprehending side . 
  the situation is critical . 
  there have been reported cases of * cookie-eating * . 
  just to clarify , what i call medium term is  1 month and < 1year  in fact i do n't even need a simcard at all , i can leave it at home and still use whatsapp . 
  you can , but sometimes whatsapp may ask to re-verify you number and if it 's at home you have a problem . 
   as long as there is some free wifi in a country i do n't see why you would need a local sim . 
  even if you do n't call anyone ( which i do ) , depending from wifi coverage defeats part of the purpose of having whatsapp in the first place . 
  you are in a bus ( without wifi ) , and your friends announce that they are going to a new pub . 
  you will miss the message until you reach the pub and ask for the wifi password ( which bartenders refuse to give if you do n't order something first ) . 
  no , it 's not . 
  they tried an hostile takeover in ... 
  2013 ? , when whatsapp started to enforce its trial periods . 
  there were some line [ tv ads ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3e6_agbthje ) featuring some teen celebrities ( hugo silva ? 
  ) , but soon whatsapp reverted their policy and that was it . 
  unless you have a dual-sim phone , i do n't think it 's a very wise strategy for medium term stays . 
  you will need the cellular data and voice that the spanish sim card provides . 
  yes , it has been in the news recently , that the fbi is already having problems with the new [ end-to-end encryption update ] ( https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2016/03/next-front-new-crypto-wars-whatsapp ) , but still lacks the privacy controls ala snapchat . 
  that 's understandable , but there are more secure and privacy aware alternatives like telegram or snapchat . 
  i thought germans would have preferred those . 
  we have reached the point that you can feel excluded if you do n't use the app . 
  as i said , it 's the preferred way of coordination among people : your child is invited to a birthday party ? 
  a group is created only for the event , where the present is discussed , the parents talk about sharing the car ride , etc. . . 
  i know people that was almost forced to use whatsapp if they did n't want to feel ostracized . 
  this is surprising , given that germans seem to be pretty concerned about privacy , and whatsapp has had pretty weak record in this regard . 
  it 's a derogatory way of referring to fascists or francoists ( who would n't call themselves fascists , and technically are n't ) . 
   why spanish fought so hard to keep bourbon monarchy in peninsular war as well . 
  nobody does . 
  i applaud your knowledge of spanish history , sir . 
   call them southerner thrash or fachas is a bit harsh no , it 's not a bit harsh . 
  it 's unacceptable and despective . 
  not really . 
  i have worked closely with some galician guys lately , but honestly politics was almost never part of the conversation . 
  there is a generalized rise of republicanism everywhere , that 's for sure . 
  i do n't think galicia is specially republican , specially if we accept the correlation pp voter -  monarchic or indifferent . 
  i see they have removed the ( light ) profanity from the queen 's messages . 
  she used the word * shit * a couple times ( one in french , * merde * , it sounds less bad that way , i guess ) . 
  `` drawn into banking scandal '' . 
  that 's a bit sensationalistic . 
  they are being supportive with a friend that has committed a bloodless crime . 
  it 's not pretty given their position , but it 's somewhat understandable . 
  the king is also much milder in their support , tbh . 
   republics in spain do n't end well . 
  nor monarchies ... 
   are there areas that are really against the bourbons , like for example catalonia ? 
  republicanism is specially strong in catalonia and basque country , yes , given independentism is strong in those areas and the monarchy represents the unity of the spain . 
  not always was like that . 
  when the princess cristina married with barcelona 's handball player i\u00f1aki urdangarin , lots of people hailed the couple in the streets . 
  they were pretty popular there since they lived in barcelona , he was a loved barcelona 's player and she `` worked '' in the catalan bank * la caixa * . 
  in the basque country the dislike for the monarchy has a way longer tradition , but at the same time is ironic because the castilian kings where the ones who had preserved the basque special laws called * fueros * . 
  in the xixth century a conservative , ultra-catholic and monarchic movement called * carlism * was prevalent in the basque country and navarre . 
  summer holidays . 
  one extra payment is in june and the other just before christmas . 
  and they can pay below minimum wage ? 
  damn !, 
  we do n't know how to save , so the companies do it for us . 
  that way we have some money for holidays and christmas . 
  it 's 618 according to [ this website ] ( http://www.datosmacro.com/smi/portugal ) ( in spanish ), 
  you say that because you are unemployed or part-time ? 
  remember it 's scaled to 12 payments instead of the usual 14 in spain . 
  not very surprising . 
  there are three big blocks : eastern europe , southern europe and the rest . 
  ca n't spain keep border controls even if the uk becomes schengen territory ? 
  i think so . 
  i guess you mean tax haven . 
  strictly is not , as least in the sense of the cayman islands , but definitely there is some fiscal engineering going on there . 
  i wonder what 's the common root of those variants . 
  the quixote reference puts it in the 1600s at least . 
  one that is not specific , but surprisingly so . 
  it has an almost equivalent one in english . 
  it 's this : * le dijo la sart\u00e9n al cazo : \u00a1 ap\u00e1rtate que me tiznas !, 
  * its an old saying can be traced to the quixote , and its pretty similar to the english : * the pot calling the kettle black * literally means : * the pan told the pot : go away or you will blacken me !, 
  i think that they are just more uniform . 
  imho , pablo iglesias has worked hard to make the pact impossible . 
  insulting and humiliating the guy you have to reach an agreement does n't seem a viable strategy . 
  yesterday he made it even worse , which was difficult . 
  he 's no fool , so probably is a tactical move . 
  we 'll see how it goes . 
  the english also screwed it up with their * counter armada * , only that they are far better at marketing . 
  that 's great because we 're selling !, 
  buy a bourbon king , get a [ king emeritus ] ( https://i.ytimg.com/vi/yyscxsgbhqs/maxresdefault.jpg ) for free !!, 
  [ * ] [ * ] elephant not included, 
  they were very , very unlucky . 
  the gold started to depreciate ** exactly ** when they started to bring it in droves . 
  who da thunk ? 
  now that the black legend has been cited twice in this thread , i ca n't resist to comment about its origin . 
  there 's a single event which is the source of it , when antonio perez , secretary of philip ii , is pressed charges for treason , and escapes to aragon . 
  there , he asks for the protection of the * justicia de aragon * , a kind of judge to whom aragonese people could resort to in their conflicts with the king . 
  philip ii did n't take it with sportsmanship : sent an army to zaragoza , decapitated the judge ( who had gathered an army himself ) , and abolished the institution . 
  people tend to think that the austrias were always respecful with crown of aragon 's privileges and institutions , but as this episode show , it is n't true . 
  btw , the * justicia * asked for the help of catalans and valencians , but as it seems they were busy with something or already had plans or whatever ... antonio perez escaped alive again , this time to england , and there started to write shit about spain , which was of the liking of the audience . 
  surprise . 
  and that 's how the black legend started , kids . 
  edit : grammar . 
  better than borbons ( that 's easy ) . 
  under their rule ( i 'm thinking in charles v and phillip ii ) , the spanish empire reached their peak , but at the same time , the seeds of all our maladies were planted . 
  they focused on war and conquest instead of trade and production and a result the economy was shit and they defaulted several times .

  housing prizes have dropped 30 % since 2008 and will still fall a lot more . 
  a nice flat in madrid could easily cost 1 million euros in 2008 . 
  it would * cost * that , but of course it was n't * worth * that money . 
  spain should seek further integration with latin america , where it would be one of the head countries and not in europe , where it does n't have a word to say and has to renounce to any kind of economic and political power of decision . 
  edit : expanding a little : i do n't feel culturally identified with other european countries . 
  even portugal , italy and france have so little in common with spain . 
  spain shares a language with 500 million native speakers , most of them located in countries of fast economic growth and where everything is yet to be built . 
  it 's easy to think we should want to stay with europe since it 's a more developed region , but here goes a sad truth : europe 's glory days are past . 
  latam and asia are the future . 
  ps : and to those downvoting , a counterargument would be welcome . 
  the king will likely resign in favor of his son felipe along this year or the next one . 
  felipe will probably lose support along his reign , but i think it will take a few decades before spain becomes a republic . 
  the second republic was the one defeated by franco 's coup in 1936 . 
  yes , they 're spain for all effects . 
  one of them : tabernas desert . 
  of course spain will have a boom in five years , but that volatility is exactly what is fucked up about spain 's economy . 
  [ this is spain 's unemployment rate for the last 40 years ] ( http://www.voxeu.org/article/why-spain-s-unemployment-so-high ) . 
  it is almost arid . 
  the iberian peninsula is filled with mountain ranges , so rain rarely gets very far in . 
  the only actual deserts of europe are in the southeast corner of spain . 
  there 's where the sahara actually begins . 
  spain may not living its best days , but calling us a 3rd world country is going too far . 
  it still is the 23rd country in gdp per capita worldwide . 
  for comparison , finland is the 15th : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_sovereign_states_in_europe_by_gdp_ ( nominal ) _ per_capita, 
  the term `` illegal immigrant '' is not generally usually used . 
  `` persona sin documentaci\u00f3n '' and `` persona indocumentada '' ( person without documentation ) are preferred . 
  `` black '' is acceptable , but the press usually prefers the term `` of sub-saharian origin '' . 
  referring other minorities , they say things like `` person of latin-american origin '' or `` person belonging to the gypsy ethnic group '' ( persona de etnia gitana ) . 
  iberia is no desert : _ (, 
  we are astonishing similar and we do n't really like each other . 
  to explain this : in spain the prosecution follows a strong hierarchy , which head is the state 's general prosecutor ( that 's his title ) , who is designated by the government ( yeah , no separation of powers ) . 
  judicature is not as controlled , but they of course suffer huge pressuring in cases like this one . 
  any of you remember judge garz\u00f3n and what happened to him ? 
  so , in this case , the judge ( of course not the prosecution ) has decided to charge princess cristina and now you have the actual prosecution defending her . 
  all this is such a joke . 
  you can imagine how spaniards feel about this whole governing class . 
  this all is gon na end badly , very badly . 
  and by the way , this judge career is ruined . 
  i would n't say they prove it . 
  to be honest i am basically quoting one of my former professors from when all the kosovo thing was still relatively recent . 
  saudi arabia wanted an independent kosovo so they could eventually join albania . 
  religious statistics show diverse data for albania , but apparently there 's an equilibrium between christians and muslims ( similar to what happens in bosnia ) . 
  kosovo 's population is more than half of albania 's and predominantly muslim . 
  albania + kosovo would be the only european country with a clear muslim majority . 
  in fact kosovo already holds that position , but it 's independence is not unanimously accepted . 
  check saudi 's actions following the independence of kosovo , like [ 1 ] ( http://kryeministri-ks.net/?page=2,9,2934 ) or [ 2 ] ( http://europenews.dk/en/node/23160 ) . 
  serbians having a hard time accepting kosovo 's independence is quite understandable . 
  do n't forget ( not you , but anyone ) it was imposed to the serbs from the outside , it was n't the result of an internal and progressive process . 
  saudi arabia and the usa wanted an independent kosovo and they got an independent kosovo . 
  and of course she made sure there 'd be several photos of it . 
  king 's son is smartly keeping a low profile so the people does n't relate him with all the corruption cases . 
  i would n't be surprised if he rejected his own family just to save his ass . 
  these people have been raised since they were born to have power . 
  they wo n't quit easily . 
  calm down , folks . 
  she wo n't be convicted . 
  they 're already looking for ways to change the judge for a more favorable one , remove evidence , etc. 
  no longer surprised about `` socialists '' like hollande reforming the labor laws . 
  meanwhile in spain , foreign football players have huge tax deductions because they 're considered `` international talents '' . 
  yep . 
  a deduction allegedly created to bring talented international scientists and artists , is mainly used so cristiano ronaldo pays less in taxes than me . 
  because they are the same . 
  exactly the same . 
  and that 's why real madrid and barcelona are what they are . 
  there may be a fundamental problem with the system but corruption and the resulting bad management has definitely played a * huge * role . 
  spain 's housing bubble was not a mistake and did n't simply `` happen '' . 
  it was designed and executed so a thin elite got richer than they already were at the expense of the average people , who massively bought houses under the constant propaganda ( specially from politicians ) that assured prizes would never drop . 
  up to 50 people they do n't . 
  spain has no claim over gibraltar , only over the surrounding waters . 
  when will the british/llanitos learn this ? 
  it 's not only because of the economy . 
  it 's the feeling that all your hard work , education and high taxes go to feed a caste of corrupted politicians , bankers , owners of the big energy and telecommunication companies and the royal family . 
  every day , we know of more and more cases of corruption involving these people , and how they never ever answer to the justice . 
  they are stealing directly from the pockets of the average spaniard , who is becoming poorer every day thanks to their management . 
  i 'd rather be paying my taxes in any other country . 
  i 'd recommend you the book * the protestant ethic and the spirit of capitalism * , by max weber , the father of sociology . 
  they do . 
  it 's black , dense and sticky . 
  russia is probably bribing the people in charge of those decisions . 
  what 's with italians and romanians ? 
  besides the gypsies , romanian immigrants are usually polite , integrate well and pick the language fast . 
  i really do n't get the hate . 
  i 'm not gon na pretend in spain there 's no racism ( and specially casual racism ) against romanians , but torching cars ? 
  then you guys and flanders are next . 
   rage software oh yeah , i played and loved the jeff wayne 's war of the world . 
  i still remember their logo at the beginning . 
  in madrid yes , specially latin american places . 
  * rep\u00fablica argentina square * colombia street * rep\u00fablica dominicana square * paseo de la habana * bol\u00edvar street * per\u00fa avenue there 's also some neighborhoods where every street is named after a european city , but those are less centric and not as relevant as far as i know . 
  turkey , japan and poland as applicant to superpowers while china and russia become irrelevant ? 
  i just do n't see it . 
  japan will probably have less than 100 million by the end of the century and its economy is n't growing at all , poland 's population is also decreasing and turkey 's is n't growing that much . 
  i think you maybe assuming many of the games you play are american when they really are n't . 
  for instance the total war saga is british , paradox games are swedish and the assassin 's creed 's saga is french . 
  greece asking for reparations for the almogavars in 3 , 2 ... 
   do you have a lighter how come this kind of practices are so international ? 
  some pictures to ilustrate : * canis : [ 1 ] ( http://www.frikipedia.es/images/thumb/5/5e/cani_bizco.jpg/200px-cani_bizco.jpg ) , [ 2 ] ( http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_6tk0myca1cu/s_leld2aybi/aaaaaaaaaau/w13azv5_wyg/s1600/cani3.png ) * chonis : [ 1 ] ( http://img.desmotivaciones.es/201107/choni_2.jpg ) , [ 2 ] ( http://oi41.tinypic.com/2u5g6zm.jpg ), 
  there are general elections next december . 
  depending on who wins , it will be handled one way or another . 
  does it really ? 
  it seems both sides are reading the results like they see more convinient .

  damn switzerland , that 's spanish or greek levels of lazy . 
  but our anthem does n't have a text anyway . 
  i think that was a decent and relatively neutral summary for anyone interested . 
  podemos has become a polarizing issue in the last few months and it is hard to read something that is n't clearly trying to support or attack them . 
  that 's the main problem . 
  not only the pp and certain psoe factions oppose any kind of political negotiation regarding these issues . 
  it is just one of their main principles and something they brag about . 
  hell , they could even agree to a middle ground where both parties give up some of their demands in exchange of something else , you know , like adults do . 
  i find it very sad . 
  if you check the history of scotland , it 's not precisely a cakewalk : the wars of independence in the middle ages , the anglo-scottish wars , the bishop 's wars and all the religious conflicts , the union , jacobitism , the clearances , etc. 
  i do n't know , if it were n't for franco i would be tempted to think that scotland had it worse . 
  this an [ inquisition scene ] ( http://uploads7.wikiart.org/images/francisco-goya/inquisition-scene-1819.jpg ) painted by goya . 
  [ another one ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/17/francisco_de_goya_y_lucientes_025.jpg ) from the same series , representing public flagellants . 
  it 's also hilarious that they are attacking albert rivera by saying that he is catalan and using the catalan name of his party , even when we all know where he stands regarding these issues . 
  well , the fun part is that they have a majority as of today , they exhausted every legal possibility , and they have tried to negotiate , but faced total opposition . 
  so i wonde , why did n't they declare independence already ? 
  i 'm very skeptical about mas . 
  i 've been 4 times , visited very different parts of the country , and got to meet very different kinds of people , from the san francisco commies to reagan-worshipping pentecostalists , even an african american baptist congregation in virginia ( i was involved in running student exchange programs , so you meet a lot of people ) . 
  what i like the most about america is that it is more acceptable to do things your way . 
  in most european countries there is a right way of doing things . 
  i mean stupid things like the way you are suppossed to cook certain things , whether you should wear shoes inside the house , using the wrong word , bureaucracy , etc. 
  europeans are sometimes very passive aggresive about these little things . 
  [ poe 's law anyone ? 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/poe%27s_law ), 
  not in europe , but i was involved in running an exchange program with a private christian high school and stayed with the `` biology '' teacher ( who had a `` christian science '' diploma hanging on his home office ) . 
  everyone must visit a megachurch if they ever go to american by the way , it 's quite something . 
  most creationist groups in europe are pretty insular : muslims , jehowa 's witnesses , american-style evangelists , etc. 
  i do n't think we are smarter than americans though . 
  it 's just that creationism does n't have the same promotion here . 
  it also helps that we are more secular and the catholic and orthodox churches accept evolution in one way or another . 
  it 's a little bit a transition between different regions , in my opinion . 
  saint louis kinda feels like a midwestern city , but the few times i went a couple of counties south it was ... picturesque . 
  though the racial problems in the saint louis metropolitan area are more similar to those of places like detroit or chicago : housing projects , white flight , segregation and all that . 
  yeah . 
  i guess it 's different in every city , but i think you see more far left grafitti nowadays . 
  i will go with america too . 
  i 've been there several times and i know a lot of people in different parts of the country . 
  sure there are many fucked-up things , but the people are incredibly friendly and there are plenty of economic oportunities . 
  it 's also a great place to be different and do your own thing , whereas most european countries have more rigid ideas about how things work . 
  the only thing that sucks is the car-centric culture and the boring suburbs , althougn there are alternatives . 
  there is no point in denying it . 
  you can see all kind of radical grafitti in many areas of spain , especially in certain towns and suburbs of large metropolitan areas . 
  even though you see swastikas here and there , i 'd say their trademark symbol is the [ celtic cross ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/celtic_cross#nationalist_usage ) . 
  skinhead are usually left alone by the police except when shit hits the fan and somebody get badly hurt or killed . 
  spain is also less strict about all these ideologies than in most of europe , as we were neutral during ww2 and franco died in his bed . 
  that being said , i think that they are not as much of a problem as they used to be 10-20 years ago . 
  every now and then , you heard about skinheads beating punkies and immigrants . 
  i was a little bit of a metalhead , which is often associated to punk and leftists subcultures in spain , and most of my friends avoided walking alone around certain parks and avenues in the early morning , because you could `` get in trouble '' . 
  nowadays , i do n't really hear about it anymore . 
  sorry , if you want to get a piece of that , you have to join nato first . 
  [ model united nations ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/model_united_nations ), 
  i 'm very skeptical about this so-called recovery . 
  even if things do finally get better , i 'm not sure it 's thanks to the policies of the government . 
  and i will never forget that the government abandoned millions of people in need to their own fate , and they have only survived because relatives and charities took care of them . 
  we are actually exporting most of our talent . 
  spain has a terrible culture of innovation . 
  only a bunch of big companies care about r&d , universities and research centers have seen dramatic economic cuts after the crisis hit , and the situation was n't stellar before . 
  it 's really sad because we have our fair share of smart hard-working people that spent so much time and public resources on their education , and now they are forced to leave the country . 
  i enjoy a * siesta * joke as much as anyone , but it 's heartbreaking that we have the most educated and prepared youth of our history , and they end up emigrating or serving tables . 
  this . 
  we also put thousands of kids on school buses every morning , and nothing stops those drivers from crashing into a concrete wall or something . 
  there is not very much we can do about it besides ensuring everyone has access to mental health services , and , perhaps more importantly , fighting the stigma of mental illness . 
  shit happens though . 
  it 's still fun to watch the nordics explain why the statistics mean they are more advanced , like with any other negative statistic . 
  i mean , you do n't see people saying the nordics are happier because muslim immigrants bring more happiness or because they are more likely to report happiness and have better education on what happy means . 
  i agree that some things are very difficult to compare , but again , it 's also very difficult to compare happiness or life satisfaction . 
  why do we have to be so cynical ? 
  there are 287k suscribers , most of them english-speaking and college-educated . 
  it 's not that far-fetched that there are a few people interested and/or knowledgeable about such a fascinating field . 
  or that they have just been reading about the issue because it 's all over the news ... 
  well , there are cultural differences among the states , but at the end of the day , they 're all part of the same country . 
  so when the national public opinon changes , there is definitely a domino effect . 
  also , you guys can legislate by challenging marriage bans , and get to make same-sex marriage legal in places like oklahoma , where 66 % of the public opinion opposed it , and only 23 % was favorable ( according to this wikipedia [ article ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/same-sex_marriage_in_oklahoma ) ) . 
  i do n't want to compare or start a debate , but i guess spain kinda brought it on itself due to the obsession of certain political groups with gibraltar . 
  according to wikipedia , el prat handled 37 million passengers last year , so maybe that puts things in prespective . 
  but yeah , this kind of news makes you feel weird when you are familiar with the place , like when eta bombed the barajas terminal 4 parking building ( i have parked there many times ) . 
  at least they are an integral part of spain , with the same rights and obligations than the rest of the country and not a `` colony '' or a tax haven . 
  it 's a very complex issue and there are very different interpretations of the history of these two cities , but right now it 's not like spain is fighting anyone to keep those cities . 
  not really , dutch has a very distinctive sound . 
  to my ears , dutch sounds more similar to german , but maybe it 's because i know some german and the structures sound familiar . 
  they do . 
  i 'm not sure what the situation was . 
  maybe they do n't give you a helicopter ride if you are not in a life and death situation . 
  many transplant recipients are stable and living at home , and when they get the call , their families take them to the hospital by car . 
  but i do n't really know the protocol . 
  in case someone that did n't read the article wonders , it was the first flight to their destination . 
  they boarded the very next flight and barely managed to arrive in time for the transplant . 
  is it really worth it ? 
  or it 's just that you got ta spend all that sweet eu money ( we 've been there ) . 
  before i clicked , i knew i wanted to see a t-rex doing the nazi salute with this tiny arm . 
  but how else are we going to stop the terrorists without a t-rex ? 
  well , your opinion is perfectly valid . 
  many of us are still pretty young or live in urban areas where you do n't experience this as much . 
  i personally think you can have all the good things without the nepotism and clientelism . 
  some mayors in small villages can and do say `` sorry , i ca n't help you with that '' , go on with their day , and they are still as friendly as anyone else in the bar . 
  it 's not necessary , but it 's culturally accepted , or at least tolerated , it 's easy to get away with , and many people benefit from it . 
  but it 's alienating to many others and creates an uneven playing field that discourages entrepreneurship . 
  the worst part is that it promotes the opposite of a meritocracy : it does n't matter if you are incompetent or sloppy , and only matters how well-connected and loyal you are . 
  it 's hard to explain , it 's a socio-political structure developed in the 19th and early 20th centuries in rural spain . 
  from the wikipedia article on the [ bourbon restoration ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/restoration_ ( spain \\ ) ) :  after almost a whole century of political instability and many civil wars , the aim of the restoration was to create a new political system , which ensured stability by the practice of turnismo .

  1981 - the murder of the marquises of urquijo . 
  also unsolved but with only a slightly less obvious solution . 
  1990 - the puerto hurraco massacre . 
  two brothers flipped crazy in a village after a 30 year-old rivalry with another family and shot 10 + people . 
  1993 - the kidnapping and murder of anabel segura . 
  two losers kidnapped a rich girl ( her father was friends with the president ) and still tried to get a ransom after killing her . 
  the whole country was gripped . 
  1999 - the murder of roc\u00edo wanninkhof . 
  half-dutch girl murdered in costa del sol , her mother blamed her lesbian ex-lover , and a jury was happy to convict her purely because she was a bitch butch lesbian . 
  turns out she was really murdered by a british serial killer brought courtesy of an uk policy to clean gaols . 
  2003 - murder of sandra palo . 
  a 22 yo mentally handicapped woman ( about 9 mentally ) who was raped and brutally murdered by 4 teenagers aged 14-18 who had been committing crimes since they wore diapers . 
  caused a great discussion about how to punish criminal minors and if the brand new law regulating that was just a slap on the wrist . 
  2009 - the murder of marta del castillo . 
  her ex-boyfriend confessed and was convicted based on that and the fact that they found her blood in his jacket . 
  there is no body , he told nine different versions of the crime but he wo n't just tell what happened to the body . 
  there is a theory that he simply does n't know because it was disposed of by his brother/sister-in-law/both ( who never stood trial ) and he is protecting them .

  since the phoenician era , the strait has not been a frontier but a waterway .

  gibraltar strait ( tarifa ) and the canary islands .

  the only ones are old women in their 80s and 90s living in mountain villages in the north , so i ca n't get mad at them .

  what about 1453 to 1495 or so . 
  except for the right [ 1 ] , which will mention the ussr , stalin , twenty million dead people , carrillo and paracuellos . 
  always in that order . 
  [ 1 ] catalan and basque nationalist right exempted . 
  wyoming is being * prosecuted * . 
  he has not been * convicted * . 
  although the fact that the denounce has not been dismissed out of hand is enough of a shame . 
   making fun of a religious person has a penalty of 8 - 12 months in prison . 
  `` making fun '' is not what the law says :  1 . 
  ** ...  escarnio . 
  * skernjan . 
  a , o en , escarnio . 
  advs . 
  `` escarnio '' is not simply making fun . 
  it must have the clear intention of provoking outrage and conflict . 
  this is not making fun ( which falls under right of parody and free speech ) , but hate speech . 
  and even then , it specificies it as targeting religious rites and beliefs , not people . 
  what says about people is ** vejar p\u00fablicamente ** :  vejar . 
  vex\u0101re . 
  as you can see , this is persecuting people because of their religious beliefs , which is a breach of human rights , not simply making fun of people who happen to be religious ( even because they are religious ) . 
  if that were the case * el jueves * would n't have a long-running comic strip about masturbating priests , for example . 
  it 's a goddam shame that the zealots of the `` catholic lawyers association '' routinely abuse the law to denounce people for political reasons like krahe , maestre , wyoming etc , especially because of the waste of time , money and effort of the courts until these matters are thrown . 
  but they are still thrown . 
  edit : coming to think about , i can not remember the last time someone was actually convicted of this . 
  there are so many , really . 
  it 's a shame hollywood only cares about rehashing their beloved columbus , torquemada and hemingway again . 
   by the way , any link to that `` castilian is a catalan dialect '' ? 
  i 've seen many times , even now , the opposite being said , but not this . 
  the opposite is still said by francoists [ 1 ] , so it is pretty easy to imagine that this started as someone satyrising that on the internet . 
  i saw it on a msn chain mail years ago and i do n't know how to google it ( with the other i would type `` des puig '' or something like that ) . 
  basically , it consisted of typical r/badlinguistics stuff comparing randomly chosen words as evidence that one language is derived from the other , then it ended with some supposed medieval chronicle from a count ? 
  king ? 
  talking about `` the people of castile , who speak the same language as us '' . 
  that was it . 
  [ 1 ] i have a school book from the 1950s somewhere . 
  it says that galician , catalan , etc are all dialects of spanish . 
  not basque , of course , because that would be stupid . 
  it says that basque is far too primitive to be used in modern life , and that despite its folkloric appeal it should be let to die because it is inevitable that it does it anyway . 
   now they clame cervantes was a catalan , the original quixote was written in catalan , leonardo de vinci was either catalan or son of catalans ... 
  it 's gratifying to see a catalan nationalist not engaging in this baloney . 
  i 've seen also `` vespucci was a catalan '' and my favorite , `` castilian is a catalan dialect '' . 
  part of what makes the 11-m conspiracy theories so infuriating is that they do n't work like typical conspiracy theories . 
  the backbone of conspiracy theories is that people * in power * want to fool us and will do all kinds of nasty stuff to keep power . 
  it 's an instictual defense mechanism of the people , so to speak ; it might ( will ) devolve into stupid lunacy later , but in the beginning it 's a sane skeptic approach , an advice to not take everything we are told for granted , to question it and contrast versions before deciding what is really the truth . 
  sometimes it 's harmless like the moon landing conspiracy theories , sometimes it 's utterly disgusting like the sandy hook conspiracy theories , but that chore is there . 
  `` ca n't trust big people in guvment , so if they say this happend , tis because big people in guvment dun it '' . 
  with 11-m it is the complete opposite . 
  instead you have high ranking politicians and their paid journalists fueling conspiracy theories since the day after the election , involving everything and everyone * except * those who actually did it , their stated reason , and the people who were in charge at the time and fucked up the response because they were too cowardly to defend their own preceding actions that served for pretext to the attack , and they feared that these bit them in the arse and made them lost the election ( instead , it was * that * bungled response which made much more people indignant and made them rush to the polls to vote against them , ironically ) . 
  11-m conspiracy theories are basically just an artificial masquerade , crafted to exim the aznar government from their willing decision to pawn our country and our people to the bush administration , in exchange for a shot at writing aznar 's name in the annals of world history . 
  they 've even gone to the lengths of harassing police officers who investigated the case and victims families just for having the gall of dying in a terrorist attack , all while hailing themselves as the party of policemen and terror victims . 
  a dominican barmaid in the university was convinced that i was mexican . 
  this was in madrid . 
  this is why i roll my eyes so hard when foreign authors mention all-powerful spanish mafiosos and crime families ( op-center , the swat movie , the wheelman ... ) . 
  like the system would allow that kind of * competition . 
  * `` actual '' organized crime is either imported ( chinese , russians , albanians , bulgarians , east-european gypsies ) and/or extremely localized and reduced in scope ( galician drug `` lords '' , gypsy clans , club owners dealing drugs and prostitution in beach areas ) . 
  i was sleeping . 
  then i began dreaming that my sisters were one at the head of the bed , and another at the feet , and that they were pulling and shaking the bed . 
  then i woke up , and i saw that the bed was indeed moving , but nobody was moving it . 
  then it stopped , and i stood there sitting on top of the bed without understanding what had happened . 
  all of this apparently only lasted a couple of seconds , but it felt much , much longer . 
  i did n't even think it could be an earthquake until my father called and asked if i had noticed it . 
  it 's worse when they write it cajones because cajones means drawers . 
  `` tengo muchos cajones '' -  ok , go back to retail and sell some, 
  so , we have two levels of regional autonomy . 
  actual autonomous regions ( * comunidades aut\u00f3nomas * ) and provinces ( * diputaciones * ) which are just redundant , outdated remnants from a time when * comunidades * did n't exist and a cesspool of corruption . 
  obviously i think the second should be abolished and their remaining capacity transferred to the former . 
  * referencing 18th century history as if it was ancient history or the beginning of time . 
  * treating so called `` founding fathers '' and particularly washington as if they were demigods who could not possibly do wrong . 
  * teenagers driving cars and losing their virginity in them . 
  * the fact that every single family appears to be broken or monoparental ( and those who are not have one of their members in their third marriage ) * mothers dying in childbirth being treated as an entirely normal thing and not weird as fuck . 
  * the idea that a nuclear family can go bankrupt if the kid is hit by a car while playing . 
  * underage girls getting their ears pierced being treated as a scandal akin to boys getting a tattoo ( girls do n't seem to get tattoos unless they are already strippers ) * non-jews quoting the old testament by heart * bibles in prison cells and motel rooms * everyone has a gun but you ca n't use it when an intruder breaks in your home because your wife does n't want it in the house with the children , so you have in the car where it is useless . 
  luckily everyone has a baseball bat under the bed , though * nobody locks their door or car , nor bars their windows or pulls them down at night , though * it is in fact , perfectly , and absolutely normal to walk into a complete stranger 's home until you reach the kitchen simply by asking `` hello ? 
  anybody home ? '', 
  once in a while * yet it is also perfectly normal and not absolutely lunatic to come out of your house with a loaded shotgun and yelling passerbys to get off your lawn/property * and what 's up with family shows ?

  i only knew that word as the poetical composition . 
  yeah i get where you 're coming from , but i personally think no ( honest ) question is ever inappropriate or irrelevant , specially if it relates to touchy issues ... 
  if for example the user ( or any commenter ) thinks that women use makeup exclusively to attract men , having the question come up directly is a far better way to discuss it and try to change their view than waiting for a potencial social mishap . 
    my , or any other random person 's opinion of what strangers wear is not relevant . 
  i do n't see the deal with the question ( except for the part about assuming we 're all male , that 's true ) . 
  liking makeup is as much a cultural trait you could be curious about as using it ; just like some cultures find tans attractive while for others it 's better to be as pale as possible . 
  people hear you speak -  they assume you 're russian -  refer to my comments about eastern europe . 
  `` wives '' ? 
  i honestly do n't know , but i do n't think it would make a huge difference since your vote is just 1 between 65 million , so your direct influence in the outcome is negligible . 
  i count southern galicia as one of the parts . 
  that would miss independent movements in the basque country , navarra , the canary islands , galicia , andalucia ... 
  there are dozens of flavors . 
  i 've reached berlin by plane for roughly that amount , though i caught a good offer ( guess the company ) . 
  not counting sales , i could reach practically any place in the peninsula using blablacar i guess . 
  really ? 
  shit , it 's the first time i hear about it . 
  thank you !, 
  how do swedish speaking finns sound like to swedes ? 
  is there any stereotype attached or something ? 
  most forms of betting are legal , excepting the ones where the reason of the bet would itself be illegal ( like cock fights and things like that ) . 
  it 's however very regulated , you ca n't just start a casino like any other business . 
  lottery is extremely popular in certain specific traditional dates ( it 's run by the state and organizations related to charity ) . 
  not buying christmas lottery shared with your co-workers is kind of a faux pas for example , to the despair of math geeks . 
  online poker and some football related online betting are kind of popular among teenagers , who play with small amounts of money . 
  casinos , bingos , slots machines , etc. 
  are seen as more shady and , if you mention that you frequently go , people might think that you have a gambling problem . 
  they 're also extremely popular among asian immigrants for some reason . 
  spain : spain . 
  both as a whole or by parts , and i use the abstract term `` parts '' because the mere fact of calling them communities , inner nations , countries or any other term would start the shitshow . 
  some german guy ( edit : bismarck ! ), 
  said that spain is the strongest country he 's ever known , for he 's been trying to destroy itself for centuries and yet it 's still going strong . 
  yup , and some of them are exceptionally well integrated . 
  i do n't know what it is about your accent or language in particular , but romanian people somehow manage to sound native with no trace of accent , which for other nationalities is usually unreachable unless they started learning the language as kids . 
  something i find surprising is that unlike latin americans , chinese or moroccan immigrants i 've never seen communities of romanians . 
  i 've always wondered why that is . 
  the thing is that most of the people that consider themselves immigrants are n't necessarily thinking on staying indefinitely either . 
  lots of them think about being able to go back to their countries once the situation improves , or for retirement , or after they 've managed to save some money ... yet you 'll never see a construction worker identifying as an expat . 
  i just think that immigration from equal or richer countries is different than immigration from a poorer country - but we do n't have a way to distinguish that in english ( nor in spanish ) so the term expat kind of filled the gap . 
  i know , that 's why i put it in quotes . 
  `` expat '' in some circles has become some sort of euphemism that people from rich countries use to sound cool and distance themselves from the negative connotations of the word `` immigrant '' . 
  you 'll find dozens of blogs from people that have married locals , started businesses and families and have no intention of ever going back still talking about the expat life . 
  i 'd say it 's just because of the social positions they tend to occupy . 
  as a general rule , you 'll find western and northern europeans are either exchange students , have their own business or are working in spain for foreign companies - the average french person living here might be for example an engineer from a french company that has offices in spain ; while the average , say , romanian would be working as a low end professional ( plumbers , electricians , mechanics , construction workers , etc. ), 
  for a spanish employer . 
  thus , a native spaniard usually only interacts with western foreigners on social events and/or serving them , while for eastern people the average interaction is the foreign person serving natives or working for them . 
  there are no negative stereotypes related to behavior , in fact eastern europeans are seen as nice to work with , peaceful and hard working , with the exception of gypsies . 
  honestly , i think there 's a difference between western/northern europe and eastern europe . 
  people from poland , romania , etc. 
  receive a treatment that 's similar to , say , moroccans . 
  however , if you 're french , german or swedish you get the `` expat '' treatment , if you know what i mean . 
  in spain you can apply for uni anytime you want . 
  the catches are that you 'll have to take again the exam to access university ( there are unlimited attempts afaik ) and , mainly , that it 's quite hard to earn a living with a part time job , so you 'll have a lot of trouble balancing your studies with surviving economically . 
  honestly , if you tried to use the macarena as the union of all spaniards i 'd happily move to barcelona and fly the estelada ... and i 'm from madrid lol . 
  is the only one that comes to mind, 
  if i had to chose a song people would take as an anthem i guess it would be serrat 's mediterr\u00e1neo ( hopefully someone can link it , i 'm on mobile ) . 
  viva espa\u00f1a is well known but sounds tacky and it 's mostly played ironically or for tourists tbh . 
  unless he fucks things up and takes the eu 's popularity down with him , in the same way that cameron helped brexit by supporting remain . 
  ( not to rain in anyone 's parade , i 'm hoping for his success ), 
  yeah , the traveler effect is probably skewing my data . . 
  i 'll have to schedule a trip to the us in the name of scientific research haha . 
  catalans are called `` polacos '' in spain 's slang , perhaps you 're missing that reference . 
   are you speaking about your experience in the us with random girls or your experience with american girls traveling/living in spain ? 
  the second - mostly exchange students or long term travel . 
  i do n't know how well that translate to us girls in general , but i 'm comparing with girls from other countries who were also staying here , so i guess there 's something cultural to it ... or who knows , maybe i just happen to be hotter by their standards than by other peoples ' . 
  i like american entrepreneur culture . 
  although it 's partly due to the bureaucratic barriers we have in comparison , there 's a cultural fear to create our own businesses in my country , as if company owners were made of a different breed rather than just regular people . 
  that also comes from the bosses ' side , that act with some sort of elitism . 
  also , most americans i 've met are very open minded and always willing to engage in conversation even with people of very different ideas , although that might be that i 'm just meeting the subset of american people that are open minded enough to travel abroad . 
  oh , and in general i find hookups faaar easier with american girls compared to other countries . 
  there 's far less of a `` you 've got to check all boxes '' attitude and posturing from american girls , it 's all far more casual - `` oh you got some beers and netflix/videogames ? 
  that 's cool , let 's go to your house and we 'll fuck too since we 're at it '' . 
  we can unite in our common culture of territories trying to secede . 
  madrid 's pride festival has become the largest party of the year ( along with new year 's eve ) . 
  it 's awesome to have more than a million people on the streets of any sexual orientation . 
  personally , i 'm glad that there 's a language that has become the world 's international system of of communication ( in the west at least ) . 
  the fact that it 's english is irrelevant to me , i would like it just as much if it was spanish , french or german . 
  the presence of a standard is what 's cool . 
  i 'd imagine that it 's partly dependent on climate . 
  here in spain nobody does it , but then again you spend your day walking over hot asphalt . 
  if it was common to be walking over wet terrain or snow we 'd do it differently , right now sweaty feet are more awkward that shoes with some dust . 
  got it , catalan it is then . 
  is n't catalonian the english word for catal\u00e1n ? 
  that 's how i 've been using it so far . 
  every single language from our peninsula except for basque/euskera - that covers catalonian/valencian , galician , aranese , several dialects and to a certain degree portuguese ( that one is easy when written but surprisingly hard to understand when spoken , it sounds like russian for some reason ) . 
  italian is relatively easy , when i was there in a school trip we figured out pretty soon that talking spanish and hearing italian back was simpler than using english . 
  i can sort of understand like 60-70 % of written french , much lower than other romance languages . 
  how do you deal with that ? 
  i usually get sick if i have to deal with a 10-20 degree difference ( usually from an air conditioned building to summer heat ) . 
  are you guys constantly putting layers on and taking them off ? 
   i try to go to bed at 21:30 ... posted past midnight . 
  you 're not trying very hard ... 
   aaaah , it 's horrible !, 
  i still remember the horror of the first time our teacher made us to practice greeting each other `` properly '' in class . 
   i had the opposite experience . 
  my german teacher ( a native german older woman that looked like a stereotypical grandma ) backed away when we tried to introduce ourselves , and offered her hand instead . 
  i ca n't really explain the feeling , but it was not nice ; even though i understood perfectly well why she did it ( this was our start of a full immersion course ) i needed some time to recover - it 's like offering friends a high five and being left hanging . 
   out of curiosity , did the class cover the 1979 islamic revolution in iran , the iran hostage crisis , the iran-iraq war , and the persian gulf war ? 
  not in national history , since they were n't that relevant to our country . 
   and what about the vietnam war ? 
  proxy battleground of the cold war ?

  that 's all i can say without resorting to wikipedia . 
  opportunity cost . 
  40km $ spent in high speed railroads , are 40km $ not spent in roads , hospitals , etc. . . 
  there is consensus among the economists that spanish high speed infraestructure makes no sense , even adding all the externalities , and being generous when estimating them . 
  excuse my ignorance , is the same sinn fein than the northern ireland one ? 
  compared to anything bar airports with no planes . 
  amancio not amanico . 
  spanish high speed trains are an horrible investment . 
  when he says expensive , he is n't referring to the price of the tickets . 
  this opinion of yours is in withdrawal in spain , where the trendy thing is to criticize that period . 
  ahem ... ireland is still here . 
  out of the graph ... [ relevant xkcd ] ( https://xkcd.com/435/ ), 
  whoa !, 
  i wrote my comment without reading yours . 
  i could have saved time just linking to it . 
  it 's not a sovietic trait , though . 
  only one ? 
  i wish i could change first the willingness to game the system and to take the biggest possible advantage in every situation . 
  people here think that they are entitled to everything without giving anything in return , and effort is not something that is encouraged or praised enough . 
  the general mentality is this : if a taxpayer can evade taxes , he probably will . 
  if a bussinesman can pay below minimum wage , he probably will . 
  if someone can jump a queue because he knows a civil servant who happen to work there , he probably will ... 
  but at the same time , everyone wants free universal healthcare ( with drugs heavily subsidized ) , generous unemployment payments and pensions , fair services , etc. . . 
  there is some people who think that the rampant corruption of recent years has been performed by a * caste * of politicians , who were detached from the real people . 
  there is an alternative explanation whihch is far more frightening : our politicians are , in fact , a representative sample of the spanish people . 
  mostly the same ( hardly anything ) . 
  they ask for 15 ministries ** in total ** , instead of the current 12 . 
  and they want for themselves a half of them . 
  well , right now his opinion is n't more qualified than anyone else 's one . 
  it 's completely out of his hands . 
  elections in summer ... 
  i wonder how this will affect the turnout . 
  i ca n't find any about this in main spanish online newspapers . 
  shame . 
  not all arm chips are designed by arm , though ( most probably are n't ) . 
  its [ business model ] ( http://www.anandtech.com/show/7112/the-arm-diaries-part-1-how-arms-business-model-works ) its pretty interesting and includes complete designs ( ready to be implemented in silicon ) , partial designs ( excluding the lower level ) and just licenses to make arm compatible designs so can run the same software , but with a design developed completely without any arm intervention . 
  this does n't diminish at all arm 's merit , on the contrary . 
  i do n't see the point of presidents of the republic in those countries where they have so much limited power . 
  i understand how parliamentary monarchies have evolved by removing rights from the king one by one without pulling down him completely , but , once you got rid of monarchs , what 's the point ? 
  the american system make a lot more sense , imo , and avoids deadlocks like the one we are suffering now in spain ( i know the congress still may block government initiatives , but still ) . 
  lucky you , but a currency best trait should n't be to act as an investment . 
  it would be much more impressing if you have said that you had performed a significant amount of your purchases using bitcoin . 
  you guessed wrong ( because your prejudices i guess ) . 
  ciudadanos supports the removal as the psoe does , just want it done with some sensitiveness and competence . 
  you can ask for it to the mods . 
  they guy is [ in the street already ] ( http://www.elmundo.es/baleares/2016/02/12/56bd0452ca47416d6f8b45cf.html ) . 
  i have no words , i am as baffled as you all . 
   why the allies did n't liberate spain like they did with other countries ? 
  well , not only that . 
  the uk and france favoured franco at the start of the war , and the non-intervention committee was a joke . 
  the embargo was only enforced on the republic , while italy and germany were sending troops and material in droves to the sublevated forces . 
  only the ussr send some help to the republic ( and may be mexico ? 
  ) , but only after getting the spanish treasure as a deposit ... 
  it 's pretty dull . 
  it 's near to the escorial so if you go there it may deserve a quick visit , but other than that is completely skippable . 
  it 's way more complex than that . 
  for example , alava and navarre kept their fiscal autonomy since those provinces supported franco . 
  also the carlists batallion of [ requetes ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/requet%c3%a9s ) had a key role in the sublevated side , as others have pointed out . 
  edit : i recommend you [ this book ] ( http://www.amazon.com/spanish-republic-civil-war-1931-1939/dp/0691007578 ) , if you are truly interested on having a balanced view on the republic , and the spanish civil war . 
  hmmm ... the new spanish government is probably going to ask for some debt relief ... may be is n't that good idea , is it ? 
  the sad part is those guys are probably some idiots who now are going to be seen as martyrs of free speech , something they definitely do n't deserve ( as they do n't deserve to be jailed , too ) . 
  they have spread their message more than they would have ever imagined . 
  i do n't like their anarchist message at all , and their lack of common sense ( if you see most of your public are kids and your show is n't for them , warn the parents instead of blindly go on ) but i 'm forced to stand with them because of this disproportionated action of a sole judge . 
   the jail is basically for the `` gora alka-eta '' part which i still do n't understand the context . 
  the cop puts the banner and use it as fake evidence to incriminate the witch ... 
  it worked really well , the fiction ended having effects in the real world as in woody allen 's `` the purple rose of cairo '' . 
   this just reinforces my view that especially at the municipal level ideology really is n't anywhere near as important as basic competence . 
  i agree . 
  i would plainly forbid any motion or proposal which is n't directly related to the city or town . 
  spanish city councils routinely vote on issues so important for their citizens as the legitimacy of israeli settlements or strikes which occur on companies which do n't even have presence on the city . 
   the programme advised people that it was n't a children 's show . 
  here lies the problem . 
  as it seems , it was initially publicised as such , and it was only changed to `` not suitable for children '' an hour before the show . 
  something that was also unknown for council execs , who reported the incident to the police ( it was n't a civil lawsuit as you said ) . 
  but , yeah , its quite unbelievable that they have ended in preventive prision for this ( what they could do which constitutes a immediate risk , broadcast the show on youtube or something ? ) . 
  this certainly eclipses what was a huge misunderstanding , product of a mismanagement . 
  edit : btw , great summary . 
  it was my preferred option before the elections , but they are short of at least 20 seats or so . 
  just ca n't work . 
  if anything , it may get both a bit of good pr for the next elections . 
  i guess you have met a hardly representative sample of spainiards , specially if you used the term * social-democrats * . 
  or may be just wants to put pp and podemos in the situation of voting together against him to discredit both . 
   it 's hardly an agreement that is entirely favourable to the uk ( and its far from meeting the expectation of those people in the uk that actually wanted to see reform . . ) , i admit that the analysis i have read have been written by europeists/eu federalists , but i think it 's clear that the uk will have an special status into the eu . 
   as to it being humiliating , it should n't be seen that way , correct me if i 'm wrong , but this agreement should be ratified by the european council , without even consulting to their national parliaments . 
  that means that the rest of governments are going to accept something they would n't want just to please the uk . 
  but the uk is not going to show that level of commitment , but will have a referendum , even after having reached a deal that satisfies to its government . 
  if uk rejects a deal tailored for it , is definitely going to be humiliating for the rest . 
  if uk votes to leave after making us swallow such a favourable ( for them ) agreement is going to be humiliating . 
  catholicism has its perks , too !, 
  a note with a bomb 's threat has been found in the flight sva 226 of saudi airlines ( madrid-riad ) . 
  that 's the only known by now . 
  edit : the passengers already have been evacuated from the plane . 
  in my region the date is called `` jueves lardero '' , and we eat [ * longaniza * ] ( https://www.google.es/search?q=longaniza&amp;client=ubuntu&amp;hs=vbk&amp;channel=fs&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewivunym_93kahvfobqkhyn0dqiq_auibygb&amp;biw=1270&amp;bih=791#channel=fs&amp;tbm=isch&amp;q=longaniza+frita ) . 
  it 's a sort of sausage with spices . 
  edit : i did n't know until today that * lardero * is a synonym of * graso * ( fat ) , so the translation is the same `` fat thursday '' . 
  asymmetry , quasi-veto introduced , stealth modification of the treaties , unjustified removal of benefits to eu citizens in uk . 
  google translation seems to be pretty understandable : ** a shame , everything is backward ** * the worst of tusk trimming package is certain social benefits to community migrants * * the six documents ( and letter ) president of the european council , donald tusk , to placate the british euroscepticism are a disgrace . 
  from a european and pro-european perspective , it contains countless setbacks and only relative progress , regulatory simplification . 
  * * it could be the consecration of the double speed in the eu , the more integrationist and no , for what tusk calls for `` mutual respect '' , especially in banking and monetary affairs , alas , the city . 
  * * but it is futile to talk , because the integration does not add them to any other mechanism and reluctant , the ability to return the policy to the council and the promise to find a `` satisfactory solution '' to the complainer : a quasi-veto .

  you have news only when something big happens , but i ca n't really see the tides . 
  even in galicia , where i 'm from , it 's only a sense of cultural proximity , but not really something strong , which does not make any sense in my opinion , we should do more things together . 
  what 's the point of view from portugal ? 
  yep . 
  they are very greedy , and always trying to bully local governments on elections to get money . 
  really awful people . 
  many highways are private in spain . 
  they often cry about profits and demand public money . 
  not worth it . 
  i tried to think about this , but it 's very complicated . 
  eu and usa did n't align in many things previously , what would be our position now ? 
  tbh there are too many variables to consider . 
  i 'm waiting to read some experts to gain insight . 
  i do n't care to be honest . 
  a dick-measuring contest will be endless here , better to calm us down ... 
  it 's true , but we did n't even try . 
  i mean , what are the solutions on the table ? 
  close the borders to those damn muslism or open them because it 's racists otherwise . 
  this is not the attitude to tackle any problem . 
  oh thank you italian . 
  the day theyll come ill be eating italian food just to honor you . 
  the problem with refugees is that we do n't know who they are . 
  literally , they made up strategies to difficult that work for police . 
  many of them were not actually refugees and on top of that , we have a very visible problem not only with radical islamism , but with just islam cohabitation in the same spaces . 
  al those problems need to be treated . 
  we may feel bad for them but it 's nonsense to difficult our actual shitty situation with this . 
  also , if you know anything about immigration , importing a shitload of people at once is a very bad idea . 
  the amount of people you let in , and the timing , are very important to integration . 
  otherwise you end up with gettos . 
  and those are studied and/or known problems that are very far from a powerful narrative , do not have anything to do with internationalism and feelings of compassion , but need to be addressed urgently . 
  so what would the left do . 
  keep pushing the idea that pointing at that problems is just racist ? 
  because this is what most of the left is doing across europe , and i anticipate you that it 's not a good idea , because the right wing will benefit from it , as it is already doing . 
  i do n't know what he really believes , but if he ca n't stay in power because of gop donors or voters , he will do it . 
  personal choices of presidents can only be pushed when there is negligible resistance against . 
  maybe because you are american you have problems understanding it , because you do n't have an outsider perspective , but clinton was also a threat for us . 
  anyway , this election was lost by liberals , not won by republicans . 
  go check the data and think about it . 
  maybe liberals have done things wrong , like choosing an awful candidate , that triggers legitimate concerns , and being awfully classist with wasps . 
  as an outsider , it was clear for me that treating this people that awful was going to backfire . 
  maybe you did n't contribute to it , but it really seemed like most liberals did . 
  nah , that 's just the anti-american rant but now with an add-in tupe . 
  do n't even pay attention . 
  man , you are in brazil , you 'll be safe lol, 
  exactly . 
  you do n't have to be nationalist nor anti-immigration . 
  most people is just looking for a rational solution . 
  something like to link immigration visas to x economy indicators , and explain it . 
  it would also help to recognize that certain religions and cultures come with difficulties that others do n't . 
  most political debates pivot over being a cool multiculturalist and a rather closed nationalist . 
  that 's nonsense . 
   also , that 's mostly a phenomenon from the anglo-sphere . 
  and the internet ( and the world ) is more than them . 
  exactly . 
  i hope you are american , because this is nonsense . 
  `` muh white privilege '' ... almost everybody is white here , and going to `` college '' is not really that privileged , since many europeans went to univeristy and they are not even in the middle class . 
  the problem with your stance is that most people that endorses it end up in an eco chamber where immigration policies do n't cause problem and therefore those problems do not need to be treated ( i 'm using immigration as an example ) . 
  the left loves to ride the intellectual horse across the storm . 
  it 's ideas are attractive in that frame but are problematic to apply in the day-to-day menial work . 
  for example . 
  what if you find that , say , 20 % of the refugees are actually endorsing radical islam . 
  the left just do n't know what to do , because they have no solution for a problem like this . 
  so the typical following action is denying that the actual problem exist . 
  but because the problem is there , and some people gets affected by it , someone takes advantage of it and tries to build a narrative around it ( extreme right in this case ) . 
  so the left follows with silencing even the evidence , which is no more possible since we live in a complex world and we have internet , so that only comes to fuel the situation against them . 
  not everyone is in the anglosphere . 
  i am actually pretty qualified to say that , yes . 
  i hope she is not , because that will be the beginning of the end for the eu . 
  man , that was an election lost by democrats and liberal voters . 
  democrats because of their stupid decisions . 
  liberals because they feel so good with themselves that lost track of their awful classism , that can be seen anywhere . 
  trump voters feel treated like trash . 
  that 's a situation that could n't last long without consequences . 
  exactly . 
  it 's just marketing . 
  he knows his target . 
  i do n't get how people can be so naive to think that a dumb man can get into the white house . 
  he may be bad , but not dumb . 
  man , calm down . 
  i 'm sure he 's awful , but no stupid people wins an election . 
  if he was really that dumb , i can promise you his team is not . 
  they studied their marking to look like they do . 
  it is n't casual . 
  never , anywhere . 
  it 's not a failed democracy . 
  democrats decided to put hillary in place , which was clearly a truly bad candidade , someone to really fear , especially if you are not american . 
  and many trump supporters feel abandoned . 
  what i see with many `` liberals '' ( in american terms ) is that they have a really strong and awful classism ( in bordieu 's terms ) that hurts them badly . 
  if you treat a large chunk of the population like trash , well , that backfires . 
  a similar phenomenon is happening in spain with urban leftist voters . 
  well , i though you where thinking in another thing . 
  i know that history . 
  what happend ? 
  yep , but spain is still an eu country . 
  we did n't ask for military help , because we did n't need it . 
  what we requested was political support , and not really strong . 
  but seeing our allies siding with morocco was really an unpleasant surprise . 
  well , that 's clearly not enough . 
  exactly . 
  we are supposed to be allies ...

  i find it weird that spain is the first `` large '' country by percentage of people living in metropolitan areas . 
  is n't population much more concentrated in cities in the northern countries due to climate ? 
  fuck no , i can perfectly picture how it would look like ...  `` hey / r/kace91 , we need you to go charge their tanks face first . 
  everyone agrees that 's stupid but apparently the guy in charge is the son of someone important and we have to do as he says . 
   the helicopter that will take you there has n't been safe for a decade , we 've been saying it for years ... but you know how bureaucracy goes , so take care in case it decides to retire by itself mid flight . 
   also , the technical team said that you need bulletproof gear for this endeavor , they always overdo it with their recommendations so i think this thick newspaper under your shirt will do just fine . 
  good luck ! '', 
  same for finnish raha ( in spanish it would be pronounced like slang for pussy ) . 
  latin follis is also suspect , follar is to fuck . 
  well , then it 's your dumb shit too :p . fundamental rights of the european union :  article 1  human dignity  human dignity is inviolable . 
  it must be respected and protected . 
  the problem is not the article itself , but the broadness of the concept of dignity and what constitutes a breach of it . 
  yes , article 20 grants freedom of speech . 
  however , it states that its limits lie in that it should respect all other articles of the constitution . 
  the catch is that honor/dignity it is also recognised as a basic right . 
  as a consequence , mocking a person in public can be considered a form of abuse/humiliation , which would break the limit of freedom of speech . 
  there is a balance between those two rights that is left for the judges to deal with . 
  it is important to note however that freedom of information is a different and more protected right , that concerns the spread of facts ( vs freedom of expression that deals with opinions ) . 
  that 's the problem and the cause of debate . 
  this sentence references a previous one where 24 year old girl got 2 years of prison for some dark jokes about irene villa ( a journalist that lost both legs in a terrorist attack ) and the holocaust . 
  the law states that humiliating victims is a crime . 
  the rest is all the judge 's interpretation : they considered that making a joke implies mocking , which is humiliation , since it was done in a public platform - basically , they considered publishing on a social network the same as publishing in a newspaper or saying it in live tv , and assumed that the content could reach the actual victims . 
  in that case the context ( the girl publicly supported a terrorist organisation in unrelated events ) was took in consideration and she was found guilty . 
  there has also been a similar case ( a politician that made holocaust jokes 4 years before serving ) on which he was acquitted , since it was considered black humor and `` reprobable , but not punishable by the law '' . 
  among the public opinions are diverse . 
  in general the old generation is much more favorable to the sentences , while the young consider them disproportionate . 
  i think that it is partly a problem of lack of understanding of social networks , that are treated as platform of public expression and not as means of personal communication , when they are actually both . 
  picture an american tweeting something like `` we could use a 9/11 on trump tower '' . 
  that 's basically what he did , with references to terrorists acts committed by eta and grapo instead . 
  the previous judges had taken into account his trajectory as a whole and framed his tweets as just provocation and irony , while states overruling says that hist actual intention does n't matter , that the references to victims of terrorism are humiliating for them , and that the tweets ' positive view of terrorism is a crime . 
  you got ta hand it to trump - choosing pence as a vice president was a genius political move . 
  it 's gon na be his life insurance , no one wants to take him down if it implies that pence becomes president . 
  translation :  ** spain 's supreme court has convicted cesar strawberry , singer of def con dos , to a year of prison , as author of a crime of exaltation of terrorism or humiliation of victims , due to several comments he published on his twitter account between november of 2013 and january of 2014 on which he mentioned , among other people , the prison officer kidnapped by eta jose antonio ortega lara , as well as the grapo . 
  **  the court , in a sentence by his president manuel marchena , rejects the singers ' absolution pronounced in july 2016 by the national court . 
  it considers the tweets to be messages of humiliation and mockery that `` feed hate speech , legitimate terrorism as a way of solving social conflict and force the victim to be reminded of the memories of past threats , kidnapping , or the killing of close family '' . 
  the supreme court does n't accept the national court 's conclusion that `` the provocation , irony and sarcasm '' that can be appreciated in the group 's songs can justify the singer 's absolution . 
   the sentence imposes the minimum punishment applicable by article 578 of the penal code , although it dismisses the possibility of classifying the case as `` of minor severity '' due to the messages being spread by a twitter account with more than 8.000 followers , each of them a potential resender . 
  he is also condemned to 6 years and 6 months of absolute inhabilitation . 
   ** cesar strawberry 's tweets , quoted in the sentence , are `` the blatant fascism of esperanza aguirre [ right wing politician ] makes me even miss the grapo '' , `` ortega lara should be kidnapped now '' , `` franco , serrano su\u00f1er , fraga , blas pi\u00f1ar ... 
  if you do n't give them what they give carrero blanco , longevity is always on their side '' [ carrero blanco was a main political figure under franco , killed by a bomb that exploded below his car sending it to a different street ] , `` how much people should have followed carrero blanco 's flight '' and a last one which was a conversation with another user , started by strawberry 's tweet of `` it 's almost the king 's birthday , i 'm excited ! '', 
  - the other user replies `` what are you going to give him as a gift ? '', 
  to which strawberry replies `` a cake-bomb '' . 
  **  the national audience considers that `` it is not proved '' that strawberry intended to defend the postulates of a terrorist organization , nor humiliating its victims . 
  the supreme court considers , however , that the intention is irrelevant , since article 578 does n't require proving the intention of the act and just needs to `` assume as one 's own the justification of a violent way of solving political differences , and the conscious reiteration of those messages through twitter '' . 
   the sentence considers important that , in order to guess the real intentions of the accused , the national court had to rely on witnesses of his non violent behaviour , to a press article more than 15 years old where he was critical of extreme nationalism , or to a large blue ribbon worn by the group 19 years ago to show rejection of the killing of miguel angel blanco [ assassinated by eta ] . 
  in a harsh argumentation , the supreme court warns that the attitude of the accused more than a decade ago is n't what 's relevant , but the messages of humiliation he sent through his twitter account are '' . 
   the magistrates quote his own previous sentences over the crime of humiliation through social networks , and remind that they have given similar sentences in other cases related to victims like miguel angel blanco and irene villa . 
   the sentence includes the particular vote of one of the magistrates , that considers that the initial absolution should have been confirmed , since `` his messages are n't more than expletives with no further path ; inacceptables , of course , but just that . '', 
  according to this magistrate , strawberry 's comments `` lack the slightest possibility of practical connection with persons or actions that could be considered terrorists '' , specially considering the moment when they were written and spread - after eta had already announced the end of their violent acts . 
  i really envy germany right now . 
  you can choose between two decent and capable candidates with the peace of mind of knowing that both choices are going to do an ok job . 
  in contrast , i ca n't remember a single election i have participated in where i was n't choosing the better of two evils , or a just half decent choice vs awful alternatives . 
  is there any country where the south is n't tied with a laid back attitude and conservatives ? 
  do you not see a difference between these ? 
  - a ) a foreign person saying `` i support x '' and - b ) a group of foreign people organizing accounts with fake identities tailored to pretend they are natives so they can spread false information . 
  per the article :  the chatroom 's admins have instructed users to make fake facebook accounts that are `` ideally young , cute girl , gay , jew , basically anyone who is n't supposed to be pro- [ fn ] . '' users are then instructed to lock down these dummy accounts so no one can tell they 're fake . 
  once they have their fake facebook profiles , they 're told to infiltrate the comment sections of large french facebook pages and post pro-fn memes and jokes about fran\u00e7ois fillon , france 's current frontrunner for the presidency . 
  i have never not gone through a passport security checkpoint in europe . 
  maybe that 's not `` technically '' a border post but it fulfills the same function because your passport is checked and can be logged . 
  have n't you seen the eu and non-eu lines at all airports ? 
  they 're there for a reason . 
  i do n't even have a passport , and i 've moved through eu countries just fine . 
  i just show my national id ( which i need to carry at all times due to national laws anyway ) to prove that i 'm who i claim to be and i 'm golden . 
    i hope europe will know to back iran . 
  you want a proxy war between us and eu forces ? 
  meaning fillon vs macron or macron vs le pen ? 
  serious ( and uninformed ) question for germans : ideology aside , how qualified is schulz to hypothetically inherit merkel 's de facto position as leader of the eu ? 
  i realize that it 's a very subjective question , but i would like some input from those of you that are used to his daily work . 
  ah , i think he just meant globalized world , not globalist . 
  it 's a normal mistake to make . 
  besides , globalist has a proper definition outside of antisemitism , it 's someone advocating for or having a positive view of globalization ... 
  i 'm not seeing it and he has n't edited ( ? ), 
  did you reply to the wrong post or something ? 
  it is n't much of a problem ; traffic with purely automated cars was solved already long ago , it 's taking care of a mix of automated cars and human stupidity that 's taken most of the work . 
  still , the more automated vehicles there are , the better they perform , due to the hability to act as a hive mind . 
  sudden braking is far easier to perform when the cars behind you can get instantly notified that you 're going to do it , for example . 
  what leads you to think they are n't going to play politics in this vote as in any other ? 
  they 're just going to decide what is more harmful to their image : going against the will of the people or taking part in a decision that all experts consider a bad choice . 
  it 's still pretty much a betting game for them . 
  the really sad point about this movement is how futile it 's going to be . 
  america 's workers have given their support to trump in hopes that their old manual jobs will come back from the places where they have been outsourced . 
  who cares that coal is no longer useful , let 's keep mining it under state protection because we need work as miners . 
  who cares that producing goods in america is n't profitable , let 's bring our factories back . 
  and why is it sad ? 
  because even if they end up recovering the jobs that they lost to globalization , those are exactly the kind of jobs that automation will kill first . 
  workers are sacrificing their empire because they do n't want to be replaced by foreigners , completely oblivious to the fact that they 'll be replaced again in 5 years anyway , this time by robots . 
  if they had any trace of awareness of the world they live in , they would have been pushing for free education and universal income , which is the only thing that can save them from the incoming shitstorm . 
  take it as a warning of why we need free quality education and journalistic integrity . 
  i want the guy to be as visible as possible . 
  not for political reasons , i just love watching his speeches . 
  can you expand on the forum ? 
  what it is , possible bias , etc. 
   it sometimes even links to the original article . 
  that is n't saying much when the readers ca n't understand the original ( since the site explicitly aims for that audience ) . 
  it 's not a childish ending , it 's telling people how to feel about the phrase - same reason why everything 's either tremendous or terrible . 
  trump talks in emotions , which apparently is quite convincing to some people ... 
   i 'm from the us and i live in the uk , so now i 've gotten to experience that , but double . 
  do n't take this the wrong way mate , but could you please stop moving around ? 
  at this point we ca n't take any risks . 
  is the video available ?

  [ it 's apparently also the hometown of bloodhound gang . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bloodhound_gang ), 
  lmao, 
  sounds like a good plan that will stop putin . 
  what can i do to help ukraine in a war with russia and what exactly do you want me to do ? 
  so the u.s. has sent warships to make a drill with ukraine to a sea next to where russia is at war with ukraine . 
  that 's calming . 
  well , the original plan is to live in ukraine/russia for 4 or 5 years and then relocate again back in spain or in another western country . 
  but yeah , you 're right about a future pension . 
  i 'll have to either save a ton of money into a retirement plan or think about something else . 
  but if i register a company as somebody suggested , i would qualify for all that , right ? 
  anyway , before doing anything i 'll talk to the embassies and consulates , because i do n't want to fuck up , yeah . 
  because i want to learn ukrainian and russian . 
  my idea is learning one of the two and then learn the other one . 
  `` then , why do n't you go to russia ? '' . 
  it seems to me that getting a work/resident permit in russia is harder than in ukraine , but it 's an option too , yeah . 
  and second , i get paid in us dollars so they 'll probably yield more in ukraine than in russia . 
  i 've been looking for flats in lviv and there are many cheaps flats there . 
  that 's great , thank you , 
  for example ? 
  so no ukraine mmmmm . 
  there are some non eu countries where an eu national can live without a visa , like norway , iceland and even switzerland i believe . 
  catalonia independent and ruling aragon ? 
  that 's optimistic . 
  seeing how easy he is to convince i should ask him for money . 
  yeah well , the brits were too determined to invade , there was n't much you could do , right ? 
  yeah , i know , but why are these celebrations taking place in bratislava then ? 
  so budapest was the capital of hungary until the ottomans captured it and then the capital moved to bratislava ? 
  i 'm sorry , but i ca n't see any menu or link to select any format . 
  for example , with this book : https://bookshop.europa.eu/en/understanding-eu-decision-making-pbqx3211990/ i only see the orange download button . 
  but i have n't been able to download a complete book , they only have the first pages or the index , am i doing anything wrong ? 
  for example , if i download this books https://bookshop.europa.eu/en/understanding-eu-decision-making-pbqx3211990/ using the orange download button on the bottom of the page , it only downloads the index . 
  am i doing anything wrong ? 
  i 'm not sure about the political situation in france but if i 'm correct , marine le pen has it very difficult to win a presidential election due to the two round system . 
  french redditors will know better i guess . 
  which is a scumbag move , tbh . 
  there are enough things to critizise him for rather than his sexual life , which should be kept private like anybody else 's . 
   terrorism just outside the eu ( turkey for example ) - pff , who cares . 
  this is really unfair . 
  everybody cares to some extent , but the sentimental relation with the victims is not always the same . 
  if a bomb goes off in syria killing 30 people and you 've never been in syria , speak the language , know the history , or know syrian people , you care , but that 's all the relation you have with the attack . 
  if a bomb goes off in paris or london , you might have walked those streets , know people from there , seen many movies about the city , or even lived there . 
  everybody reacts according their relation with the subject , it 's not something you ca n't blame people for . 
  and it also happens in many other instances . 
  do cancer and strokes get the same attention in the media or the same amount of donations ? 
  subjugated , yeah , i do n't understand how the un have n't rescued you yet . 
  pedro s\u00e1nchez said `` there wo n't be a third election '' , which can be interpreted as , if the situation is the same as in december , the psoe would abstain so the pp could govern . 
  about an official mechanism to prevent a 4th election , as far as i know , there is n't , so if the parties do n't agree on a new government ... new elections in fall . 
  thanks !, 
  what happened with the tuition fees ? 
  care to explain , please ? 
  i still remember one bosnian kid who came as a refugee when i was in grade school . 
  i lived in a very , very , very small spanish town with almost no foreigners , having a kid from bosnia was like having a kid from another planet . 
  i 've always wondered what happened to him and where 's him now . 
  haha scared of what exactly ? 
  catalonia would what ? 
  vote themselves out of the eu ? 
  not in a million years . 
  it was the main unionist argument agains independece and even catalonian leaders firmly stated they want catalonia in the eu . 
  nobody in spain is against the eu , only extreme left anticapitalist movements , and they matter nothing . 
  i can assure you spain will never vote out of the eu . 
  not under these circumstances , for sure . 
  spain has n't officialy said anything about that matter and wo n't do in a very long time until the scots officially apply for the eu . 
  and even then , vetoing scotland from entering the eu would be a very controversial move , even among their voters . 
  so i still have a chance ? 
  why commiting genocide when you can have the cia fuck up every nearby country . 
  and i do n't think podemos is gon na bring any communist-like government . 
  they 're just real socialdemocrats , that 's all . 
  but that 's podemos fault . 
  you can watch countless videos on youtube of iglesias and monedero licking chavez 's ass and talking how good his politics were . 
  now that venezuela is completely fucked up , do you expect the media and the politics to ignore all that ? 
  the left would n't ignore it if it was the opposite situation . 
  there 's some people worried that the same thing could happen in spain . 
  and although i do n't think podemos is going to bring any chavez-style government , those who are worried are rightfully so . 
  and ? 
  people always say `` stupid media , they never report about [ insert-country-here ] , the censorship of traditional media is brutal '' . 
  and now that they 're talking about the shithole maduro and chavez made out of venezuela , it 's suddenly wrong to talk about it . 
  and it 's obvious there 's an ideological reason behind it , but we all know who complains about it and why . 
  because i knew you were going to end up here :  people born in a state are assumed rights to stay in that state . 
  people who want to immigrate into a state are given certain requirements to meet from said state . 
  which is the typical `` locals first '' . 
  and i do n't criticise it , i kinda understand it too , but it 's an enormously unfair idea . 
  imagine you 're a guy who came from another country and have been working hard for 10 years . 
  you learned the language , you integrated , you have friends , never created any problem , etc. 
  but the 2008 crisis makes you lose your job and now you 're one of those burdens for the state . 
  compare that to one of those retired guys ( british or not , i do n't care ) who never cared about the country they live in , never learned the language , never integrated , etc. 
  any person who has been working for 10 ( or any decent amount of time , the number is irrelevant ) years has probably contributed much more in taxes than a pensionist has contributed in money spent ( which is also debatable , since most of that money stays in small circles : local shops , restaurants , etc. 
  then let 's follow your point all the way and kick out all unemployed people . 
  no , not at all . 
  in the end , the people who have suffered the most during the crisis have been those who did n't have anything to do with it in the first place . 
  the cuts were/are mostly in welfare , benefits and the like . 
  high class people have n't done any sacrifice . 
  so now we judge people off their accounting value ? 
  also , any poor guy who came to spain ( or any other country ) and is hardly able to get a job , i could cut them some slack . 
  a retired person with money and a good life who does n't give a shit about the language or the local people when it would n't cost them jack shit to get integrated ? 
  those can fuck off, 
  2 ' 38 $ / kg right now in dia . 
  ah ok , so the sms thing is the popular vote ? 
  did n't know . 
  but still , it does n't seem to be very transparent , right ?

  some official documents are also publicated in catalan aswell . 
  mp still can not talk in that language and obviously the spanish mps ( from pp and psoe basically ) are known to be at fault for obstructing the process of officialization , an unique situation given the fact that even gaeligue was proposed as an official language by ireland despite only having 130.000 speakers . 
  so yes , it can be done and yes , it 's spain 's fault that it has n't been . 
  so am i. 
  there are catalan mps in pretty much every single european chamber , that 's why we want to be able to speak in catalan there ( among many other reasons ) . 
  and yes , we also proposed it for the spanish chambers too . 
  catalan mp have already proposed it and it failed beacause of the spanish vote against, 
  yeah that was weird ... 
  i 'm guessing it was the easiest model to use available ? 
  no , valencian is the name given to catalan by speakers of the valencian dialect . 
  like castilian/spanish . 
  sorry i do n't follow ? 
  yes , they 're official in the respective communities , but not in the state : catalan ca n't be spoken in the congreso , for example, 
  welp , then they were plain wrong . 
  the official consensus has always been in favor of it being a dialect . 
  it 's kinda scary that it had been taught to children . 
  '' ] ( https://ca.wikipedia.org/wiki/acad%c3%a8mia_valenciana_de_la_llengua ), 
  in that case , it shows poor editing by wikipedia . 
  there is no political disctinction , valencian is classified as a dialect of catalan by catalan * and * valencian linguists alike . 
  the issue arose thanks to ideological manipulation by the spanish ex-ruling party in valencia ( pp ) which aimed to strain relations with catalonia , but thankfully now it 's in the past . 
  [ there really are n't that many official languages ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/languages/policy/linguistic-diversity/official-languages-eu_en.htm ) , so not that i know of . 
  countries like malta though , which have maltese and english both as official languages are both recognised by the eu . 
  standard prodedure is to recognise the officiality of the language of the state , but it can be voted to recognise any language that request it . 
  the only reason catalan is n't recognised is beacause of spanish pressure . 
  the eu institutions get to decide which language is official or not for their chambers , not the spanish . 
  our beef is with both . 
  the latest official report as of 2014 [ situates catalan at over 10m speakers ] ( http://blogs.iec.cat/cruscat/wp-content/uploads/sites/15/2011/11/informe-2014-conclusions.pdf ) . 
  12,8 m people understand it out of the 13m people that live in the catalanospeaking area and it is the 16th most spoken language in europe and , if we take into account people that have it as a second language , the 7th most spoken . 
  i do n't know where wikipedia got that data from , it seems pretty fake honestly ( there 's at least 8m people living in catalonia , and catalan is not only spoken here , [ it has a much bigger area ] ( http://www.llull.cat/_img_cultura/territori_catala.gif ) ) the catalan wikipedia reports much higher numbers too ( 11,5 m , i must 've missed a newer report ) , so it seems iffy . 
  it 's bigger than any scandinavian language and most slavic . 
  well then , welcome to our club , maltese speakers . 
  +10 m speakers , one of the most spoken languages in europe and we also ca n't speak our language in the eu parliment or any spanish chamber , the biggest by far non-recognised language in europe ( bigger than most of the recognised ), 
  i guess they were going for architectural works more than anything else , but really the delta works are more representative, 
  what was the building for the netherlands ? 
  there 's a monolithic opinion on this sub . 
  and you ca n't go against it, 
  and catalan , and spanish, 
  you need to go to a * forn * or * fleca * for that ( a real one , not one of those `` panificadoras '' ) . 
  traditional breads usually are n't in supermarkets, 
  down here we prefer white bread . 
  we have a crapton of shapes for it , and another crapton ways of making ` sandwiches ' ( which are n't even that but there 's no closer word for ` entrep\u00e0 ' ), 
  well , all are white except the very very traditional catalan black bread , but you 'll only find that stuff in towns . 
  it has a bit of a ` legendary ' status behind it , since that 's what people ate in the post-war period . 
  the rest of ` brown ' breads are considered ` for hippies ' or ` diggestive ' and take that as you want :p, 
  wait , people do like that ? 
  i thought it was some sort of `` diggestive '' bread . 
  at least it 's how it 's viewed down here, 
  i like'em , and our rich guys too, 
  most are either basque or catalan , which have pretty different cuisines than the rest of the penninsula ( even if addmitedly , most spanish regions do have their own cuisine too ) .

  45 % of relative humidity in a city between two rivers and the sea , it 's not bad .

  oh well , mild heat is some heat i guess, 
  i dunno , i just checked my phone and that 's what it said ... though i guess the south of the penninsula is much hotter now :p, 
  what the fuck . 
  is this normal ? 
  down here it only snows once every five years or so ... and for just an afternoon, 
  24\u00ba at 10pm with low humidity , it 's perfect weather down here in barcelona,

  nah , pretty much everyone knows that they 're the same . 
  if they can sell it as `` saving ejpa\u00f1a '' from the dirty communists it wo n't create much fallout . 
  since pp actually tried to make a pact with psoe in the first place it will probably harm psoe a bit more than pp , but if they 're smart it wo n't be that bad for them . 
  also for some reason i ca n't see this comment chain , only in the reply box, 
  i mean , we just broke bipartidism for the first time since ... 1982 ? 
  the state is a bit unstable at the moment, 
  weeell ... 
  i suppose so . 
  but they 're not extremists like they 're sometimes painted as , their policies are pretty much the same as any social-democrat party in northern europe, 
  my money is on pp-psoe-ciudadanos , since they all happen to misteriously agree that podemos is the devil and ciudadanos actually tried to make this happen in this legislation with no success . 
  once they try again , they all win ( pp will probably put their own president since they 're the biggest party - getting rid of rajoy - , psoe will look like it has made a move `` for the state '' being forced to pact with pp `` for spain '' and ciudadanos will look like `` the negotiatior that saved spain from the * rojos/communists * '' ), 
  psoe is `` socialist '' in the sense that it actually is whatever they want to be once they are in power . 
  they drifted pretty much to the right and they 're probably a center-kinda-left party now . 
  also , podemos has n't been stained by the tons of corruption scandals that stain the old parties, 
  i do n't . 
  and you could make that same gif for basically all of the 4 major parties ( yes , including ciudadanos/pp 2.0 which seems to get a lot of love here ) . 
  edit : also / u/monkeyseemonkeydoodo i for some reason ca n't see your reply or my reply ... weird,

  barcelona is in europe as far as i know, 
  i mean . 
  you come here and try to live without ac, 
  it 's just that the `` monarchic union -  spain '' gets so repeated that people forget that , at the same , it was pretty common ( poland-lithuania , england-scotland pre act of union , etc ) . 
  it makes no sense though , beacause for the same reason half of germany should be also `` spain '' when charles i became king, 
  yep , tell me about it, 
  it 's preeetty weird , i 'd almost say it 's made up ... 
  it screams 60 ' like no other !, 
  i have a deep love/hate relationship with daring buildings like this one, 
  so basically mallorca and the canary islands ? 
  and these resorts are shitty as fuck , you get pampered to hell and back but never actually visit the country, 
  the tallest building in barcelona will be the sagrada fam\u00edlia !, 
  so yes , a church will still be the tallest !, 
  ( despite the fact that it will be * the tallest church in the world at around 180m but hey * ), 
  can tell you for a fact that at least for spain it is n't . 
  at all,

  so , `` saciated one 's house '' . 
  aside of ours ( best and oldest ) , estonia 's looks great worst would be kosovo ( and maybe cyprus , but not so much ) for having the map on the flag . 
  bosnia and herzegovina too . 
  that would be a good flag for a company , like ikea , not for an independent country . 
  op starts saying he is from canada ... 
  because those are the two coutries mentioned by the op ? 
   , whereas on the spanish side people tend to gather more in urban centers leaving the country side more empty not in galicia . 
  more population nuclei in galicia than in the rest of spain . 
   how can lidl sell jeans for # 5.99 ? 
  according to the very linked article , they do n't . 
  the ones at this price are leggings , not jeans . 
  no idea about facebook , but i 'm catalan and have two family names , and use both . 
  if you see someone named `` x i y '' , it 's clearly catalan ( `` i '' meaning and ) . 
  my mother 's family names were `` roca i roca '' . 
   lind - type ( lindberg , lindstr\u00f6m , lindqvist and lindgren in that order ) . 
  and what 's `` lind - '' ? 
  the one writing the article has no idea what a restoration is , innit ? 
  andorra , of course . 
  in fact , the only independent part of my country . 
   set up by venice 's rulers in 1516 on the site of an old metal foundry , and probably the first community in europe to be segregated by religious belief , the neighborhood took its name from getar , a word in the venetian dialect meaning `` to smelt . '', 
  really ? 
  come visit the `` call '' ( catalan for jewish quarter ) of girona or barcelona or mallorca , or so many other catalan towns . 
  from several centuries before . 
  portugal and canary islands are in the right time zone . 
  have you ever seen a time zones map ? 
  canary islands are 100 % in utc-1 and so is half portugal , the coast , which happens to be the more populated area of the country . 
  what about france ? 
  and belgium and the netherlands . 
  and , in fact , portugal and the canary islands should be utc-1, 
  in fact , colombus not being italian , but catalan , is the only one of their theories that does n't really sound crazy . 
  colombus , cervantes and many others were catalans and there 's been a spanish conspiracy to rewrite history . 
  hey , they have their own `` new history '' institution !, 
  well , they favor a coalition of both center right nationalist parties . 
  makes sense . 
  how do you say to flight ? 
  ( in catalan it 's volar ) and to want ? 
  ( we say voler ) so , in fact , vol has two meanings : a flight and he/she/it wants . 
  how do you say to fly in romanian ? 
  also , vol is he/she/it wants . 
  so vol de mort might ( a little bit ungrammatically ) mean wants of death . 
  which is ... ? 
  by the way , rosemary 's baby 's title in spanish is the devil 's seed . 
  could n't be a bigger spoiler . 
  romania , romance language ... who could have guessed !, 
  in catalan at least he is voldemort , what they changed was the real name . 
  i guess because voldemort appears on the 1st book and we do n't know his real name till much later . 
  i love how romanian is some times so like catalan . 
  dead man 's head is also , literally , cap de mort . 
  does voldemort translate to , in romanian , as flight of death/dead man ? 
  then i 'd have said catalans , not french people . 
   i 'm willing the bet your friends were rather speaking in a `` bourgeois '' manner and called it the `` parisian accent '' . 
  that 's pretty much the diffinition of posh , innit ? 
  also , according [ this collaborative dictionary ] ( http://dictionary.reverso.net/french-english/serviette ) , a serviette is also a briefcase . 
  it does n't say in what dialect . 
  the same according to the [ oxford dictionary ] ( http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/translate/french-english/serviette ) . 
  [ in wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/swiss_french ) it 's said serviette in swiss french is linge . 
  i 've remembered i learnt about serviette being a backpack in a village near friburg . 
   in the french-speaking areas of switzerland , a popular variation is the `` caf\u00e9 renvers\u00e9 '' ( `` reverse coffee '' ) , which is made by using the milk as a base and adding espresso , in reversal of the normal method of making a `` caf\u00e9 au lait '' . 
   wait in what language is a serviette a backpack ? 
  serviette is what you put on your lap when you eat at a restaurant . 
  i always say caf\u00e9 au lait . 
  where in switzerland are you from ? 
  i learnt those words in la tour de peilz , next to vevey . 
  the french people i know who are not from paris make fun of `` l'accent parisien '' / lak ` sanparisi'an / as being posh . 
  serviette as a backpack ? 
  renvers\u00e9 as a caf\u00e9 au lait ? 
  septante , huitante , nonante ? 
  aside , the lack of difference is n't because the native language was arpitan and it was mostly replaced by standard french ? 
  posh catalan sounds nasal , full of spanish words , sounded consonants pronounced unsounded , s pronounced with a lisp ... edit : seeing what some portuguese guy has writen , yeah , here also with lots of hand movements . 
   in a similar fashion the franks ( now french ) were named after the proto-germanic frankon it seems - which was their local name for the spear . 
  i 'd say franks nowadays are franconians . 
   the allamans where a tribe next to france . 
  and not really a very coherent tribe , but a bunch of people from different tribes , hence all man . 
  in catalan we also call them `` alemanys '' and the country `` alemanya '' . 
  as i said , my french pronounce is awful . 
  i 've always pronounced them differently . 
  i 'll have to blame my teacher . 
  i guess my french pronounce is awful , as i would pronounce renar different from renard , for example . 
  where would you add a d in n\u00e9nuphar ? 
  why ? 
  it 's an official language in the whole of catalonia . 
  good point . 
  also , after some years of droughts ( well , now it 's about 100 days without rain in catalonia ) catalan people have learnt to survive using less water . 
  but , anyway , they have used the total amount or the concentration ? 
  afaik in english it 's minorca . 
  thanks , i did n't get it . 
  so , the balkans do n't care about the south part in south-eastern europe ? 
  what 's `` your '' part of europe ? 
  they do n't call themselves by patronimics , but by given names . 
  i speak both catalan and spanish . 
  the intelligibility is for non bilingual people . 
  for exemple , catalan speakers from perpiny\u00e0 or l'alguer have problems understanding catalan , and i 've met many latin americans who understand nothing of what i say in catalan . 
  what is your language ? 
  catalan or spanish ? 
  do you understand the other without no exposure , no teaching ? 
  that 's nothing near to fluent . 
  really ? 
  what about people from eivissa or mallorca ( specially the inland ) ? 
  they are the worst !, 
  catalan and spanish are not mutually intelligible .

  yes i do . 
  i would like to see the 3\u00ba spanish republic . 
  i have no problem at all . 
  if someones grandfather is spanish he is spanish by born right , period . 
  i have a very strong feeling . 
  when i listen the european union anthem i feel joy and i think that we can achieve whatever we want together . 
  good people and country . 
  9 right now , but in other jobs 6:30 , 7:30 etc etc. 
  what culture do you mean ? 
  yes in spain , national  regional , for example tax things . 
  basic things in school , how to have a `` fluent '' conversation with breaking bad , lost etc etc. 
  it is very popular in spain , 2\u00ba main sport i would say . 
  i cant recall any change in spanish language,

  you can always claim you are spanish . 
  i would like to know about those countries that werent superpowers . 
  because when i went to school we learned about empires or german , italian unification etctec , i did n't know about polish-lithuanian thing till 3 years ago , can you believe it ? 
  wow , it is a large timeline . 
  i would say roman empire ( really old times ) and russia ( \u043a\u0440\u0430\u0441\u043d\u044b\u0439 revolution ), 
  yes , i know , it was a litle bit trolling . 
  actually usa is not a huge vacation destination here in spain . 
  when we cross the atlantic we rather go to el caribe or mexico etcetc . 
  i would choose carlos i forever . 
  yeah , canc\u00fan for example . 
  people from galicia ( spain ) are known for answering a question with another question .

  no , he is not sociallist/left/whatever . 
  they even removed `` socialdemocrat '' from their party . 
  hahahahaha , and what else ? 
  in spain both mean right wing, 
  in some way fidel castro . 
  yes with at least 15 aircarriers with eurofighters on them .

  do you mean not to eat pork ? 
  to stay at home on saturdays ? 
  to wear flips flops and socks in summer ? 
  to drink like horses ? 
  i always liked this one : tu puta madre en bicicleta, 
  much more than people thinks about spain hahahaha, 
  i usually say nothing to them , it is a private thing . 
  i have friends who support franco . 
  i cant chose my friends , it is a life 's law . 
  not enough no i am worry about this public transport , water comsumption at home , electricity comsumption etcetc good morning to you too, 
  100 % agree, 
  franco and all his supporters are cancer, 
  no and no .

  el cantar del mio cid , around 1200 ( spanish ) el foro del buen burgo de castro caldelas , around 1200 ( galician ) text of the last one here : https://www.yumpu.com/pt/document/view/12890440/o-foro-do-bo-burgo-do-castro-caldelas-consello-da-cultura-galega/7, 
  when i was a kid and i was starting to learn it i was always thinking , `` what a stupid people !!!, 
  why dont they read all the letters in their words ?! '', 
  hahahahaha, 
  the same thing happend to my wife 's father , so many years living in ukraine but in the end when he tried to speak it was like an invisible wall . 
  i wanted to ask you just to check if it was something similar . 
  why ? 
  galician , spanish , portuguese , english and survival russian . 
  not in spain, 
  italian or greek arabic, 
  well if cyprus is why not israel . 
  i am not saying right although, 
  bagpipes are the tipical thing where i live in spain , galicia . 
  that was invaded by the soviets, 
  menu del dia too, 
  nobody follows those sports but basketball . 
  yeah !!!, 
  kiev mini buses it was the worst and the best at the same time .

the democratic majority want to close the borders to foreigners . 
  do we really know that ? 
  boris was promising that freedom of movement would remain right up to the day of the referendum . 
  the official leave campaign was all about `` sovereignty '' , `` taking back control '' , '' # 350m a week to spend on the nhs '' , and `` not having to follow silly eu rules '' . 
  only farage 's non-official ` leave.eu ' campaign used immigration as a key point . 
  if one in fifty leave voters thought freedom of movement would stay * just as the leave campaign leading light said it would * -- and would n't have voted ` leave ' if it did n't -- maybe the vote would have gone the other way . 
  or maybe it would n't : maybe there are remain voters who would have been willing to give up the economic advantages of staying in the eu in order to stop eu immigration ( but i doubt it ) . 
  seems to me that the truth is that it 's non-eu immigration ( let 's not mince words : muslim immigration ) that people in the uk are really against . 
  who really gives a shit about a belgian coming to the uk , when he has to get a job within three months or go home , and is n't eligible for benefits or non-emergency nhs treatment ? 
  and of course , the woman who promised to reduce non-eu immigration as home secretary ( and totally failed to do so ) is now prime minister , here to save us from immigrants . 
  full disclosure : i 'm a british immigrant to spain . 
  yet . 
  the ramblas , barcelona . 
  it 's just a street full of tourists , pickpockets and the city 's shittiest restaurants . 
  there is ** absolutely nothing ** there for tourists to see or do , yet every tourist who comes here goes to the ramblas . 
  if that 's the standard , [ not in madrid either ] ( https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5698/21600289150_a2169cb317_z.jpg ) .

  this is ** not ** normal for spain . 
  mcdonalds used to sell it in the uk up until the early 90s . 
  at the time they also sold ` mcdonald 's cola ' instead of coke , so every time you ordered a coke , they 'd have to ask `` mcdonald 's cola ? 
  yeah and the racists on the acid attack posts are already claiming you 're only reading about white british attackers because the media [ does n't report on muslim attackers ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/6n77o3/teen_arrested_after_five_linked_acid_attacks_in/dk7jpzu/ ) . 
  not so great for the green areas bit though . 
  it never ceases to amaze me how many people here have dogs when it seems to me not to be a very dog-suitable city . 
  when i lived in the uk i had a 5 litre reflux column still . 
  made vodka with it ( i usually steeped fruit in it for flavour ) . 
  in canarias i have had illegally produced aguardiente . 
  pretty horrible . 
  in normandie i 've had illegally produced calvados . 
  quality ranges from `` as good as commercial calvados '' to `` induces vomiting '' . 
  i lived for a year in a ch\u00e2teau in normandie . 
  there was only the ch\u00e2teau and a couple of farms in the road it was on , which was named after the ch\u00e2teau . 
  the ch\u00e2teau just had a name , unsurprisingly . 
  then the mayor insisted we put a house number on the gatepost ( and supplied the number in the approved design ) and used it for the address . 
  we put up the number , but preferred just to continue to use the ch\u00e2teau name and tiny village it was near as the address instead of `` 3 , route du ch\u00e2teau le machin chouette '' . 
  mornings , after gym , before going out in the evening ( in summer ) . 
  so could be once in winter ( on non-gym day ) or three times in summer ( on gym days when i also go out in the evening ) . 
  shampoo : i 've got a buzz-cut so just use shower gel . 
  this is the one i was going to post . 
  dunno about the rest of spain , but people in barcelona work really hard . 
  i 'm from britain , live in barcelona . 
  i can only have one flair . 
  not noticed that myself , no . 
  i can easily believe it though with the terror attacks , and the increasing number of muslim immigrants . 
  muslim immigration has happened here quite recently , and quite quickly ( not counting al-andalus ) . 
  i 'm an immigrant to spain myself . 
  so i guess my life is multicultural in that respect . 
  in terms of participating in these cultures , i am a casteller , attend cal\u00e7otadas and correfocs ( all catalan cultural things ) , i have been to an iftar , my fridge contains korean kimchi , cheese from asturias , italy , and canarias , i eat spanish , pakistani , latin american , bangladeshi and indian food ( and sometimes filipino ) , i still cook french food and keep up with french news ( i lived there a while ago ) . 
  i have friends here from colombia , venezuela , mexico , serbia and other places and i go to their cultural events . 
  i watch spanish tv , and keep up with spanish politics and news events on the web . 
  i speak spanish to b2 + level ( still studying ) and french to b1/b2 . 
  i would still say that when i lived in the uk i got a lot from the other cultures that live in the uk , especially food-wise . 
  i do n't think multiculturalism is a necessity for a society , but i do think that it can enrich a society . 
  there are things from other cultures that you can take if you want , and leave if you do n't . 
  i 'm also aware that i 'm a minority in wanting to live in an immigrant barrio . 
  that 's fine . 
  different strokes for different folks . 
  a couple of weeks ago it was the end of ramadan , and at dawn i was awoken by the call of the muezzin at the mosque in my street ( this only happens on very special days ) , and looked out into the street to see all the people going to the mosque and i thought it was charming , though i realise that a lot of people would n't and i do n't criticise them for that . 
  diversity of cultures . 
  the building my flat is in is a good example . 
  we have catalan , spanish , british , filipino , pakistani , indian , cuban , and doubtless other nationalities and cultures . 
  we 're all minorities in this building : there 's no majority culture or background . 
  in my neighborhood there are shops , restaurants and businesses representing all these cultures and many more . 
  personally , i like it , and i choose to live in the most culturally diverse barrio of the city . 
  as long as the native culture is not completely displaced , and that natives are n't expected to adopt foreign cultures i ca n't see a problem . 
  i do my bit by not forcing people to drink tea or get sunburn . 
  strange definition of public place . 
  to me it means anywhere to which the public have substantial access ; streets , parks , roads , pavements , shops , libraries , museums , etc. 
  this is the legal definition in us , uk and spain anyway . 
  i 'm also pretty sure that hijabs are not ( yet ) banned in public universities . 
  yes , i think muslims are generally happy in spain . 
  i live in a barrio with a lot of muslim immigrants . 
  my neighbours are first-generation pakistani immigrants , there 's a mosque in my street , my butcher , greengrocer , supermarket , hardware store , and building merchant are all run by pakistanis or bangladeshis . 
  they 're all just trying to make a living like the rest of us . 
  there 's no burka ban here , but i very rarely see women in niqabs or burkas . 
  hijab yes : extremely common . 
  i 'm personally against the burka ban , and do n't think there 's any chance of it happening in spain . 
  muslim immigrants seem to be pretty well integrated in spain , at least [ according to this ( old : 2011 ) government survey ] ( http://www.interior.gob.es/documents/642317/1201485/valores,%20actitudes+y+opiniones+de+los+inmigrantes+de+religi%c3%b3n+musulmana+\\ ( nipo +126 -11 -022 -1 \\ ) . pdf/0bf98a9b-bd 97-490f-8e53-0e6885a34e0a ) . 
  82 % of muslims in spain agree that `` the three great monotheistic religions ( judaism , christianity and islam ) are equally great and none can be considered superior to the others '' . 
  only 5 % disagree . 
  and only 14 % of muslims are opposed to inter-faith marriages . 
   in france they have a ban on all religious symbols in public places . 
  that 's not true . 
  it 's just hijabs . 
  [ edit : not [ hijabs ] ( https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0704/7797/products/coffee_grande.jpg?v=1477047191 ) , [ niqabs ] ( http://d2ciprw05cjhos.cloudfront.net/files/v3/styles/gs_large/public/images/15/09/shutterstock_269101841.jpg?itok=rgnvaf5c ) ] religious symbols are banned in schools and some government offices , and employers have the ( rarely exercised ) right to ban employees from wearing them , but they 're not `` banned in public places '' . 
  you know that the us and uk deposed elected , popular and liberal prime minister mosaddegh in a coup in 1953 and installed mohammad reza shah , right ? 
  and that the backlash to his autocratic , brutal and corrupt rule was the background to the islamic revolution ? 
  it 's legal , and i 'm happy about that . 
  i never gamble , and i think it can be problematic , but i 'm tolerant of people who do . 
  banning gambling wo n't make it go away ; it would just put it into the hands of organised crime . 
  problem gamblers are going to be even worse off if they are in debt to the mafia . 
  to be fair , london generates 30 % of uk 's taxes . 
  yeah , surely everybody knows that , right ? 
  pretty common in barcelona . 
  most of my friends have it . 
  i do n't .

  i 'm all for a spain of nations , but just aknowledge that not ** every fucking thing is castilla ** . 
  there has been bullfighting in barcelona ** since the xivth century ** - is that castillian cultural invasion ? 
  the flamenco originates in gipsy culture mainly around granada and spread around the south to andalucia , murcia and extremadura - is that the core castilla ? 
  has castilla even embraced it ? 
  heck , i would say flamenco is more pivotal in catalonia because of the immigration influx from the south during decades than in the rest of spain . 
  nobody i 've ever met from madrid up to the north has given a fuck about flamenco . 
  as always , it looks like you try to make everything merge into a common enemy , sometimes you call it madrid , now you call it castilla . 
  and by doing that you are effectively doing what you complain about : ** you erase the culture of the rest of the spanish regions ** , as if there was no extremadura , no andalucia , no asturias , no la rioja , no cantabria : only the really bad castilla !, 
  i really do n't think they are oppressed at all either , considering they are one of the richest regions of spain and they have a considerable amount of regional autonomy . 
  so why ? 
  i indeed guess economy plays a huge role , even more when we are in the middle of a huge financial crisis , and a lot of people believe being independent will mean their economy will be better off , but that is just my opinion . 
  * and castilla is to blame for the extension , most of the times natural , of its language ? 
  * you should understand that castilla played a fundamental role during the reconquista , which led to their language being dominant . 
  and just like people switched to latin centuries ago because of the roman cultural power , they then switched to castillian . 
  * is also castilla to blame for the fact that most channels want to appeal to the broader audience , as essentially everyone speaks spanish but not everyone speaks another language ? 
  * i really do n't understand this argument - why have tv shows in a language the majority of the population does n't understand ? 
  and remember that co-official languages are always subbed and never dubbed ( except for live events ) , so it 's not like there 's a disrespect for the speakers . 
  * and should we blame on castilla the fact that tourists think stereotypes about barcelona ? 
  * i mean , here you are n't even considering that every single city has stereotypes that are flat out false , and also , catalonia has a rich history related to bullfighting ( and you ca n't blame this on castilla as well ) , and flamenco originated not in castilla but mainly from the gypsy culture . 
  castilla ( understood as castilla y le\u00f3n + castilla la mancha + madrid ( + arguably cantabria , extremadura or la rioja ) is the biggest part of spain , and as such you could say that it holds the biggest power . 
  but still we 've had presidents from andalucia , or from galicia currently , and we 've had policies benefitting basque country ( with their fiscal pact ) and catalonia with the help of catalan parties to felipe gonz\u00e1lez and aznar in order to pass major laws such as budget , all while ceuta , melilla and the canary islands keep their special tax status ... overall , i do n't think castilla can be considered to be * dominant * over the rest . 
  also , i 'm not saying spain is nothing . 
  i 'm saying spain appeared as the union of different regions , with slightly different cultures , so saying one of those regions is n't spain makes no sense to me . 
  i 'm not claiming spain is something `` artificial '' . 
  i genuinely do n't see the problem with the first sentence . 
  and well , spanish is called that way because it is the most common language shared by the country , but even in south america they sometimes call it castillian . 
  no , that would be like saying `` catalonia is not castilla '' , which is obvious . 
  catalonia is catalonia , castilla is castilla , spain is both of them plus several more . 
  scotland is scotland , england is england , they are both different and yet they both together are the united kingdom . 
  no apologies needed !, 
  the whole `` madrid 's subjugation '' is just wrong ** in my opinion ** . 
  firstly , in 1714 , there was no such thing as spain invading catalonia . 
  spain 's king had died without children , and the new one came from the borbons in france - felipe v. however , being allied with the french did n't sound good to many catalans as half a century ago they had lost the rosell\u00f3 in a war against them , so they supported austrians and english and revolted , claiming carlos iii was the legitimate heir to the throne . 
  eventually their coalition , which was strong in catalonia , valencia and balearic islands , got defeated , and after a siege barcelona fell in 1714 to one spanish king while defending another spanish king . 
  and about franco , well , firstly madrid was the last city to be conquered by the francoist army , after being bombed quite a lot of times , and a pretty long siege , so it 's not like they did n't suffer the wrath of the war . 
  and also , blaming everything done by franco in catalonia to castilla/madrid means assuming there were no executions of left people , no land stolen from farmers , and no injustices commited in the rest of spain at the time - which is outright wrong . 
  tl ; dr : every single region in spain has been eventually fucked up , so let 's not blame everything on madrid or castilla as if they 've spent all their history trying to destroy catalonia . 
  i like it when they say `` catalonia is not spain '' , because to me it feels like saying `` scotland is not britain '' : you may not want to be part of the united kingdom , but you are definitely in an island called britain . 
  in the same way , catalonia might not like being in the same state than the rest of the regions , but to me there is no such thing as `` spain '' without any of its regions . 
  i think they should be able to decide their own future . 
  at the same time , i do n't like the idea of them voting with a distorted perspective of future and past , and i 'll explain myself : if they say they want to be independent because of money , or because they prefer having a smaller government , or because ( on line with cup ) they dislike the current idea of europe and want to drive towards a smaller , more social state , that 's fine for me ( even though i disagree with all of those reasons ) . 
  however , it really grinds my gears when i hear reasons such as : * * franco hated catalonia !, 
  catalan was forbidden !, 
  * yeah , well , franco killed thousands of people , destroyed the country in a civil war , destroyed the economies of a lot of parts , did nothing to address cultural problems such as a lot of people being illiterate , having nothing to eat , owning no land and being essentially slaves to their patrons ... and that did n't just happen in catalonia . 
  i understand you got fucked , now you should also understand we all got fucked too . 
  spain steals from us !, 
  * so ... spain also steals from the richer people because they pay more taxes ? 
  i guess they should argue that because they have private health care and education and use none of the public infrastructure as they go everywhere in helicopter , they should go along tax free , right ? 
  well no . 
  spain had a fierce protectionism which hugely benefited catalonia 's industry , which in turn made you richer . 
  i guess the payback is allowing the rest of the regions to catch up . 
  * * spain invaded us in 1714 !, 
  * that 's just ... argh , i hate it . 
  catalonia 's history has been `` revised '' lately , in a way that makes it look like it existed before fucking pangea . 
  the `` catalan empire '' was actually the aragonese crown , and there was nothing more than the count of barcelona . 
  there was no such thing as `` pa\u00efsos catalans '' , and even since the catholic monarchs catalonia became de facto part of what we now call spain . 
  in 1714 catalonia just chose to back a different king during a civil war , and even mr. casanova , now praised as independentist , said something on the line of `` bleeding for the king , the homeland , and the freedom of all spain '' . 
  i do n't think that 's specially pro-independence , at all . 
  tl ; dr : yes , let them decide , but for god 's sake , do n't vote based on stupid arguments that have been repeated again and again until they now look like the truth . 
  forgiving castilla , what for if i may ask ? 
  are castillians even a half-serious independent movement ? 
  i would n't say so . 
  and most of spain would vote against , do n't even doubt it ( though i think a lot would support a referendum ) . 
   catalonia is also much more left-leaning than the rest of spain ( though someone can correct me if i am wrong ) , which dates back to the spanish civil war . 
  naturally a political divide like that is going to lead to talk of independence . 
  i would n't say so : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/catalonian_parliamentary_election,_2012 - ciu , which in the spanish spectrum is more leaning towards the right , has been historically one of the most ( if not the most ) relevant parties in catalonia , although for quite a long time the tripartit ( coalition of 3 left parties ) prevented them from forming government . 
  they lean more towards the left than other regions such as galicia or madrid for sure , but not as much as andalucia or extremadura for example . 
  after all , their economy is based on a powerful middle-high class , with a lot of economical power , which probably does n't like left parties . 
  in the south we very often feel like the scapegoat of catalonian politicians - things are bad up there ? 
  no problem , it 's not our fault , it 's the southern regions that take our money and do nothing all day !, 
  they just live off our taxes !, 
  you may think it 's an exaggeration , but after comments like [ * `` adopt a kid from extremadura \\ [ sw region \\ ] '' * ] ( http://elpais.com/elpais/2008/07/30/actualidad/1217405834_850215.html ) from a city councillor , or jordi pujol , president of the generalitat de catalunya , saying the andalusian man is [ * `` not coherent , anarchic , destroyed , hungry , living in a state of ignorance and of cultural , mental and spiritual misery '' * ] ( http://sevilla.abc.es/andalucia/cordoba/20140827/sevp-pujol-andaluces-20140827.html ) are kind of frequent , up to the oint you get tired of being considered inferior for being born in one region . 
  artur mas has already said that he will go on with the independentist project as long as he gets a majority in seats ( which as of now he has , if we look at polls ) , regardless of whether he has an actual majority in votes or not . 
  jordi pujol was president of the generalitat for 20 + years and he said some [ pretty nice things ] ( http://www.cartasaldirector.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/10375150_744802032232040_6297099248762074744_n.jpg ) about how andalusians are destroyed people , an anarchic and poor mentality . 
  does that mean anything ? 
  no , because we just accept he was a moron . 
  also , it 's not like you are the only ones to suffer . 
  southern regions got fucked since the reconquista with all the agricultural land being divided among the rich land owners , destroying any option of improving the economy . 
  in sevilla , the very first day the spanish civil war started , our dearest queipo de llano decided it was about time to take the troops around the city , and after all the parts of the city were under control , 6000 people had died , as the orders were to shoot anyone that looked suspicious . 
  also , it 's not like everything was negative for catalonia . 
  there was a huge protectionism towards catalan products ( even stendhal acknowledged that ) that fueled cuban independece movements , first electricity and rail lines , seat production lines , support for barcelona ' 92 ... tl ; dr : spain 's one and only goal has never been to fuck with catalonia , there just were a bunch of retarded rulers that fucked the whole country . 
   do n't you think that this history alone is a reason for independence ? 
  2 quotes by 2 retarded guys ( fraga , really ? 
  ) , something done by a king 250 years ago , and something done by a dictator that fucked up all of the country 80 years ago . 
  with that filter every fucking village could find reasons to become independent . 
  [ * we 're all amigos here * ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0htrnaa8ae ), 
  there 's plenty of precedent of people calling everyone every way . 
  pp fascists , podemos communists , go back to cuba , look how venezuela is , ap was founded by a minister of franco , companys was a traitor , companys is a prophet ... 
  it 's senseless to claim offence according to what a specific media says . 
  a lot of those houses belong to banks , though , and those are the same banks that received billions from the government in bailout plans . 
  yes , the government is the one that should provide the housing , but i ca n't see what 's wrong with using the thousands of abandoned , bank-owned houses for families that due to economic circumstances ca n't afford a better place to live . 
  but becherovka is so good though !, 
  i would n't disagree with spending all day drinking it , 
   spanish history is pretty embarrassing - you had mountains of gold from s. america but ended up being fleeced by genoese then flemish bankers , while the brits humiliated you militarily and ended up being a backwater for centuries , the industrial revolution passing you by . 
  we were too proud ( and our kings after xvith century where too stupid ) to admit that things were n't going well , so we just kept throwing the american gold that was n't taken by british pirates at our army to keep fighting useless wars , and by the time the industrial revolution came , our empire was long gone , despite the efforts to keep it together by empowering our colonies and trying to put them at the same level than mainland spain in spanish ' 1812 constitution ( thank you , fernando vii , you fucktard ! ), 
  i disagree with respect to the military humiliations though - brits were also humiliated really often ( cartagena de indias or their own invincible army stand out ) , and we had arguably the best soldiers for a period of time , plus some really clutch battles like lepanto . 
  we just were n't too good at pr apparently ( as juderias defended when he introduced the term * black legend * ) . 
  they are probably more informed than the average european citizen . 
   so according to the ministry the shipping companies actually support putting a tax on them ? 
  better the devil you know , i guess .

yes , i was hoping that at least at the end of the video there would be a list !, 
  only thing i 've found is in his website ( http://stanchang.wix.com/photo ) and it only says the countries :  30 countries include :  austria , belgium , bosnia , croatia , czech , danmark , estonia , france , finland , germany , greece , hungary , iceland , ireland , italy , liechtenstein , malta , montenegro , nederland , norway , portugal , russia , sanmarino , slovenia , slovensk , spain , sweden , switzerland , uk , and vatican, 
  most people in europe care less about european elections than national/local ones , so they are used to punish the biggest parties or the ones in government . 
  thing is ... even if parties more favourable to putin win seats , how would that strengthen putin if nobody really know what the european parliament does ? 
  exactly !, 
  any place where you can keep an eye and act should be better . 
  i understand that nobody wants a chemical weapons warehouse in their backyard , but just dumping them in the ocean was crazy . 
  i completely in favour of net neutrality and i 've paid enough roaming charges already as to be really really happy about this !!!, 
  however , it worries me a bit that all this may put a burden too big on telcos and our networks do n't get the level of investment needed to keep up with other areas of the world . 
  only a decade and a bit ago we had the best mobile networks in the world , but governments got greedy and charged huge amounts for 3g licenses . 
  telcos had to write off a lot of those costs later and we have been late to the 4g party because it took them long to recover . 
  we need to enact regulation that force telcos to compete because it is a business that can turn into oligopolies very easily , but we need to be careful that we do n't end up harming them too much . 
  i does n't . 
  what net neutrality protects from is telcos charging more for certain traffic . 
  we wo n't be charged more to watch youtube than to watch any telco owned video platform . 
  i think he refers to the part of the roaming reforms . 
  if roaming is not that expensive then the super expensive hotspot need to lower prices to compete . 
  you ca n't never know for sure how your business is going to go in the future . 
  if with a new project you think you may do some profit you will hire someone and go for it ( think in a company considering about expanding to a new geographical area , no need for a new business or idea ) . 
  however , if there is a risk of losing what you already have in case that new business goes wrong , you wo n't do anything ( the cost of firing that new person would detract from other areas and you 'd be in a worse situation that before trying ) . 
  that is one of the reasons we have many small businesses in europe but very few high growth ones ... all those are in the us or asia . 
  exactly . 
  if you increase the cost of trying something people will take less chances . 
  i 'm used to it , every time i mention liberalising anything in europe subreddit i get downvoted . 
  some people are ok with me having an opinion as long as i agree with them . 
  some people are open to discussion as long as you agree with them  it 's ok , every time i write about liberalising anything in europe subreddit i get some heat . 
  i agree with you about making things easier for startups , but i think that is not enough . 
  there is no higher barrier to starting/growing a business than a rigid labour market . 
  i 've seen a lot of early stage companies going backrupt because they could not afford to make the necessary adjustments on time . 
  you are right when you say that local business ca n't relocate as easily as big ones , but they may not grow or enter new areas because of a rigid labour market . 
  europe has plenty of small businesses , what we do n't have is high growth ones . 
  only 12 european companies founded between 1950 and 2007 got into ft500 index . 
  in that same period the us created 52 ( source : http://www.economist.com/node/21559618 ) . 
  i think it is not a coincidence that we are all discussing on a platform created in the us . 
  in the us salaries are much higher than in europe , so liberalising the labour market does n't mean necessarily to reduce salaries . 
  and even if it meant that , the discussion would not be between high salaries vs low salaries , it would be no salaries vs low salaries . 
  we ca n't say that the system is working when we have unemployment rates as high as we do in europe , at least in some countries . 
  some people wo n't like it , but it is the only way to go . 
  europe is growing much less than other regions and we need to compete . 
  when economies grow and work as they should , being fired is not such a huge problem because you can find another job soon . 
  the problem is when you lose your job in a stagnant economy like most european ones and you are unemployed for years . 
  count me in !, 
  i do n't care if we are gmt or gmt +1 , but i definitely want to stop this dst nonsense, 
  yeap , and some of those key pressers are just killing time in reddit :d, 
  i agree , i 'm not as worried about salaries as for what they do when they work . 
  their job is to spend like crazy and they deliver quite well on that . 
  we should have less politicians and recover space for private initiative . 
  texas legislature meets every two years !!, 
  senators/representatives have other activities because they are getting paid only 35k usd for every two years ( everything included ) . 
  this leads to less professional politicians and more valuable people getting involved in politics . 
  i want that for europe . 
  yes they are overpaid . 
  we have too much people working in politics and most of them do nothing but show up to press a button once in a while . 
  a decently trained monkey could do this without getting paid . 
  this is true in the european parliament and in most national ones . 
  that 's correct . 
  i believe he is also quite active in protecting australian koalas . 
  he 's been talking about invading that country for some time because of this . 
  amazing , thanks for confirming !, 
  i 've read somewhere else ( i think it was in a bbc article ) that erdogan has condemned the leak and said that what kind of people did this about a top secret meeting !, 
  whoever did it is quite ballsy . 
  i guess a smartphone in the pocket would suffice , but it is easy to get caught . 
  and i do n't want to think what they would do to someone leaking top secret meetings if they are considering to attack themselves to be able to start a war . 
  you are all misunderstanding erdogan . 
  he is blocking youtube not because of the audio leak but it because he worried about cat videos . 
  he is an animal rights activist and finds them extremely cruel . 
  yeah , mtv is able to find freaks wherever they decide !, 
  bbc writer says : `` located at the crossroads of the atlantic and the mediterranean , europe and africa , spain 's history and culture are made up of a rich mix of diverse elements . '', 
  bbc writer thinks : sex , sea & sun . 
  let 's go on vacation !, 
  skip the messenger , ama request for god, 
  that 'd be fun !, 
  he lives in ikea and dresses like abba, 
  and people in reddit do not represent a good sample . 
  to begin with , to be discussing here you need some proficiency in english , which is only the official language in a reduced number of european countries . 
  i agree . 
  my identity is really complex because i have several personalities . 
  at least that is what my therapist says . 
  do n't listen to him , he 's been celebrating saint patrick 's day for ten days . 
  btw , how do you do the flag thing next to your name ? 
  ( spaniard here ), 
  this is a terrible problem , corruption is everywhere . 
  add to that overspending and ineptitude everywhere . 
  anarchy would be much cheaper . 
  it is not only what they steal , it is what they cost us when they work and approve laws from their ivory towers . 
  i do n't think putin is too worried about this . 
  for russia crimea has been a way to recover lost pride and his popularity is skyrocketing because of this . 
  maybe in the medium term people will start to care , but by then the us and europe will be relaxing their sanctions because they also need russia . 
  europe does n't have significant amounts of uranium , but most of the value added/costs in the production of nuclear energy stays where the energy is produced , not where the uranium is mined . 
  also , switching suppliers is much easier with uranium than with gas because you need less fixed transport infrastructure . 
  finally , two of the three biggest uranium producers are long stablished democracies , canada and australia ( the other one is kazakhstan ) , which are less likely to engage in retaliation like russia is feared to do now . 
  europe has very little fossil fuel . 
  nuclear needs to be in the mix . 
  anything else is unrealistic and causes energy to be much more expensive than it should be . 
  and that is a big competitive disadvantage . 
  real estate crisis take longer to recover than most people realize . 
  people get mortgages which are very long term in the peak of the bubble and ca n't always walk away for different reasons ( in some countries you are liable with all your present and future assets , in others you can but it may hurt your credit so much that you prefer to stay and pay ) . 
  i thought the same thing about using a hotmail account to steal from microsoft . 
  i do n't believe that guy could be so stupid , i believe there is something else to the story they are not releasing . 
  we all need to educate ourselves and assume there is no privacy .

  also , spain is a ** much ** better place to live than the uk , and maybe that 's the reason why you come here to live the rest of your lives and we even treat you like normal human beings ( see ? 
  we know how to free insult too ) idiot . 
  their strong `` british '' identity is , in reality , a strong anti-spanish sentiment due to franco being a fucking moron ( like if we did n't know ) to them . 
  that 's their true identity , and the reason gibraltar is how it is today . 
  nothing else . 
  gibraltar has a problem with picardo . 
  he 's the biggest fucking clown . 
  drop the tax haven thingy , drop the random incursions into spanish waters , and start persecuting smuggling/fightning dirty tactics against your neighbours and we will have the best border deal with gibraltar . 
  that will : - keep gibraltar fully british - keep gibraltar sovereignity over their territory , with all their self-government - keep gibraltar in the eu , sort of . 
  but they wo n't accept it , because they not only want to keep having full access with perks to spain but also the rest . 
  fuck off then , and good luck trading with morocco and the sea . 
  as long as i can get hawt irish men we have a deal , celtic britain . 
  obviously , just like spain would defend ceuta or melilla . 
  and we actually had to in the 2000s . 
  the thing is , will spain attack gibraltar ? 
  absolutely not , there 's nothing to earn from that even if it was at barely zero cost . 
  and there 's no way spain attacks gib . 
  99,9 % of the population would be against it and actually do something against it . 
  but the uk right now looks like a fucking child . 
  and right now we 're like ... `` maybe that 's the only thing they can do to us , being mean to us , and that 's why they 're acting like this '', 
  rome , not italy :p current-day italy has the same right to the roman empire than france , spain or romania , for example ( just like their languages , sons of the same mother ) . 
  funny coming from someone that wants to actively disobey it . 
  you must be so naive to think you can get independence and still being spanish . 
  if you 're independent , then that 's it , you chose to keep your catalan nationality over the spanish one , and that 's exactly how it works . 
  because they do n't take it off you ... you are droping the spanish one because there 's no agreement with the catalan one . 
  you are so naive . 
  what 's the source ? 
  where is it ? 
  no , have * you * heard about dual citizenship before ? 
  because it does n't work like that : both countries need to have an agreement , otherwise most countries understand that you 're renouncing to your nationality ( although to be fair sometimes this is not enforced ) this is , as i said before , very very basic stuff about international law and how things go about citizenship . 
  calling colonialism ( with its ethnic implications ) a political option you do n't agree with is pretty much that . 
  next step is calling good catalans only those that agree with independentism . 
  and it 's actually very close to that . 
  you can invoke any dank may-mays you want . 
  it 's a very creepy fascist attitude to have . 
  and i 'm not a ciudadanos supporter at all . 
   will the spanish government really take the citizenship away from everyone that decides to keep the catalan one ? 
  that 's exactly how it works in every country between just another country with which they do n't have an agreement about dual citizenship . 
  it 's exactly how citizenships work internationally , yes . 
  except then you can lose the spanish citizenship in that case , which will left you with the catalan one and no eu one . 
   modern colonialism \u2122 found the catalanazi . 
   catalans with non-catalan parents tend to be `` unionists '' more often [ citation needed ], 
  your eu membership comes from your spanish citizenship . 
  there 's no eu citizenship by born , it is only obtained automatically through the national 's citizenship of each member state . 
  if catalonia stops being spain and its citizens are asked wether they like to be catalan or spanish ( because they would have to choose ) , then those that pick catalan over spanish will stop being eu citizens . 
  this is pretty basic stuff and has been said over and over by eu officials . 
  but you look at the spanish basque side , the french basque side , or both at the same time/different intervals ? 
  i simply look at the iberian peninsula because it 's so fucking nice to the eyes . 
  you do n't have literally any proof on wether he was involved or knew what was going on . 
  you only talk about guesses and that 's it ( like `` he would be idiot if he did n't know '' ) , and there 's where your argument crumbles . 
  you call him a corrupt with conjectures . 
  but you do n't know if he 's involved at all , he could have received a discourse that he has to throw there and he just do it . 
  your definition of corrupt is so vague that you can basically clasify almost everything as corrupt . 
  that does n't work like that , because it kind of distort the meaning and the image of actual corrupt politicians that are * actually * corrupt . 
  he is definitely part of the excuses and political agenda trying to hide their shit indeed , and that makes him absolutely an undesirable political figure to have , but objectively we ca n't say he is a corrupt politician . 
  he 's a cynical one , but that 's not illegal . 
  but pp is a political party with very serious corruption cases ... not la cosa nostra -_-, 
  but you 're saying * he * is a corrupt . 
  was he ever caught , personally ? 
  is he in the middle of some judicial process ? 
  not even talking about having a proper trial and he being condemned . 
  you are mixing things up if you do n't see it . 
  he might be in a very corrupt political party , but we ca n't say he is a corrupt himself unless we can objectively say it . 
  and you ca n't objectively say it . 
  so no proof , then . 
  proof on the corrupt accusation ? 
  i 'm at the antipodes of his ideology but still was very moving this speech to me because i can agree with it 100 % . 
  `` la verdad es la verdad , la diga agamen\u00f3n o su porquero '' so much hate against him . 
  i can understand it ... but it 's about the message and that i can totally agree and identify it with . 
  this is why we ca n't have nice things in spain ( disregarding something just because it was said by someone you do n't like ) . 
  it 's also a nasty fallacy . 
  and no i 'm not a right-winger . 
  speak for yourself 8 ), 
  it 's also the deadliest accident in history : /, 
  welcome to the club of civilised people , common trait having very clean buttholes !, 
  naisuuu, 
  sorry , i ca n't upvote you . _ . 
  funny how you try to prove italy 's superior labour market with a list of countries by average wage where spain is just at italy 's levels . 
  the truth is , you have no idea about spain 's labour market and how it works , other than `` oh you have a higher unemployment rate so it might be worse hurr durr '' . 
  pretty much the same can be said about your knowledge on the spain 's different industries . 
   the fact that i wrote different papers about the subject in one of the world 's 50 best universities k. ... aaaand yet spain 's gdp per capita is surpassing italy 's . 
  might want to consider write another paper . 
  or use it to clean yourself . 
  but sometimes you just ca n't or you had shower time just a few minutes or a couple hours ago . 
  but hey , at least we know you clean your butt in the shower , and having no bidet it 's not about that you do n't want to clean it !, 
  lol, 
  you should give a lecture to yourself on what [ a situation of economic stagnation means ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/economic_stagnation ) . 
  it 's not a situation when you have a high unemployment rate but still grow at 3,5 % , but rather when you have very low growth rates * optionally * combined with a high unemployment rate . 
  and i 'm sorry to tell you , italy has n't been growing over 2 % these years , nor it is a low enough figure to be considered economic stagnation . 
  italy has been suffering a low economic growth rate for many years , and spain has not , despite how our labour market works , which you do n't understand because you wo n't be able to explain why we grow at more than 3 % with a 19 % unemployment rate . 
  just like german companies profit from cars being done here , there 's an important amount of undeclared work , and thus not entirely computing in the figure . 
  and still we manage to grow more . 
  not knowing basic things like what a situation of economic stagnation means wo n't allow you to disguise your ignorance insulting my education . 
  you should educate yourself first , then try debating about something you have a slight idea of it . 
  meanwhile , spain is overshadowing italy in gdp per capita while having the czechs at your rear . 
  well , `` less rich '' can be a synonym of `` poorer '' . 
  yeah , [ tell me more ] ( https://www.google.es/publicdata/explore?ds=d5bncppjof8f9_&amp;met_y=ny_gdp_mktp_kd_zg&amp;idim=country:ita:fra:grc&amp;hl=es&amp;dl=es#!ctype=l&amp;strail=false&amp;bcs=d&amp;nselm=h&amp;met_y=ny_gdp_mktp_kd_zg&amp;scale_y=lin&amp;ind_y=false&amp;rdim=region&amp;idim=country:ita:esp&amp;ifdim=region&amp;tstart=-276660000000&amp;tend=1427410800000&amp;hl=es&amp;dl=es&amp;ind=false ) . 
  the only year italy had a clear advantage was when we were transitioning to democracy and in the worst year of eta terrorism . 
  world bank data btw . 
  not even now when both countries are growing again after the crisis italy can compete with spain 's growth , and this is shown as a gdp per capita surpassing over italy 's , of course .

  i want to learn german now but it is pretty hard and i 'm a bit lazy to use duolingo and stuff . 
  does n't play on my phone . 
  someone create an european replacement for all of this . 
  damn i 'm jealous of the people that got to try it . 
  also is it doing a barrell roll on one of the pictures ? 
  woah, 
  you write just fine , 
  or trilingual , 
  proficiency is a big deal here . 
  almost nobody has it . 
  to get a degree you are only required to pass first certificate . 
  consider yourself lucky of having tti , i just had good ol' regular english . 
  yes that 's how i learned spanish myself . 
  on the internet . 
  english in spanish schools is a joke . 
  luckily for me , i loved mmorpgs . 
  let 's do this . 
  fair point , 
  technically not , and i say that because we used to be and we might be again someday . 
  and because i feel like that . 
  yes . 
  maybe more . 
  there 's 11,5 m catalan speakers in the world , i do n't think it is that minor . 
  i do n't even know why vatican should be a country . 
  i 'm not proud of being catalan , i did n't do anything . 
  but i do want us to be independent , i think there are a lot of valid reasons to be . 
  i know , being that he was put there pretty much by franco . 
  it only makes sense . 
  no catalan :(, 
  that sounds right . 
  it is both . 
  that 's the reason we do n't have a referendum . 
  spain fears the outcome . 
  why do n't we take over spain ? 
  we 'll help , if only you let us be independent . 
  soon ... 
  why does your flair have a german flag but it is about an european confederation ? 
  you planning to take over again ? 
  damn . 
  edit : i vote for catalonia , even though it is not technically a country . 
  sorry , i 'm not big on scottish tax system . 
  maybe they are exempt from taxes , i apologize . 
  i guess he was referring that 16yo can work . 
  i guess you can make a pretty accurate assumption . 
  i guess you are kidding but it really is the only logical step . 
  we 've had that in spain for a while . 
  i think in the end it was rejected . 
  but is there an actual serious effort to be independent ? 
  i have not heard of that . 
  if you ask me , it is n't gon na happen any time soon . 
  we could use a list , there must be hundreds of things we do n't even know exist !, 
  catalan government is rather subdued to the spanish one , sadly . 
  specially when psc or pp governs , because their main party is on a national level . 
  i see you too want a catalan flair . 
  of course we have a fucking president . 
  66 % holy shit that 's terrible . 
  and welcome to the jam, 
  that 's an excuse . 
  otherwise bomb all dictators . 
  hello . 
  expensive dangerous and stupid . 
  great . 
  there 's plenty of them actually . 
  i see lots of people in / r/barcelona looking for work . 
  hey now , some of us are n't even a country , 
  before wartime . 
  while terrible , it is nowhere near the same . 
  one is straight up theft and the other is exploitation . 
  nice . 
  stone is expensive and concrete is cheap . 
  it was a joke about how `` gibraltar waters '' are here every week but yet they are actually spanish . 
  it is quite expensive living there , i hope he makes around that much . 
  what about gibraltar waters ? 
  why is portugal stupid ? 
  you are exaggerating . 
  portugal is n't in such bad shape . 
  well there are some redditors that are 3/5ths of a redditor . 
  relevant username, 
  it 's in my flair . 
  do you really have to attack people like this ? 
  are you 12 ? 
  be civil please . 
  because the petition is useless . 
  and because the text will be released before voting . 
  now shut up this ttip crap pisses me right off . 
  i spend 200 $ a month for four people and we lack nothing except fresh fish . 
  only eat frozen fish and canned tuna . 
  most muslims do n't , either . 
  there are both . 
  not all people crossing into europe are syrian . 
  not really . 
  there are good ethnically gipsy people but they abandoned their culture . 
  their culture is terrible . 
  i do n't give a flying fuck about anybody 's ethnicity . 
  so that ca n't be racist . 
  wild pigs are pretty mean and they cause car accidents sometimes . 
  also supposedly there 's wolves in the north but apparently they are shy and do n't mingle much with humans . 
  too bad you can only vote two parties . 
  so did you and i. 
  does n't justify cruelty .

  no , the economy is on auto-pilot . 
  the 2016 budget was passed a few weeks before the december/2015 - ie . 
  the only important bit of legislation that directly connects people 's daily life to the government was correctly dealt with before the forecasted double fiasco . 
  the 2017 budget is also going to be passed soon without government , basically re-using last year 's , which is marketed as a `` compromise '' . 
  this is great , but will raise questions because it would likely cause spain to miss the deficit reduction target agreed with the ecb . 
  most government work , in most civilised countries , is independent of politics after the money is allocated - sanitation , transport , education , healthcare , etc. 
  spain is still in recovery mode - a far cry away from the depths of summer 2012 hell , but still with enough momentum . 
  the only impact from politics was pre-election polls suggesting that extreme-left podemos party would have enough power to enable a referendum for catalan secessionist parties . 
  after two elections , that has proved unsubstantial . 
  in fact , there was a bigger impact on our 10yr bond 's price by brexit than anything secession related . 
  the protests and violence have calmed down , there are no parties trying to exit the eu , and basically all parties claim to be pro-refugee . 
  spain is going to do fine however the gridlock is solved , invest your money, 
  just tried to post this link and saw it 's already been posted . 
  my favourite part :  spaniards crap on everything : in the milk , in the sea , on the mother that bore them , on the number 10 ... so true :'d, 
  finland is not in nato ? 
  wtf finland, 
  kumbaya my lord, 
  the sinking oil price and the fact that the majority of scottish trade is with england , make me think it would be rational economics to stay in the uk and use the pound . 
  on the other hand , fuck it all to hell !, 
  no no , [ * this * is the one ] ( https://youtu.be/c7blmpbr__y?t=8 ), 
  so paper and plastic go into the same one , no ? 
  that 's what i was criticising above . 
  in spain you have [ these 3 minimum ] ( http://blogsigre.es/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/contenedores.jpg ) , and most cities have [ these 5 minimum ] ( http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_8lgb3d9wrsg/ti12trapiqi/aaaaaaaaans/6qses3asemo/s1600/all_containers-525x351.jpg ) , with batteries only every few blocks . 
  [ code for different bins ] ( http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-gqbj0schyp8/ui4hjtaonci/aaaaaaaaah8/ua1mqkmbivy/s1600/colores-reciclaje.jpg ) in my original comment , that article says that aside from plastic bottles all other plastics are not recycled , instead incinerated because apparently the cost would outweigh the benefit . 
  what some plastic manufacturers were complaining , on the news here anyway , is that for many products they have not yet developed biodegradable alternatives and that this announcement is kind of a shock since the government has n't implemented more palatable reforms such as adding more bins to encourage reuse / recycling more items other than just plastic bottles, 
  [ as i understand ] ( https://www.angloinfo.com/france/how-to/page/france-housing-setting-up-home-recycling ) you put all of those into the yellow bin ( except glass in some cities , and batteries at electronics stores ) - you have separate bins for paper ( eg . 
  blue ) and plastic ? 
  at least in spain we have separate bins for plastic , paper , glass and batteries - meanwhile in france they have the one , sullen yellow bin to sort and mostly burn the plastic without trying to find reuse [ source ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/2007/02/21/world/europe/21iht-trashparis.4672578.html?_r=0 ) ( in paris and some major cities they have one more for glass ) inb4 you talk about garbage strikes in andaluc\u00eda , like that [ shit ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/12/world/europe/amid-ongoing-strikes-garbage-and-resentment-pile-up-in-france.html ) [ does n't ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-11559265 ) [ happen ] ( http://www.cnbc.com/2015/10/08/stinky-paris-garbage-collectors-strike-over-pay-cost-cuts.html ) [ in ] ( http://www.20minutes.fr/grenoble/1264789-20131217-20131217-grenoble-greve-eboueurs-perturbe-collecte-ordures ) [ france ] ( http://www.francetvinfo.fr/france/provence-alpes-cote-d-azur/bouches-du-rhone/marseille/greve-des-eboueurs-du-prive-a-marseille-3-000-tonnes-de-poubelles-dans-les-rues-d-ici-lundi-predit-fo_1806339.html ), 
  also true , we live in a post-factual world , which will be perplexing to explain if we survive this game of ww3 chicken, 
  imagine for a second free trade without lowering standards . 
  how great would it be to have cheaper ... everything ? 
  no redundant customs charges , less room for tax skirting , new employment , and a scope for allowing europeans to work in usa and vice versa without tedious visas ? 
  it would only have passed if along with not destroying standards each government had calculated that there would be a net positive effect on their own economies . 
  for me , it was already difficult after brexit , but certainly after the german finance minister buried it a few days ago , basically saying `` there 's no point pretending it 's not dead '', 
  yep , if anyone else bothers to read the very first line :  `` il n ' y a plus de soutien politique '' et `` la france demande l'arr\u00eat de ces n\u00e9gociations '' . 
  we did n't have the funds either ... and there were thousands of people living in ragged tents around the olympic mountain and prime-time beach area . 
  but if you do n't even want it , then no point forcing another rio de fiasco, 
  you 'd pass on a lifetime opportunity ... barcelona was nothing before 1992, 
  i do n't * know * , sorry , but the news is that carriers can not charge for roaming anymore . 
  this means either you can use all your data/mins/sms as if at home , or you have a cap while roaming . 
  so i would certainly call them up because that add-on either can not be charged anymore , or terms modified to increase your cap while roaming, 
  i thought free-market was the exact contention that led to this landmark decision ?!, 
  that it is unfair for this service to have natural monopolies arise due to borders ; especially daft since companies like orange , vodafone , telefonica already have subsidiaries throughout the continent !, 
  fuck em , and next we are going to fuck the electricity , gas and water suppliers !, 
  zurich airport ?? 
  like a cartoon , i was so happily taking out my 5eur note and then i see the til go `` hup up up !, 
  '' , then misery music as i take the 20 , and receive a wad of coins , and deceivingly lukewarm cocoa :'(, 
  clean answer , best answer, 
  except this is locals judging local businesses on their ability to speak the other official language . 
  it does n't , like your business , just limit itself at `` we speak this language here '' . 
  it goes so far as to point with a red frowny face that this establishment does not speak catalan ( well ) . 
  it 's discrimination , which you are entitled to , as immoral as it is - except it 's horrible when a government subsidised organisation is doing it . 
  you can debate how direct the involvement , because the generalitat is not the publisher , but the financial link is there . 
  and whether it is xenophobia or cultural protection are just descriptive words on either side of the argument . 
  but let 's focus on how evil i am for making up that this app even exists , and that no tax monies are going towards any partisan , society-dividing endeavour - such imagination i have !, 
  right , except i use an iphone . 
  and that those two idiots use `` nazi '' sparingly obviously must reflect on me , because they 're on my side ? 
  whataboutism at its best , bravo . 
  nevermind the nature of this app , its intended audience and objective , let 's focus on my ulterior motives . 
  you are closer to the putin-trump clan speak than you would care to admit . 
  i 'll part with the language you best understand : sad !, 
   no anir\u00e0s mai petit trol thanks for selective quoting, 
  - you can argue that it is n't the generalitat 's doing , but are related to this app through subsidies to this ngo - post removed for linking to an app store app not an article explaining what is happening , calling xenophobia when that is debateable , and because content is not in english anyway - by the 52 % upvotes from 50 votes , i think i am , legit , not the only one to think this - if r/europe is n't the place to discuss news events in europe , then fuck me sideways, 
  i knew about public financing of the church ( which i am against ) , but i had no idea about the fascist foundation or trains to barely-populated villages ( both which i would also be against ) . 
  see , the problem is your mission in this whole thread is just to characterise me . 
  while my mission was to denounce something i found wrong , describing the app and its purpose without lying . 
  i called it xenophobia is perhaps my crime here , while you say it 's cultural protection . 
  i have nought against the catalan language , but you are entirely contrary to the existence of someone denouncing cultural isolation . 
  my final words to you , sir , are : get bent . 
  you disproved nothing i 've said . 
  i did n't lie . 
  and if `` societat civil catalana '' ( an anti-secessionist group ) made an app purporting something like `` restaurants that reject speaking catalan '' , i would just as motherfucking angry about public monies being spent on that too, 
  you are still thinking that i 'm defending a spanish agenda , when all i 'm doing is pointing out a racist , discrimination enabling app . 
  perhaps you can discuss it is not directly linked to the government , but to counter-denounce is akin to what trump does in america . 
  persist on your alternative facts . 
  there are a total of like 8 unique users commenting , with 3-4 of us cannibalising the discussion . 
  the reason others are n't interested is because : a ) it does n't concern them , and b ) this got deleted pretty early to pick up anywhere anyway . 
  the link goes to a fucking app store , rather than a link to an article explaining the situation . 
  the only fucking idiots here arguing are n't even logically presenting the events ; instead we 're just arguing agendas and other irrelevant , ultra-localised issues that have neither relevance or interest for anyfuckingbody else, 
  app description translated into english :  do you want to improve the situation of the catalan language in businesses and establishments ? 
  are you tired of going to restaurants , bars , museums , banks ... and not being attended in catalan ? 
  download catalapp , and contribute to improving the situation of the catalan language in all kinds of of establishments within catalan-speaking territories . 
  catalapp is the new mobile app created by the `` language platform '' which allows rating and commenting on the use of catalan language when being attended either verbally , in writing or virtually at over 1million businesses and establishments , geo-located by the application . 
  thanks to catalapp , consumers can know which businesses have a more responsible attitude with the use of the catalan language . 
  furthermore , it also serves to create awareness about establishments with worse rating and the need to improve their linguistic policy . 
  for more information , visit https://www.plataforma-llengua.cat/catalapp app description in catalan :  vols millorar la situaci\u00f3 del catal\u00e0 a comer\u00e7os i establiments ? 
  per a m\u00e9s informaci\u00f3 , consulta el web www.plataforma-llengua.cat/catalapp * i started translating this before the post got deleted , hopefully it still shows up now, 
  and now we know why you are vehemently defending what is clearly secessionist agenda propaganda . 
  good on ya , truth be praised, 
  - that organisation receives subsidies from the generalitat . 
  - tripadvisor seeks to review businesses on their service ; this app is only concerned with catalan language proficiency , with negative reviews for business-owners that do n't speak catalan ( well ) . 
  - the codi de consum is not a legal requirement for operating your business : so long as you can speak one language to fulfil the legal requirements there is no obligation to learn the other . 
  - you also missed * consumer i 'm done with this thread , it 's already been deleted , please stop replying, 
  `` generalitat de catalunya indirectly but fully advertently * finances * catalapp ... '' - better ? 
  hmm , i wonder how they financed the app 's development, 
  lol - did you just prove my point ? 
  that pdf is a scan copy of the agreement between the generalitat and this `` ngo '' , providing funds though to 2018 . i think we 've now entered a [ bugs bunny cartoon ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsbon3dtwiy ) gg , bb, 
  i think i understand - it 's a link to an app store . 
  there 's really no context for an english-speaker except for the title itself , and that is n't valid content . 
  the trouble is there are a whopping five news articles on the matter , all in spanish/catalan .

  ciudadanos , psoe are n't perfect but at least are n't horrible ... or even pnv in your case . 
  i was mad at rivera during their face to face debate because of this . 
  * stop doing silly remarks and talk about how they want to cancel debt and at the same time raise money from the very same debtors !!, 
  you fool !!, 
  * i think arrimadas is already a better communicator than him ... 
  i love the denmark example , because the nitpicking that people does when putting that country as example is staggering . 
  do you realize that the danish pension system is mostly private ? 
  that layoff compensation is almost nonexistent ? 
  that they do n't have collective bargaining ? 
  immigration policies ? 
  no , i do n't think tax collection can be increased with podemos measures . 
  on the contrary , without more liberal policies the collection will only increase through higher tax rates and the best example are the councils and regions in which podemos governs or supports psoe . 
  whichever requires massive spending ( healthcare , guaranteed income ) . 
  the increase in taxes would depress the economy and skyrocket the deficit to the point the state could n't access to external financing . 
  that has been tried before , or do you think that zapatero actually wanted to cut spending ? 
  i skimmed through the one they had for the last elections , thank you . 
  i do n't know if its modern and social democrat , but definitely is not realistic ; lots of measures are unpayable or directly unconstitutional . 
  i guess we wo n't agree but that 's because podemos program is ~ ~ bollocks ~ ~ unviable . 
  even if i think that calling * communist * to podemos is n't far fetched , i think that it would be fair to use the word to mean * eurocommunism * and not in the soviet sense . 
  it 's perfectly possible . 
   well , ciudadanos is a 100 % populist party . 
  they consider themselves anti-bipartidism but they are ppsoe jr. . not even kidding , they made an agreement with psoe and have said they would consider one with pp ( all of this after saying they wo n't negotiate with either of them ) until you get absolute majority , there 's no other chance . 
  not reaching a pact until the others blindly swallow your program is not a viable strategy imo . 
  for example , they managed to get a good chunk of their electoral program in their pact with psoe . 
  if that would have go through , it would have been a successful way of implementing their main proposals with less than 15 % of the vote . 
  nobody knows , but i do n't think that will be new elections in 6 months again , although the legislature probably wo n't last more than a couple of years . 
  my bet , a minority government of the pp , who will have to sacrifice rajoy 's head to buy psoe 's and c 's abstention . 
  this time , i think the king wo n't propose anyone to pm until someone manages gather enough support to be elected by the congress . 
  the clock for `` automatic '' new elections does n't start until someone is proposed as pm and tries ( and fails ) to win the majority of the ~ ~ camera ~ ~ parliament . 
  edit : not sure if camera is valid english in this context . 
  just showing their genitals ? 
  that 's pretty mild . 
  they are capable of much , much more ... 
  that guy had a discourse pretty similar to yours and now he 's gone and here you are , with a two months old account . 
  may be ... 
  being `` black '' is a defined as race culturally-wise but has little to do genetic variability . 
  in fact in africa there is more genetic diversity than in any other place in the world since the whole humanity has lived there for most of its existence . 
  the rest of the population of the world could be the result of a single migration from africa . 
  regarding iq and race , afaik it only has been proved some statistical significative difference in the case of askhenazi jews , and it was the result of several centuries of endogamy , something which wo n't happen in large populations naturally . 
  [ i like this one ] ( http://img.desmotivaciones.es/201103/sa_2.jpg ), 
  agenda pushing if i have seen one . 
  i would call that trolling , but may be i 'm just old-fashioned . 
  i like the city but for god 's sake it 's full of beggars !, 
  pssst , you forgot to log into your trolling account before posting this ... 
  i mean into your * blatantly * trolling account . 
  it wo n't be applied . 
  it has been approved against the government wishes and since it requires a modification of the budget , it 's dubious it may be enforced . 
  if anything , shows that the government is so weak that new elections are looming . 
  law 2/2010 , so yes , in 2010 during the second zapatero 's term . 
  if we 're strict with the definitions , spain should be in the 00 's group . 
  the 80 's law allowed abortion only if the health of the mother or the fetus was at risk ( or when the pregnant woman had been raped ) . 
  the loophole was that the psychogical risks were also considered , and it became pretty easy to obtain the medical report needed to receive the surgery . 
  i guess most of them would still choose to vote for the lesser of two evils , but i think there could be also another effect going on here . 
  the first round serves as an extraordinary chance of releasing the rage and voting against the establishment . 
  but after seeing the media in shock and the traditional politicians turning livid i guess most of the disenchanted voters , who usually do n't go to vote , will be satisfied and wo n't bother to vote in the second round . 
  in summary i think the first round is more emotional and the second more rational . 
  well , you asked who i considered a charismatic french leader , and my answer is : i do n't have really a clue , but if i had to say someone i 'd say valls . 
  but i guess it 's probably because the spanish media devotes him a unproportional share of attention due his spanish ascentry . 
  is it clearer now ? 
  i do n't know , i said * i hope * . 
  valls is n't disliked in spain but it could be because of his spanish ascentry . 
  i think that in a two-round system trump would n't be the president . 
  said that , what i dread is people like to jump in the winning bandwagon and with the brexit and trump succeses this * alt-right * is getting a lot of momentum . 
  i hope the french really have some other charismatic leaders to opposse to her because we have seen that throwing technocrats at them wo n't work forever . 
  [ ... if my mansplaining is triggering you , you can either fuck off to your safe space or engage with me , and debate me , and tell me what i 'm getting wrong . . ] ( https://youtu.be/glg9g7bcjks?t=5m22s ) [ only slightly related but i saw * mansplaining * and * trump * and i saw my chance to say that i loved that part of the rant . ], 
  it 's not , thank you ( that way browsing reddit is not `` procrastinating '' but `` improving my english '' :-) . 
  why bulgaria and moldova are `` more red '' than the others ? 
  does it have any meaning ? 
  of course , but as far i know russians do n't think as themselves as europeans . 
  even less than brits . 
  you do n't dare to say that to a russian to his face . 
  time for predictions . 
  these are mine . 
  * the cup wo n't vote for mas , and with their 10 seats , they are going to drive the way to independence . 
  raul romeva will be the catalan president . 
  * money is going to fly from spain ( bye bye recovery ) , and specially from catalonia . 
  * pp is going to be the most voted party in the general elections , but psoe 's pedro sanchez will be the president , with the support of podemos , but a very weak one . 
  * the catalan goverment will start to make its state structures , but before declaring independence , will run out of money . 
  some payrolls of public servants will be late or severely cut . 
  this will be justified because of the financial asphyxia of the spanish goverment . 
  * europe : this is an internal issue of the spanish state . 
  strongly worded letters calling for an agreement . 
  * the catalan goverment will declare the independence in late 2017 and call for civil disobedience . 
  * do n't know what comes after , but we will be pretty fucked up . 
  in spain , whatsapp is ubiquitous . 
  it 's the smartphone killer app , which makes the 60 + wanting to own one , and whatsapp groups are also the preferred way of comunication between groups of people ( groups of friends , parents of classmates , family branches , etc. . . ) . 
  i wonder if this is a spanish-only phenomenon or this happens also elsewhere in europe . 
  i 'm curious about your username ... do you know who [ general mola ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/emilio_mola ) was ? 
  did you choose a fascist general on purpose or it 's another one reference ? 
  extremes , namely pp and podemos . 
  i share it with 333 persons according to the [ spanish stats institute ] ( http://www.ine.es/widgets/nombapell/index.shtml ) . 
  my second surname ( the mother 's one ) is way more common , 25.000 persons . 
  the queen is the one who fills the role of the american first lady , and she has a fairly prominent role , obviously . 
  it depends . 
  i used to think it was pretty good , but only because i mostly read non-fiction . 
  reading * seveneves * in english has been ... challenging . 
  a galician major iirc, 
  in spain we have several civil codes depending on the region you were born , which is nonsensical enough , but some of them have really outdated and absurd clauses . 
  in my region , for example , the children of a widow has to be advised by a council of relatives if the surviving parent wishes to sell some goods which are part of the children 's heritage . 
  the members of this council are chosen by an `` algorithm '' in which males have precedence over females which is obviously discriminatory .

  when jordi pujol was in power 20 years was probably its best moment . 
  edit : way better than the others at least . 
  now self-improvement cliches !, 
  for god shake !, 
   but i can not imagine to make a decent living off $ 25000 a year , most spanish people earns way less like that . 
  and it 's more than twice the average is romania . 
  calling that salary ridiculous seems almost offensive . 
   without having to deal with extreme cold . 
  4 years of prison pre-trial at spain . 
  but only a maximum of 72 hours without seeing a judge , a week if the police suspects that you are a member of eta . 
  and after that time you to have an accusation/charges . 
  even if the trial takes 10 years . 
  [ according to the wiki ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/economy_of_greece ) : russia is the biggest ** import ** partner , turkey is the biggest export partner . 
  edit : but i do n't know about agriculture only figures . 
  an order of magnitude weaker than the typical in western europe . 
  i am lazy . 
   so i am quoting the [ link about podemos ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/30wo5y/the_podemos_revolution_how_a_small_group_of/ )  spain is not greece . 
  austerity may be hurting -- the roman catholic charity caritas distributed food , clothes and help to 2.5 million people ( one in 20 spaniards ) last year -- and [ 43 % of the jobless without benefits in november ] ( http://www.elmundo.es/economia/2014/11/05/5459d73a22601d65398b456d.html ) and growing . 
  however , we also have a legal mandate of taking care of parents or children if we have means and they have n't . 
  i remember a [ case from the news ] ( http://www.farodevigo.es/sociedad-cultura/2014/09/18/condenan-padre-gallego-mantener-hija/1096107.html ) . 
  the justice forced a father to provide for his 30 years old daughter , that did n't a close relationship with him or lived with him . 
  usually going to court is not needed because we have strong family networks . 
  short explanation of the benefits for non-disable people at spain following : the unemployment benefits expire in a maximum of 2 years . 
  the insertion income , for people that is in programs for increasing chances of getting a job can last a maximum of 6 months . 
  and it pays 426 euros , but only if you live in a household with mean income bellow minimum wage ( 753 euros ) . 
  a complementary program for 6 extra months has been created for only this electoral year for people that completed successfully the previous one paying the same . 
  after that you are of of benefits unless you are older than 55 years and have worked more than 18 years then you get the 426 euros forever . 
  edit : clarification . 
  there is not public housing ( at most of spain ) or housing allowance programs ( there were , but austerity ) . 
  madrid had public housing but [ it has been sold to goldman sachs ] ( http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/10/24/us-spain-housing-specialreport-iduskcn0id0gp20141024 ) . 
  it was not enough for all the people that needed it during the crisis anyway , and the people that did n't need it could n't be forced to leave easily so it was n't very effective , but it has not been replaced with anything . 
  pp ( spanish government ) is not posturing . 
  they have the law in their side and they could have negotiated earlier if they wanted . 
  artur mas is sort of posturing ( for keeping power ) , but a big chunk of his coalition ( ciu ) and most of the party ( erc ) that supports his minority government is not . 
  he is waiting for a majority in the spanish parliament more open to negotiations and a constitutional reform for saving face . 
  if we check the [ current polls ] ( http://www.electograph.com/p/electograph-poll-of-polls.html ) , pp is going from absolute majority with 44 % of the vote to 23.8 % and it 's the only pure pro-status quo party . 
  podemos , c 's , iu and upyd want constitutional reforms for their own convictions and psoe does n't have a firm position ( about anything actually ) . 
  the president of the generalitat ( catalan government ) and his party did n't support [ independence until 2012 ] ( http://catalannewsagency.com/catalonia-independence/item/the-main-catalan-nationalist-party-points-towards-catalonias-independence ) . 
  he only moved to support it when he was put in a position when was that or losing power . 
  native speakers around 7 millions . 
  the others are people learning at school or the streets . 
   most of the benefits systems in western europe will give you this i believe are spain and portugal western europe ? 
  it should have separated level for countries with more than 20 % . 
  why are n't we providing them with benefits ( cash , housing , training ) now ? 
  [ this is not the first time that the unemployment is over 20 % in spain ] ( http://www.google.com/publicdata/explore?ds=z8o7pt6rd5uqa6_#!ctype=l&amp;strail=false&amp;bcs=d&amp;nselm=h&amp;met_y=unemployment_rate&amp;fdim_y=seasonality:sa&amp;scale_y=lin&amp;ind_y=false&amp;rdim=country_group&amp;idim=country_group:eu:non-eu&amp;idim=country:es&amp;ifdim=country_group&amp;hl=en_us&amp;dl=en_us&amp;ind=false ) . 
  the point of podemos is internal . 
  it is asking for money inside spain . 
   even if you include the unemployed as having no income . 
  what you are saying it 's true . 
  and that does n't change the fact that we have 5 % of the population living from private charities . 
  [ 43 % of the jobless without benefits in november ] ( http://www.elmundo.es/economia/2014/11/05/5459d73a22601d65398b456d.html ) and growing . 
  as average my neighbor and me have a car per capita . 
  that does n't mean that i have a car , that i do n't have two cars or zero . 
  there is many wealthy people at spain and people with high salaries , but there is also a lot of poverty . 
  both things are truth . 
   there 's no way a federal system would be an acceptable middle-way for both parties ? 
  it makes sense , but the current majorities in both parliaments are against it , at least in rethoric . 
  except , for the ethnic turks this rings some bells . 
  we did n't have commies , but we had national-corporatist economy and then third-way post-social-democracy . 
   unlike the greeks , we 're not in any immediate danger of bankruptcy . 
  with the demographics of portugal at some point you are going to have a problem due to the pensions even with the current ones . 
  do n't you have ? 
  what are you commies ? 
  it would have been their soil if they would have won . 
  and part of the last one was in their soil . 
  what 's the status of the rocks/islands between madeira and canary islands ) ? 
  has portugal got the international recognition of them as portuguese islands ? 
  i see that the map claims them . 
  that looks old-fashioned . 
  black humor is like legs some people do n't have but they should n't be angry with the people that does . 
  podemos + pp is very unlikely . 
  podemos + c 's is the easiest to sell for podemos if you listen the anti-establishment discourse of podemos . 
  removing the corrupt old oligarchs that have ruled spain since the transition to democracy and all of that . 
  the new allying for removing the old ... of course , agreements between the new parties and the establishment are possible but complicated . 
  for c 's allying with the ruling pp seems hard to combine with the promises of fighting corruption and regeneration . 
  specially with half of the leaders of pp including the pm suspected of corruption and illegal financing . 
  psoe at least changed the leader by somebody not very smart , but without a criminal record and that looked good in a camera . 
  the main [ economist of c 's said that rajoy must go in the ft ] ( http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/e2362e6a-64e5-11e4-ab2d-00144feabdc0.html ) , a couple of months before joining the leadership of the party . 
  and in general i do n't think that nobody will want to ally with pp if rajoy does n't leave , it may happen but it would be very hard to sell . 
  remember that syriza in greece preferred to ally with the anti-establishment right than with the establishment left . 
  tldr : * pp ( epp ) : spanish conservatives . 
  ** 23.1 % ** * podemos , the purple and the circle ( sits with gue/ngl ) : anti-establishment left . 
  ** 22.6 % ** * psoe ( pes ) : spanish traditional center-left . 
  ** 19.9 % ** * c 's ( alde ) : new liberal party . 
  ** 15.0 % ** * iu ( party of the european left ) : establishment anti-capitalist left . 
  ** 4.3 % ** * upyd ( sits with alde ) : sort of moderate conservative party founded by a member of the psoe that lost the elections to the leadership of the psoe and saw the market niche of moderate center right . 
  ** 3.3 % ** c 's is going to eat upyd , that it 's heading for a big internal crisis . 
  other than that it 's hard to forecast changes . 
  metodology :  electograph poll of polls is a 30-day weighted average of spanish general election polls . 
  its aim is not to predict the outcome of the election , but to gauge opinion trends . 
  the following polling firms/institutes are taken into account :, 
  private monopolies & overpriced management contracts of public hospitals and others are n't free market reforms . 
  well , that 's a tricky question . 
  you hava a point . 
  modern psoe is monarchist , contrary to derogate the concordat , support the peculiar system of restricted markets capitalism that we have ... 
  i mean the registradores de la propiedad like rajoy . 
  a left wing party , , would think that their should be done by the government . 
  a liberal party would try to adopt a free market that give the option to select between different notaries . 
  the economic discourse of ciudadanos puts them in liberal positions . 
  the discourse of podemos in social-democratic positions ( they may have a hidden agenda or no but the discourse post eu elections is social-democratic ) .

  i find such lines of thinking as hypocritical . 
  these extreme far right individuals that germany likes to demonize would say the exact same thing of people coming from very fundamentalist muslim countries . 
  the moment you put the tape over their mouths , their grievances appear more legitimate whether true or not . 
  more fuel to their fire . 
  it 's a silly goal to think any extremist element can ever be truly eliminated as long as their is suffering somewhere , but its presence can be so greatly diminished to the point of obscurity . 
  see the american kkk in the early 20th century to today for a decent comparison . 
  maajid nawaz is always an awesome read . 
  iraqi mud hats await my friend . 
  because they ca n't just shut them down with debate and better ideas . 
  ridiculous . 
  edit : thanks for bringing out the details of being publicly funded . 
  i totally agree with that . 
  instead of leaflets , let 's say seminars and classes since we 're being literal here . 
  sweden and norway come to mind as the forerunners for this tactic and frankly it 's come off as an utter failure . 
  chemo wo n't always kill you , but it hurts you . 
  europe 's solution is a painful one is what i 'm saying . 
  the cure for a cancer is typically painful and uncomfortable . 
  likewise we need to use the chemo on this bad idea . 
  what is that chemo ? 
  that 's the question , but handing out leaflets saying respect women and western values and here 's why has not worked so far . 
  the next few years will be very interesting . 
  are n't german elections next year ? 
  could this statement be her last nail in the coffin for merkel 's political career ? 
  still a thing , especially in the rural areas . 
  my family lives on the outskirts of madrid , the local shops close down during the midday but madrid itself always has a ton of activity going on . 
  it also used to affect school , not sure if it still does . 
  in the states school would be out like 2-3 , but in spain it 'd be like 5-ish thanks to siesta . 
  but it certainly seems to be a dying tradition anyway . 
  you clearly were , you were implying buddhists are just as bad as muslims in terms of terrorist activity , therefore a 1:1 ratio . 
  stop spinning your bullshit onto others . 
   reconquista4ever what  sometimes buddhists can be aggressors and sometimes muslims can be victims . 
  did i say the contrary ? 
  but you really have to suspend utter belief to say the ratio of such acts is anywhere near 1:1 for both religions . 
  that 's why i said largely . 
  as in it 's mostly as a counterweight to muslim actions . 
  to be fair , it 's largely counter terrorism against islam . 
  oh god , i detest every single one of those . 
  bullfights especially . 
  i 'm pretty sure this is what 's helping to kill off twitter . 
  facebook is n't doing this in north america i believe but it 'll take a huge hit in europe . 
  they most certainly do . 
  i 'd invite some of these people to come check out miami . 
  the cuban exile community and their descendants have a lot of conservatives among them . 
  there are a lot of legal minorities here that despise illegal immigrants because it ultimately makes life a lot harder for them as well . 
   trump is racist too . 
  perhaps you could argue xenophobic , but he 's winning the conservative minority vote most of the time . 
   closing the borders is an option but damn , it weighs in the conscious no it does n't . 
  i 'd think it 's fair to say that the average denizen had no part to play whatsoever in what happens in a place like syria . 
  i only go off the videos and images i 've seen . 
  my half brother identifies with the antifa crowd and communist groups and frankly he 's a narcissistic and loud-mouthed but you know what the say about bark being worst than the bite . 
  it 's not hard to make my half-brother cry . 
  economic migrants = / = refugees . 
  for example , morocco may be shitty , but it is n't civil war in syria shitty . 
  the rise and immediate disbanding of these far left militants . 
  they always come off as disorganized , spineless and emasculated . 
  they just happen to be very loud . 
   the spanish have a moorish twinge : /, 
  i 'm a dual citizen so if it all goes to hell i can go back to madrid . 
  you are not wrong though . 
  there are just no good choices , it 'd be between voting a snake or a fox into the hen house . 
  yeah i 'm aware of how bad the disparity is becoming in europe . 
  i believe sweden is the worst off . 
  as for china i believe it was a long term projection that the disparity would be the reason as to why birth rates will fall low enough to go into decline eventually . 
  it 's called picking the lesser of two evils . 
  from my point of view , trump is that lesser . 
  oh my , i believe i missed something interesting . 
  necrophilia a muslim thing ? 
  what the hell ? 
   temporary home because the sub saharan and middle east will see conflict resolution within the next few decades . 
  right . 
  aside form humanitarian concerns , it 's not a perfect policy . 
  they 'll have a shortage of females in the coming decades last i read . 
  something like 45 girls for 55 boys . 
  the population is on the decline now , which i 'd say is a good thing but they certainly do n't agree . 
  you say interesting , sounds terrible to me . 
  spain does n't need anymore migrants . 
  say what you will , agree or disagree , but is he really entertaining to watch and read about . 
  if bernie does n't make it , i 'm spitting in the face of the establishment and going with trump . 
  if anything he 'll make life hard for congress who will deserve it . 
  right but how prevalent is anti-abortion attacks compared to islamic influenced attacks ? 
  which is the bigger problem ? 
  this is really fucking scary . 
  setting a precedent for the whole of greece perhaps ? 
  i can imagine the fear when the number of migrant men outnumber your community . 
  not if trump beats them to it . 
  this is pretty scary . 
  pig is haram ? 
  it 's the founding of america that is a sort of pseudo mythology . 
  the spirit of rebellion runs deep in america . 
  i 'm of the opinion that it pales in comparison to the centuries of european history and culture but america has something . 
  i have n't heard about any sons ofodin patrols beating anyone up yet , but just that neighborhood watch thing they got going could bring some positive security feelings to the local communities . 
  law enforcement is seemingly strained these days anyhow . 
  `` aww still baby '' i fucking died . 
  i 'd never think a prostitute could be so god damned adorable . 
  both sides have their pros and cons i do n't think that 's a fair statement to say at all . 
  for example , germany has an abysmal birth rate , liberal societies often have a terrible birthrate but germany is right down there with japan . 
  now societies under conservative have booming birth rates . 
  of course ignoring for a moment the eethical and moral viewpoints that could come with such policies ( say making abortion illegal ) it is still a solution to a problem . 
  perhaps not one someone would agree with but still a solution nonetheless . 
  this is purely anecdotal , but i 've read accounts of people talking to german tourists and how they were more open to admitting that they do n't support the refugee policies .

  we hold the referendum to precisely know the figure . 
  it 's only fair considering how drastically the situation has changed . 
  things post-brexit should begin to improve very quickly for a scot to not vote leave . 
  if there is half the economic turmoil that is expected , i ca n't see a no to independence winning . 
  you have to account for the scots that want to be in the eu and were convinced that remaining in the union was the only way to accomplish so , but now consider independence as the only means plausible at the moment , and the scots that were unsure in the 1st referendum and were convinced by the promises from westminster regarding the yielding of more autonomy toward the scottish gvmnt , which as far as i know have n't quite come to life . 
  it is hard to believe that a scot that voted yes would now vote no , unless he 's gone insane , whereas there 's lots of people that , should they be coherent with their principles while overlooking theirnationalist beliefs , would vote yes . 
  welp autumn 2018 should be enough time to see how brexit goes . 
  best of luck to them anyway . 
  i loved that in the original eurovision epic sax song , the dude does n't even attemp to hit notes - he just grabs the sax and swings it around while sucking the mouthpiece . 
  in this video he sometimes moves the fingers , though . 
  progress !, 
  very well said . 
  i ca n't agree more with all your comments here and i would n't be able to express the same as eloquently as you . 
  you can be whatever the fuck you want to be . 
  that bus ' sole purpose is the brainwashing of children . 
  it does n't aim for any other demographic , only children . 
  this is incredibly dangerous since childhood is the stage of one 's life when principles and values root the deepest . 
  it 's not like only middle-aged people who already have a fair sense of judgement can notice the bus . 
  the bus is targeted at children who ca n't defend themselves against these messages . 
  imagine a bus with the banner `` black people are much more inferior than you . 
  treat them like animals . 
  '' , you will have a good deal of incredibly racist people who wo n't be able to correct their attitude * even * if they try years later upon realising how wrong they were . 
  this reminded me of a thread where someone asked people why they were homophobic . 
  everyone that answered related their dislike towards gay people to how they were brought up . 
  most of them , i must add , knew they had wrong values and wished it were different , but they could not help it . 
  they said they respected their rights and so on , but still could n't avoid feeling a slight sensation of disgust when a gay couple showed affection in public . 
  that 's how deep these ideas dig into your being when you are young . 
  even if you counterbalance it with rationality once you 've matured , there will still be remainings of that idea . 
  this bus is evil and i would n't mind donating it to france for their traditional bonfires . 
  who the hell denies catalonia is a part of spain?doesn ' t the whole point of wanting independence presume the belonging of catalonia in spain in the first place ? 
  and what does catalonia have to do with you saying elbrus is not in europe and making a fool of yourself by taking pride in your deliberate ignorance ? 
  2/10 the trolling needs some work . 
  you can do whatever you want . 
  for all i care you can say europe starts in perpignan and ends in lille . 
  it is your choice to consciously go against the academic concensus . 
  how do you say redneck in french ? 
  except for the fact that when you google mount elbrus , every link you find says it is the highest peak in europe . 
  elbrus is edit : west * off the urals , in russia/georgia . 
  it is widely accepted that europe reaches up until the urals . 
  there should n't be a debate really - in fact i 'm surprised to find it here . 
  i 'm being a dick ? 
  us catalans here only gave you feedback in a polite way , with arguments and reasoning . 
  you 're giving very poor reasons as to why catalan has been left out . 
  it is the official language of a country , it has more speakers that half the languages listed and i am still unsure what are the practical reasons since there 's plenty of space between france and spain , where andorra is . 
  no one brought politics into it . 
  if anything , you did by making a linguistic map be ruled by political criteria . 
  including catalan in your maps is not `` doing a lot '' ; it is making your job ... 
  for every time the referendum is denied , you all will type in a \u00c7 by mistake in the next 100 messages you send . 
  i hope someone else tells me that i have indeed came across as offended and attacked . 
  i do n't know if you 're high and drunk or i am . 
  the thing is that i feel like i 'm talking with a bot . 
  i have to re-read what ? 
  fucking hell when i see an online map i do n't run a background check on the author . 
  why the fuck am i supposed to know anything about the author ? 
  am i supposed to be aware of all the comments there are to read about the thread ? 
  i have n't felt attacked by anyone , yet you keep accusing me of being engulfed in some kind of hatred explosion hahaha, 
  good god the hate . 
  as amusing as sad, 
   catalan is only official in a microstate that is a passive user of that language , which is regulated by two institutions located in two regions of another country . 
  so is luxembourguish ? 
  are these really your reasons ? 
  they are pretty poor , to be honest . 
  hey mate , you might want to re-read my post . 
  i precisely said he probably did n't know of the existance of catalan , as i did n't think this is an attack of any kind . 
  the fuck have you smoked to think i was bitching about an attack ? 
  in what part of my post have i said he has something against catalan ? 
  what a ridiculous comment hahaha, 
  easier said than done . 
  what point are you even trying to make with the african languages thing ? 
  it is worrisome that a language spoken by 10m people is ignored in a chart about europe in the european subreddit . 
  of course we do n't know much about africa : i , like most of us here , barely ever have to deal with their languages , their cities , their geography , and traditions . 
  of course i do n't know much about them . 
  ( i still know they speak afrikaans , french , berber , arabic , portuguese and swahili , off the top of my head , so your assumptions seem to be well off so far ) . 
   and i do n't see other countries making much of an effort to make their regional languages well-known . 
  fact of the matter is that if you look at a list of regional languages you 'll find a long list of them endangered . 
  your situation is n't anomalous . 
  and what point are you trying to make here ? 
  we ca n't call out this anomaly in the map just because some people do n't give 2 shits about the language they speak ? 
  how can you even think that way for a split second , lol . 
  as a matter of fact , the languages that are endangered are so because the people that spoke them did n't bother to protect it in the first place . 
  your logic summed up : `` oh come on , do n't complain . 
  there are lots of languages that have been left out and their speakers do n't complain '' then , if catalan was to be a marginal language , because of the lack of protection and stubborness : `` oh come on , do n't complain . 
  if you look at a list of regional languages you 'll find a lot of languages like yours . 
  no one cares about a language that is barely spoken and , besides , why would you be different ? '', 
  you sometimes ca n't win . 
  erm he added irish which is barely spoken by no-one in the west coast of ireland ( i.e regional language ) , while he also added luxembourguish which has less than 0.5 m speakers and it clearly does a poor job at simplifying anything due to its small size in the map . 
  there are n't arguments at all to justify leaving out catalan , besides mere ignorance : 1 - catalan is the official language of a european country : andorra 2 - catalan is spoken by +10 m people , which makes it the 10th ( i think ? 
  somewhere there ) most spoken language in europe . 
  3 - there is enough space to put in the info 5 times . 
  i do n't think he wanted to `` simplify the map '' , that 'd be dumb however you look at it . 
  i want to think they do n't know about catalan , which is understandable , i guess . 
  catalan is the official language of andorra , though ... 
  i agree with that , but that does n't make it less of a fact . 
  besides , i do n't know if the us even wins the battle regarding sponsored terrorism . 
  i think the us has funded way more terrorist groups with much more money than iran has . 
  `` bombing , sabotage or attempted government overthrown '' . 
  that 's what the picture says . 
  i do n't think there is much of a debate , really , after wwii the usa has got the most blood on their hands by a huge margin . 
  you also conviniently forget that the us has almsot single-handedly boosted islamic fanatism to the international relevance it has today by funding ultra-religious guerrilla groups during the cold war to fight the filthy godless commies !, 
  before the coup iran was much like morocco or tunez - places where religion was important , but not that much .

  for people in the_saltmine , the most joyful news would n't be `` crimes went down '' or `` more people enjoy life '' but `` terrorist attack in france by an asylum seeker '' . 
  i think they are psychopaths , incapable of feeling empathy , and they do n't care to wish that people die if they think that would help them push their agenda . 
  and the fact that he wrote the name correctly . 
  on a serious note for a native speaker : is it correct to say `` to working with him '' ? 
  if my understanding is correct , should n't it be `` to work with him '' , because after to goes an infinitive ? 
  honest question , just want to learn . 
   one of them even questioned the legitimacy due to the low turnout . 
  still way higher than the usual ones in many other countries , by the way . . 
  well , my duty has been completed !, 
  you are welcome , france . 
  time to go to bed . 
  he is not a very good gambler if he was gambling 500 pounds for a 2 % chance . 
  also , another example of the alt-right : what they want is defined not by principles , but for what would make `` libtards '' cry . 
  oh no you did n't !, 
  they need their safe spaces , you heartless monster !, 
  i am not a fan of football , but i also have what i find a very funny coincidence . 
  since i become an adult , spain has won 2 euros and 1 world cup , then i moved to germany , and germany won worlds . 
  the only one that did n't work was the portugal prediction , although i did visit the country for a conference the previous month , so i want to believe it was that . 
  i will skip my siesta before going to bed to see the results . 
  i guess that this further confirm that i am the chosen one , which puts more weight in my shoulders : <, 
  maybe this is just all a very long , collective nightmare . 
  yes , that is why i am staying awake , to not commit the same mistake again . 
  i slept through brexit , us elections and turkish referendum . 
  i stayed awake for the austrian and dutch elections . 
  i learnt my lesson : no more sleeping and `` waking up to the news '' the next day , because all the times i have done that , the news have been horrible . 
  i am staying awake until the mathematical victory is cast . 
  op said :  immigrants have no right to benefits until they 've worked and paid taxes for a number of years if it is the law , it is a legal fact . 
  whether the law is correctly applied or whether it is the correct law to have it is another discussion . 
  but the law is what it is . 
  we both should be able to read the same law and see the same words . 
  when someone says then says :  its what many people in europe feel . 
  what i interpret is that he is saying that people can simply forget about the fact that the law is what it is and say things like `` the law gives immigrants benefits from the very beginning '' , which is a recurrent type of comment in reddit , even if the law clearly do not say that , just because they `` feel '' it . 
  again , if the law is correctly applied or not it is another debate . 
  it has nothing to do with the topic of migrants or the topic of economy or whatever . 
  for me it is a matter of `` how it is '' and `` how people feel like it is '' . 
  as an eu immigrant in other eu countries , i could post my personal experience ( that you need to work for a time before you get benefits such as unemployment ) but that still would n't be the fact , because my personal experience is not the law . 
  at the end , i did n't meant to explain why they are wrong , just that answering facts with feels is not an argument , is demagogy . 
  facts can be discussed with facts , for example , if one thinks that the other person is manipulating them , or leaving important pieces out of the presentation . 
  i am only pointing out the irony of these people complaining that the left need `` safe spaces '' because they `` feel attacked when someone has a different '' opinion , yet they cry at every turn for safe spaces because they feel attacked . 
  in summary : the left wants spaces for people not feel discriminated and attacked because of race , gender , etc --  libtard , baby adults safe spaces the right wants spaces for people who feel attacked for `` the war on christmas '' --  true grown ups that are just defending themselves against a society that never give them a break . 
  whether i agree with their feelings or not is irrelevant . 
  i am just pointing out the irony of the situation . 
  as i said in another comment : seven billion people could believe that the earth is flat , have as many referenda and votes as they wanted , and it would n't change the reality . 
  the problem is that , nowadays , people have lead to believe that if enough people believe something , it is true , which is stupid . 
  in my opinion , the idea that everybody must have an opinion about a topic and that everybody 's opinion is equally valid , no matter how ignorant or well educated is one 's opinion , is what will regress our system back . 
  there are things that belongs into the realm of opinions and things that do not . 
  one is entitled to a personal opinion , but not to personal facts . 
  and to have a respectable opinion , one has to learn the facts first . 
  i do not have an opinion about thousands of topics , because i do not have a clue or , at most , not enough information or time spent studying the topics . 
  however , it seems that the paradigm of the current population 's idea of a valid opinion is the guy in the bar who talks about something that they are showing in the tv with a clear lack of knowledge about the topic . 
  well , the ancient greeks already described the cycle : democracy leads to demagogy which leads to dictatorship . 
  and back to the starting point . 
  people mistaking feelings with facts is not democracy , it is a mixture of demagogy , populism , ignorance and purpose misguidance . 
  seven billion people could believe that the earth is flat , have as many referenda and votes as they wanted , and it would n't change the reality . 
  the problem is that , nowadays , people have lead to believe that if enough people believe something , it is true , which is stupid . 
  on a side note , i never understood the argument of `` anything else is worse '' as an argument when discussing a specific problem with something , in this case democracy . 
  people who use it blindly as an answer for everything seem to think that our current representative system ( which one , because there are at least half dozen of kinds of them just in the western world ) is what it is , like if it had been sent by god written in stone , and can not be tweaked or modified or can not be subject to any improvements . 
  it is a lazy , and more often than not , wrong argument . 
  sure , and that is the problem . 
  the other redditor complained that the feelings do not correspond with reality and , in my opinion , that is when demagogy kicks in : it does n't matter how the reality is , just how your feels are about it . 
  war on christmas , war against men , war against whites , the donald , etc. 
  all of them are simply safe spaces for already privileged people to cry about other people wanting to remove those privileges , yet it is somehow the left which have `` safe spaces '' . 
   its what many people in europe feel . 
  that is the problem . 
  we have enter in the next stage , demagogy : feels over reality . 
  why ? 
  yes , it does . 
  that is why no country in the eu will extradite someone to somewhere where they could face inhuman treatment , even if that is the law of other countries . 
  by allowing the referendum they would be necessary cooperators of a violation of human rights . 
  not only european values , but also european law . 
  the european court of human rights is pretty clear about death penalty . 
  sure , but ireland was basically pushed to become a tax haven , to prevent the backslash from the eu that other countries have received for poor performance , thus harmonization has to come with a solution to the inherent problem . 
  i am a supporter of the idea of harmonization . 
  i just doubt that a french or a german will accept that part of their taxes will go to ireland , as taxes from a richer region within a country go to a poorer one . 
  i would be glad if i were proven wrong . 
  that was the idea , but the result is not that , basically because when we created the euro , a fiscal and banking harmonization was planned , but never implemented . 
  how would you call the fact that some countries inside the eu have way lower taxes to attract companies , if not a competition ? 
  why would you describe having different taxes as `` following the same rules '' ? 
  i do n't blame ireland for it , to be honest . 
  i see it more as an eu failure , for promoting and forcing countries to compete with each other instead of collaborating . 
  i would like those runs to the bottom to end , because they do n't help anyone but big companies , however i think that a solution should be given for ireland too . 
  and the allies were as bad as the nazis , amirite ? 
  well , i see your point there . 
  why not close the loopholes then ? 
  the eu is big enough to put the pressure for it . 
  i am not a doctor in economy , but if removing the corporate taxes and taxing more on the income seems to be better , i would like to hear about it . 
  however , i have a question . 
  if a company sells in a country and obtains some benefits , but all the employees are outside such country , how would the country receive the extra tax ( besides the vat ) that this new higher income tax would cover ? 
  for me , the idea would only work if the employees of the company are also taxable citizens for those countries . 
  we do n't even have a fiscal harmonization within the common market , so i do n't see how it would work . 
  not that the current situation , in which companies simply have shell companies in tax havens is better . 
   so the company is screwing over the owner of it 's company , which makes it a lot more controversial . 
  i would add `` sadly '' . 
  sadly it makes it more controversial , when the whole issue of inventive accounting should be more controversial than that . 
  well , that is ironic . 
  it hit me like a thunder right now . 
  is there anything more inherently spaniard that a church with scaffolds and cranes , that have been delayed for ever ? 
  just substitute gaud\u00ed for calatrava , add a few layers of corruption and i think we have found the perfect summary . 
  [ the simpson predicted it first . 
  weird .

  so if you offer more , do n't complain later that the refugees only want to go to your country . 
  you do n't throw your people into a war where you dislike all sides yes you hate isis , but the others are al-qaeda and al-assad . 
  why would your soldiers die for it ? 
  we are talking about a century ago , but how is not a `` close '' country ? 
  [ look at sheet ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/spanish_diaspora ) ps : by the way because of this , i just found out that jean reno was named `` juan moreno y herrera-jim\u00e9nez '', 
   and we all know how it all ended . 
  i do n't , i have n'tr even heard of that city ; did the spaniards do something ? 
  i did n't find anything on google . 
  i think you go to your closest ; during and immediately after the spanish civil war ; spaniards fled to argentina , france and venezuela mostly ( i think in that order ) . 
  not britain , not the us nor russia . 
  later when spain was at peace , the spaniards change their destination to germany . 
  now , the difficult question . 
  can you tell me what spaniards were the refugees and who were the immigrants ? 
   eu needs unified benefits by purchasing power ehm no . 
  hi , for anyone who thinks that what france said made sense ; let 's do a recap of the beligerants of this war . 
  ** al asad ** - the dictator ; brutal and merciless but before the war , syria was kind of decent 2 . 
  ** isis ** - jihadist , murderes and slavers all approved by religion . 
  ** kurds ** - the fan favorites , but they are n't fighting for syria but to not be syria . 
  so they are on another race 4 . 
  ** rebels ** - the good guys right ? 
  these days they are led by al-nusra ; who is al-nusra ? 
  a branch of al-qaeda so choose your poison ; i 'm baffled about why france would say that ; do we prefer al-qaeda to al-assad ? 
  really ? 
  well ... yes , the west have been pushing in the same direction of al-qaeda for a while , and you can see the result on the arab spring ; tunisia , libya , egypt and syria . 
  much democracy , very safety . 
  we ( well spain has little to say here ) keep pushing for the same fail politics we 've been doing the past years . 
  did i ever tell you what the definition of insanity is ? 
  i see that the % is based on the total votes and not in the number of voters . 
  good start . 
  you assumed right . 
  german companies even came to my town ( well i 'm from madrid , more like my father 's town ; in la mancha no more than 5000 pop ) and a couple of friends ( without a college degree ) try this way ; went to germany for a few months working on a hotel , without knowing any german at all but taking german courses ; in the end they were n't really prepared to move to another country and came back on their own volition . 
  i had other friends that just went there on their own , threw some applications around and they got offers to choose from . 
  ( one of them is very succesfull there i may add but he is very talented so ... ) so yeah , i do n't know for sure , but my guess is for an eu citizen it 's going to be easy to get a job in germany ; other thing is if it 's worth it , if they are ready to move ; learn the language and etc. 
  but job offers are not the problem . 
  all of this imho . 
  about if they help more the refugees than us , well , it 's not my country and it 's not for me to decide or criticize who they help more , but one would say that a syrian may need more help than a spaniard . 
  so the problem is ; they not working ? 
  they not integrating ? 
  they staying ? 
  or what the heck ? 
  every spaniard i know that went to germany got a job fairly quickly . 
  now , not every unemployed spaniard , wants to go to germany . 
  they are not waiting in spain saying `` oh , i wish germany would give me a job '' or anything like that ; in fact there 's been programs by german companies that came here to make job offers and courses in germany . 
  if you do n't roll the r , what 's the point anyway ? 
  are you guys seriously discussing real politics of a fictional game ? 
  i side with the nords because the leader kills people with his voice and the other is a random bald guy ; get your reasons straight !, 
   their strange kind of islam random rules that forbid random things ? 
  like , i do n't know , every religion ever ? 
  what 's so strange about that ? 
  how real is this ? 
  edit : since this sentence is funny apparently , let me try again . 
  maybe , but not because of this . 
  accepting refugees from countries you have been at war 30 years ago that pray everyday for the destruction of your country it 's not the sanest thing to do . 
  i 'm totally with you ; i do n't enjoy the driking culture of north europeans and end up hanging out with other spaniards or italians at parties . 
  in a week , i already canceled my erasmus and went back to spain . 
  i did n't really get the gist of berlin ; and there was such a crappy weather too ( at least when i went ) that you could only stay home at day , and go binge driking at night . 
  that life is not for me . 
  [ basque y chromosome ? 
  ] ( http://www.eupedia.com/images/content/haplogroup-r1b-df27.gif ) but it 's still a r1b so i do n't get this super different genetics and stuff ; they are less mixed than france or spain , that 's logical but they are still related . 
  you wish !, 
  the `` neutrality '' thing is a meme right ? 
  because if i remember correctly ( and by remember i mean i just checked wikipedia ) sweden went to afghanistan in the nato operation . 
  interesting , looks like the climate change is also political . 
  i guess it was clear with the us-iran nuclear deal ; no more axis of evil ? 
  yesterday , our foreign minister was in iran too ; he said that we have to make peace with asad , because you can only make peace with your enemies or something . 
  turkey pls !, 
  of course you can sell weapons to war-torn countries ; just do n't get caught like the rest of us . 
  i completly agree on that . 
  i 'm going to do another post . 
  does people realize that this ones are going to be taken from italy , greece and hungary ? 
  that the ones that get to germany without being identified do n't count in this . 
  man , this is not going to be pretty . 
  3 per 10k people . 
  i 'm not sure , but i think we can manage . 
  they are not supossed to work anyway . 
  you get 2 refugees for 10k people ; the minimum , also each country will provide what they can ( want ) ; so pls , it 's fucking nothing ;, 
  i want to apologize to every refugee that will have the bad luck to be sent to spain . 
  i 'm sorry for the inconvenience , i know being sent to spain where you wo n't have half the benefits germany promised does n't seem fair . 
  i know you would n't even have tried that dangerous travel for this ; but this is part of the eu politics , propaganda and self pandering we are used to . 
  you will just have to deal with it . 
  and also , with the spaniards , that will think they are making you a favor for this . 
  eastern europe does not want to take refugees . 
  refugees do n't want to go eastern europe either ( well nowhere except germany or sweden really ) so what 's the problem here ? 
  also ... force solidarity is not solidarity ; it 's extortion . 
  well , if it 's doing better is not thanks to the west , and remember that there is still a three sided war going on there . 
  they lack kurds , iran supporting one side , and a no-ones-land country beside them like iraq to be exactly the same . 
   i never had problems understanding anyone from the americas well i have ; i have received tech support in mexican spanish and i have to call again and pretend i do n't speak spanish and use english . 
  edit : and do n't get me wrong , im all in for the language proficiency certificate , but the reality is that some american countries have taken slang too far . 
  so many things wrong in what you said . 
  germany is giving free movement to all the refugees . 
  second spain is ready to get our share of refugees , by our politicians and our people . 
  needless to say , we are not going to give them the welfare germany is giving because not even our citizens have it . 
  of course without the free housing and the handouts , syrians refugees wo n't bother trying to get to europe and will stay in turkey . 
   it 's not like spain never got help from others ... franco died in bed . 
  the spaniards of today are not refugees nor immigrants not sons of them , they ate dictatorship whole ; so if we help , and belive me , we want to help , it 's because we want to no because we owe the world shit . 
  i do n't know man , it really looks like propaganda . 
  if you enter the news you will see that we had photos of drown kids for a while ( i saw them before from the syrian conflict twitter ) . 
  but suddenly we got this one in the main page of all the newspapers ... 
  i do n't know man , i 'm not used to wear tinfoil hats but this really smells ... 
  well i do n't know , the germans asked for this , so i do n't know why they wo n't want this .

  good riddance . 
  i think you meant ` rabid ' . 
  although extremist rabbits as mods would be cute . 
  because that way companies do n't lose money and minister soria gets a nice position as counsellor in one of them . 
  we intervened when the civil war was well underway . 
  correct me if i 'm wrong but , in a way , i 'm starting to think the moral high ground is not something so important , i mean , no other country seems to care about it , for some people we will never have it because `` colonization '' and we are just shooting ourselves in the foot . 
  having it or not does n't seem to affect whether we can do something internally or externally , it 's just for justifying to ourselves that we are the good guys , when we are doing the exact same thing everyone else s doing . 
  does allowing something as horrible as a civil war , or a situation that 's harmful for everyone , to go on , just so we can claim something as intangible and with as little effect as the moral high ground ? 
  now , the insurgency thing is totally true . 
  but what does ` taken from nature ' mean ? 
  does a crop grown in a farm and artificially selected for centuries count ? 
  only things harvested in wild areas ? 
  even then there are plenty of natural things whose effects we do n't fully know . 
  for example : pot , and the ` toxoplasma gondii ' whose effects on human brain chemistry we do n't know . 
  dripping wet from his ass , i bet, 
  we do n't take pride on homosexuality laws from the fifties , maybe we should review asylum laws made around the same time . 
   ridiculous ignorance . 
  its well established the backwards nature of most of africa is due to the nature of the continent . 
  europeans and middle easterners were given the perfect environment to succeed . 
  only racist think the difference was due to some inherent inferiority of africans . 
  i can grant mesopotamia , but mind telling me in what sense did europe have the `` perfect environment to succeed '' that africa did n't have , especially when civilization developed later than in china and the caribbean ? 
  it 's a different way of killing each other , of boredom and frustration . 
  much more civilized this way . 
  this , you would n't say english culture is the same as russian , italian or norwegian , would you ? 
  `` one ? '', 
  we have enough to block out the ground, 
  yes , basically . 
  then i will be judged by a representative of the multinational , a judge from the country and somebody from a corporate funded organization . 
  no possibility of abuse . 
  wrong sub , buddy . 
  also , you are wrong, 
  wait , so progressive is now a race ? 
  try ten, 
  good way to pass the time while they bring you your bag of unmarked money and your ride to the airport , i guess . 
  the 2010s called ; `` people of colour '' is the pc term . 
  accounting for linguistic drift : `` coloured people '' ; which turns to : `` coloured '' . 
  he 's just ahead of the times . 
  you mean belgian cops ? 
  if so , already forgotten last year ? 
  but gender dysphoria is an actual psychiatric condition , recognizable and diagnosable . 
  edit for clarity : by which i mean it 's possible for a biologically male person to be wired in the brain as a female . 
  hey , some of us still have a moderately decent army . 
  even if we had to gut our force-projection due to economical collapse . 
  the same way profiling communist is not racist, 
  i 'm gon na say poor connection and mobile client , happens sometimes . 
  nowhere in no school are you going to earn any money until after you graduate, 
  has europe been bombing morocco , sudan and saudi arabia ? 
  go with that to the news , that 'd be a gigantic exclusive !, 
  so according to you belgium and france are now justified for bombing civilians , and usa was perfectly justified in invading iraq and afghanistan . 
  you 're a fucking white male, 
  we 've had a lot of experience with terrorism . 
  first hand , and the parts when society supported them , and parts when society did n't . 
  so yes , society can do a lot . 
  truly the capital of europe, 
  and `` near '' as in `` in the general geographical area '', 
  it 's a street light , one of the big ones used in main roads , you can see the pole . 
  it 's illuminating the smoke coming from the flare . 
  i thought it was his fathers or grandfathers surname , before they changed it to an english one during a world war ? 
  the crusades and the establishing of knight monk orders almost brought the church to another schism . 
  it is not the same situation , and you know it . 
  dropped your / s, 
  certainly not the sharpest tools in the shed, 
  the sleep i 'll lose over this !, 
  have you heard of colons ? 
  fucking saved , really needed the laugh . 
  but they are seriously mentally incapacitated, 
  franco changed it to be in line with germany 's in 1942, 
  they were only there because she puts cat food all over the house, 
  wow , you 've done a preliminary budget for the program , even !, 
  that 's amazing . 
  may i ask what metodology you 've used to reach that number ? 
  or have you just pulled a random number out of your ass ? 
  not more than asia . 
  especially korea and the south east asia region . 
  from yesterday 's front page : http://news.yahoo.com/cologne-prosecutor-majority-suspects-asylum-seekers-135156726.html i do n't know who invented that `` only three '' idiocy . 
  no , just no . 
  the middle ages were the result of a complete societal collapse and people certainly noticed their society , and all its institutions , disappearing . 
  one place it can be seen is the prevalence of writing as a form of communication , even on road signs , comercial propaganda and graffitis . 
  that demonstrates a large amount of literate citizens . 
  that dissappeared until almost the enlightenment . 
  tl ; dr people are not idiots , they notice their society collapsing around them . 
  a number that will be revised upward several times through the year, 
  when reality catches up to satire and even surpasses it, 
  is something you expect in a country with very recent terrorism problems who has n't have come around to fixing ( sometimes excessive , sometimes not ) laws made during the troubles and mending its laws to something more in line with what 's expected from a democratic , stable country , though . 
  all that said , yes it 's excessive . 
  i just hope it will make a change of laws . 
  i trust the judge will just clear them from all charges , you do n't become judgr being unable to understand context . 
  the extremists in this article multiply in mosques , have you read it ? 
  i know things are different over there , but ... yes , carrying firearms is extremely unusual . 
  concealed firearms with ammunition is even more unusual , and also a crime . 
  multiple loaded concealed handguns is exponentially more unusual . 
  i think a comparison would be somebody trying to enter disneyland in california ( was it there ? ), 
  with mustard gas canisters . 
  yes , it could be for a totally innocent cause , but the police is n't going to think that . 
  also , we have nowhere near the gang problem america has , so those statistics are pretty inflated . 
  well , it was not pegida torching those cars , were they ? 
   how many people are in arms over merkel 's treatment of greece ? 
  in southern europe , a lot . 
  and will continue to be very vocally against her and her policies . 
  if yoy ca n't even police a territory , you have little claim to sovereignity over it .

  ** americans were able to continue to buy cheap fruit and live like kings and love that marvellous capitalist system that brough them so much abundance . 
  do you understand my point ? 
  the same is happening today all over the world . 
  people in bangladesh or morocco are earning miserable salaries so that you can consume cheap clothing . 
  african mine workers are being executed for demanding better working conditions so that you have cheap batteries , electronics and jewels . 
  capitalism needing accelerated growth and thus devouring its own society ( exhausting neocolonialist dynamics ) is a whole other topic and i ca n't stay on reddit all day , but i will adress those points at a later time . 
  would you say that the nazis rose to power because of their hatred towards the jews and blacks or would you say that such movement was a reaction to a very harsh economic environment ? 
  saying that the right-wing has risen because of the refugee crisis is deliberately oblivious . 
  far right groups have always existed and inmigration was always present . 
  the real reason for the current situation is that people are angry , but instead of being angry with their system they find someone else to blame and become scared of . 
  they think * `` how can the system be wrong if it has worked so far ? 
  '' * and from that starting point it seems reasonable to believe that some external force is negatively interfering . 
  and i do believe that economy is by extremely far the most important aspect in politics . 
  do you think people would be still so reluctant towards inmigrants if they lived in a blooming society that could fairly provide for them without them feeling impotent and abandoned ? 
  capitalism is the reason for the economic decline and the increased inequality that are bringing those `` anti-establishment '' movements towards positions of power . 
  now that producing countries are becoming less exploitable and capitalism is stagnated , it has started to grow on the impoverishment of the population of western countries . 
  the eu is doomed , especially with people uncapable of recognizing that our problems are not due to some esotheric crisis of no known origin but to the predictable systemic failure of a system that was never designed to improve the lives of the masses . 
  did n't know that . 
  source ? 
  you are like those people who project their defects onto others to make critizism seem whataboutist . 
  whatever then , i 'm a propagandist and you are the holder of the truth about justice . 
  oh , and that video you showed was from the aftermath . 
  you should see the video where the massacre was talking place instead . 
  plenty of young people with ukranian flags celebrating their murders with laughter . 
  but you can keep being oblivious to the ukrainian coup being directed by fascists that openly called for the ethnic cleanse of ukraine , if you want . 
  that pic is nothing without context . 
  besides , have you seen videos about odessa ? 
  youngster were laughing as they burned people down and shot them while they tried to scape the fire through the windows , it was not self-defense . 
  but i understand you have anan excessively biased perspective being from there and you feel like it 's right to justify such atrocities . 
  probably because similar invasions of privacy have already been taking place for many years now by various global powers ? 
  i do n't think it is irrelevant but it is definitely not suprising . 
  not only it is bad because it serves as a way to localize and identify activists and oppositors but it also seems to lay the grounds for extremely authoritarian internal policies in the upcoming events of global conflict ( china and the us , among others , are also increasingly doing this ) . 
  overall a very black future seems to be presenting itself . 
  i 've never been in that sub but the times i 've seen it in the frontpage seemed to indicate a strong far-right pro-western vibe . 
  by the way , it 's you that accused someone with a different opinion of being some russian infiltrate or something . 
  the us has openly stated that they supported the coup from the beginning ( for democracy of course ) and provided financial and military aid absolutely openly . 
  it is as much of a conspiracy as that they armed islamists in the middle east to fight various geopolitical opponents . 
  are you really that paranoid ? 
  i wish they 'd pay me lol i 'm just procrastinating for my finals . 
  there is so much i could argue against your points ( the irregularity of the ukraine after the coup , the anti-russian far-right agressions such as the odessa massacre , the involvement of the us escalating the conflict and effectively turning it into a proxy war on russia 's borders ... ) but have my differential equations final in two weeks and have to study . 
  we 'll be watching you , 
   it comes after the foreign secretary said vladimir putin 's regime is `` up to all sorts of very dirty tricks '' in the world , such as cyber warfare , i actually snorted my tea right there . 
  they could preach against violence while murdering without hesitating at all , lol . 
   1 ) the `` referendum '' was held by armed green men from russia , who 3 days earlier occupied the territory . 
  if was neither free nor fair and could not serve as grounds for declaring independence . 
  ukrainian law does not allow for such a referendum to be held . 
  source ? 
  the democratic president of crimea asked for un and osce observers to confirm the veracity of the referendum but they refused to come . 
  non-osce observers from various european countries confirmed the adherence of the referendum to international law , although , according to a historian from yale , far-right groups were among said observers . 
  a journalist claimed to be able to vote by presenting her russian one-year permit to work in crimea despite not being an actual citizen . 
  a us official said they had `` concrete evidence '' for pre-marked ballots . 
  economics is not a science . 
  what you are stating is not a physical low , it 's an expected outcome with the current economic policy , which is subject to change . 
  that is our point , to change the economic environment altogether . 
   if we do n't give companies tax haven-like fiscal status they will flee to tax havens . 
  why do n't we get rid of taxes completely then ? 
  all companies will be able to stay ... anywhere !, 
  is that the point you are making ? 
  you are taking the gospel of greed as some sort of ethereal truth about humans and applying it to whatever historical event forcefitting it ( the ussr collapsed because people did n't have the chance to be greedy , the launch of the first satellite or any other feat of the ussr is then some sort of magical error that ca n't happen according to theory ) . 
  there are plenty of people who are motivated to work for a salary that allows them to live comfortably . 
  many thrive from improving the world around them and not because of some unstoppable thirst for money . 
  in fact , the only ones who are subject to this limitations in high earnings are people who put their own benefits above all else and have no problem damaging others or their own companies for their own short term profits . 
  it 's not like inequality is rising all over the world and every year records are broken about the relative wealth of the richest and the poorest . 
  it 's not like populations among most western countries are turning against `` the establishment '' through right or left populist parties because they do n't trust the statu quo and feel like their governments do n't work for them . 
  surely what we need is to allow the greedy to become greedier , that will solve the problems we are facing ... somehow . 
  i 'm sure there will be no skilled people people at all willing to work in england anymore for such salaries . 
  literally all `` good executives '' and financial especulators will flee . 
  great then !, 
  less greedy assholes willing to devour society for their personal benefit . 
  not really . 
  it was an organization composed of more members than himself that was payed those amounts for consultation services in some latin american countries ( for example military and strategic services ) . 
  monedero had not done anything illegal and was not accountable for prosecution but still payed a different amount of tax after this was portrayed in the mainstream media as some sort of corruption scandal ( even though he never even worked as a politician in the end ) . 
  because if someone can only earn a million pounds per year he will probably give up working competely as he has no incentive at all to be productive if he ca n't win one hundred million , right ? 
  something something human nature . 
  you 're still kind of an douche for shitting on him if he really has it that bad , even if he is kind of an asshole too . 
  you did n't understand his point at all . 
  can you really blame them for the futa ? 
  europe according to who ? 
  they cooperated with the german economic elites , privatized public services to gain their favour and even cooperated with the jewish witgenstein family as they were one of the richest families of the world . 
  the soviet communists expropiated the goods of those same people . 
  you do n't even provide any source for your claims , almost as if you were guided by feelings insteads of facts . 
  it all makes sense once you accept trump in your heart . 
  his source is a facebook pic with some sort of bullshit claim in bold letters that completely confirms his previous beliefs in the likes of : this is a picture of socialists protesting against the existance of jews * picture of rally against israel 's occupation of palestine * socialists = nazis extremes are the same confirmed share to spread this information, 
  til nazis are self-hating socialists . 
  did you read the wiki article i linked , at least ? 
  or are you completely in denial ? 
  i 'll explain in a way that you understand : if i say i 'm an astronaut but not only i do n't ever go to space but dedicate my life to sabotaging astronautical facilities , would you still consider me an astronaut ? 
  why would you even defend this ? 
  how does this resonate with your personal identity in any way ? 
  do you just feel the need to demonize socialism by associating the nazis to them ? 
  rofl https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/anti-communist_mass_killings#nazi_germany  german communists , socialists and trade unionists were among the earliest domestic opponents of nazism [ 10 ] and were also among the first to be sent to concentration camps . 
  hitler claimed that communism was a jewish ideology which the nazis termed `` judeo-bolshevism '' . 
  fear of communist agitation was used as justification for the enabling act of 1933 , the law which gave hitler plenary powers . 
  hermann g\u00f6ring later testified at the nuremberg trials that the nazis ' willingness to repress german communists prompted president paul von hindenburg and the german elite to cooperate with the nazis . 
  the first concentration camp was built at dachau , in march 1933 , to imprison german communists , socialists , trade unionists and others opposed to the nazis . 
  [ 11 ] communists , social democrats and other political prisoners were forced to wear a red triangle . 
   whenever the nazis occupied a new territory , members of communist , socialist , or anarchist groups were normally to be the first persons detained or executed . 
  evidence of this is found in hitler 's infamous commissar order , in which he ordered the summary execution of all political commissars captured among soviet soldiers , as well as the execution of all communist party members in german held territory . 
  [ 12 ] [ 13 ] einsatzgruppen carried out these executions in the east . 
  [ 14 ] you are an ignorant .

  and germany had no role whatsoever in that , no ? 
  maybe many would start believing that the eu is not a gigantic fraud that way . 
  they are old school right wing , not neocons . 
  they use the state as a tool for their shady business , thats why they are not interested in weakening it by lowering the taxes . 
  well , no one uses all of them to tell the truth , they are localisms . 
  ha , i wish . 
  it was a joke ... 
  where i live we have over 60 words to call rain , i 'm sure finlad has way more than that about getting wasted xd, 
  those earn usually more sure , especially engineers . 
  but many have to reach quite some years of experience before that . 
  also there is the problem that there is not enough demand for high skilled workers . 
  1700 average in spain ? 
  you are lucky if you got over the 1000-1200 eur per month . 
  so subtle . 
  well , is not like anyone takes eurovision seriously anyway, 
  and i thought polution was bad in madrid ( i need two showers in a row to stop feeling sticky everytime i visit ), 
  just imagine all the spiders that can fit in so much terrain . 
  he was supporting erdogan only because he was pro eu ? 
  seems to me that he was tasked with that role before and only now realizes that could hurt his career . 
  where was that ? 
  i 'm proud of my country for once !, 
  seriously now , i woul enjoy more tea if it werent so bad for my system . 
  but coffee is my true and only friend in this cold world . 
  i know it would mean its own deal of problems , but leaving the eurozone and refusing to pay the debts doesnt seem as bad idea now . 
  its clear that the higher ups in europe dont care if greece is burn to a crisp in social turmoil , only that the banks get their due ( with interests ) if this is what the big european project really means we would all be better without it . 
  i dont know if this is a shift or simply to use an excuse to show their true colors . 
  in any case the shift seems to be that its not a taboo anymore to show far right ideology in public . 
  make internet great again !, 
  i thought this was / r/the _ donald for a moment . 
  is this what europe is turning in ? 
  are people seriously blaming refugees over the acts of some madman ( native german madman to boot ) ? 
  they can threat with freezing all the secret accounts of politicians across europe . 
  you dont fuck with the swiss , for real . 
  a boat counts under international law as part of the land of its flag . 
  you cant expatriate refugees that are on european land without an order first . 
  hm , maybe its something cultural . 
  here women are usually way shorter than men ( they havent been so affected by the sudden size increase of the last 30 years ) and tall girls always seek taller than them guys , maybe so they wont feel so out of place . 
  it was a correct average size for people who are now in their 50-60s . 
  in twenty years average size in spain is going to be over 1.85 . 
  i dont know what they are feeding to these kids . 
  have you seen a girl going out with a guy smaller than her ? 
  there you have it . 
  well , i always was the short guy on highschool , by a head in most cases . 
  my school days would have been better if 1.77 had been considered tall . 
  which part of spain ? 
  i 'm 1.73 and was always considered small . 
  1.78-80 was the average size for people of my age . 
  and 16 year olds are surpassing that now , i think the average for todays teens has increased a lot . 
  what it used to be ? 
  what period are you talking about , wwii ? 
  they become bankers , who pull the strings of politicians . 
  we have gypsies on spain and i would be pissed too if anyone would relate me to them . 
  same continent . 
  so since pangaea split i guess . 
  they should have added a pic of an english made paella for extra effect . 
  or a spanish omelette , but we would be really forced to go to war in that case . 
  if our politicians were willing to go to a war for that stupid piece of rock we would kick them to the moon and beyond . 
  not even the most deranged ultranationalist shithead would be willing to do such thing ( they would talk about it , sure , but like most neonazis they would chicken out when faced with reality ), 
  its the rule in spain in big profile oppositions . 
  thats not to say `` everyone '' that enters has a recommendation , but a lot of people do . 
  i have friends that tried some high levels entrance exams and they were advised that they would never pass the exams without a recommendation ( oral exams are a barrier where they can make you fail or pass at will and without leaving traces of the questions involved ) the cases of judges that were trying to prosecute corruption cases and were expediented , substituted or worse in the late years is also dangerously big . 
  here you have an example of the imparciality of most judges in spain : http://www.eldiario.es/politica/investiga-presidente-murcia-miembros-pp_0_625737543.html, 
  i dont know how bad it is in other european countries but here the separation of powers is a complete joke . 
  judges had been handpicked by the political parties ( with frauds in the public exams ) since forever and the higher the instances the more corrupt is the judge . 
  the result is corrupt politicians going around for free after being condemned ( or not even being condemned at all ) and the law apparently being there just to keep the poor people in line . 
  just dont come to spain to get wasted after screwing your own country . 
  `` my policies were terrible but it could get worse if you vote those far right pricks over there ( and dont tell anyone , but i would gladly team up with them to stop a true left wing party winning the elections ) '' modern politicians ... how did we end with this mess ? 
  german seems the superior race in this one . 
  didnt the german tank division kicked the us ass until they were recalled to defend the frontlines against russia ? 
  wtf tell me you are making that up . 
  i dont know , if people enjoy that crap let them have fun , they are not harming anyone but themselves . 
  hard to miss when there were half a dozen series with the same characters . 
  i didnt knew weed was popular back in the sxv, 
  local police is usually very peaceful and `` by the book '' . 
  the `` tough guys '' more prone to violence are in the special forces . 
  they seem that way now because they are in control and unrivaled . 
  its not hate , its how the world has always worked . 
  but it would be stupid to turn a blind eye to it . 
  yeah , because the us on the last years was doing so much good across the world . 
  lets not blame on trump things that have been happening for decades . 
  - the graphs show the increase of light and gas cost between 2005 and 2015 . 
  the cost is even higher now . 
  - other basic goods have similar increase over the years . 
  - basic salaries had zero increase over that time , life cost keeps rising . 
  https://i1.wp.com/iniciativadebate.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/timocracia1_luz1.jpg?resize=640%2c495 https://i1.wp.com/iniciativadebate.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/timocracia1_gas1.jpg?resize=640%2c495, 
  but life is more expensive than on eastern europe . 
  salaries have been frozen for the last decade while basic need goods have more than doubled its cost in that time . 
  its that bad . 
  because there is no industry . 
  and this data only shows that a lot of precarious work is being created , contracts of 1-2 months where stable jobs existed before . 
  i dont see how the common people can benefit from the animosity towards russia . 
  even when i can see how a bunch of businessman and politicians can seek profit on it i reject being thrown in the same bunch as them . 
  is it ? 
  whom interest are we talking about ? 
  i know about 4-5 people from that list . 
  i dont know if thats a good or a bad thing . 
  well , russia is better suited to withstand economical turmoils . 
  so its not much as grow but to not fall when others will . 
  europe is much more vulnerable than russia in that regard . 
  yeah , the new far right wave that is spreading through europe hasnt arrived here yet .

  being old does n't mean to be confined and wishing to die . 
  there are people at 70 who are in a worse state than some at their 80 . 
  when life expectancy increases , it usually means a better well-being for people at the previous `` limit '' . 
  who do you think lives better , a 50 y.o. 
  person one century ago or someone at 70 today ? 
  life expectancy increases because we are able to develop the technology to avoid successive problems . 
  that was my surprise when i first came to germany and started to travel through the neighbor countries . 
  as spaniard , i though that richer countries would have a so much better system but not so much for now , which is worrisome . 
  i never understood that . 
  okay , you have to kill anakin but you loved him as a brother so you cry . 
  but you left him to die in the most painful way instead of just executing him ? 
  what kind of monster you are ? 
  you think you smoke too much ? 
  how sweet . 
   and sorry but rape exist in every country to much lesser extent in some but this is unfortunate reality , you perceive reality without victim blaming . 
  rape exists in every country , but not in every country so much people think that it is the fault of the victim in the sightliest . 
   there is nothing about miniskirts in this question . 
  the question is as vague as possible . 
  the title is editorialized they could simply mean that women should think more about being safe , so victim-blaming : `` i am not saying that you deserved it , but if you had wore more modest clothes ... '' what a shitty country / culture if women have to think twice what to wear for not being raped , is n't it ? 
  yes , we do . 
  but we can also hate the hypocrites . 
  i hope you are wrong , but i can not deny it . 
  sure , if you want to look it that way . 
  china has a lot of investments in more than just barcelona . 
  i am sure that france will gladly put extra money in their coastal cities to cope with the redirection of the traffic to very close cities in spanish and french sores . 
  or , even , you know , they push a bit to mas and he will relax the speech and begging the backpedal . 
  of course , that is if barcelona got independent along with the rest of catalonia . 
  in the case of a referendum , i see each one of the provinces voting independently and , historically , barcelona has n't been the most indepedentist one . 
  even more , all the previous thoughts are just in the case spain does not the same that thatcher did and place the tanks in the diagonal , which could also happen . 
  but , anyway , these are * castillos en el aire * . 
  i wish i could see it so clearly as some people here . 
  i can not predict the future . 
  edit : a word . 
  thank you for the clarification . 
  i am not from any of the castille , but i guess that i fall into that group , because for the catalan media , we are all `` spaniard = castilian '' . 
  so i will give my honest opinion about the issue : i , for one , think that raw babies are the best with hamburger bread . 
  we are spaniards . 
  we are used to get blamed for anything . 
  even when other parts of spain blames spain too , including catalonia . 
  we are a country which is the embodiment of the `` i am not like the other girls '' . 
  catalan people are spanish people , that is why there is a discussion about some of them who do n't want to keep being . 
  who are the `` spanish people '' anyway ? 
  galizian ? 
  andalusian ? 
  aragonese ? 
  basque ? 
  castilian ? 
  canarian ? 
  the spanish people are , by definition , the sum of the previous . 
  the use the trick of `` spanish people '' as an homogeneous group ( which in the catalan media seem to wish the utter destruction of the poor , oppressed catalan population ) to make a clear `` us vs them '' . 
  if they do n't want to keep being a part of the spanish group , fine , see you . 
  i always supported the referendum to decide , albeit i oppose the indepedentism . 
  but stop generalizing about us , thank you . 
  we are not homogeneous and some of us are quite pride about the diversity of our country . 
  in the latest centuries , probably the spanish civil war and the franco 's dictatorship . 
  nowadays , being in the eu means quite a lot . 
  that is why china pushed greece so hard to not do a grexit , because they have just bought a port in greece and , out of the eu , is basically useless . 
  germany could n't ( i do n't know if it changed already or not ) use their army either outside without international approval . 
  somebody said it was not possible . 
  i do n't think it is an acceptable solution , however it is not only possible but had happened before . 
  isis has tons of money to buy fake passports and plane tickets . 
  why would they risk their human resource in a dangerous travel ? 
  training a combatant costs thousands and the safe route hundreds . 
  mortadelo y filem\u00f3n is my favourite spanish comic . 
  i know others , but never really read them . 
  i never get into it . 
  however when my father was young , they were really popular . 
  it is a reference to my autocorrector . 
  in spain , asterix and obelisk are very famous , and so they are other french comics such as lucky luck or tintin . 
  we are the old world , but said we are not ready for the party ? 
  it is impossible to get bored in this continent . 
  the spanish government would treat it like an internal issue , as there is a law to actually suspend the autonomy . 
  additionally , what would catalonia do ? 
  they would have at most the mossos d'escuadra , because only spain has an army . 
  and police here is not militarized like in the usa . 
  or maybe part of the army would align with them to stop the occupation . 
  nobody knows and hopefully nobody do something so stupid . 
  then again , our president is stupid . 
  they would deploy the army , arrest the president and the political leaders and suspend the autonomy of catalonia , which would be governated from madrid until the order were restored . 
  there would be no need to bomb anything . 
  it would be a military intervention , not a war . 
  probably the military would be only needed if the police were not able to do the job because of the regional police . 
  i dont like the idea at all , but it is sadly not only possible but also not so improbable , moreso with the current government . 
  mind you that the previous president , zapatero , was suspicious about a plot of the military in regard to the catalonia situation . 
  it could happen that some military interpret their oath in a weird way and deploy the trops . 
  it is sadly not the first time we would have seen it . 
  you are hoping too much then . 
  at least in what is related to the pp . 
  who was that ? 
  i remember something about margaret tathcher and some tanks in ireland . 
  not saying it is an acceptable solution , but stating it would never happen or had not happened before ... 
  the most probable thing before a military intervention is that mas ends up in jail , as the central government have the power to revoke the autonomy . 
  as i was implying in my comment . 
  in sweden they have a monarchy and they are probably better than most of the world in terms of democracy . 
  where did i state the opposite ? 
  when reading an article , unless they are really into it , people do n't pay much attention to the details . 
  pick a random stranger in the street and ask that person which are the numbers for random countries . 
  if they state the numbers correctly , please inform them that they are doing better than half of my students , who still get confused when they have to read a logarithmic graph . 
   ofcourse , they could 've avoided all potential misinterpretations with a simple list of countries with numbers by their names . 
  they did on purpose .

  it would n't be the first time they come or pass through spain . 
  i think stupiduselessscot has a point , though . 
  islam operates a lot like an identity , so it 's really hard to approach it with the eyes of what we have done here with christianity . 
  you 're muslim first , and then , if appropriate , something else . 
  leave an identity is way harder that leave a religion , even if one implies the other . 
  you 're right . 
  39 confirmed and now talking about 60 . 
  this is horrible . 
  hopefully it 's just the confusion of the moment . 
  the numbers are very dispar . 
  i hope for the best . 
  it can be tricky if you do n't know the process or if the person who attends you wants to get away . 
  i 've had problems myself in madrid because i did n't know well what to do and they were sending me to different institutions . 
  but in my hometown , speaking on a daily basis , i have n't had any huge problem with the administration : police , post office , school , hospital , justice etc. , are all pretty diligent . 
  and the ma\u00f1ana-ma\u00f1ana thing just does n't happen with private businesses . 
  maybe i 'm just lucky . 
  i 'm aware there 're some issues with education and sanity ( heavy-demanded operations specially ) due to cuts , old webs , problems between regional authorities , etc. , but , in my experience , on a daily basis , it 's not that bad . 
  i do n't know how it 's for foreigns , though , so maybe there 's a real issue towards them , i 'm just speaking about my experience . 
  and the siesta topic just does n't happen ( i know you did n't say nothing about it , just want to condense all in one post ) . 
  nobody in my circle takes a nap after eat . 
  it usually goes like this : 2:45 home ; 3:00 eat ; 3:00 -3:45 news-sports while eating ; 3:45 -4:00 prepare , take a shower , etc. 
  ; 4:00 -4:30 leave again . 
  sorry if i made some grammatical mistake , but i 'm really tired and do n't want to revise it all . 
  new account with only one comment repeating the most insulting stereotypes . 
  seems legit . 
  when i went back to spain from a trip to rome , it was really amazing to know that i would n't be smashed by a motorcycle or a car at the first opportunity . 
  firenze was nice , though . 
  rome too spooky for me . 
  blas de lezo , a spanish admiral , was pretty badass if you ask me : from wikipedia : * blas de lezo participated in that battle ( battle of m\u00e1laga , the largest naval battle in the war of the spanish succession ) fighting itself in an exemplary manner , until a cannon ball shattered his left leg , so it had to be amputated without anesthesia , below the knee . 
  * later on , after he recovered : * [ while defending the fort ] after the impact of a cannon in the fort , a piece of wood hit his eye , exploiting it immediately , thereby losing forever the sight of it . 
  * and : * later participated in the siege of barcelona in command of campanella ( 70 ) , during which besieged the city systematically bombarding , where the september 11 , 1714 , as he approached with too much momentum to their defenses , is shot by a musket in the right forearm , leaving the limb with little mobility to the end of his days . 
  thus , with only 25 years old , we have an one-eyed young , maimed and crippled blas de lezo . 
  at that time , and in command of a frigate , he captured eleven british ships , including 20 guns-stanhope . 
  * he also participated in the spanish expedition to oran ( 1732 ) , where they defeated the ottoman-muslim troops and took back or\u00e1n and mers el-kebir . 
  but he is better known for the battle of cartagena de indias , where he repelled 30,000 english , 29 ships of the line , 22 frigates and 135 transports and other craft with 4000 men and 6 ships of the line and numerous shore-based guns . 
  he died 4 months later . 
  edit : i translated most of it myself , so there 's a lot of mistakes . 
  jeremy rayder is so badass . 
  hope he wins . 
  that 's a monstrous tortilla . 
  the normal one looks more like this : http://imgur.com/qzvwbuv eggs , potatoes , olive oil , ( onions ) and salt are the key ingredients . 
  you can do it with courgette , ham , spinach , peppers , etc. , too . 
  amazing dish , i tell you . 
  it 's a famous tapa too . 
  do n't try to trigger me !, 
  and do n't confuse the almighty spanish tortilla ( http://imgur.com/vksi70j ) with that corn flatbread !, 
  ok , here i go : i like the tortilla more without onions . 
  yes , you read it right . 
  fuck the onion barbarism !, 
  the falkland islands ^ he ^ he ^ he, 
  here the generation of my uncles/fathers/grandfathers never had english as foreign language , it was french . 
  now , most of their generation can speak/understand some french , but they do n't know a single word in english . 
  maybe the situation was similar in france ? 
  with german instead of french , obviously . 
  because the young french people i know have a normal level of english . 
  he 's french , he already surrendered . 
  he 's joking , man . 
  view of tenerife , canarias , spain : https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/98283619/m=2048_k=1_a=1/25880694c677498714a9d52a9e69f4fd i do n't think you can see something like this in continental europe . 
  look at his account , he 's a troll that creates a new account in every thread related with spain just to say the same sentence . 
  makes no sense to argue with him . 
  i do n't think that 's what he 's trying to imply . 
  bosnian muslims are known for being moderate , so their radicalization is a problem/frightening . 
  it has nothing to do with the arrest of the radicalized muslims . 
  maybe i 'm wrong , though . 
  edit : i was just interpreting the top comment of this thread because the [ removed ] comment was misinterpreting it . 
  i 'm not saying anything or supporting a concrete opinion . 
  i 'm saying this because now it seems it 's me who is being misunderstood . 
  do you have blonde/pale gypsies there too ? 
  i always thought they were modern irish gypsies . 
  they do n't mix with roman gypsies here . 
  can confirm : wine is for old people , tourists and gypsies . 
  we drink ( mostly ) beer during the week and ron-vodka-whisky during the weekends . 
  that sounds so ... human . 
  silly spaniards . 
  yep , it 's a matter of time . 
  most young people are actively against , while old people can be more reluctant to ban it or support it . 
  the problem : people between 35-50 . 
  they just do n't care . 
  my fathers , for example , ca n't stand a bullfight , but they would never do anything about it . 
  seems like they ca n't confront their parents ' generation . 
  i can into suomi too !, 
  i understand why they did it in the last elections , but now i do n't get it . 
  everybody is aware of podemos and his leader . 
  it was a great experience overall . 
  the city is truly beautiful . 
  we had some problems finding cabs/public transport , though , but maybe is because we were doing it wrong . 
  we were the only strangers , so i guess it 's normal , but it felt weird and uncomfortable how a lot of the people there were staring at us . 
  edit : we were eating at a restaurant full of people from there on the outskirts of the city when that happened . 
  funny story : i was 15-16 yo when we went there , and most of the time the waiters served these huge beers to me and not to me my mother . 
  the same when we went to the oldest brewery there . 
  even though every teen here can buy beer and so on , it 's unusual to serve them beer in front of their parents . 
  camille desmoulins , who i didnd ' t know who he was until now . 
  rip turkey . 
  yeah , i 'm an atheist too , but as i see it the religion does n't affect the political/social views of the spaniards too much . 
  their belief in god is pretty passive , i 'd say . 
  or at least that 's my experience . 
  indeed . 
  i 've seen this stereotype a lot of times here . 
  i 'm not sure where it comes from , though . 
  only old people ( not all of them , of course ) are religious in the strict sense .

  i ask an honest question , you give a reasonable answer , why do you have to be so passive agressive by adding that last bit ? 
  you know , not everything is male vs female war ... 
  6 years ? 
  really ? 
  she stabbed a police officer in the neck ... is there a huge disparity between male and female sentences in germany like in the us ? 
  edit : i forgot she is just 16 , sentences for minors are usually more lenient ... 
  of course china wo n't shut down the grid , its pretty stupid to think that , the problem of selling vital infraestructure to private companies to other countries is that you can not guarante the quality of the service , future investment to maintain and/ir expand the service and reasonable prices . 
  and no , its not as easy as to `` just take the control back '' , if you do that people wo n't be willing to take the risk and invest in your country . 
  so , sovereignity jokes aside , this is not good for the regular british citizen , some people will make a lot of money at their expense . 
  i spent the weekend on cantabria , if you wanted snow you should go to reinosa ... holy shit , the snow was up to my calves . 
  it blowns my mind how people is so desperate to get rid off trump that they believe a fucking buzzfeed article , everyone was saying that pizzagate was stupid , and this stuff sounds at the very least as crazy as that ... man i really hate this much disinformation , now everything fake news , shills and everyone who disagree with me is a shill , this last american elections have change the world for the worse . 
  edit : a word, 
  not saying any of the 28 could n't get the deal , what i 'm saying is that some countries have more leverage than others , for example , france and germany are in a better position to negotiate than eastern european countries , its a no brainer to me that if this is someone we all agree on we should do it together , not just to get a better deal , but to be all on equal ground , no point on being able to kick out of a germany people that have no right to asylum if they can just get to spain , italy or any other country and try again . 
  this , 28 countries have more leverage than one , if each country tries to do this on his own smaller countries and countries with less ties with north africa will get the short end of the stick . 
  i think it might be accurate , most people against or even neutral about the whole independence movement do n't recognize the legitimacy of all this and wo n't even bother to vote . 
  yup , let 's hope its just that . 
  not so sure this is a terrorist plot , its not new for north african people ( moroccan specially ) to dress as a cop and rob tourist , it happens a lot around airports . 
  edit : typo, 
  should n't be compared the chances of being killed by a terrorist against the chances of being murdered in germany instead of accidents and diseases ? 
  i 'll just edit this message instead of sending the same reply 3 times . 
  everyone has to accept that his life will eventually end , you might die because of a disease , because you are old or you might be unlucky and have an accident , i accept that i might get a cancer because i smoked for a decade , but i refuse to accept as tolerable that somebody ends my or anybody else life because we think different or come from different cultures , to compare a natural disease or an accident wiith terrorism is to downplay the threat , and that threat exist , remember the guys arrested for trying to attack puerta del sol in new year ? 
  they were caught because a neighboor saw an ak-47 magazine on the trash ... if the guy just threw his trash without looking in the dumpster we might have had a tradedy on new years eve , there was another story today about people recruiting young moroccans in spain to attack us in the name of daesh , wether we see it or not the threat exist . 
  so , should we live in fear and not leave our houses ? 
  absolutely not , even after what i said before we are safe , i just do n't like to compare a tragedy ( car accident ) with evil ( terrorism ) , so even if its just a 0,0000025 % chance , i wo n't accept it and i wo n't downplay it . 
  sources of the ak-47 magazine on the dumpster and the two guys recriting for isis , i just saw them in spanish . 
  it 's always moroccans or `` spaniards '' with moroccan roots the ones the ones that try to bomb us , refugees do n't wan na come here for the most part . 
  for reference to the redditors that might not know , people celebrate the new year in the plaza del sol , this year the assistance was limited to 25,000 people ... so grenades or a bomb vest could have been devastating . 
  not really when you struggle to find a job , let 's not even talk about a decent paying job , imo the house market in spain is still w ay more expensive than it should , a 150,000 $ house its 10 years of salary for most people . 
  the last part it 's why we ca n't have a productive conversation about all this , if you talk about economics i can definitely agree with you or at least find some middle ground because i would want something similar or the same for madrid , i do n't want to pay for huge subsidies that end up on politicians pockets on other parts of the country , nobody should tolerate that . 
  but when you talk about feelings you lost me , all i see is brexit 2.0 , campaigns run on missinformation and ignorance ( from both sides ) , i would never agree on a referendum that allows that kind of behaviour from politicians and press , such a big change on so many people lives should come from an informed position , not from emotions and propaganda ( again , blaming both sides on this ) . 
  as a side note , you said `` we '' when i talked about the generalitat fuck ups , i would never blame any politician fuck up on the population and i do n't want any criticism that i make about the generalitat to be taken as a criticism of all catalonia , i hate politicians , i do n't hate millions of people i do n't know . 
  are you saying the generalitat never blames or tries to distract from his own failures mentioning the central goverment ? 
  i 'm not saying that 's the only reason but that 's a big one , same way the central goverment starts talking about other things ( catalonia indepence movement being on of the main ones ) whenever they fuck up or try to pass some sketchy law they do n't want the general public to know about until its too late . 
  every time i hear a politician talking about independence all i think is in which way does he personally benefits from it , this country is full of corrupt politicians and catalonia is no exception . 
  people get very emotional with this subject , so before anyone replies i would liike to point out that i have not said my opinion about the whole thing . 
  decades of their own goverment using madrid as a scapegoat amongst other things . 
  i hate to be pessimist , but no , you ca n't defeat that type of terrorism , there is no clear organization to go after like eta or ira , they are lonewolfs radicalized online , on their local mosque or in jail , you ca n't follow every single muslim that triggers a red flag 24/7 and they proved that they do n't need explosives or even fire arms to do damage , so you lose the biggest indicators to inmediately stop someone ... 
  they kill people motivated by religion , you need to control what imams say in mosques and make sure it 's compatible with german values . 
  drop the victim attitude , everyone gets shit on here , i remember reading people that spaniards where just not looking for jobs , that 's why we had 5 million people unemployed , ignorance plus anonymity is a bad combination , very few people hate you guys , i 've never had a bad interaction with a pole , do n't let a few loudmouths represent a country or europe . 
  people have no clue about racism , they just love yo throw the word around whenever they hear something they do n't agree with or like , it 's a trend , and one i hope it dies soon , i think racism is serious enough to not abuse the word until it looses his meaning ... also , people who abuse the word might want to check out what racism of low expectations is , they might realize they are guilty of what they accuse everyone who disagree with them . 
  edit : grammar, 
  well , i just said in that post that i get profiled for drug and alcohol test when i 'm on the road . . anyway , i can see what you mean by that , as i said profiling is a tool , and tools can be used in the wrong way , the same way i would not be ok with me having a ticket just because i 'm a male between 25 and 30 years old , i 'm not ok with people being treated like a criminal because of their color of skin . 
  something similar happened in madrid after eta used a car bomb , some guy followed two armed terrorist while talking to the police . 
  source in spanish https://www.google.es/amp/elpais.com/diario/2001/11/07/espana/1005087601_850215.amp.html?client=ms-android-google, 
  no clue about this honestly , there are two mentions in the article that it 's mandatory , first time the police officer and then a co-worker . 
  bullshit article , is she trying to imply that a police officer being polite and not fining her for not having her id is racist ? 
  also , why is profiling bad ? 
  should i blame the police officer that mades me do a drug test while i 'm driving just because i belong to the age and gender group most likely to use drugs and drive ? 
  or should i blame every single dickhead driving drunk or high instead ? 
  dunno that much about german politics , this guy is most likely a piece of shit trying to take advantage of a tragedy for personal/political gain , but he is not entirely wrong , the whole refugee situation was and is a mess , you do n't have an accurate number of how many people got in , you do n't know where they came from ( thanks ngos for telling everyone to burn their passaport and claim they come from syria ) , you do n't know where they are and you do n't even know how old they are !, 
  the main stereotype when talking about german people is that they are very cold compared to southern europeans , well you chose the wrong time to act with your heart ( not that i do n't simpatize with the sentiment ) and now you guys have to thread very carefuly , you can adress legit concerns about inmigrants and refugees or ignore them and and label everyone not following the trend as a right wing nut job , altrighter , fascist and every buzzword you can imagine , but maybe not next year , but five years from now you might have a disgusting real extreme right wing party with way more power and representation than it should have , look at the uk and usa and learn from their mistakes . 
  every single region in spain has his own accent , best accent will be galician as long as it 's not too strong , heaviest and worst go together imo , rural accents from galicia , andaluc\u00eda and catalonia , it 's almost like they talk another language , very hars to understand anything they say . 
  it 's the same shit everywhere , in spain we bailed out our banks too , and now our goverment wants to bail out 8 private roads for 3.4 billion ... 
  and you better believe it if you do n't want be labeled as a right wing fanatic , opressor of minorities !, 
  yup , i 'm not wrong , someone already said that lol , not sure if stupid or propaganda accounts . 
  i wish we couls get rid off all the trash the us elections have spread on the sub . 
  pays tribute , interesting ... why not pay for housing for some of the refugees in poor conditions ? 
  can anyone define the alt-right ? 
  i remember hearing and reading about it maybe a couple of years ago , and what i got is young people with liberal ( economic ) ideas and socialy progressive , a counter movement to the pc police on the anglosphere ... and now , i see people saying they are neo nazis and fascist ... 
  words that have little to no meaning to me since people abuse them too much . 
  i disagree , that statement it 's not racist because of the context , he is talking about moroccans as a group because of their crime rates , not because the color of their skin , if people wanted to talk about inmigration and what issues might bring instead of just shouting racist at anyone raising a cuesti\u00f3n we would not have that many far right movements across europe , or at the very least , they would not have any representation . 
  i do n't think anyone cares about his sex life , but is funny to see an islamist gay , you know , isis throw people off buildings for that very reason ... 
  yup , only around christmas , next time you come to spain try to make the trip during the semana santa and try our torrijas . 
  ugh , peoople downvoting different opinions instead of debating ... 
  i would normaly agree with youu , you ca n't just force companies to raise salaries like that , is something close to a 30 % increase to the current minimum wage ( 636 $ if i recall correctly ) , companies will fire people left and right to make up for that extra money they have to expend on salaries ... the problem is that people can not live with the minimum wage , in madrid the cheapest rent you can find is around 400-450 $ , you ca n't afford that plus bills ( electricity in spain is amongst the most expensives ones in the eu ) , food , a transport card/fuel and a long etc. , even if you cut out any social activity . 
  somethings needs to be done , is this a solution ? 
  probably not , it will do both good and harm , but honestly , i do n't see a way out of our current situation : /, 
  ca n't blame the judge for not trusting his claims if he brought them up after his first application was rejected . 
  pretty awful situation to be in :(, 
  42 \u00b0 yesterday at 3 pm , my dog was burning his paws when i got him to take a walk when i came from work :(, 
  i just saw it on tv , glad they did n't need to use lethal force , let 's hope he rots in jail for a very long time . 
  would be interesting to see a graph like this one but about crime in general , assault , murder , theft etc. 
  yup , love the movie but that 's not what i 'm talking about , i fear a genocide if things go really out of control with tena of millions of people trying to rush to europe . 
  i really hope i 'm just talking nonsense and we are able to help african countries to maintain a healthy and self sustainable population . 
  i 'm glad i wo n't be alive to see that , because if i 'm sure something wo n't change by 2100 is that politicians will still ignore issues until they explode in their faces , and if the far right support increased during the last couple of years ... what will happen when the migration problem is 20 worst ? 
  the mods my remove this post and ask you to go to / r/askeurope instead . 
  things to see in madrid , well , what do you enjoy ? 
  i could tell you several museums but you might not like art . 
  regardless of preferences , you have to visit el retiro , big park in the center of the city , very close to gran via , sol and opera , you 'll have plenty of stores around there and places to eat , both local and international chains , i could tell you quite a few places to go , send me a private if you want some addresses , if you are american or from northern europe i can almost guarantee you you have nothing similar to mercado de san fernando , pretty cool place to eat , take some drinks , or both , specially saturdays when they have events , people playing music , dancing etc it 's really hot right now in madrid , bring sunscreen even if you are not pastry white . 
  europe is failing once again to protect his jewish population , i see people being fined for comments against islam , refugees and migrants , but i rarely see people being fined for anti semitic comments or even direct calls of violence , canada sent to prison an imam for calling for the death of jews , why do n't we do the same ? 
  we have laws that allow it . 
  i 'm talking about muslims because this particular murder was committed by one , you can apply everything i said to the far right too . 
  he must listen to ben shapiro every day . 
  let me fix that for you buddy !, 
  `` there is wide support amongst people who would benefit from it that the corporate tax should be roughly zero '' i could keep going telling you how money goes in corporations an disappears in bribes , we could call it lobbying if you are not comfortable with the real name , and tax havens . 
  as always , we need migrants because paying fair wages so i can afford to give a decent life to my kids it 's not an option ... fuck this system, 
  not sure if it 's a good idea to make it public and show your face , look at how many muslims sent threats to that liberal mosque , i would be surprised if this is well received in the muslim community . 
  hold my beer !, 
  i will disagree with 99.99999 % of the things she says , still , i do n't want a linch mob to beat the shit out of a young girl for wrong thinking , does n't matter how disgusting i find what she says . 
  just do a quick thing for me , change lauren southern and far right for muslim and islam and tell me if you find that same phrase you said acceptable , what you think about violence being justified against the far right to protect europe from fascism is the exact same thing they think about themselves using violence to protect europe against islam . 
  how progressive of you !, 
  so bad they did n't beat the shit out of a woman i disagree with !, 
  i dislike lauren , but you are both a coward and a cunt . 
  til , spain took part on libya . 
  from wikipedia : spain participated in air control and maritime surveillance missions to prevent the inflow of arms to the libyan regime . 
  spain also made available to nato the spanish air base at rota . 
  til , you have any source so i can read more about this ? 
  til , you have any source so i can read more about this ? 
  you kill your pets before committing suicide ? 
  you guys up north are savages,

  and even then i though greece was only questioned on euro membership ? 
  ( eu membership being pretty safe ), 
  doe n't thay already exist ? 
  i thought the single european market was already a thing in the eu ( and eea ), 
  to be fair i checked the polling once and out of the countries without the euro and without an optout , sweden and another one ( czech republic i think ? ), 
  did have large majorities against joining . 
  however of the others poland had a roughly 50-50 split and everyone else was mostly in favour . 
  not like they should be forced of course . 
  all ( except denmark ) are forced to join eventually , but that eventually can come in a very long time . 
  i personally prefer the montenegro one . 
  minimum of 55 % yes . 
  not sure if it had minimum turnout . 
  alternatively just ask for say , 40 % of the total voting population ( and more yes than no , either by 50 % +1 or by 55 % ), 
  personally i feel like these kinds of referendums should come with a clause not allowing more on the same subject on the next 25 years or so ( maybe add an exception if there 's a supermajority in parliament like say , 2/3 or 4/5 ), 
  well , we have tons of people with that mindset about catalonia . 
  it 's basically a `` i want to stay but the voice of the people should be heard '' thing . 
  pff get on our level . 
  almost a year and we almost went to a 3rd round of elections :p and belgium is like the grand masters of long coalition talks . 
  currently 22c . 
  today has been a cloudy day tbh . 
  not exactly thr best weather to go to the beach ( although not too bad either i guess ) . 
  no rain though . 
  to be fair that also means that not all candidates run in all countries . 
  if i had wanted , say , nigel farage ( efdd ) as eu commision president for some bizarre reason , i could not vote for him as no efdd members exist in spain . 
  similar for a brit who wanted to vote for junker for example, 
  in ireland at large maybe , but probably not in northern ireland, 
  i personally feel like this kind of votes are `` once in a generation '' deals , and that scotland should n't have another referendum in at the very least 20 years ( when people born now would be able to vote ) . 
  fine , so now i can go wear a hat in class ? 
  afaik the only successful far leftist reciently is corbyn in the uk , and he is not prime minister anyways , he just overperformed a lot . 
  in fact the only eu government with an arguably far left leader is greece with tsipras , and i do n't think he is far left in inmigration anyways and has also moderated a lot i think . 
  melenchon lost , france elected a centrist . 
  the netherlands have quite a right wing parliament now . 
  pablo iglesias lost , spain elected a right wing pm . 
  either a small plot of land is occupied ( fairly easy on lybia , they have a lot of stuff to worry about ) , or they are bribed ( easy on tunisia/egypt/morocco , they have fairly stable governments ), 
  east germany entered the eu automatically when they fused with west germany . 
  why would it be different for ireland ? 
  yeah , same here . 
  at least here in spain ( idk about france ) a party getting an absolute majority means they have a blank check to do whatever they want for the next 4 years . 
  2 round elections . 
  macron 's party is not that great as a first choice , but because it 's a centrist party , the left will vote it to keep out the right and the right will vote it to keep out the left every time there 's a runoff . 
  i think the us use a similar system in some states ( louisiana and california iirc ) . 
  not sure if that makes louisianan and californian politicians more centrist though . 
  yeah , same here . 
  absolute lowest majority was in 1989 , when 40 % of votes gave exactly 175 mps ( half of parliament ) . 
  for the most part in spain if you are at 40 % + you 'll probably get an absolute majority unless the opposition is also very unified ( like in 2008 , when one party won 45 % but did n't get a majority because the opposition got 43 % or so ), 
  well , rajoy might be very corrupt , but at least he is not crazy so i guess us ? . 
   i hope when we leave , you start reforming spain and you can finally get a federal state . 
  actually the opposite is more likely . 
  if catalonia ( and the basque country ) leave , spain will probably become more centralized not less . 
  :( who will stand up for a federal state ? 
  only the canary islands and valencia have regionalists represented in parliament , and only 1 from the canary islands contested the election alone ( cc ; nc went inside psoe and compromis inside up ) . 
  hopefully i 'm wrong and we at least keep status quo powered by the remaining communities with nationalist sentiments ( valencia , balearic islands , canary islands and galicia ) but centralism will probably become more powerful . 
  for all what 's worth i did the math and if catalonia did n't exist pp would have won 2008 by 2 mps , but lost 2004 ( 1 mp less than psoe ) . 
   but i do n't want to take part on this reform . 
  i 'm already too tired of spain ... such a complex and difficult country . 
  so many problems that should have been solved decades ago , and still persist ; like the fascism that still resists . 
  i do not agree in this . 
  being a complex and difficult country is what makes spain good imo :d also , the fascism is almost nonexistant . 
  franco died over 40 years ago . 
  falange still exists sure , but they get what , 0.05 % ? 
  they do n't even have councillors in any townhall !, 
  ( and we have quite a lot of them ), 
  yeah , i am not really that in favour of one but i agree . 
  illegal ? 
  sure . 
  legitimate ? 
  seeing how rajoy will do absolutely nothing , probably . 
  i do wish there was more dialog and an agreement on some midle point ( federal state ? ), 
  was reached :(, 
  spain is not a soviet oppressive dictatorship . 
  maybe in the 60s you would be right but not now . 
  probably more like 1 lithuanian guy . 
  or is the lithuanian pm somehow in favour ? 
  if i were a civil servant in catalonia i would actually be extremely worried . 
  who would i obey ? 
  the regional government asking me to do something illegal but is my employer or the national law ? 
  i do n't get that . 
  why vote for sf , which will do nothing to help you in westminster ? 
  would n't the sdlp be a better choice for northern irish nationalists ? 
   the tories , the conservative party ... managed to form a coalition where they are arguably the least scum in the coalition . 
  i mean , maybe the dup will implode in the next election like the lib dems in 2010 ? 
  that would be a silver lining i guess . 
  imo it 's quite a dumb question . 
  the republic part could have been omited . 
  did anyone think for a second an independent catalonia would remain a monarchy ? 
  a better question could have been `` do you want catalonia to become an independent country ? '', 
  for all what 's worth , erc+pdec at + up do n't have 2/3 of catalonia 's seats in congress either , so you could argue that there 's not enough of a mandate to reform the constutition but it 's a filmsy argument, 
  sure , but the process is the same . 
  2/3 in both the congress and senate , snap elections , 2/3 again and a referendum in all of spain . 
  if we are going to go through all that hassle we might as well redo the constitution so it fits everyone , and several other changes that might be discussed ( monarchy/republic , electoral system , powers of the autonomous communities , senate reform , etc ), 
  tbh the process to give catalonia independence is the same as to rewrite the constitution from scratch . 
  imo if we are going to do that we might as well rewrite the constitution and start over creating a country no one would want to leave . 
  there has n't been that much polling ( about 1 poll every month or 2 ) , but averaging the last few polls i 'd say it 's roughly tied ( average pointed towards yes winning by a point ), 
  if not then who else ? 
  psoe is probably the most likely of the 3 ( which is not saying much ) psoe seems like the easiest path , i think the party voters are divided on the referendum issue . 
  ( voters . 
  most leaders are opposed to it . 
  i do n't think s\u00e1nchez will be any different ), 
  iirc a recient poll said that something like 75 % of spaniards disapprove of rajoy 's handling of the catalonia issue . 
  hell even 56 % of pp voters disapprove iirc !,

  they ca n't use that money for investment . 
  that money is for paying previous loans . 
  you can join a trade after two years of training , being a 18 years old . 
  that 's enough for most of the jobs . 
  why should everybody go to college ? 
  it 's not like a society where everybody has a skilled job is possible . 
  besides that , college education is expensive . 
  the people running this are the ones that commit the rampant corruption and the other political scandals . 
  they are n't interested in fixing our real problems . 
  doing what ? 
  disorganized crime .

  the foral tax system means that they have 28 % corporate tax and mainline spain has 30 % corporate tax . 
  basque country and navarra have the basque economic agreement that means that they only pay for the services that eu or the spanish government provide to the basque people . 
  the do n't contribute to the * fondo de compensaci\u00f3n interterritorial * . 
  they have very important privileges . 
  i do n't think that it will work . 
  it makes me want the independence . 
  and i am not from a place with a pro-iindependence movement . 
  i know that i am always talking about spain , but this history is extremely amusing . 
  i am not from anywhere with a independence movement , and i do n't want the break up of spain . 
  but , i am jealous of the will of some political change . 
  spain needs to be shacked . 
  even if they break spain that would be better than keeping the status quo . 
  that actually happened . 
  luxembourg , the small shameful tax haven that is also a net retriever of eu funds . 
  [ about spain ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/1joo5o/spain_will_have_an_unemployment_rate_above_25/ ) the greek forecast is similar . 
  why should growth come back ? 
  this links gives reasons for the opposite . 
   secondly , prosecute those who are corrupt . 
  what if the people in charge of prosecuting the corrupt are also corrupt ? 
  italian industrial output increased in june a 0.3 % . 
  it 's not a lot , but it 's a positive figure . 
  however , italy has a recesion still . 
  uk is n't in schengen . 
  yes , you are right . 
  it 's because i am spaniard probably . 
  i should have use italy . 
  they are having an [ industrial recovery ] ( http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-08-06/italy-s-industrial-output-rises-in-sign-of-easing-slump.html ) that nobody was expecting . 
  but , we ca n't have this thread for every country we should send eu wide links , if that 's possible . 
  the first bailout was done by the spanish government before we retrieved the bailout . 
  the second is done after the bailout , but spain passed an amendment to the constitution that gives priority to pay back the bailout over the public services , pensions or public servants salaries . 
  however , it 's not like we enforce seriously the constitution . 
   spain still is a net benefactor from eu funding compared to north european nations . 
  spain is extremely dependent on eu funding in all aspects of its economy [ 10 euros per capita ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/budget_of_the_european_union#net_contributors_and_recipients ) is it extremely dependent ? 
  can you back your statements with facts ? 
  this airport was paid by a regional savings bank . 
  they retrieved a bailout in 2009 and were integrated in liberbank before the european intervention . 
  government loaned them 124 millions in 2012 that are n't going to be returned . 
  they will become capital probably ,, 
  did you see the french and spanish indutrial output figures ? 
  the spanish industrial output fell 1.9 % [ link ] ( http://ransquawk.com/headlines/spanish-industrial-output-wda-jun-y-y-1-9-vs-exp-1-2-prev-1-3-rev-to-1-5-08-08-2013 ) what 's this british obsession with the french ? 
  this will improve your mood . 
  [ picture ] ( http://i.imgur.com/wlrlo7h.jpg ) translation : entry without warning is prohibited to dogs and romanians . 
  otherwise they will have to run . 
   stunts like these will ensure that there will be even bigger political opposition in other euro-zone member countries to support further economic stimulus to spain . 
  is that a bad thing ? 
  if with stimulus you mean bank bailouts we are better without that . 
  if you meant actually stimulus we lost the support for that in 2010 . 
  spain closes the fence . 
  you do n't count . 
  ciudad real is * far * from madrid . 
  does n't make sense . 
  extendng barajas is a better idea . 
  we ran out of needed infrastructures and spain started to build more airports . 
  list of unneeded airports : * this airport was paid by a regional saving bank . 
  * the one in castell\u00f3n by the regional and provincial government . 
  * huesca airport built by the central government . 
  * lleida airport : paid by the catalan government . 
  * murcia - corvera airport initially private . 
  the regional government put 200 millions . 
  it 's not only airports . 
  [ also highways ] ( http://www.telemadrid.es/noticias/nacional/noticia/fomento-contempla-rescatar-autopistas-en-quiebra-entre-ellas-las-radiales - ), 
   that is why i will not answer those first questions , you are n't even attempting to give all the options , you just say that there is a and b , and forget the rest of the alphapbet . 
  i was talking about the likely scenario where spain does n't try to fix its problems . 
  whatever , i should n't you that have answers , i do n't think that eu is prepared for that either . 
  but , i think that we should be ready for that scenario . 
   not a lot . 
  the spanish economy is not the eu 's responsibility , and any solution would involve going beyond the commitments that the eu states have made . 
  spain is going bust , so now we are going to say that spain is not a sovereign state anymore , and the spanish people do not know what to do and are asking other people to fix them , which , will as we know , all involve money , loads of them . 
  please finland , give them 5 % of your gdp '' . 
  i am not asking about that . 
  i think that giving more money to my government makes the situation worse in the long term . 
  and economic problems are created by the political problems . 
  acting in the economy before fixing the political and legal framework is not working . 
  political intervention is totally forbidden in the eu that 's right . 
  however , eu put mario monti as pm of italy some time . 
   buit , for the record , i think the euro is the most imperfect of currencies and that you should leave it , together with greece and portugal . 
  what spain is suffering from ( a huge part of the problem at least ) is the internal devaluation that comes with the territory . 
  spain has had over 20 % of unemployment before the euro . 
  maybe spain should leave the emu , but i would n't expect that the things would get better with that . 
  we also have demographic , constitutional , institutional , social ... 
  some days i would prefer that spain falls in pieces in a peaceful way . 
  it would force some change at least . 
   fix your country , that you ca n't fix . 
  pay off your debt , etc. 
  you do not seem to realise , at all , that you are the only ones who can fix your country , and frankly - we have been sending money south since forever . 
  it has not made a single difference .

  it 's just that we have more in common among us than with ( random example ) nordics ( and nordics are different from each other !, 
  but they have some things in common ... just as mediterraneans have more in common with nordics than with chinese ) . 
  so i do n't really get your point ... 
  so true ... why would you go to somebody 's place without actually knowing if the person is at home ? 
  i 've seen that a lot in germany ... 
  i remember having to pay to pee in places where i could be considered a customer such as a museum or several restaurants ... 
  i remember that once a girl blocked the door with a remote control to make me pay/tip her for her cleaning . 
  it was really annoying and was like `` do n't german companies pay for their cleaners ? '', 
  why do you think that ? 
  this also happens in spain ... 
  as a matter of fact , ` please ' in english sounds really weird when i think on it ... 
  in spanish we say ` por favor ' which translates to ` please ' but means ` as a favour ' . 
  oh , do they just refuse ? 
  never seen a muslim rejecting it although i noticed that some of them are n't very used to it ... 
  probably ... 
  i use to ignore the milks fridge . 
  sure ... not all banks have that functionality and maybe some of them charges for the cards but yes ... you can create a virtual card with any amount of money on it in minutes . 
  never done it as it does n't make much sense in reality ... they are just for old ladies afraid of writing their card number online but in the real world ( trademark ) merchants must be ready to probe that any single transaction was made by the cardholder , otherwise charges get reverted so if somebody stole your card online and wastes a bunch of money you only have to call your bank to have your money back . 
  the tunnel through the atlantic channel is going to cost an absurd amount of money ... 
  agree , but to be honest , in countries where uht is prevalent , non-uht is often much less visible in supermarkets ( and often in another section as it has to be refrigerated and sometimes there are n't fridges in the milk section !, 
  you can go both uht milk and fresh milk in spain but uht is a much more common option ... fresh milk has to be stored in the fridge and lasts like 2 or 3 days only . 
  yes , fresh milk tastes better but for me it 's not worth the pain ... 
  i 'm single and i can buy a uht milk 6 pack which last for 3-4 months ... once opened it has to be refrigerated but it last one ( if brick ) to three ( if bottled ) weeks . 
  almost nobody knows that anthem and its f % $ % \u00b7 ing hilarious ... 
  well , virtual cards also exist here ... although they are usually prepaid and offered by banks . 
  actually you have bikes , making a lot of infrastructure unnecessary as drivers are used to bikes and therefore it 's safer to share roads . 
  it 's said that our queen is actually republican ( she was in the past for sure ) and atheist ( supposedly the monarchies were established by the grace of god ) . 
  you know what i meant , right ? 
  it 's curious ... in spain it 's legal to produce ( if you can probe it 's not for trafficking ) and own it but not to sell it ... our coffee shops are private clubs and you pay for somebody to grow it for you , not for the weed itself . 
  do n't think so ... `` si habla mal de espa\u00f1a , es espa\u00f1ol '' . 
  your statement is only true with the food ... and well , i 've traveled a lot and i have to say that our food might not be the world 's best as it 's a matter of tastes but it 's very good . 
  canada and mexico ... although mexicans are often left out from the `` north american '' term ... 
  but we are not part of the english speaking world ( which happens to share a lot of cultural differenciations as it matches the former british empire ) , we just happen to speak english . 
  for me north and south america is just one continent ... america ... regardless of the language that i 'm speaking , and we discovered it ... ( both from your perspective ) so i think we have a word on that !, 
  haha . 
  there are cultures that consider both asia and europe to be the same continent ( eurasia ) and that 's independent of the languages they 're speaking . 
   it 's different in other languages no , it 's different in other cultures , for me there are the same number of continents in both spanish and english . 
  it 's like distances are measured in miles in uk and usa and kms in ireland and canada , or dates are in the correct order in uk and ireland but not in usa and canada ... 
  warner bros park is in madrid ... also you can visit parque de atracciones de madrid in the same trip . 
  are you saying my euros are not usable in denmark ? 
  but it 's the eu , right ? 
  not the same thing . 
  as i already said , card payments work internationally in the rest of the world . 
  you just expect card payments to work being in a first world rich western european country . 
  btw you can pay in euros in denmark in big stores or taxis . 
  it 's in few places but still possible . 
   are you aware that stores may not choose mastercard nor visa because of the costs of those as well ? 
  are you aware that stores elsewhere in the world can afford it ? 
  it 's just the default in most countries !, 
  ing offers it in spain at 0,5 % per transaction to smes ( bigger companies have better deals ) . 
   why should the local shops get off their way to cater to tourists who are ill-informed ? 
  because it 's money , they are suffering the bad part without enjoing the good part 2 . 
  why should you have the european standard plug , or the european standard voltage , or the european standard currency , or any other world or european standar if you can just work with your own standard just because it 's yours and others can adapt to it for no reason at all but just because it works differently internally ? 
   do n't go abroad if you can not afford it then . 
  i do n't complain when i need to pay fees to use an atm anywhere else in europe , do i ? 
  nobody has become rich by throwing money away ... you can afford going abroad and try your cards first to avoid the fees . 
  wow !, 
  i literally can reach oslo from madrid by car in less time ( 31 hours according google maps ) . 
  i guess the trick is that distances are shorter through sweden . 
   this is the tourist 's problem , not ours . 
  if you go to a country you go prepared and informed , otherwise just ask . 
  furthermore , you can also pay by nfc and most banks have a payment app that replaces the card , thus solving the problem for a lot of people . 
  well , this is one of the things you do n't expect to work in a different way !, 
  and yes ... you can pay by nfc either with the card or with the phone or with whatever ... ** but not in the netherlads ** . 
  this does n't solve a shit because the transaction still has to be processed by visa or mastercard . 
   mastercard is accepted in any atm , yes , paying fees . 
   and albert heijn even accepts maestro and so do most big stores . 
  good for them , maestro is only a thing in benelux and germany . 
   just bring a goddamn id in case you are asked for one . 
  again this is the typical thing you do n't expect to work in a different way ... but in spain the id can also be required at any time so we are also used to that ...  tourists have a problem with the payments system because they are unprepared to deal with it , agreed . 
   thus tourists create the very annoying inconvenience of longer queues and annoyance at a lot of stores blame the tourists for everything but for this . 
  those annoyances are created by your incomatible banking system . 
  also , stores can choose to accept mastercard and visa and stop being annoying both for you and the tourists . 
   you can swipe , nfc , or chip your card in , the problem is that you ca n't . 
  international cards are not widely accepted in the netherlands and people do n't get it because it 's the only country i 'm aware of having this particularity . 
  i 'm not saying that tourists does n't makes life in amsterdam worse because probably you are right ... 
  i 'm just saying that i understand why they have problems paying . 
  i remember once paying in a lidl with a huge sign saying , in english `` we accept international cards '' and when i tried to pay with my spanish card they said ... `` no ... but we just accept maestro '' ... ( which is like 0,000001 % of bank cards outside netherlands ) . 
  i 've only seen these machines for spraying air fresheners . 
   escobar in spanish is to sweep for me it 's just a surname . 
  to be fair amsterdam is planned in a way that just does n't seem to admit that much people ...  and , finally , there is the payment issues because they merely do not understand that credit cards are uncommon , and paying by cash is not accepted everywhere , nor can they ever be bothered to read the huge signs that say `` hier alleen pinnen '' . 
  you make foreigners life almost impossible for paying ... chipnick is only a thing in the netherlands and in the rest of the world mastercard and visa are widely accepted ( both credit and debit , in the netherlands foreing debit cards are strangely accepted ... foreign credit cards are only accepted by hotels and car rentals ! ) . 
  if you can not pay in cash and you can not pay by card how are you supposed to pay ? 
  you can drive norway for 20 hours ?!, 
  how many kms tall is norway ? 
  you are right !, 
  yes , it 's known ... just because it 's in often in the reverse of the parch\u00eds or oca ... never met anyone knowing how to play it ... 
   have only seen it in forocoches and said by me , i like that word . 
  yes !, 
  it 's very curious because few people use it but when used , everybody knows what it means although it 's completely different from the non-slang word !, 
  yes , we say `` hercio '' !, 
  also , this is one of the few words that does n't have a consistent spelling in spanish , i mean , it can be written in multiple ways ... hertz , hertzio or hercio , and in plural hertzios or hercios ... but of course , the most common way of writting it is `` hz '' . 
  if that sounds funny , try with 800 mhz ( ochocientos megahercios ) or 1 ghz ( un gigahercio ) !, 
  we have funny dresses for the class pictures !, 
  https://www.google.es/search?q=orla&amp;tbm=isch although they are not always taken the year you are graduating . 
  in my case i took it several years before as nobody graduates at the same time . 
  nowadays it 's an unit of the is ( so no degrees ) , but before that it was just another graduated scale based on celsius . 
  so at least in spanish if you are saying `` 20 kelvin '' it 's because you are ommiting the degrees ( grados ) word in plural ( even if it 's not correct to read kelvins as degrees anymore ) . 
  i think we are more strict with the plurals than you because we say pascales and hercios . 
  true , herpes is a `` family of viruses '' and all adults are infected with at least three of them ... which of them ( simlex 1 or 2 , zoster , epstein-barr/mononucleosis , etc. . . ) seems irrelevant to me ...

  and you know that perfectly . 
  you are fine with your local criminals acting against people because of prejudice . 
   `` aussiedler '' , ethnic germans who have a right to be here in the first place . 
  lol . 
   and some of us would n't mind seeing pegida thugs kick your teeth in . 
  and then you claim to be better than immigrants . 
   east bloc people fleeing a collapsing soviet union are not comparable to syrian or somalian refugees why ? 
  the relevant paragraphs : `` our state apparatus had been contaminated by the troika , very , very badly . 
  let me give you an example . 
  there is something called the hellenic financial stability facility , which is an offshoot of the european financial stability facility [ efsf ] . 
  this is a fund that contained initially $ 50 billion -- by the time i took over it was $ 11 billion -- for the purpose of recapitalising the greek banks . 
  this is money that the taxpayers of greece have borrowed for the purpose of bolstering the banks . 
  i did n't get to choose its ceo and i did n't get to have any impact on the way it ran its affairs vis-\u00e0-vis the greek banks . 
  the greek people who had elected me had no control on how the money they had borrowed was going to be used . 
  `` i discovered at some point that the law that constituted the efsf allowed me one power , and that was to determine the salary of these people . 
  i realised that the salaries of these functionaries were monstrous by greek standards . 
  in a country with so much hunger and where the minimum wage has fallen to $ 520 a month , these people were making something like $ 18,000 a month . 
  `` so i decided , since i had the power , i would exercise that power . 
  i used a really simple rule . 
  pensions and salaries have fallen by an average of 40 % since the beginning of the crisis . 
  i issued a ministerial decree by which i reduced the salaries of these functionaries by 40 % . 
  still a huge salary , still a huge salary . 
  you know what happened ? 
  i got a letter from the troika , saying that my decision has been overruled as it was insufficiently explained . 
  so in a country in which the troika is insisting that people on a $ 300-a-month pension now live on $ 100 , they were refusing my cost-cutting exercise , my ability as a minister of finance to curtail the salaries of these people . '', 
  while el mundo can say true things , i would not use it as a source . 
  if i 'm to bet , they have used data elaborated by the pp government , and are more than suspicious . 
  for sure , contrary data are usually done with help from the catalan government , but i feel they 're nearer to the truth as they want to convince people of something that is not the common wisdom . 
  i 'm talking of you . 
  that i definitely do not want any ruling me . 
  fenrir ... who would have thought . 
  i think nazis are worse , and they killed a lot of roma . 
  typical talk of an individual without any culture beyond paleolithic . 
  not very intelligent from you . 
  if you 're ever scammed , do n't ask me for help . 
  it is quite a possibility . 
  the treaty of rome has in its motivation the `` ever closer union '' , which is what makes it interesting for the common people . 
  the uk ruling class is only interested in the `` free trading area '' aspects , which are most interesting to that same ruling class , and that ruling class hates anything that helps the common man . 
  most of the moves by cameron show that , as he has said many times that the `` ever closer '' reference should be erased . 
   if the rich regions ( e.g. 
  madrid ) would be independent they would not have to share the money with poorer regions . 
  well , while in the present madrid is quite developed , most of its wealth is consequence of madrid being the capital of the state . 
  getting independent would be cutting the source of its wealth . 
  and is worsened by the measures of austerity . 
  and less people like you . 
  yes . 
  germans look like the salafists of isis that killed people because they did not follow ramadan , which in case you 're not aware is a measure of austerity . 
   well it 's syriza 's fault for daring to even try to fight back against an abusive lover . 
  that a tyrant you speak about . 
  people that serve tyrants deserve no respect . 
  but then what do you know about been oppressed ? 
   trust from people with money in the greek economy . 
  trust of the tax fraudsters ? 
  of the corrupt individuals that had engineered the deficit and debt of the country for longer that they returned to democracy ? 
   managed to destroy the trust that was around . 
  the trust was never there for syriza to destroy it . 
  the so called trust was that the greek politicians previous to syriza were corrupt and in the pocket of people that formed the troika and were more than willing to pact against the interest the people they were supposed to serve . 
  as for your graphic , who had more money in greece ? 
  the people that were against syriza . 
  the people that had not paid taxes and wanted to avoid paying them . 
  in fact greece had a higher rate of interest , as she was considered a risky investment , and while entry in the euro might have meant a reduction in those rates , the knowledge should have been there . 
  the lender were acting recklessly . 
  why ? 
  both languages are diachronic dialects of proto-indo-european , and both received ego at the start . 
   i ca n't help thinking `` i '' is such a basic word it 's unlikely to be borrowed , but apparently it happened with `` ego '' from latin to greek , so i suppose it 's at least possible . 
  not that i know , ego is as originally latin as in greek , as it comes from proto-indo-european * eghom . 
  yes it is long , usually on tv they pass a shorter version , and let know that a full version is on the web . 
  and yes , it is dakota johnson . 
  they 've been doing that kind of ads for a few years now . 
  one of a beer : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yd5nuhrb_ys&amp;feature=youtu.be, 
   i think it 's a good idea that they stopped pointing fingers to the news articles they were rebuting , then how do you know why they say something ? 
  should lies be allowed to go and fill the news space ? 
  i mean that the fact that uk fought against nazi germany is not in itself enough to warrant the idea that no briton share the same kind of worldview . 
  just like in other countries . 
  understand that the uk did not so much fight nazism but the fact that germany under nazism was about to get a powerful empire rival to the british empire . 
  an awful lot of people in the uk liked nazism as such . 
  there are only 1440 minutes a day . 
  everybody that cares about getting music from internet is already doing so . 
  it is not irony but sarcasm . 
  it 's not / u/arathian idea . 
  now on purely biological terms i do not expect to see much differences . 
  at most some y-haplotypes and mitochondrial haplotypes . 
  thanks . 
  are you not mixing it with the eu getting a cut on income taxes ? 
  the incompetence of you government is no such a thing , but an expression of the fact that you , as a people , lack understanding of real life . 
  you are slowly transitioning into a neo feudal order . 
  at present , and 2016 is not that far away in time , the disparity in income and wealth make that rather dubious . 
  too high for some , and possibly less than local rate in other , and then , who would collect it ? 
  states depend in a significant part on vat collected in their territory , allowing another entity to get that money would not be welcome . 
  since the eu gets a cut on vat , it might be the one to collect , but would that collected amount be reduced from which state apportation ? 
  no , simply you 'll pay the vat established in your country . 
  i think it is the same with local sales taxes in the usa when you buy via internet . 
  and you are as dense as a piece of depleted uranium . 
  edit s/a a/as a / too many beers, 
  it is interesting that people that claim there is no right to be forgotten do not use their own name . 
  you are practicing nazism no matter how you deceive yourself into it . 
  i 've no faith that wasteland countries will be really up to the level of present western countries in two or three generations . 
  rather western countries will devolve into wastelands . 
  some tolerance is in order . 
  no , but since it surged from it , liberal democracy ( ld ) does n't protect against it , so ld is far from perfect .

  i did n't grow up , nor went to school with , in a `` white bubble '' . 
  it may have been a non-poverty bubble , but then that 's just to be expected . 
  i never felt threatened nor in danger from the well educated ethnical minorities i grew up surrounded by . 
  which is not to say your father may not be right , but does he recognise that the fact that immigrants in inner cities tend to be poorer and less educated , is something we could potentially fix with policy ? 
  imagine ubi were implemented in europe tomorrow , and ** all ** legal immigrants did n't have to worry for their immediate sustenance , going through bullshit `` prove you 're trying to find a job to get a miserable social help '' , having to settle for putting your whole family in a rented room in the worst part of town , and obviously , contemplate having to turn to prostitution/dealing/other crime ; all while you take the time to properly learn the language , and perhaps even get some skills training and certifications going , in order to , in a couple of years , be able to ** truly ** join the workforce in an effective capacity . 
  most people who believe immigrant kids are somehow inherently dangerous , violent , or otherwise scary do n't quite understand that children , excepting in grave diseases like autism and such , are absolutely always reacting to the environment them and their parents are living in . 
  my wife is a child-adolescent psychiatrist fwiw , and she says her office is filled with conduct disorders from otherwise psychiatrically-healthy children who , despite living in a first world country , are living in horrible situations that are very difficult address from a social pov , because the problems are the usual mobility barriers getting in the way of climbing out of poverty . 
  and yes , these minority kids are indeed the prototypical `` problem children `` at their respective city schools , and school teachers have them sent to the psychiatrist alarmed , but nobody seems to understand the true , actual real cause for their being like that is fucking poverty , and the feedback loops that prevent their families , well h meaning as they might be , from climbing out of it . 
   which / u/cativellauni has mentioned may not be the case !, 
  to my great alarm , yes . 
  i do n't disagree with what you 've said , but what can be done besides being politically active , voting , and trying to not panic ? 
  i do believe/hope between the real-world repercussions that brexit will have on the uk , combined with what trump will end up doing to the us , in very concrete economic terms ( if nothing else ) , will help dissuade these nationalistic , far-right fantasies amongst those people who see the world as one big conspiracy from which lepen might save them from . 
  but then again there are a few automation/labour crises on the horizon in the next few years , so more economic downturn ( regardless of policy ) will possibly lead to an increasing identification with these radical ideologies . 
  and those are very troubling exceptions , no doubt . 
  well , their intent with the new budget seems to reduce education even more , so ... 
  believe me , i 'm well aware . 
  certainly a reason for europe to remain ever tighter . 
   do n't worry obama care is going down . 
  i do n't doubt this will get done , but boy is it weird seeing people championing this . 
  the tragedy with ignorant people like you is , that you wo n't even realise how fucked this will render you until it 's too late . 
  people from this side of the pond ca n't unfortunately do anything for you poor souls but try and warn you , and see it all unfold before our eyes . 
  i did , but honestly , i do n't engage with those people on here anymore than i try to explain to a drunk patient why i wo n't try to `` negotiate '' anything with them until they 've sobered up . 
  i know they 're disenfranchised and all , but ** willful ** ignorance is something that i refuse to lend any kind of legitimacy or voice to . 
  incompetence has its own way of destroying a country . 
  the gop are all too happy to take this opportunity to remove any and all regulations for businesses , and the fact that he 's slowly dismantling the very agencies meant to , well , regulate different matters is a kind of damage of its own that should under no circumstances be dismissed as clown-like . 
  the guy is a clown , but the us government is n't exactly a perpetual motion machine that will continue churning along effectively during the lack of a very motivated and capable leadership . 
  fortunately the historically strong push for ever better education is n't waning , and if we 're being perfectly honest , most of the support for these emerging far-right political parties stem from old people , who , to put it bluntly , are next up on the chopping block . 
  a few countries have a genuine problem with young people endorsing far-right ideologies , but those are the countries which are suffering the most economically , and we can ** surely ** improve that stuff . 
  slowly ( greece 's problem with all-encompassing , and everywhere-encroached corruption wo n't be solved overnight or merely with cash injections ) , no doubt , but progressively . 
  in this particular matter , such `` stereotypically '' european programs like the erasmus university exchange programs , i believe , are a huge help in slowly changing fatalistic , socially-ingrained corruption cultures . 
  paper ballots are n't terribly secure either , and certainly not accountable on an individual level , other than bluntly counting the votes . 
  you seem to thin we have this figured out , but in the real world , what you call `` inconvenience '' is a ** huge ** factor that in very real ways impede true democracy from happening . 
  well , since you ca n't walk into a computer either , that seems kinds hard . 
  and either if it were possible , then some people would object that the elderly and computer-illiterate would n't be abke to check . 
  no system can be perfect ( although your concern could be addressed ) , but the question is wether we can improve things with technology , and the answer is an undoubted and emphatic `` yes '' . 
   it needs to be 100 % anonymous , if there 's anything that can trace back to you , essentially making it provable that you voted a certain way  of course , the moment you make electronic voting fully anonymous , you open the flood gates to undetectable fraud . 
  i think you might be unaware of how public-private key cryptography can actually achieve this ( and this is in fact how these projects are being coded up ) . 
  assymetric crypto can make it so , on the `` registry '' of votes , my vote appears as an anonymous string of characters that can never be traced back to me , but if it came to a recount , and the government required me to re-derive my public key ( using their private one as well ) , it would come out the exact same way . 
  privacy and accountability at the same time . 
  [ this is an explanation of how asymmetric crypto works for dumbasses like me ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yebfamv-_do ) . 
  nobody could coerce me , because to derive the same key that voted , they would also need the government 's key ( or more likely the separate and impartial entity entrusted with the creation of such keys to prevent governments from meddling with the election ) . 
  and my vote would still be completely anonymous . 
  provable if need be , but anonymous . 
   the second of those literally lets you sell your vote . 
  but that 's a matter of presence , is it not ? 
  no matter the technical details , if a person is not forced to physically go to a voting booth so that people can see they 're not being threatened or otherwise co opted , this possibility will always exist . 
  so as a society we can either accept that this will be a possibility , or enable electronic voting that requires physical presence , where the private key to cast a vote is generated on-site , and preferably derived from some personal keys ( like many countries already have personal cryptographic credentials built into their national identity documents ) . 
  see ? 
  shit i had n't even thought about , and now you 're responding to yourself . 
  let me hook you up with more info into that company : https://secure.vote/ https://voteflux.org/about/, 
  cheers !, 
  remember 2018 could be a super defining election . 
  from the outcome of that an impeachment process can be born . 
  jokes can be a coping mechanism . 
  that 's why colbert is so popular even after he stopped being so actively politically sour in his new show . 
  do n't take it as an offense , we 're all horrified about trump , and he has a very good chance of actually fucking the world up for the next few decades . 
  we 'll see what happens today , but france is toying with fascism in their upcoming election . 
  brexit ca n't completely be attributed to trump , but surely there 's some of that as well . 
  laugh with us . 
  `` prospered '' is a strong word . 
  we stopped getting actively fucked by the incumbent party for a few months there . 
  then we had repeat elections and the votes centralised towards that very party . 
  the population here is weird . 
  the real good answer is that if you truly ca n't find a single candidate whose views you can feel represented by ( and i do think in these systems you 'd need to be a very special snowflake for this to be the case ) , you should really start your own party . 
  i know not everyone will want to do this , and some people are just `` against everyone and everything in politics '' , but that 's absurd . 
  it 's of course their right not to participate in democracy , but in my mind , people who do so should lose any right to complain about anything government-related for the duration of the term of the election they skipped . 
  that escalated quickly . 
  were n't pseudonymous blockchains such as bitcoins supposed to solve both the anonymity ( with private/public crypto ) and accountability problems ? 
  i 've heard an australian company is looking into commercialising just the very thing . 
  then again , it 's not my industry , so i imagine my layman ramblings sound about as absurd to you as when people try to tell me why i 'm wrong about my job . 
  i also subscribe to the `` recent dictatorship '' theory . 
  but aside from that , i also think we 've had to live with far more diverse peoples throughout our history , as compared to more northern countries , not to mention our current closeness to african and muslim countries ( with a ton of immigration from them ) . 
  we 've also had to find a way to solve or at least maintain the peace amongst multiple groups that consider themselves separate cultural entities . 
  i do think a generalised need for tolerance in other aspects leads to tolerance in these matters . 
  do n't know , i 'm sure the center-europeans would chalk it up to all the sun we get . 
  that law is up in the chopping block this year , thankfully . 
  that said , please do n't call rajoy `` the spanish trump '' . 
  he 's an asshole who supports all kinds of corruption , but hyperbole like this subtracts impact from the words that are meant to describe horrible situations . 
  when rajoy leaves office we 'll still have a functioning government , which right now is rather plural btw , and afaic see into the future , we do n't have any aspiring autocrats demagogically raising support for institutionalised racism , hate , the dismantling of the social safety net , and the destruction of the environment the way , for instance , france does , or some of the countries from the north . 
  no offense , but pick up a book on bioethics . 
   people should be able to consciously sign away some of their rights this is not something we currently allow under any western legal system . 
  i hope you realise the magnitude of what you 're suggesting , leaving completely aside the fact that you 're responding to a completely different matter , because legality / = ethicality . 
   nobody is forcing them to sign anything . 
  and this , this is a separate matter that should also be considered . 
  one of the arguments against remunerated surrogacy is precisely this . 
  which are similar to those of legalising prostitution . 
   we try to make things as good as possible without undermining freedom . 
  ... which is but one of the ethical issues that surround surrogacy . 
  a contract that would sign away the right of autonomy , is but one of the possibilities being discussed on this very thread , precisely by the people that are denying the fact that there are ethical issues associated with it . 
  your comparison to marriage and driving are false equivalences , for this very reason ( among a few others ) . 
   i say that it is more ethical for governments to provide and assist with such surrogacy contracts than it is for governments to drive surrogacy underground . 
  now ** this ** is a compelling argument , that i thoroughly support . 
  but then perhaps we 'd get into other things of arguments , which are not worth it to get into when we disagree on a more superficial level , but that 's definitely something that should be considered as an important factor . 
  i see in the length of time it takes you to reply to the comments i 'm expending time and mental effort on , exactly how much consideration you 're giving the subject . 
  but no , we 're not saying the exact same things . 
  at least twice you have changed your stance on the actual topic ( the ethicality of it ) , and you do n't seem even willing to see it . 
  thanks for at least not devolving into insults . 
  and please , do consider the book thing . 
  cheers . 
   i never once denied that .

  i met my wife through language exchange and never really dated around all that much . 
  but i did n't in the us either . 
  food here is amazing and relies a lot more on natural flavors rather than other sorts of spices like back in the us . 
  cars are generally smaller mostly to be able to park and a standard car is a 5 door hatchback . 
  city centers are not great for driving but suburbs and rural areas are pretty car dependent . 
  luxuries tend to be pretty similar . 
  people mostly aspire to the same stuff . 
  bigger houses , nicer phones , flying up front , etc. . . 
  though that sort of thing tends to be a global market so the relative price difference is more . 
  i grew up in the us but have lived in spain basically ever since i left college . 
  your question seems really broad , anything specifically ? 
  i would say there are two main stereotypes . 
  * slightly dim but overall caring though prone to mistakes * workaholic who is always in a suit and only cares about making more money, 
  also , while it 's true that spain does have a claim on gibraltar , it 's not actively trying to get it back . 
  that said , they did illegally construct on the isthmus when spain was at war and basically expanded on what was neutral territory and where the airport is today . 
  also , the issue with brexit is that gibraltar is not a part of the uk , just under the sovereignty of the crown and they are definitely different things . 
  gibraltar can agree to be bound to the uk 's negotiation , but they are n't obligated to by law and still have n't so the spanish position that they will need a separate agreement seems quite reasonable to me unless they agree to follow the uk 's negotiation . 
   what difference does it make to me ? 
  but that 's a source of at least 25 % of banter with portuguese bros. 
  you do n't have run down castles in the middle of nowhere with basically no maintenance . 
  the preserved ones here are like that , but you can find plenty that are falling apart and basically serve as a spot for teenagers to drink and have sex . 
  he said heathrow not luton . 
  heathrow is at least baroque . 
  i love spain , but i 'd get out of madrid if i had the chance . 
  i 'd probably choose zaragoza . 
  it 's close to fantastic skiing in the winter and still gets hot in the summer , not a far drive from the beach . 
  it 's got enough people to have activity like a big city , but not so many to be overwhelming . 
  you can also be in madrid or barcelona in an hour and a half on the train . 
  the situation at gibraltar right now is kind of a joke and could very well end up a lot more formalized . 
  since as it is right now you just kind of flash your id card in the general direction of the border and keep walking . 
  they search cars because it 's a smuggling haven , but foot traffic is the majority and it 's very rarely stopped or held up . 
  i 'm not even an eu citizen and they just wave me on through . 
  nobody ( well only some very extreme groups ) in spain is talking about taking gibraltar from the uk . 
  there are complex legal issues surrounding entry and trade rights , fisheries , etc. . that need to be ironed out and as of right now gibraltar is n't under uk law so negotiations with the uk are not the same as negotiations with gibraltar since bots are legally autonomous . 
  that 's completely made up . 
  there may be serious issues with ownership and landing rights , but literally nobody has doubted there 'd be overflight rights . 
  it 's not about ceding territory , it 's that gibraltar is not governed under the same laws as the uk since gibraltar is n't part of the uk . 
  if gibraltar were to agree to all the same conditions as the uk does for brexit , i 'm fine with negotiating as one , but they have n't so i 'm not . 
  a huge amount of people ( including british people ) do n't actually understand the legal status of gibraltar and how it complicates things . 
  usd is still the main global currency . 
  i often bring us dollars to travel to third countries that are n't at all related ( though euros are usually just as good now ) . 
  so yes , everyone knows usd . 
  almost everyone here would know the mexican peso , but i do n't think spain is representative of europe on that front . 
  and most people would probably guess dollar for canada but would n't know it for sure . 
  i know the exchange rates because i work in international business and also i am american so i need it both professionally and personally . 
  i also travel a fair amount so i can quote lots of random exchange rates . 
  did that one give any problems ? 
  i generally really hate calatrava so i 'm immediately sceptical of any of his work . 
  there 's still a set in almer\u00eda that 's kept as a tourist attraction . 
  it really does look like the american west . 
  we 're the only ones allowed to get away with speaking spanish at you guys . 
  i do say `` at '' because i 'm not going to understand a word you say back . 
  i generally do n't mind shitty pop music but the constant barrage is just too much . 
  finally feels like it might be dying off a bit but it 's been a constant for the last couple months . 
  both are on constantly . 
  there 's basically always at least a few regget\u00f3n songs in the top 10 and so when there 's one like this ... it 's just nonstop . 
  people in spain absolutely love to complain about how it 's pretty much the worst country ever and everyone else has a better life . 
  about 95 % of those people have never lived abroad ( or maybe did an erasmus and think that 's how most people live in the host country ) and those that do and come back seem to really appreciate that life is n't so bad here . 
  british system seems pretty reasonable . 
  citizenship for children of people born in the uk and residence rights for grandkids . 
  most irish in america did n't register their kids citizenship . 
  this kind of fucked me as i would have had a much easier time figuring out how to live before i got married . 
  but soon i 'll be spanish so it all worked out . 
  were you born on the island ? 
  anyone born on the island of ireland is automatically an irish citizen . 
  depending on how much time you 're willing to spend you could do the feve across northern spain and then move down to lisbon and back through madrid ( lisbon to madrid is a shitty overnight train ) . 
  the feve is narrow gauge which may be of interest to you as an enthusiast of the actual tracks . 
  would probably take close to a week , though . 
  i studied for a summer at a university on fourvi\u00e8re hill and you could definitely see them from the balcony of our dormitory . 
  the downside of living on an island . 
  what do you mean paying fees ? 
  from the uk you 'd have to pay for passage on either the tunnel or a ferry , but that 's just because they are private operators providing a service . 
  you could theoretically do it for free if you had an aquatic car . 
  you do n't have to pay the government for getting your passport checked and there are currently no customs duties between uk and france . 
  not from poland to ukraine . 
  only within the schengen area . 
  note that this is not the same as eu as there are non-schengen eu countries ( uk , ireland , croatia , romania , bulgaria , cyprus ) and non-eu countries in schengen ( iceland , norway , switzerland ) . 
  so you can drive from poland to lithuania with no border control but you will have one crossing from poland to ukraine . 
  yeah , op is definitely going to have to do some investigation about belarus . 
  the rest is just booking flights/trains whatever, 
  austria , hungary , slovakia , poland and lithuania are all in the schengen area . 
  there are literally no border controls and it 's like crossing between states in the us ( with the notable exception of france right now ) . 
  plenty of cross border transport traffic . 
  ukraine is not eu nor schengen but it 's pretty easy . 
  just stay away from the conflict areas . 
  crimea is fully administered as russia so you would need to cross the russian border to get there . 
  you should n't be going there , but the donetsk and luhansk people 's republics are also administered as independent , even if nobody recognizes them . 
  but seriously , stay away from war zones . 
  belarus is going to be the tricky one . 
  i know it was nearly impossible to get the visa but they 've just introduced a new short stay with no visa . 
  also , do n't be so dismissive of flying , it 's very often the best method of transport . 
  edit : oh yeah , and be careful if you are hiring a car and you take it outside the eu . 
  for example i doubt many companies would be okay with you taking their car into ukraine . 
  i would say for most blue collar type jobs you count it as per month after taxes . 
  for most professional type jobs it 's per year before taxes . 
  [ vetusta morla - copenhague ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mw2cy_7rwf0 ) it 's actually a good song . 
  we curse a lot and we do n't apologize for it . 
  hah , seems pretty universal that the term ` pretogues ' is enjoyed . 
  also , portugal apparently colonized the parts of africa with the best looking people . 
  the angolan women are generally gorgeous .

  jesu christ , venezuela has almost three times the murder rate that mexico does according to this : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_intentional_homicide_rate, 
  are you really comparing modern day muslims with medieval europeans ? 
  do n't you think it 's condescending and insulting to set the bar so low for islam ? 
  lol butthurt, 
   i will never understand those that claim to be left-leaning but completely refuse to be part of a common project putting the argument of `` too much solidarity '' or even `` stealing us '' ( when it 's not ) ... that 's not socialist/left-leaning at all . 
  me neither , it 's always puzzled me how some erc voters believe that rich catalonians should show solidarity to poor catalonians but not poor andalusians . 
  it 's also possible that erc voters disillussioned with jxs\u00ed will now vote for the cup, 
   so jxs\u00ed could have formed a government if they were willing to ditch m\u00e1s but just goes to show when it really matters that him staying in power was more important than any idea they professed . 
  precisely what i thought , jxs\u00ed could have formed a goernment if someone from the left like romeva or junqueras had been proposed . 
   still wont stop eastern europeans in nato countries as far as poland crying about how russia will try to take them over any day now to rally something or other . 
  you really think it 's unreasonable for former soviet-block countries to be worried about russia after the georgian war and now the ukraine conflict ? 
  honestly i think it 's because france is spelled the same way in english and french , thus not dividing the subreddit . 
  there are many many more refugees in turkey , lebanon and jordan than in europe , those are probably genuine refugees while the ones in germany are economic migrants, 
  i remember being 30 min late to a party at some german friends ' appartment , i was dumbfounded as to why they gave me so much shit for that, 
  bbva does it on certain big branches , you take out a ticket from a machine and go to your assigned teller after your number appears on a screen, 
   heh , yeah , anyway same here . 
  a religious marriage is `` invalid '' as far as the state is concerned . 
  would-be grooms and brides have to go sign papers at the town hall , with witnesses , and they have to indulge in a sort of republican ceremony , if they want their marriage to be legally recognized by the state . 
  religious people thus do the religious ceremony in addition to the `` republican '' one . 
  same goes for mexico , people usually have two weddings ( civil and religious one ) with the first one being a smaller more private affair and the second one being the big one . 
  not in my experience , towns in mexico have an orderly grid-like layout , towns in spain have messy medieval streets, 
  yep , my mother 's votes arrived on the last day of the deadline for sending them , thankfully we were able to send them in that same day, 
  what rights do catalans lack that other spaniards have ? 
  1 equal opportunities 2 rule of law 3 freedom of speech , press and religion, 
  schipol is pretty efficient , but pretty boring looking imo, 
   1st what has `` regionalism '' to do with municipalities ? 
  i associate it with the spanish mentality of extreme jingoism for one 's town/municipality/concejo / province , etc. 
  from what i saw when i lived in your country , people there have some absolutely retarded rivalries with their nearest town over and i believe that translates into everyone wanting to be special little snowflakes with their own little municipality ( edit : and reagion , autonomous community , etc ) with their own deputies ( after all , how can they share deputies with the evil people from the town next to them ! ), 
  can you imagine the bitching if some municipalities were fusioned ? 
   it 's a problem in ( very ) small constituencies , like the ones we have in spain though . 
  i think your silly regionalisms are to blame for this though , spain has a stupid amount of municipalities, 
  why should it ? 
  colombia was a part of spain when that ship wrecked, 
   the same goes for asturias there is a tiny communist independentist party in asturias, 
  singapore , switzerland , japan , canada , new zealand , etc, 
  exactly !, 
  forme , expecting people t pass an a1 test is not `` quite strict '', 
  seems pretty reasonable , one of my brothers marrid a german woman and could pass the a1 test after like 3 months there, 
  i lived in oviedo until two months ago , maybe things are different there ? 
  i never saw a single supermarket open on a sunday, 
  oh god this ! , everything is dead in spain on a sunday while in mexico sunday is probably the busiest shopping day, 
  hey !, 
  i lived in spain for almost five years and the people were pretty friendly ( except for the basques whom i found pretty rude for the most part ) , do n't sell yourselves short !, 
  i agree , also , oriol junqueras will make anime real . 
  imo spain has some of the best transport infrastructure in the world, 
   the few that would be considered suitable would be singapore , because rich so then they are economic migrants after all ... 
  my residence/work permit took 4 months to be approved , it would have taken longer if i had n't had help from a friend of a friend that works at `` extranjeria '' that made the tramit faster . 
   no , there is a prestige attached according to ? 
  i 'm a native spanish speaker and i 've lived in both mexico and spain for years , i 've met countless other latinos , i 've been exposed to iberoamerican culture much more than you have , i 've never heard of iberian spanish being seen as prestigious . 
  i have the suspicion that because british english is seen as fancy in the aglo world you people assume that something similar happens in the hispanic world . 
   spain spanish remains standard though , and is the prestige dialect . 
  you are wrong on both accounts , the rae recognises several dialects as being standard and there 's no special prestige attached to iberian spanish . 
  amazing food , fantastic weather , friendly people , unique and diverse culture , and a terribly inefficient government ? 
  romania sounds nice , i should visit, 
  i think he was referring to the partition, 
  not sure if you 're not sure what he 's talking about ... he means northern ireland, 
  wut , those are mexican wages !, 
  ugh , 3d graphs are so stupid , they add nothing to the graph while actually making it harder to compare, 
  i know that you want to be outraged and all that , but those are pretty much the same standards applied in europe for naturalisation . 
  the funniest thing i 've seen is that most of the hostility is coming from countries where immigrants and refugees do n't actually want to go !, 
  refugees in hungary are there because they want to go west , not because they want to live in hungary, 
  yeah that was my impression , i just was n't sure because i don ' live there, 
  this is the mean gdp , so it does n't take into account inequality of distribution , a better indicator of welfare would be either the median gdp or the inequality adjusted hdi . 
  no , he was brutal even by standards of the time . 
  he was removed as governor of hispaniola and imprisoned because of his poor treatment of natives and generally tyranical behaviour . 
  meh , i 'm descended from spaniards so it was probably my ancestors doing the genociding rather than yours . 
  i do n't get why people want so much about claiming to be the country of origin of columbus , he was a genocidal piece of shit . 
  meh barcelona , and all large cities in spain seem perfectly liveable without cars . 
  maybe they 're counting it as part of denmark . 
  when i tried activating closed captions it auto-detected it as portuguese , i guess i 'm not the only one that thinks that european portuguese sounds like russian . 
  yes like that one time obama got ron paul jailed , or when the tea party protesters were brutally repressed, 
   having an international or international-sounding first name coupled with a traditional surname can be seen as `` low class '' yes this seems universal , brians and johnathans are seen are mocked in mexico, 
   if catalonia gains independence after today 's vote , it will prove that itself is a failed state . 
  in order for catalonia to gain independence they would need to reform the spanish constitution first , this vote wo n't make catalonia independent, 
  i disagree with him , but he is contributing to the discussion and is n't being rude or anything , no point in downvoting him tbh, 
   they 're not proposing , of course , but how will they afford the spending then ? 
  you can finance a stimulus in several ways , debt , printing money , selling of government assets , foreign aid , etc  they either tax people or they cut spending elsewhere or they print money - considering we ca n't print money ( and even if we could , that would lead to inflation ) inflation is pretty damn low in the eu : http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/cache/ity_public/2-15112012-bp/en/2-15112012-bp-en.pdf, 
  a monetary and fiscal stimulus like every other country that is actually growing did, 
  well , at least in the spanish case ( i 'm not familiar with the other cases ) the government had pretty low debt relative to gdp before the crisis , over leveraged private investors in the housing bubble caused it here . 
   the state needs to increase taxes so it can afford more spending and so we can finally break the economic cycle and experiment permanent expansion '' people that are rallying against austerity are n't proposing tax increases ( do you even know what a fiscal stimulus is ? ), 
   austerity does reduce growth , but it also reduces the deficit ( which is happening quite quickly for portugal ) which in turn eventually reduces debt . 
  not quite , austerity reduces consumption , reduced consumption reduces revenues , reduced revenues reduce government revenues , ** if government revenues decrease at a higher rate than the deficit then austerity is increasing the deficit ** this graph shows the fiscal deficit in greece is actually increasing , despite austerity : http://static5.businessinsider.com/~~/f?id=4b22522f00000000006477cf&amp;maxx=266&amp;maxy=310 from this link : http://www.businessinsider.com/greek-tragedy-debt-deficits-and-default-2009-12, 
  are there that many egyptians in europe ? 
  where 's the viviane redding for fat old aspiring porn actors ? 
  where ? 
  you 're the one throwing around terms that you do n't understand like `` market demand '' and taking them to mean `` women want to work in board positions '' ... 
   what i meant is that there is a great demand on behalf of women to get into board level positions well plenty of people want to work in the board of companies making lots of money , does that mean that they 're both qualified and willing to put in the sacrifices needed to get there ? 
  so you 're saying that private businesses , whose sole reason to exist is to make a profit , are consciously ignoring what the market demands ? 
  i see the video and i changed my mind , the kid was definitely doing nothing , but the kid getting hit seems accidental . 
  the policeman was definitely in the wrong if we take in account your edit . 
   the difference is there is serious demand for women to get board positions , i do n't understand what you 're trying to say here , market demand ? 
  political demand ? 
  can we get quotas for men in cushy administrative jobs ? 
  how about daycare centers ? 
  or schools ? 
  or any other area where women are overrepresented ? 
  well at least inn the spanish case excessive spending did n't come from the government , but from the private sector speculating on a bubble with credit provided by german banks , so not really as simple as saying `` lazy southerners stop complaining '', 
  ehh i would be skeptical f those numbers , while there are certainly losses from missing days of work people tend to make up for it when they do work, 
  this is such a non-sequitur it 's making my brain spin, 
  there was no school at ny level today in spain,

  if you are from the states , there will be transatlantic low cost flights from barcelona soon , so you can always come in a couple of years for a low price . 
  ( we are talking about 250-300 $ both ways ), 
  have you thought about the language ? 
  because you have romance countries where you will be fluent in the language in a few months . 
  what about those ? 
  are you aware of how hard danish is ? 
  or german ? 
  and also you have portugal, 
  from spanish people ? 
  cause i 've never heard anyone here referring to barcelona as bar\u00e7a when talking about the city also i googled it , just to be sure cause you made me doubt , and everyone says the same . 
  barna is the official abreviation to the city , and bar\u00e7a is just used for the football team, 
  i do n't know if you are serious , but just in case , that 's the team , not the city !, 
  because the guy has 2 balls bigger than his head, 
   that 's true , but ilegal . 
  if you fall into that scam just call the police ... are you sure about this ? 
  i 've seen menus with the iva not included many times , and even in really good restaurants , not the typical touristic ones i guess it is illegal if you do n't mention that the iva is not included . 
   my grandma ( an atheist too , go figure ) used to say `` see you tomorrow , if god wants to '' ( hasta manana , si dios quiere ) when kissing us goodnight , which creeped me out beyond imaginable . 
  i think all the grandmas do that . 
  when you are a kid you are like `` pls god do n't fucking kill me i want to make it to tomorrow '', 
  in some restaurants the price is shown without vat , check if it says `` iva no inclu\u00eddo '' . 
  about the tips , forget about it unless the service is good . 
  about the quantity , it is up to you , but i think 1-2 $ is more than enough . 
  5 $ is the maximum i have given . 
  your question is a bit retarded . 
  every country in the eu know that the eu is in fact a good thing for their quality of life and economy . 
  ** there are some countries that dislike the way the eu is getting ruled ** , but that does n't make them dislike the eu , but the current politicians . 
  if your country is ruled by the party you do n't like , would you say that you do n't like your country ? 
  please stop , i am starting to feel bad for him, 
  my company is english , so therefore i work with mostly english and german people , and i have to say i 'm really impressed about how well they speak spanish . 
  the english people that come here and do n't try to learn the language/integrate are those pensioners that go to the south . 
  but the normal english people that come here to make a life in the sunny spain , integrate just well , like any other european . 
  also you ca n't blame the pensioners , you ca n't expect them to learn a language when they are 70 + . 
   these places are shitholes for black and brown people . 
  we only have 5 million of south americans because spain is a shithole for them . 
  only on mexico 's tv shows, 
   i 'd like to name her mar\u00eda marcela luc\u00eda . 
  and you are dutch ? 
  it would be something like ** mar\u00eda marcela luc\u00eda van der wissel fern\u00e1ndez ** are you sure about it ? 
  a common european name such as sofia , maria , mario , etc. 
  a name used in the whole europe ( not only in spain ) and easy to pronounce . 
  for sure not a name like mine ( basque one ) that people struggle to pronounce . 
  ( even tho i like it ), 
  that 's not what cambridge , oxford or merriam webster dictionaries say . 
  and i do n't want to be rude but , why are you telling me what my homeland is ? 
  it feels like foreigners feel with the right to tell us ( and catalans ) what we are and what we should do . 
  to think we are a country is delusional . 
  we are an autonomous community of spain and an historical nation . 
  some people do n't like it and try to change that , that 's it and we respect everyone 's opinions , but even the independentists know what we are . 
  just because the word `` country '' is used in other languages , that does n't make us a country . 
  the original name is euskal-herria , not basque country . 
  also you find everywhere that scotland is a country , but you ca n't find anywhere that the basque country is a country . 
  the basque country ( / \u02c8b\u00e6sk / , / \u02c8b\u0251\u02d0sk / ; basque : euskadi [ eus\u033akadi ] ; spanish : pa\u00eds vasco [ pa\u02c8is \u02c8\u03b2asko ] ; french : pays basque ) is an autonomous community of northern spain . 
  scotland ( / \u02c8sk\u0252t.l\u0259nd / ; scots : [ \u02c8sk\u0254t.l\u0259nd ] ; scottish gaelic : alba [ \u02c8al\u032a\u02e0ap\u0259 ] ( listen ) ) is a country that is part of the united kingdom and covers the northern third of the island of great britain . 
  we are a historical nation , and we were part of the kingdom of navarre , that 's all . 
  the same applies to catalonia and the kingdom of aragon, 
  i am from the basque country and everybody here ( save a few nationalistics ) know that the basque country is not a country but a historical nation . 
  our name is confused cause it is badly translated from euskal-herria , where herria does n't mean country , but somehow it was translated that way kingdom of navarre , that was a country . 
  just like the kingdom of aragon and castille, 
   but like them , there are parts of germany and italy that were independent for a long time what parts of spain have been independent for a long time ? 
  i am curious, 
   catalan thing , not spanish that 's like saying `` that 's a thing in moscow , not in russia though '', 
   my jaw dropped at seeing a 1l water bottle for 25 euro cents . 
  that 's amazing ; how are you guys doing that ?!, 
  that 's because we recycle fecal waters and bottle it . 
  i hope you enjoyed your trip ( im joking , you can stop vomiting ), 
  i am 183 , and i do n't consider myself tall when there are teenagers around me ( those bastards are easily 180 + at the age of 16 ) but i am above the average and i am usually taller than most of people ( save youngsters ), 
  oregon would be like living in / r/earthporn, 
  nothing like eating chorizo after siesta while washing your flamenco dress pd : i have it in the bathroom, 
  https://8values.github.io/results.html?e=58.5&amp;d=56.9&amp;g=53.8&amp;s=62.8 this test seems to work , i would say it is pretty accurate . 
  not even 50 % of the people in bilbao speak euskera which is sad , but it 's the reality . 
  the situation is different if you compare it with other spanish historical regions , like catalonia . 
  in the big cities most of people do n't speak it , you see almost everything in spanish , etc. 
  there are schools for adults to learn euskera , so people keep trying to learn it . 
  the thing is euskera is an extremely hard language , and if you do n't learn it as a child , it 's rather impossible to learn it as an adult . 
  also there are schools for kids , the so called ikastolas , where almost everything is taught in euskera . 
  the problem is , that it is well known that the most radical basques send their kids there , so the normal people try to avoid them . 
  i do n't know , i think it is the city that best represents europe as a whole . 
  for its history , its facades , its streets , etc. 
  plus it is an economic powerhouse , well located , and it is the capital of france , one of the pilars of europe . 
  i would make paris the capital of europe, 
  i love the catalan accent , although many people hate it for how they pronounce the l. 
  the big macs are very big macs and much big macs . 
  it 's very difficult todo esto . 
  yes , for this [ one ] ( http://i7.photobucket.com/albums/y271/neutravo/imperio.jpg ) its the first flag we had and we changed it for the current one because in the sea it was hard to distinguish from the english one ( what a shame ) i think it looks cooler and it represents way more than the current one , since it is the flag we had during the spanish empire and during the spanish golden age if the iberian union is a reality in the future , i would take [ this ] ( http://orig15.deviantart.net/8749/f/2014/057/5/7/flag_of_the_union_of_iberia_by_lyniv-d76zpl3.jpg ) as a flag without thinking twice . 
  yes , especially f1 and motogp ( these recent years we are dominating the last one ) also , this year , everybody in spain is suddenly a super fan of the indy500, 
  catholicism in spain is another stereotype . 
  if we were that much catholic we would n't always be on the top of europe talking about same-sex acceptance , gender equality , civil rights , abortion , etc, 
  why should n't we be tolerant ? 
   but merkel for example had to explain to him how he ca n't just make a deal with germany , he has to make a deal with the eu at large and he did n't seem to get it . 
  he just does n't read his notes apparently . 
  she had to explain that to him 11 times http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/angela-merkel-donald-trump-explain-eu-trade-11-times-germany-chancellor-us-president-a7699591.html, 
  right , they do n't understand that we ca n't learn how to dance flamenco if we are sleeping the whole day, 
  to experience something similar to the northern europe cuisine ( im joking guys , i am acting like a real spaniard , the truth is i eat mostly hamburgers ), 
   where do you put it then ? 
  in the garbage, 
  about the languages , the order of difficulty from easier to harder would be : norwegian  swedish  danish use duolingo and check , you will find out that norwegian is easier than swedish , and way way easier than danish . 
  about the cost of living , from cheaper to more expensive would be : sweden  denmark  norway but i would say the rent prices in copenhagen are way more expensive than in oslo/stockholm, 
  well , catalan is a language and not a dialect , but it is my choice , i like how it sounds , it is my favourite by far [ video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zptpx1kejay ), 
  yes , i am worried . 
  i do n't care from where the immigrants come , but they should integrate to the country they are going , and not the other way around .

  i know it 's a joke , but : no . 
  not at all , this is / u/aleixasv that we 're talking about . 
  it 's the guy , not the catalan people . 
  but for a delusional like this one the problem `` it 's yours '' and `` the spanish trolls '' whenever he gets downvotes ( like if the spanish were the only ones downvoting him ... or like if a spanish person was n't able to agree with whatever he has to say ) most catalans are just normal , and by most i mean the independentists * too * . 
  that 's why the french beat us . 
  very slightly , but it 's there . 
  please bring hawt portuguese guise instead . 
  we can `` fight ''   , 
  and paella spanish ... 
  i 'm going there now , bitch . 
  i 'm literally refering to your own sources ... do you want me to link your own links ? 
  http://www.lavanguardia.com/local/madrid/20160224/302395918353/cifuente-madrid-arrebatar-mobile-congres.html this is the president of the autonomous community trying to bid for wmc ... not the central government trying to `` steal '' barcelona 's congresses . 
  do you even understand this ? 
  it 's your frigging link . 
  you posted it . 
  ecuador or morocco are also sunny and cheap , but they 're not the 5th . 
  not madrid ( in abstract ) . 
  the autonomous community of madrid . 
  the central government ( based in madrid ) does fund and support barcelona 's wmc . 
  you 're playing with the words . 
  you 're not objective . 
  you never were , you never are . 
  people already know you here and do n't buy your political agenda , 
  are you even aware when you refer to `` madrid '' most people think of the central gov. 
  because that 's how you depict it ? 
  and that the central gov. 
  is actually financing the barcelona 's mwc ? 
  it 's not just ridiculous ... it 's just simply yet another fallacy . 
  of course autonomous communities compete for their shit , but you are not even trying to hide that the central gov. 
  is the one ( together with bcn and the generalitat ) funding it . 
  surely the central gov. 
  is also against barcelona 's big to one of the eu institutions that will be moved from london ... except it 's the most interested . 
  quit the bullshit and the false photograph . 
  you said that madrid steals barcelona 's congresses . 
  that 's ... ridiculous lmfao you simply do n't know what to say besides the usual mantra that keep saying again and again . 
  lol, 
  fallacy : being pro-independence does n't mean you think `` spain steals from us '' . 
  do n't use fallacies to try to debate , please : /, 
  sure , everything madrid does is substracting barcelona 's money , congresses , international projection ... you guys are terrible , no one outside catalonia ( and inside , most ) believes that anymore , because it 's simply false . 
  even the independentism movement itself has been moving away from those arguments since 2012-2013 ( they have been saying the `` spain steal us '' motto is just untrue ) . 
  but you redditor independentist crusaders keep trying , lol . 
  of course we are better and stronger together , and it will be like that for the years to come , 
   any economic rational approach will confirm how badly barcelona suffers from this `` strong combination '' ... 
  except this is simply untrue . 
  but why do you consider it to `` react so badly '' when we are simply telling you that basically no one uses that demonym to refer to castille and leon ? 
  we 're not franco yelling at you , we 're simply pointing out that no one in castille and leon would say `` old castille '' ( maybe what , 500 out of 2 million ? 
  ) , and that it sounded like a political statement because of the whole `` blarrrgggh , fuck spain because is not real , castillians are evil that occupied the rest of the peninsula , blarrgghh '' thing . 
  not even the `` castillians '' themselves consider themselves like that ... they usually refer to themselves as their more regional/local places ( salmantinos , toledanos , madrile\u00f1os ... etc ) . 
  people and cultures evolve ... we ca n't use `` castillians '' like the old fashion way because it 's very difuminated now . 
  just like the `` historical region of castille '' is . 
  not really , catalonia is also heavily benefitied from being part of spain . 
  denying this is like saying the eu does nothing but substract money for its institutions , and that brussels is like mordor . 
  that 's not the whole picture , just like that argument is not the whole picture of how spain works at all . 
  no one can say that catalonia being independent = it will be much better . 
  it could be ... ... or not , because there are many cons as well on leaving spain and the eu just afterwards . 
  you 're simply leaving the `` it will go well '' to the sentiments , the feeling , your nationalistic views ... and not much else . 
  because we rock , of course . 
  i mean we are 5th being only the 30th most populous country and the 12th biggest economy in the world . 
  not a bad position at all . 
  also interesting position for portugal as well . 
   completely unlikely , and then ...  `` castile and leon '' and `` castile-la mancha '' are modern inventions who do not accurate reflect the historical sure buddy , sure ... not a political statement . 
  madrid + barcelona combined is where is at #strongertogether, 
  that 's because spaniards do n't use `` old castile '' or `` new castile '' for many decades , maybe ? 
  i was going to share this . 
  what about portugal or sweden ? 
  or you just call them corrupt because you have no fucking idea what you 're even talking about ? 
  i knew it was that anyway . 
  i miss the winter already :|, 
  like if he was relevant in the cyclical nature of the job market in spain . 
  the definition of ignorance , mixed with crappy stereotypes , and `` what other redditors say '' right there . 
  i doubt it . 
  this was used mainly by british media alone . 
  not something the average american would see or hear . 
  your point being ... ? 
  what does this crisis have to do with being a poor or undeveloped country ? 
  spain has passed through an economic crisis ( and many many more before ) , not that that has changed the country from developed and highly advanced economy to a poor one . 
  you should probably read more ( and will understand that acronym is quite derogatory and not being used anymore , not even by the financial times ) . 
   in the beginning of the 90 's portugal had to import 80 % of the olive oil for consumption and now we produce to reach our needs and export ? 
  do you know why ? 
  spaniards start to buy olive terrains in alentejo and modernized the industry  i totally did n't know that , but we should definitely work together much more closely . 
  i do n't think a confederation is possible today but that 's my dream . 
  and the best healthcare systems , family care , `` live and let be '' , homosexual tolerance ... we are top notch irm\u00e3o . 
  i do n't think some people understand what a poor country is . 
  definitely not spain btw . 
  since when the civilized , much more technologically , politically , economically advanced roman empire existed to boost the economy of some backwards barbaric tribes ? 
  why did n't you love canada before this , cazzo !, 
  well you compared one of the poorest regions of spain ... a better comparison would be toledo or valladolid and any interior medium-to-big french city . 
  in living standards ? 
  i do n't think so . 
  you are probably talking about gdp per capita charts alone . 
  but standard of living between france and spain is not very different . 
  on average , obviously : you can also find more impoverished areas here and there , including in france , although i have to say they have less differences in that regard ( in the sense that there 's not as big north/south or north-interior-east vs south-west clearly division as we have in spain ), 
  yay , thanks for madrid , my brothers . 
  i feel bad for germany especially , though . 
  yes , i mean , there are differences , of course . 
  just saying that they 're not noticeable for someone coming from a poor or underdeveloped country , as example . 
  and of course we have that unemployment problem still ... although i hear in france it 's above 10 % and it 's kind of a huge number for the french economy ( a 10 % here would be like your 2 % or 3 % lol ), 
  are you from my neighbourhood ? 
  there 's barely any difference between spain and france 's living standards ( i 've been some time to france so i could corroborate it myself . 
  we 're pretty , equally awesome ) .

  we do n't have a lisp we do n't say ethpa\u00f1a , we can pronounce the 's ' perfectly thank you . 
  we change the pronounciation of some letters centuries ago and it was decided that c and z was to be pronounced like the greek theta . 
  but that was done before teaching americans spanish, 
  officially 10th place - public 17th place . 
  nice !, 
  the jury gave us almost 3 times the votes public gave us . 
  i have n't heard spain song actually , i only follow the votes , they are hilarious, 
  whelp they did n't save ** us ** so thanks for nothing soviets . 
   then why not advocate leaving nato ? 
  the purpose of it is collective defence , and if a country feels it is getting nothing out of it i think that is more a reason to leave than not meet the agreed threshold . 
  i 'm a little late to answer but whatever . 
  about what i quoted . 
  i 'm ok with spain helping other western nations if needed be , even if we do n't really get nothing out of nato , but having to waste money with no real purpose because of it , no so much . 
  and that 's why nato is what it is , and nobody really complains . 
  never heard that actually , but i would bet that almost half of that 5 % blue are swedes or other scandinavian ... we , on the other hand have almost as much `` reds '' as norway total . 
  edit - i think this needs a clarification : i 'm talking about the view of norway as not homogenous which i think you really are . 
  i 'm not discussing the reasons of the economical and social success of the country . 
   and the 2 % figure is hardly a figure the us pulled out of their ass to bully the european nations , it was something that was agreed upon . 
  different contexts . 
  you guys use your military to project influence into the world , that 's ok ( i guess ... ) but the rest of us do n't and there is no sense in spending more money in shit to just store it away . 
  this is just the military industry lobbying because the crimea crisis give them a good excuse . 
  as a spaniard i think we are doing more than enough to contribute to nato since we get no global influence , nor security since we have no threats . 
  it 's really about foreigners though . 
  spain usually votes for romania , uk , portugal and germany . 
  if you look what europeans are the most numerous in spain ... 
  surprise !, 
  nice analisis but about the second point . 
  the bolliviarian alliance is a joke . 
  it 's just venezuela teaming up with smaller countries trying to get a better play in sa . 
  the big south american nations are out of that shite . 
  if mexican spanish is the alternative , i will root for chinese or something ... 
   as long as english has the ~ ~ combined prominence , in ~ ~ us ~ ~ , uk , australia , india and most of europe , ~ ~ its not going away for a long time . 
  there are some novels that can give very different feelings about spanish literature so i prefer if other spaniard point out ** `` the novel that foreigners should read '' ** too much presure for me . 
  but just for enjoyment , i think `` the dumas club '' could be interesting to read for any foreigner , is about a book hunter/searcher ( ? ), 
  that works on `` two books '' ( a satanic one and a dumas one ) ... shit happens , and he does n't know which one is the cause . 
  it 's from a modern writer , p\u00e9rez-reverte , he is a total douchebag , but i really like his soft novels ... and some of his twitters : `` i 've spent two hours killing russians '' ( call of duty ) i also want to mention `` the house of the spirits '' of isabel allende not european but argentinian , ( but argentina is europe right ? 
  ) , which is very `` thepillarsoftheearth `` ish but with colonialism , ouija and shit , it 's very enjoyable . 
  i came here expecting to have read lots of the books mentioned . 
  and the only one i 've read is `` gulliver 's travels '' and mostly because `` la puta '' in my defense i would say we have lots of good novels in spain , and half a continent writing in spanish too ; i still expect a russian mentioning `` crime and punishment '' though , it 's my favorite . 
  source : gypsy palm reader, 
  do you need a viking to tell you ? 
  i mean , i always knew i was loud . 
  it is how it is ... 
  also the division is in both things ; trust given and trust received . 
  this time was al-qaeda vs al-qaeda drop out . 
  hezbollah is not jihadist . 
  he is a fucking aussie , it 's not like we are talking about a chinese or a tanzanian . 
  he is from a country with a heavy european background already . 
  source ? 
  castillian  spanish  romance european  south european ~ = western  christian background ( i 'm an atheist but religion background is kinda of important for values and culture )  earthling to me the whole eu thing so far east is a little meh , cool but meh . 
  if you were to ask me whom i feel much closer to , an argentinian or a polish the answer is kind of obvious , and i loved poland and gda\u0144sk when i was there . 
  that 's not the purpose of the eu , but to take the fragmented countries of europe to form a block that is able to play in a world of usas , chinas , russias and such . 
  metta world peace is just a basketball player . 
  seriously , do n't look at the pretty colors and look at the legend the lightest blue is '' < 1 '' and asturias blue is `` 1.5 - 2.49 '' . 
  yeah that 's exaclty what is happening in this map , right ? 
  it looks like a latin origin word ; in spanish is `` patr\u00f3n '' from the latin patronus which also meant prototype and such ... 
  baby steps , at least i did n't write `` ocuod '', 
  i do n't agree . 
  `` akward '' is a big word that covers too many meanings . 
  akward can mean clumsy , uncomfortable or embarrasing for example . 
  it 's pretty hard when translating words to conserve all their meanings , in english , in french or in chinese . 
  imo akward can be perfectly translated in each context without losing meaning . 
  what the women look is too tan ; it 's like the opposite of the rest of the world , pale males , tan females . 
  also , very sunny photos , never been in sweden , but i spent almost a month in berlin and did n't get to see the sun in all that time . 
  im always so skeptical when i see photos of northen green sceneries bathed by the sun . 
   `` ei guys look how we have done ... injected massive amounts of dollars in the economy and now we aren \u00b4 t bankrupted '' if you got the aircraft carriers to support it i do n't see the problem, 
  the same link you provided is the one that says that the data was goten from each contruy , right at the bottom ... 
  anyway it does not matter because that was n't my point . 
  what i meant is that you should present your data better if you want a real discussion , and dont pile up the number that suits you to make another post of murica !, 
  against eu . 
  also not cool to throw spain numbers at my face ; like i have something to do with it , or make my point less valid . 
   we 'll soon be reaching a stage where violent riots are going to become standard practise in demonstrations across the country nah, 
  i do n't know much about this theme but ... do n't you think the numbers you are comparing do n't match with each other . 
  i mean , you have gone back to the 1980 to take the number for the us ( the 3 million figure i do n't see it ) and you compare it with the ones living in europe right now . 
  then you compare the rejection rate between the us with the whole eu , which makes no sense , because the same guy usually applies for several nations in europe ; meaning one guy can get 5 rejections while he can get only one acceptance . 
  i do n't know i could be wrong and i did n't understand it well , but i think you should give this a thought , or present better those statics . 
  let me be a little bit douchy : so the strategy was to convince russia to attack easier countries , and wait for other nations to save the day . 
  i still do n't understand why sweden and specially finland do n't join nato , when they are already benefiting from its existance . 
   also , who 'd stop them ? 
  nato wo n't lift a finger . 
  of course they will , this statment is getting repetitive and boring lately . 
  we have our hands full with our christianity , pls do n't add an even more backward religion , thank you . 
  playing ck2 right now with a finnish tribe , ca n't wait to form the kingdom of finlad and get that magnificient lion as my coa . 
  that 's it , if the swedes and the russians with that bullshit alliance of theirs leave me the fuck alone for a little while . 
   it 's all over the western countries , is n't it ? 
  not in spain , but then again people put us out of the west sometimes . 
  anyway we have a prank day the 28th of december `` el dia de los santos inocentes '' which commemorates [ this scary shit ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/massacre_of_the_innocents#feast_days ) many jokes that day , see ... 
  born in spain with spanish origins yes ; but she is french , really . 
   the catholics in the west also commited genocide on us , no one remembers that . 
  we tried to defend our people both from the west and from catholic slavs and we 're the bad guys ? 
   the west is consistently trying to destroy slavs ( and the orthodox culture ) the catholics !?!, 
  in what world are you living in , muchacho ? 
  ok , just a little more centuries to go and we will have our own tv show on history channel . 
  exactly , i 'm a lazy slacker redditing from work . 
  but i do n't represent my country goddamit . 
  ... because i have a job . 
  not true !, 
  so gypsy is now offensive ? 
  that 's what they call themselves here in spain . 
  `` gitano '' or `` cal\u00e9 '',

  just because many us states have a state flower / bird / mammal / whatever they keep creating these lists . 
  then , if she had voted in autonomic elections , i do n't believe at all she was not allowed to voted back then . 
  unless she wanted to vote in the wrong place . 
  also , if she votes on autonomic elections , it means she has spanish nationality . 
  so , she could not be a weird case that the people at the voting place did n't know how to treat . 
  if spain were to block a catalan state into the eu , most of spanish goods ( more than 50 % ) would have to find another way to reach the rest of the eu , as they would be taxed or stopped at the border , for example . 
  also the eu would lose a net contributor ( in fact , right now , the top contributor per population , i think ) . 
  anyway we could just join the efta and schengen and keep using the euro . 
  it 's simply we are more stable than the country we want to leave . 
  so , saying we are not stable is not a reason not to leave . 
  ana pastor got 169 votes . 
  25 blank votes . 
  ( plus one abstention , of course ) 169 votes are the exact addition of pp ( 137 ) + ciudadanos ( 32 ) . 
  155 votes are almost the exact addition of psoe ( 85 ) + up ( including ecp , comprom\u00eds ... ) ( 45 + 12 + 9 + 5 = 71 ) i guess the abstention comes from one of them . 
  25 blank votes are the exact addition of erc ( 9 ) + pdc ( 8 ) + pnv ( 5 ) + bildu ( 2 ) + cc ( 1 ) source for the number of mp : https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/congreso_de_los_diputados source for the votes : http://www.congreso.es/portal/page/portal/congreso/congreso/salaprensa/notpre?_piref73_7706063_73_1337373_1337373.next_page=/wc/detallenotasalaprensa?idnotasalaprensa=19646&amp;mostrarvolver=n so , it seems you were lying , but without knowing it . 
  you should look for better information sources . 
  rewriting history again ? 
   party ruling catalonia votes for pp 's choice to preside congress . 
  you know you are lying , do n't you ? 
  neither erc nor pdc voted for ana pastor . 
  if you ask for a referendum over a dozen times and the answer has always been no , what do you do ? 
  do you keep on asking permission for , what , 1000 times more ? 
  or you keep on , no matter what they say ? 
   to put things in perspective , the catalan government which makes those claims has been unable to approve the 2016 budget , and has planned a motion of confidendence for september . 
  and the provisional spanish governtment which opposes those claims has not been able to conform a new government since last december . 
  so what ? 
   so , new elections in catalonia are n't exactly unthinkable , new elections ? 
  like elections in december and again in june ? 
   i know some people that can barely speak spanish , and when they go out they seem guiris . 
  guiris from the same country !, 
  someone who has spanish as his second language speaks it like people who have it as a second language !!, 
  did she present the papers showing she was currently living here ? 
  because i was a volunteer in that `` participation process '' and everyone who came with legal papers showing they live here were allowed to vote . 
  i 've now read that , since being at war for the last several years , their nutrition has impoverished and the height reduced . 
  dinka people , who live in south sudan , have , since i can remember , been considered the tallest people in the world . 
  more than south sudan people ? 
  really ? 
  and as catalonia comes from catalan , and catalan has been used in english since centuries ago , we should use it . 
  middleman79 talks about maps . 
  mestermagyar mentions philistia , which is the ancient name that appears on maps older than 2000 years ago . 
  i this whole thread you are just answering me ... 
  who said philistines were related with modern palestinians ? 
  the question was about maps with palestine in them . 
  not about the people living in that place . 
  make sense ? 
  well , yeah . 
  the problem is that the country is named after the people . 
  also , as from greenland you have greenlandic and from iceland you have icelandic , people from england would be englandic , according to your logic , innit ? 
  greek origin ? 
  you know this has not been proved at all . 
  and palestine is just the modern rendering of that philistia . 
  palestina is the modern ( well , latin ) rendering of philistia . 
  well , estonian independence was quite unilateral ... 
  the country is catalonia , the adjective catalan . 
  says the estonian one ... 
  you do n't say germanians or spainians , do n't you ? 
  so better say catalans , not catalonians . 
  you know you make no sense , do n't you ? 
  linking a video twice makes it more true ? 
  weird logic . 
  so you mean you do n't want proofs , with you prejudices you have enough . 
  great . 
  so , your proof is that the us lied about proofs . 
  great . 
  you realize those videos do not prove anything , do n't you ? 
  is there any proof that gulen 's organization was behind the coup ? 
  i would call them `` special '' , more than beautiful . 
  hey , last summer i bought a fan !, 
  we were over 35\u00bac , with lots of humidity , for several days in a row . 
  in summer i have them down during the day , to not let the sun in , and up during the night . 
  in winter , the other way round . 
  well , i know nothing of < -5 \u00bac winters ... ( and not much of < 0\u00bac , either ), 
  look up `` decretos de nueva planta '' . 
  just curiosity , why are you posting it now , when it is from october ... 
  ** [ the clarification ] ( https://www.thesun.co.uk/archives/news/297647/clarification-30/ ) and [ the original news ] ( https://www.thesun.co.uk/archives/politics/1068437/eu-have-to-be-kidding/ ) . 
  i do n't get `` the vatican '' . 
   the protection of minorities is an important part of democracy , exactly . 
  the protection of children , who can not even vote , is very important . 
  the same in catalan ( fills de puta ) . 
  well , psoe are socialdemocrats only nominally . 
  their politics are more center-right wing ones . 
  and , in fact , up , or at least podemos , are hard to describe in european terms . 
  what they really are is socialpopulists , south american style . 
  he is the head of iu , which is a mix of parties that includes communists parties in it , but not only . 
  and this mix gets even more diluted into up . 
  they are socialdemocrats , mostly . 
  is that really ultraleft for you ? 
   you do n't need to learn history , but just open your mind . 
  you can get independence , but that would be splitting up spain , not `` a colony being free 'd from its colonizer '' . 
  period . 
  by the way , i think no spanish polititian shares your view . 
  none says if there 's independence there will be two new countries , but one heir country and a new country . 
  so , spain would still be on the un , the eu , the nato ... but catalonia should ask to join any international organization . 
   in what form or shape does that change what i 've just said ? 
  you can give an id card to saharians and presence on the parliament . 
  they still were colonies . 
  when does a conquered territory stop being a colony ? 
  you know the cadiz constitution speaks about the spaniard of both hemispheres , that saharians had dni , that guinea ecuatorial was a province , with presence on the parliament , and later an autonomous comunity , do n't you ? 
  spain was still spain without portugal . 
  spain was still spain without flanders .

  some parties have considered it but it 's not simple . 
  first , many people in spain ( mainly in the spanish speaking regions , and me included ) are against the decentralized model , seeing it as a huge waste of money due to duplicities , so any party proposing further decentralization is gon na alienate part of its voters . 
  but also it would n't even make them earn votes in the secessionist regions , since usually people who want further autonomy do n't want a federation , but independence . 
  it 's not even the historic sparta . 
  iirc it 's just some modern town named after the original one , which used to be somewhere nearby . 
  lovely . 
  they contribute so much to our societies !, 
  that 's an important difference . 
  but unless that happens they have de facto similar autonomy levels . 
  being realistic they 'd just put it in some other country . 
  i do n't believe we 'll see the day when all tax havens have disappeared . 
  they do have independent justice systems , education , healthcare and police , among others . 
  it 's not a federation , but it 's pretty close . 
  so far decentralization has n't exactly worked great appeasing nationalisms in spain . 
  catalonia & the basque country have never had as much autonomy as today and independence has never had as much support . 
  these girls are raised so their goal in life is having a strong husband , a big family and a pious life . 
  you can imagine their opinion on our women 's rights and feminism . 
  it 's already gone metastatic . 
  i 'm sure the germans appreciate this detailed judgment of their society from a random foreigner . 
  yeah , do n't bother . 
  the multiculti-band has finally found a positive thread about muslims and have made their nest on it . 
  now they 're just trying to hide any comment not praising how very tolerant are our euro-muslims . 
  yeah you just found the source of muslim radicalism in europe : people who react to it well after it 's all over . 
  genius . 
  it 's already been 10 years since [ this happened ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2004_madrid_train_bombings ) . 
  because there 's a thing called culture , and that does n't depend on where was the hospital where your mother gave birth to you . 
  sjws can keep trying to make this look like a poverty problem , or put the blame on `` society '' or anybody but the radicals themselves . 
  it wo n't make it truth . 
  they 're more than free to go back to their countries if they 're not able to adapt . 
  but do n't expect the country that received you to adapt to you . 
  it 's not wrong , the map just has a \u00b1 1000 km margin of error . 
  some 70 year old driving at 30 km/h who 's gon na change to your lane without blinkers . 
  i 'm not commenting on how you feel about the spanish position , but on the general opinion that the scottish movement is going to be some kind of trigger for stuff to happen in spain . 
  stuff is already happening here regardless of the scots . 
  regarding the politician comments , he , just like the italian cited on the article , are answering questions regarding eu law . 
  that is n't `` commenting on scottish separatism '' . 
  i really do n't see this referendum having nearly as much influence in spain as / r/europe seems to believe . 
  the catalan and basque secessionist movements are powerful enough , having as much or more history that the scottish one . 
  they 'd keep pushing independence regardless of what had happened in scotland . 
  romania has a border with ukraine . 
  being realistic and kind of hawkish , europe can `` defend its interests '' way easier in algeria than in russia . 
  not right . 
  this question shows up in every thread . 
  yes , spain will . 
  union ? 
  brics is just a name made up by economists , whose countries organize a yearly summit . 
  if that 's an union spain must be in 3 or 4 of those . 
  sorry , some graffiti does not qualify as catalan being forbidden . 
  very nice of you trying to make me seem like a fascist , btw . 
  oh yeah , i must be a borderline nazi not to believe pan-catalanist propaganda . 
  spain does not recognize unilaterally independent states , being them kosovo or abkhazia . 
  and that 's the way to go if you ask me . 
  says who affirms speaking catalan has ever been forbidden . 
  not being official/being discouraged ! = being forbidden . 
  blah blah blah franco used to oppress us . 
  you know you have a weird concept of oppression when you are complaining about 1/3 of lectures being taught in spanish . 
  also , valencia is not catalonia , so whatever happens there has nothing to do with it . 
  it could be argued that 1 % would be better expended in creating alternatives to german dependence on russian gas . 
  wawaweewa , it 's a very nice !, 
  if it 's yearly salary i assume pre-tax . 
  taking about monthly salary the number is almost always followed by either the word ` limpios ' ( post-tax ) or ` brutos ' ( pre-tax ) , otherwise i usually assume post-tax .

  if only it were funny, 
  canada , usa and australia have huge uranium reserves and those would be most likely allies of euope in case of conflict . 
  spain and sweden also have sizable reserves . 
  i wonder if the round numbers and the difference between ceuta and melilla is because they asked exactly 4 persons . 
  and just like that danzig is prussian again . 
  most of it taiga and tundra . 
  do you see many french , italian , german or british doing it ? 
  nice prejudices dude, 
  then you must be blind , or you just do n't see whatever does n't fit your ideology . 
  i take you have not been to paris . 
  what the fuck denmark . 
  it would be interesting to see the number of anti-aircraft weapons in eastern europe . 
  isabella and ferdinand were the heads of different kingdoms , none of them with a single capital , so there were several throne rooms . 
  this is for instance the [ throne room ] ( http://www.alcazardesegovia.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/sala-del-trono-slide.jpg ) in segovia 's castle . 
  70 years ago, 
  apparently [ this is the spanish kings ' throne room ] ( http://womenworld.org/image/042012/palacio%20real_3.jpg ) . 
  it 's not exactly a famous thing here . 
  ad hoc account created to post this . 
  weird . 
  how long would it take for the 2k + russians tanks to reach the german border ? 
  how long would it take for the us main armies to land in central europe ? 
  i 'm not saying nato would n't try to hold poland , but that we may not be able . 
  for a single person , 2000 $ may be enough . 
  for a family , double or triple that . 
  is this accurate ? 
  the baltics , being the first ones that would be attacked , have 3 tanks , 0 planes and spend almost nothing in millitary . 
  even if it was more important than the defense of dc , i do n't believe it 's really doable . 
  i 'm no military expert , but you just have to look at a map . 
  the baltics are almost indefensible , the front would be most likely be somewhere in central or even western europe . 
  wallonia would n't even be close to be the smallest , less populated or poorer nation in europe . 
  why would n't it be able to survive as an independent country ? 
  specially if it joins the eu . 
  sweden 's idea of help may be very different ( more watered ) from that of the us or uk . 
  what is there to fight ? 
  they 're not profitable . 
  we 're 20 years overdue in completely dismantling them . 
  it 's crazy that nowadays there 's still people who * start * their career in the subsidized mines . 
  it 's almost impossible for a civilian to legally get a gun , or any short barrel weapon , unless you have suffered threats from eta , which does n't really happen anymore .

so , the country is out of crisis but the people are just stupid and did n't realized it ? 
  well , maybe it 's because in a country like spain the ibex35 and related macroeconomic data means nothing to the country due to the fact that the companies on the ibex35 represents less than 5 % of the job positions creators and are the tiny familiar companies the ones that sustain the country . 
  the tiny little companies that are destroyed due to the lock down on loans from the banks due to the huge hole they have but hey !, 
  we are just idiots that did n't realized that we live in a country that is out of a crisis and is going well . 
  2013 ended with almost 150k more people unemployed than when it started . 
  2014 ended with some more than 250k more people unemployed that at the beginning of the year . 
  http://www.eleconomista.es/indicadores-espana/noticias/6443494/02/15/el-paro-subio-en-77980-en-el-mes-de-enero.html on 2015 january 80.000 people more to unemployment . 
  do you only read la razon or what ? 
  like the still growing unemployment and the destruction of companies ? 
  yeah , way to recover !, 
  it 's like saying `` we have to cut your arms and legs , but hey , your head is well '' . 
  the spain 's recovery is a marketing move to make sure that no other anti-austerity measures political parties get on power , imagine that podemos get to win the elections with an absolute majority , this country is not tiny greece it can be a fatal blow to the eu that merkel & co wants . 
  let me laugh to the `` economical turn around '' and surely , the dozens of my unemployed friends , some with phd and years of experience will found this funny too ,, 
  soooo doing a hate campaign does n't have anything to do ? 
  really ? 
  and i did n't post the dozens of politicians from different parties accusing the pp of being behind those boycott campaign . 
  el periodico had a letter wrote by the secretary of a pp minister giving directions to the friendly mass media on how to call for the boycott but it have been conveniently removed due to being `` old news '' . 
  it 's more the 43 % percent and going down . 
  it have been quite a long time that our companies started diversifying the exports destination , all thanks to the pp and their constants calls to boycott catalan products . 
  that 's pc for diplomatic attack . 
   i just followed logic though . 
  who would risk their relation with spain by recognizing catalonia ? 
  you are implying that spain will attack diplomatically whoever tries to do business with catalonia . 
  that line of logic , can be true of course , but with more than half of it 's exportations and importations going through catalonia i would n't dare to think that spain will shut off any diplomatic relation with catalonia . 
  the most logical movement would be to try to maintain the status quo for long as possible but if the situation changes spain will act accordingly or at least if the spain government wants to maintain their economy . 
  that 's why i said you way of thinking was childish : `` oh !, 
  they made me angry so i will bully whoever talks to them ! '', 
  we no longer live on the great empires era . 
  because you portrayed spain diplomatic as a 12 years old with an attitude and i think that the moment spain realize that catalonia is just as good as gone they will try to have friendly relation with us . 
  even following your rather childish logic you say that we will be like taiwan then ? 
  in fact , catalan independence is the best thing that can happen to spain , because right now the country works with 3 communities paying to the poor ones in order to make the powerful more rich sucking on the resources of the poor communities . 
  spain can be very rich and developed but not while the status quo is maintainable because the powerful oligarchs does n't have any reason to change it . 
  in one hand we have lots of experts on economics that say that catalonia can be a rich country if it were independent , in the other hand we have you , a guy on reddit , so i think i will stick to the professionals thanks . 
  there are lots of different kind of banks and for the sake of keeping tax revenue we do n't need a bank that can print money or lend it to the state . 
  basically what we need is the oldest form of banks : a safe place where to put the money . 
  i do n't like it either but we do n't have that much of an option . 
  no , most of the strategy is secret in order to make it more difficult for spain to create laws for those scenarios . 
  we can create our own bank and if you arrest our representatives you will create heroes and we will replace them . 
  remember that independence does n't come from mas , it comes from the will of the catalan people . 
  we can create our own bank and save it there . 
  you can apply for asylum on the catalan republic , we know how it is and we will not let you suffer needlessly . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/currency_substitution and then read again the stupidity you just wrote . 
  the problem that the spanish government faces is that catalonia have a long functioning political system and government . 
  that means is that even if spain says that catalonia is no longer an autonomy the catalan government can just ignore it and continue to function , then is when thins get complicated at that point spain is faced with two options : 1 - try diplomacy and reach and agreement with the catalan government . 
  2 - send the army . 
  the first one is the preferable one for both sides due but we are talking about the pp !, 
  if they start to talk with us his hardcore voters will never forgive them . 
  if they send the army it means that catalonia has won because it will became a game of endurance that spain can not win , if a country take the tanks to the street you can expect that every investor will flee faster than the speed of light and wait for the situation to calm and with spain economy already severely injured if the money runs it 's quite possible that in less than half a year they can not even pay the army . 
  https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/comunidad_aut%c3%b3noma check your facts . 
  we have the largest gdp followed closely by madrid . 
  will they come and take them ? 
  any country can use whatever currency he wants other thing is changing policies about that currency but if you are fine with it there is n't anything that can stop you . 
  they changed the constitution overnight just to make the troika happy . 
  or the best timing possible , because they already have their hands full we can do it with less pressure . 
  yes , lots of them . 
  scenario one : spain says the constitution applies to catalonia because you are part of spain and we do n't recognize you as an independent state . 
  in this scenario , without entering in if spain can enforce it or no , spain says that nothing changed so catalan people are spaniards to them and therefore catalans maintain the spanish citizenship . 
  scenario two : spain recognizes the catalan republic , without entering in the details of the process , and agree that the spanish constitution no longer apply to catalonia therefore catalan people can be stripped of their spanish citizenship . 
  i hope is more clear now . 
  we do n't want that constitution but if they argue that it applies to us and therefore catalonia would never be a state then it applies enterely . 
  if they want to take the spanish nationality from us they have it easy , just recognize the catalan republic and then the spanish constitution no longer apply to us and therefore can take the spanish nationality all for themselves . 
  that only applies to people between the ages of 16 and 18 . 
  those ages are the ones that the spanish civil code recognises for emancipation . 
  `` no spaniard of origin can be denied of his nationality '' source : spanish constitution , title 1 article 11 : http://www.congreso.es/consti/constitucion/indice/titulos/articulos.jsp?ini=11&amp;fin=13&amp;tipo=2, 
  so , you are a guy from barcelona that moved recently to cyprus ? 
  or are you just a little troll ? 
  no , that 's what your lying politicians told you . 
  we , catalans , know better from here . 
  see how idiotic it sounds to have that kind of opinions without knowing anything ? 
   because you 're breaking apart a country for no reason , disrupting all european order for no real reason . 
  you 're not oppressed , you live good lives in spain , but on top of that , you have thug catalonian politicians who spread this bullshit that catalonians will still be part of the eu , that they can move as they like , that catalonia 's economy will be fine , it 's all nonsense . 
  that is why catalonia is more rich we strive to be always better . 
   when we have other minorities in european countries who might want independence , do we give every single one of them their own country and carve up europe based on ` culture ' ? 
  this is nonsense . 
  to recognize catalonia would not only incite these groups to declare independence as well , but we would also piss off spain , a much more important ally than catalonia could ever be . 
  and that 's bad because ... ? 
   you have no reason to care about european minorities , but likewise we have no reason to recognize catalonia . 
  ok , do what you want but do n't come to us asking for money . 
   you 're just inciting ethnic tensions which may very well lead to violence . 
  if we use those arguments then the blacks would be still slaves . 
   if spain decides to take back its territory by force and send the army , do n't expect any help from the eu . 
  the eu have a clause for that kind of behaviour . 
  and even if there were n't those eu laws it will only lead to a war and probably throw the already weakened spanish economy straight to third world . 
  not sure if oktoberfest or salou a saturday night . 
  the day we become an independent state we should dedicate a statue to rajoy in pla\u00e7a catalunya, 
  the canary islands bans the `` toros '' 25 years ago and nothing happens , we do the same and pp makes a law that invalidates the catalan ( and sadly the canary ) too . 
  http://catalanassembly.org/why-support-catalonia/reasons/ if you want more go find it i 'm tired of writing the same to every spaniard that does n't want to know whats happening . 
  that 's not the only reason and after all this years you should know it . 
  he probably read and article in la razon . 
  obviously my example was on barcelona . 
  when i was attacked on toledo i was talking to a friend who happens to be from barcelona too so it was natural to us to talk to each other in catalan . 
  no , and that guy was a jerk . 
  what happens in the rest of spain including catalonian is : me : bon dia ( good morning ) shop keeper : buenos dias ( good morning in spanish ) me : voldria un entrepa per emportar si us plau ( i would like a sandwich to go please ) shop keeper : aqui se habla espa\u00d1ol catalufo de mierda ( yelling : here we talk spanish and a couple of swearing words ) obviously i have n't returend to this particular store and i 'm not the only one with similar stories . 
  no one here believes that with independence everything will be solved that is what the mass media from spain say to you . 
  we want independence in order to have the chance to create a better country . 
  if you think that catalonia will have only two parties like spain you do n't know catalan people , just look at our parliament . 
  for us politics is an every day topic so we are well informed . 
  as for the control we have ... let me laugh at this . 
  yes , we have a cute sheet of paper that says so then comes the tribunal constitucional and fucks every law that the pp government does n't like . 
  in a classroom of 30 people only one wants to speak spanish only ?

   wnd again in case of costs , the calculated price for the tunnel would be 2 billion eur why would be it so cheap comparing with the [ channel tunnel ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/channel_tunnel#construction ), 
  and let 's be honest . 
  is there enough population and economy around to justify the project ? 
  if it 's done is for political reasons , because an investment like that would n't be recovered in our lifetimes . 
  the purchasing power of the median citizen has n't been on free fall the last 7 years in our countries , you should know . 
  about the one at otxarkoaga ( district of bilbao , spain ) was put there in with a [ right wing nationalist mayor ] ( http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/ayuntamiento_de_bilbao ) ( bilbao has been ruled by the pnv all the democracy ) by an abertzale ( * patriotic * ) left group . 
  the statue was in the soviet embassy until it become the russian embassy . 
  when the russian embassy retired it the group proposed to put the statue in a park in bilbao and the mayor ( that leaded a minority government accepted ) . 
  off-topic : you have to admire they ruled bilbao 32 years of stable governments in minority without doing any concession that they had applying ther right wing policies with the support of the pp and their nationalist policies with the support of the pro-independence left . 
  and not only at the city , the same at the regional government . 
  and the pp was founded by a francoist minister and at the beginning was very dictatorship nostalgic , and the abertzale left had connections with eta . 
  some times had to do weird concessions ( why you want to put a lenin statue ? 
  do i have to pay something ? 
  whatever if i can keep the office with that ... ) , but bilbao has been one the best managed cities at spain . 
  no , that 's the [ ghost airport of ciudad real ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ciudad_real_central_airport ) . 
  however , that airport had flights ( paying a fortune to the airlines to move almost empty planes ) and was property of a regional saving bank that ended bankrupt . 
  castellon 's airport has never seen an airplane . 
  most of the austerity happened more than 2 years ago . 
  now we are with an expansive economic policy : giving more bailouts to banks , buying bankrupted private highways owned by the usual cronies , cutting corporate tax ... and with a 7 % deficit . 
  one week seafood paella , another week meat paella here . 
  well , when i lived with my parents . 
  however , i am from valencia . 
  western ireland is the part with the worst economy . 
  everybody invest in eastern ireland/dublin . 
  it 's not one of the core ingredients , but it works with the meat version . 
  you can also add artichoke to it . 
  if you add snails and artichoke , i would remove rabbit . 
  i do n't like to have too many ingredients . 
  edit : there are many ways of making a paella work . 
  but never put beef , pepper , marinaded meat , mix seafood and meat ... 
  paella is cooked with small variations at ingredients in different parts of valencia , already . 
  and nowadays you can find the basic ingredients all over spain : * meat version : chicken , rabbit , judias verdes anchas ( wide green beans ) , tomato . 
  and the other ingredients in the standard version are easy : saffron ( or the saffron dye ) , rosemary , garlic , sweet paprika , butter beans ( garrof\u00f3n ) can be replaced by other white beans ( tavella is used at some areas ) ... * seafood : cuttlefish ( i had to look for sepia ) , prawns , green beans , mussel , and some little fish for giving taste to the soup to cook it ( but you can use dehydrated cubes i do it often ) you are probably right . 
  i have n't seen any * foraster * do it correctly . 
  i do n't know why , i have done paella right outside valencia with ingredents bought at mercadona . 
  forasters , you even screw the basic ingredients . 
  :( in addition , gazpacho is from southern spain . 
  and there were other regional dishes called gazpacho : [ gazpacho manchego ] ( http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/gazpachos_manchegos ) . 
  spanish also . 
  can you link their official subreddit ? 
  this only means that poland has passed spain . 
  per capita data is better . 
  an article [ where an oppsitton deputy calls him for his political connections ] ( https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=es&amp;tl=en&amp;js=y&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=es&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fwww.elmundo.es%2fcomunidad-valenciana%2f2014%2f08%2f06%2f53e23e6d268e3ef43c8b4598.html&amp;edit-text= ) . 
  these declarations were made after calatrava was charged for the [ irregularities on the construction of a convention center in castellon ] ( https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=es&amp;tl=en&amp;js=y&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=es&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fwww.elmundo.es%2fcomunidad-valenciana%2f2014%2f08%2f06%2f53e2185b268e3ef43c8b457c.html&amp;edit-text= ) . 
   why mix politics and art ? 
  because all his big , expensive and crazy projects have been contracted by politicians of the pp . 
  and a lot of irregularities and corruption have been going on his projects for public administrations . 
  however , i admit that he has n't convicted for any of the corruption cases . 
  he has been fined for some negligences on some projects and he has been paid by public administrations through his society on switzerland to avoid taxes , but there is n't anything criminal on that . 
  i think that [ this ] ( http://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/compare_countries_result.jsp?country1=spain&amp;country2=portugal ) is mostly accurate . 
  i think that [ latvia has the record ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/demographics_of_latvia ) . 
   but in fact if companies get all the vat they 've paid refunded , only companies that sell electricity ( and other high-vat goods or services ) will be inconvenienced . 
  that 's capped to the amount of vat that your clients pay , you ca n't get back more than that ( spain at least ) . 
  for many farmers is a * problem * ( they do n't get all the vat that ) because they pay 21 % vat for everything and they sell fresh food with a vat of 4 % . 
  edit : however , we have an alternative system called objective estimation , that allows some self-employed people ( like taxi license owners ) to pay almost no taxes , and keep part of the vat for themselves while other self-employed people pay more taxes than profit have ( mandatory self-employment social security contribution included ) . 
  you should remember where is the average . 
  you could have drunk clown as pm and be better governed than average . 
  [ one article ] ( http://viewfrommadrid.blogspot.se/2014/01/calatrava-update-heads-up-for-falling.html ) about some of the problems of the city of the arts and the sciences ) . 
  and this megalomaniac project has cost 1.4 billions of euros plus exhibitions and maintenance . 
  it includes the biggest imax cinema of spain , the biggest aquarium of europe , a stupid opera house with bad acoustics and not good visibility of the scenario , a park , an science museum ... and calatrava 's as architect got paid $ 70 millions ( for him and his team ) . 
  he is the architect of the conservative party . 
  he also designed [ this monster for oviedo ] ( http://leolo.blogspirit.com/media/00/02/979836193.jpg ) it 's nice and except the opera everything fulfills the requirements . 
  but it 's so bloody expensive to maintain . 
  i hope that we ( valencian ) change the regional government after the new elections and the new government let 's it fall apart . 
  edit : do you see the stairs of the museum ( near the building that seems an eye ) . 
  they were added at the last minute when the building was almost done because the architects forgot the emergency exits . 
  disclaimer : spaniard . 
  they are paid better than the entry level/young people in the career , but less than the people close to retirement . 
  you can see some [ salary information for medical doctors in the eu ] ( http://www.redaccionmedica.com/contenido/images/salarios_medicos_hospitalarios.pdf ) , the tables have the name of the countries in english . 
  this data is for the public health care , 2011 figures ( the salaries have been cut slighly since that ) . 
  spain only ( i do n't know the portuguese system ) : future retirees wo n't be able to get maximum pensions almost never ( at least at spain ) because more the cotization base of more years will be included for calculate the pension ( 25 years from 15 ) . 
  and almost nobody gets to a level that qualifys for a maximum pension 25 years before retiring . 
  however this wo n't concern to people retired before the reforms . 
   ca n't be serious . 
  800/month ? 
  talking about spain the entry level for software engineer with some brains and english is 1,500 euros/month before taxes at valencia . 
  and around 2,000 euros/month at barcelona ( the rest of catalonia is at the lower threshold ) , basque country and madrid . 
  and lower at southern spain . 
  it goes to 1,200 euros/month at extremadura and andalusia . 
  that 's before taxes , people tells his income after taxes often ( / u/justgohomealready may be doing ) . 
  but the salaries at portugal are the lowest in western europe . 
  if you are thinking about moving to be a software developer in europe you will be better off at romania than portugal or spain . 
  however , the things that he says about the public servants being mostly true need to be taken with a grain of salt . 
  * that pension is the maximum pension paid by the government ( similar to the spanish one ) to non-politicians . 
  reserved for university tenured professors doctors . . and people at the the highest possitions of the public services . 
  many public servant retirees are paid less . 
  the ones with high salaries get high pensions , the ones with low salaries get low pensions . 
  and they have seen pension freezes and stuff , but way less that the current workers or jobless . 
  being at portugal i got the feeling that the cost of living is similar to the spanish one . 
  the lower cost of some stuff compensated by the higher taxes and the co-payments . 
  if you go for food and clothes to the catholic church you may be able to afford your other expenses with that minimum wage . 
   by no longer drawing unemployment benefits but , [ most of jobless do n't get unempleyoment benefits at spain ] ( http://www.ansamed.info/ansamed/en/news/nations/spain/2014/05/13/spain-4-million-jobless-lack-unemployment-benefits_a23f4279-2a14-4bdd-8fea-0b600ebd56f9.html ) ( and portugal as far as i know ) . 
  some people gets other benefits . 
  250,000 are in training programs that pay them an income of 400 to 450 euros . 
  and another 250,000 colect some other type of benefit . 
  if you have first degree relatives ( parents or children ) , spouse or flatmates that including you in their househould keep an average income above minimum wage you do n't get benefits after unemployment expires . 
  the welfare is n't the same in all europe . 
  there is a convincing excuse for that . 
  shitty populism ; the economic program seems written by juan carlos monedero or a 5 years old , and i fear that is the first . 
  does n't try to fix the underlying issues in out institutional framework , in fact it opposes to independent regulators and proposes to put the ecb under more control of the eu parliament .

  unless you are from madrid , it could work !, 
  it 's just flavor of the month . 
  forgot about that . 
  it 's not even finished !, 
  also i do n't think that 's a real gift to the world . 
  i find it ugly . 
  diabeetus . 
  no phone . 
  only sad . 
  and cold . 
  northern navarra feels much more basque , some people speak euskara there . 
  i guess there 's plenty i could find with a quick google , but nothing comes out off the top of my head . 
  except we do n't care at all about gibraltar and the falkland islands . 
  i really doubt it is a distraction maneuver . 
  it 's just petty politicians . 
  spain is trying its hardest . 
  i think a mouse could starve on the diference . 
  of course . 
  no idea . 
  does n't mean much . 
  spanish people eat a lot of bread too and our bread is remarkably bad compared to yours or german . 
  yes , but i think it would be hard to justify giving an autonomous region ( such as catalunya or euskadi ) the right to self-determination and deny it to balears . 
  in my opinion balears would be the region that would do better on its own . 
  tourism is big . 
  next time , speak about things you know about . 
  catalunya has every thing you listed . 
  we have police ( mossos d'esquadra and policia local ) , we have our own parliament , budget ... 
  i think our destiny is woven together . 
  if we are allowed to have a binding referendum , it will be for both . 
  imo german bread is just superior in every way . 
  also more varied . 
  i love them . 
  i have some family i would n't give a crumb of bread to . 
  i do , i 'm a boy scout , been monitoring for 3 years now . 
  have also participated in food banks . 
  oh , i know that . 
  but i do n't think in a number 's game , pro-independence wins overall . 
  you talk like one of those thousands of stupid 15 year olds that have a very idealistic and simple view of politics . 
  no offense intended . 
  you are right , most people in navarra do n't really want to be independent as far as i know . 
   do you consider yourself basque ? 
  i do n't think that means all those people support independence . 
  downvotes are n't a disagree button . 
  what he is saying is relevant to the conversation no matter how unagreeable it is . 
  but it is . 
  all the other sides are greener than spain . 
  french people in my experience do n't want to even speak english . 
  they probably know it , but i have had a hard time finding someone willing to cooperate . 
  aahahahah 10 % unemployment ... what we would give it to have it that low ... 
  but our individual goverments are just as bad . 
  surveillance , wars , wars on drugs etc. 
  yeah but if the system is corrupt europe ca n't just force them to put the politicians in jail . 
  why is it ? 
  it would be only a bit bigger than us federal government . 
  and probably would n't have as much power . 
  what jail ? 
  you ca n't just take a bulgarian politician and put it in `` european jail '' . 
  that 's just stupid . 
  a lot of people are technically religious but they really are n't fighting about it and it does n't stop them from doing most things . 
   the attackers were not initially taken into custody . 
  few weeks later the again attacked someone else and were put in prison . 
  what the fuck . 
  they are also hated in southern europe . 
  can confirm . 
  the word you are thinking about is `` extremist '' . 
  not all muslism are extremists . 
  two wrongs do n't make one right . 
  yep , it ai n't going to happen . 
  congrats , let 's see if we can do the same someday . 
  ca n't wait to get my degree and gtfo . 
  judging by the comments i read on reddit , your grammar is pretty poor . 
  wo n't be enough for all of you , sadly . 
  please , i 'll make you spanish omelette ... please ? 
  uk pls . 
  fair enough . 
   extremist and terrorist related content wonder what they consider extremist . 
  this could be bad news . 
  it has more results if you search `` mireia belmonte '' . 
  maybe that gives you some perspective . 
  oh so you are the kind of guy that reads abc and la razon . 
  i understand everything now . 
  terrorist detected, 
  they try but nobody cares here . 
  it 's not even in the news barely . 
  i recommend doing a bit of research . 
  but it 's obviously unrelated . 
  if i break the law , i can still report you if you trespass my property , for example . 
  does n't matter that i just robbed a bank the day before . 
  spain may break the laws , does n't mean they ca n't worry about their interests . 
  yet this has nothing to do with the above comment ... 
  it might seem like that but things like this wo n't get really big in our news . 
  people do n't care much . 
  i 'm sorry but that 's a very different question . 
  how many people adhere to that movement ? 
  i 've never heard of it seriously . 
  just people joking about the civil war and shit . 
  we are not special . 
  but this is the first time i hear about separatism in most the countries you listed . 
  do they really have a strong movement ? 
  not all those countries have a strong separatist movement .

  since she was speaking about the euro ( about the concerns of some french people of what would happen if they returned to the franc ) , the eu is more related than europe in general . 
  it was before or after removing the eu flag because you felt insulted by it ? 
  you do n't get the title so easily , frenchie . 
  other countries are working really hard for it too . 
  i was thinking about the main difference between countries like spain , which scores higher in having less government expenditure and less tax burden , but way lower scores in freedom from corruption . 
  in other words , spain is closer `` ideologically '' to the mantra of `` only small government is good for business '' , yet it is worse economically . 
  nk has a zero or the lowest score in all categories . 
  i guess that is a big difference with , basically , any other country . 
  in socialism , which is what i was discussing , there is private ownership . 
  the only private ownership which is abolished is the one over the means of production . 
  in summary , you can own the car privately , but not the company which makes cars , which is owned by the workers or by the state , depending on the different branches of the ideology . 
  sorry , i did not understand that . 
  google translator of galizian does n't give me any understandable result . 
  the lizard people . 
  just like with the rest of the problems in spain : there are no problems , but if there is any , it is caused by the lizard people , definitively not `` good spaniards '' . 
   ( el pa\u00eds being ~ ~ leftist ~ ~ centrist and el mundo being ~ ~ centrist ~ ~ right wing ) i corrected it for you . 
  who ? 
  actually the heritage foundation makes a lot of judgement using the data . 
  you can read it in the article . 
  they seem oblivious to the `` paradox '' that the nordics , some of the best performing countries in europe , occupy the tops in the `` less free '' categories of `` limited government '' . 
  and , also , the final index is simply an arbitrary combination of already arbitrary sub-scores . 
  putting more emphasis on some sub-scores or others is also an ideological decision . 
  are you more free if you have more taxes in a less corrupt country or less taxes in a more corrupt country ? 
  i agree , however , that this is not an economical goodness index . 
  i just wanted to point it out , as op , because some people are reading it in that way . 
  i am neither a socialist nor a communist , so i do n't know if i am the most appropriate one to answer your questions , but there are examples of relatively big companies being owned and run by workers . 
  in spain , there is for example the mondragon group . 
  i do n't understand what is the problem with the pension system . 
  pensions are not means of production . 
  this is all a very big simplification . 
  different branches of different ideologies deal with those problems in very different ways , in the same way that two capitalists systems , nordic model or neoliberal chile under pinochet regime , deal with the problems in a very different way . 
  i guess that one would have to specify more the field to yield anything meaningful . 
  i think that it is very important . 
  one of the worst things about being harassed by strangers is the fear and the sense of defenseless . 
  just by stating out loud that the victim is not alone , it changes the mood of the situation completely . 
  we should accept them , even if it is just to complete the map , because it triggers me to see such whole there . 
  i would say that turkey has not lost yet the battle for its soul . 
  i think that in that aspect , you can count with most europeans . 
  i also hope that europe does not turn a blind eye to turkey , because what erdogan has done can be fixed and the people in the opposition need to feel that they are not fighting alone . 
  this is something that i guess all citizens can agree in it , so i guess we can call it . . citizens united !, 
  i also found interesting that they used the corruption perception index , which means if the corruption is disguised well enough , it does n't count . 
  exactly my point . 
  one can have both a good welfare state and a business friendly environment . 
  countries like spain doing poorly has less to do with `` too much socialism '' ( whatever does it mean ) and more to do with rampant corruption at all levels and poor organization . 
  edit : a word . 
  there are plenty . 
  it is a continuous erosion of rights . 
  from the gag law to the latest case of someone judged for a tweet making a joke about a member of the dictatorship being assassinated by eta . 
  in relation to the press , i would say that tve , which is the national tv , went from one of the `` most free '' and even received awards from the bbc in that aspect to an government tv that has received international criticism for it . 
  the first thing the pp did when they won in 2011 was to replace the important charges with their own people . 
  does it , really ? 
  because all the nordics are top in the `` less free '' in the most `` ideological '' parts of the study , tax burden and government expenditure . 
  and i would say that they do just fine . 
  however they score top on the things that i pointed as objectively good . 
  spain scores way higher than denmark or sweden in the `` ideological part '' and , as you said , it is not doing so well . 
  edit : to add more information to what i said : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/index_of_economic_freedom#2014_ranking_with_more_attributes and you list the `` less free '' countries in fiscal freedom , the top 3 are north korea , denmark and sweden . 
  most nordic countries are top 15 in the `` less free '' by government expenditure . 
  if your job is to live from other people 's work , then , yes , it can be seen as repression . 
  however , you can still work in the company and earn millions and have ten houses , since private ownership also exists within the socialism . 
  you simply do not own the company . 
  the foundation that made this map listed tax burden and government expenditures as a reason for a lower score . 
  so i guess that if you are rich , many european countries , including the nordics ( which are the origin of this subthread ) , are `` repressing '' you . 
  edit : to explain my last point a bit better , if you go to the article of the wikipedia and you select the whole set of 2014 ( which has the score in specific areas , i could n't find anything newer ) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/index_of_economic_freedom#2014_ranking_with_more_attributes and you list the `` less free '' countries in fiscal freedom , the top 3 are north korea , denmark and sweden . 
  most nordic countries are top 15 in the `` less free '' by government expenditure . 
  but they are also top scores in freedom from corruption . 
  and that is the main difference , in my opinion . 
  edit 2 : a word . 
  the only one with which i agree too is the rule of law . 
  lack of corruption and legal guarantees are objectively good things . 
  the rest is simply ideology . 
  just an extract from the article ( there are plenty of things with which i do not agree ) :   limited government  fiscal freedom : how free is a country from tax burden . 
  it comprises three quantitative measures : top marginal tax rate of both individual ( 1 ) and corporate ( 2 ) income , and total tax burden as a percentage of gdp ( 3 ) . 
   government size/spending : governments ' expenditures as a percentage of gdp , including consumption and transfers . 
  the higher the percentual spending , the lower the score . 
  so now being taxed or having government expenditure is not being free . 
  in summary , this map represent an ideology , not a freedom . 
  well , socialism does n't mean either that businesses are repressed . 
  i agree . 
  just because we were in a better position does n't mean that we can get complacent . 
  point in case , spain gained a lot of freedoms after the end of the dictatorship , but people have already forgotten the past , so the country is going backwards again in many aspects . 
  i would say that those are two factors working in the same direction : misinformation of the public . 
  first suppress facts and then you overflow with lies so the lack of facts are n't noticeable anymore . 
  you surely love weird things . 
  but i guess that some people ( not you , i assume ) actually love it , because the less free press , the stronger the power of certain groups . 
  spain is only position 29 ? 
  i am surprised that it is not further down . 
  \\ #betterthanthenetherlands, 
  it is not hard to check that his account is , in fact , troll account , so i would n't put too much thought on that . 
  the idea that we can just put nice lines in a map and call it a day is what started the mess , by not paying any attention to difference and tensions among groups in the region . 
  just because they are all `` brown people '' does n't mean that they want to be in the same country . 
   the eu ca n't have their cake and eat it to . 
  this is not something that happens in the eu alone , so , since this discussion is not even about the eu , why would you bring up it now ? 
  you too seem to commit the same mistake i pointed out in my first comment . 
  it is clear that a relatively large part of the us population will find someone like le pen desirable and many are far right supporters or proper fascist/neo-nazis . 
  it is also observable that a sizable amount of redditors subscribe to subs which are cesspool for negative attitudes and lies . 
  one also has to consider that people who go to other subs to specifically spark conflict are most likely trolls and they are looking for that ( over ) reaction . 
  however , i posted my comment because i see an increasing number of uncalled bashing of americans in this sub and i read your comment in that way . 
  the other redditor spoke about people in this thread , which by statistics are most likely europeans , being `` dumbasses '' and you brought the americans out of nowhere . 
  when i see an unfair treatment of a group of people , i call it out . 
  and what i found in this sub is that a very vocal minority of users will always bring `` others '' as the source of all the problems in europe .

  interesting , i simply repeated what i read from the wiki article on the conquest of england by william , i would love to see more indepth sources about this . 
  my understanding is that such events happened only after the normans were already in full control of england , when john , king of england and duke of normandy joined the papal call to attack france along with the holy roman empire and a bunch of others . 
  not only that , the normans settled in france on friendly terms in exchange for norman defence against raids from other vikings . 
  the normans quickly adopted the religion , language and names from the region .

  i 'm scared of how things are turning up in europe and i 've stopped posting anything left wing in social media related to me for a while now , just in case . 
  why do you consider it as bad as franco 's dictatorship ? 
  also , a third republic would , in any case , be very different from the second given that the material conditions have changed drastically . 
  even though i 'm a modern communist , i 'm happy to envision a third republic simply as a country were the political and economic elites were separated through a very strict and multi-layered system of checking coupled with stronger laws against corruption while also nationalizing basic services ( including finance services ) . 
  the material conditions during the second republic were very different fron what they are now so it is irrational to be scared of a third republic based on being scared of the second one ( assuming there are reasons to be actually so scared of it ) . 
  of course they had support from the population but i find the idea of peasents supporting the rebellion for any reason other than being reactionaries scared of the attacks of leftists to churches very unlikely . 
  i 'll stand by the idea of the ones responsible for the rebellion being economic elites with the reactionary population simply following them but being uncapable or unwilling of rebelling themselves otherwise . 
  `` i support stalin but i think it was not perfect '' how upset would polish people be if i said that now there ?

  why would you support franco , who was a national-catholic , not a fascist , otherwise ? 
  a few days ago i was threatened with a ban for making the `` baby-eating communist '' joke at some guy arguing that marx and everything that followed was some kind of evil movement disrupting the peace and good of the world . 
  the mod even made a comment explaining that it was due to `` low quality circle-jerk '' , which is funny because my comment is what it is usually permitted here as a ** joke ** . 
  the mod assured me that his actions had no politicam motive but i would n't be surprised if i 'm banned after this . 
  nobody here seems to be menctioning the most * crucial * factor that sparked the rebellion , which was a very profound reform in the organization of the rural societies where * se\u00f1oritos * ( pseudofeudal lords which owned latifundios ) would lose its almost medieval position of power . 
  in a country where the burgeoise class had still not developed completely , those rural lords were the strongest social group at the time and were disposed to destroy the democratic republic to maintain the status quo . 
  i feel so frustrated when people talk about the spanish civil war as a war between two evils as if it were n't a war pushed by military and economic elites towards a democratic government that was finally ending centuries of a barely feudal political organization . 
  if you want to know more about who * se\u00f1oritos * were i recommend the film los santos inocentes ( the innocent saints ) or the novel of the same name by miguel delibes . 
  this was so fucking sad for me , too . 
  i can imagine * la pasionaria * holding madrid with her * no pasar\u00e1n * in her heroic stance . 
  i can only wonder what would have happened if franco did n't recieve direct help and arms from hitler and mussolini or if the republicans were not betrayed by the soviet union . 
   and i see stiglitz saying nonsense . 
   granted , i 'm not a nobel prize winner , but so far his predictions are wrong and mine are right . 
  i was not arguing against a particulartly complex argument , though . 
  i agree with you in that what i said is not a valid argument , but i think it is easily visible that the social unrest in increasing to dangerous levels all across the eu . 
  fiscal integration would probably bring more problems due to the disparities in the economies between different european regions . 
  the problem is that devaluating the euro would have prevented the austerity catastrophe in southern countries while negatively affecting other countries like germany in their import and export prices . 
  as germany ( and sarkozy 's france at the time ) were preoccupied with their internal affairs than with the future of the eu , instead of reducing the consumer power of its citizens for a period of time , they chose to force austerity policies in southern countries which further exacerbated their financial situation while also deepening the economic crises by reducing flow of money to its citizens . 
  this was also done as the media in places like germany pushed the narrative of southern countries deserving to be punished ( not the banks , not the speculators , the working people ) and it was percieved as a punishment in the recieving countries , too . 
  since those reforms have n't actually improved the situation for the average person and instead , additional reforms are continuously implemented in what is percieved as an escape forward , many people in the south have been growing resentful of the eu . 
  left parties have also gained a lot of power and are also against this percieved despise and humilliation from northern to southern europe ( we wo n't ever forget the term piigs to refer to those countries ) . 
  while i was always in favour of a strong and independent eu guided by ideals and principles of human rights , i am now in favour of the desintegration of the eu unless a very radical change is done . 
  the accumulation of capital and growth of inequality ( the number of millionaires have doubled in spain since 2008 and the benefits of big corporations have skyrocketed ) have also fueled this perception of the eu being a fundamentally complicent organization of the capital against the people . 
  in northern countries where the leftist narrative ca n't expand , the growing social discomtept has been directed towards inmigrants and refugees , as it is usual when people are eager to listed to mass media deriving the attention from the ever increasing inequality and negotiating power of the richest to inmigrants . 
  in any case , i could rant about this for hours but i have to eat . 
  he probably has more knowledge and expertise that you , so i trust his predictions better . 
  most intellectuals agree that if europe continues this path of austerity that benefits northern economies while asphixiating the south , the division will eventually explode . 
  that is not to say the eu ca n't change its ways to revert this , but the problems originated by de facto increasing capital accumulation during recession instead of implementing expansive policies will not go away easily . 
  is there any reason for your tone ? 
  the `` i can ban you any time i wish '' does n't sound like something a proper moderator would do . 
  in any case , as to abide to the rules of the sub , i 'll start reporting such comments when i encounter them . 
  alright then , i guess this settles this conversation with memorials for the victims of spanish imperialism being built in spain being wrong as it is stated in the unwritten rule you menction . 
  is that your point ? 
  are you serious ? 
  one joke among half a dozen serious comments and i 'm threatened with a ban ? 
  can you explain how is this partial when comments of this kind are common and accepted in this sub ? 
  i 'm getting the impression that my comment was targeted by political reasons . 
  alright then , why not statues of hitler in berlin ? 
  why not monumentalize the genocidal , fascist leader ? 
  franco was also a genocidal , fascist leader who started a civil war against a democrally elected government when they tried to abolist the barely feudalist political organization in rural spain of the `` se\u00f1oritos '' . 
  why should we monumentalize such a person ? 
  do you realize that we are talking about the victims of spanish imperialism ? 
  there are hiroshima memorials in japan , 9/11 in the us and holocaust ones in germany so i think it is not crazy to dedicate monuments to the victims of spanish imperialism in spain . 
  slow down . 
  nobody here said anything about white shaming and such thing does n't even exist in spain . 
  that narrative has nothing to do with this . 
  this is about honoring the victims of imperialism . 
  that does not mean that we are demonizing spaniards . 
  it is possible to acknowledge the fact that european imperialism is not a matter of badness and that any civilization with the capacity would have done the same , to acknowledge the many benefits that europeans brought to the world , while also acknowledging the cruel horror that was experienced by the victims of imperialism . 
  see , this is a problem i encounter with the general population and especially right wing people : you assume the world is divided into team a vs team b. 
  if i am in favour of honoring the victims of imperialism , i am a white shamer . 
  if i am against capitalism and in favour of communism , i am in favour of authoritarian regimes . 
  it is very frustrating to discuss anything with people like that as they end up fighting the strawmen they create instead of actually communicating . 
  this thread is a magnificent example of that . 
  then we should place a few statues of hitler across london , too . 
  he was very relevant to british history , after all . 
  just make sure to say the dude is an asshole somewhere around . 
  why is it wrong to mourn thr victims of the holocaust or hiroshima but not of the genocide and enslavent that the spanish performed in america ? 
  in argentina , the conditions in the silver mines were so bad that the life expentancy of workers there was counted in months and it was n't until the enforcement of the `` new laws '' that indigenous people were considered human beings . 
   columbus did heinious acts that were considered atrocious even for his time . 
  is he really the man we want as a symbol in the city of barcelona ? 
  you :  you marxists are supporting north korea and stalin and want to destroy european culture marx was literally hitler i hold the truth about history you know nothing hahahow stupid and ridiculous you totally proved your point , defending the glorification of a person whose acts were reprimended even in his time by attacking some strawmen you created about north korea lovers . 
  you do n't even make an effort to understand what other opinions have to offer , you dismiss them with laughable falacies . 
  what ? 
  they limit the money takeout when that happens massively because banks ** do n't have ** the money you deposit there . 
  your savings have interests because they are used by the banks to give loans . 
  if the bank gives shitty loans that are not payed back then your savings are literally lost . 
  that is why banks needed mindblowing cash injections after the 2008 financial crisis . 
  they had invested in greedy , risky loans with ** your money ** and when they lost it they literally forced the governments to give them ** hundreds of billions ** of ** your tax money ** to avoid a political crisis when people would not be able to access their savings and have all their fucking money lost . 
  i thought this was common knowledge here after the 2008 crisis !, 
  how are you the most upvoted comment ? 
  in what reality do you live ? 
  so we have forgotten about the maidan protests , the odessa massacre , the call for an ethnic cleanse of russians in ukraine , the incendiary snipers , the `` fuck europe '' and the only thing that remains is the `` russia invaded ukraine '' ? 
  so this is actual history in the making , huh . 
  how is it not true that the ussr was the central power fighting germany ? 
  they did liberate europe from the fascists . 
  you probably meant thirthy times our population . 
  the new mayor of barcelona , ada colau , from podemos , is trying to give rebirth to the industrial sector as to not be so dependent on turism . 
  she has also done an excelent job of cutting out on fraudulent and inefficient city contracts , reducing the deficit of the city substantially . 
  since podemos also wants to invest in r&d , it is likely that there are plans or projects to attract tech business already . 
  not the russian ones ,

   at least they have oil . 
  and they sell it for dollars ... 
  we are going 10 years back in time though, 
   `` donde mahoma perdio el gorro '' : where mohammed lost his hat . 
  no , i do n't understand it either ... that 's kind of unusual , the most common on that format is : `` donde cristo perdio el mechero '' `` where ( jesus ) christ lost his lighter '' but still in spain the most usual thing to say is `` a tomar por culo '' ; `` where they fuck you in the ass '' ?? ... 
  i do n't really know how to translate that , and is used to point something far away or to just say `` go fuck yourself '' and about places , it changes a lot depending in what region of spain you are , where i 'm from , sebastopol ( sevastopol ) is the most usual one i think . 
  `` sergio ramos mando el balon a sebastopol '' - [ `` sergio ramos sent the ball to sevastopol '' ] ( http://www.whoateallthepies.tv/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/ramos.gif ), 
  yeah , like serioulsy , if you are not blonde or pale skinned you are risking it , the `` white '' standard could change overnight . 
  man , internet is full of swedish action . 
  a neoliberal will tell you that it was n't liberal enough . 
  check, 
   looks interesting not really it 's just like any game of thrones chart , family names and titles ... 
   which are way more valuavel than german unless you want a job ... but in all seriousness , who wants one of those \u30c4, 
  that 's scary ... what about `` the definitely not nazi fourth reich '', 
  since nobel prizes are considered i call this index bullshit . 
  edit : wait what ? 
  spain in the bottom 5 for international peace and security , what the actual fuck is this shit ??? 
  and number 1 in health and wellbeign ? 
  what 's going on here ? 
  `` holy islamic republic of europe '' or just `` europistan '', 
  yeah , seriously , use is reserved for the future united states of earth , jesus !!, 
  if the referendum is held ( doubtfull ) the result are going to be 90 % in favor with a turnout below 50 % . 
  and the royalist pig-dogs wo n't be worried at all . 
  am i seeing a `` white '' guy with an argentina football shirt ? 
  oh wow , i feel retarded , i thought they were two different places . 
   that can be easilly closed . 
  but wo n't, 
  not really , i always go with the `` spaniard '' thing , i 'm ready to clarify it as european if needed be but i 've never had to , not even in america . 
   but it loses manchester city striker david silva , whose mother is from japan ** and whose father is from the canary islands . 
  ** wtf !, 
  i remember the : - `` there is a spanish song number 1 in america '' . 
  - `` really ? 
  which one ? 
  andalusians , close enough, 
   but logically i support it . 
  what 's the logic in it ? 
  is it the destiny or the objective of the human race to become more intelligent , better , more productive or something ? 
  eugenicists talk like they know the meaning of life and shit . 
  leave the people in peace to make the most of their lifes and shut up ; you are dead meat anyway . 
   let 's not forget that spain executed more than 100000 innocent civilians in the thirties . 
  i do n't, 
  i 'm impressed !, 
  this is what my code looks like when [ i 'm working ] ( http://www.styleite.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/reddit2.jpg ), 
  i do n't know . 
  ask [ the locals ] ( https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4136/4883372463_382a7280bf_z.jpg ) what do they think of this melting pot . 
   remember this : brazil is * huge * and full of terrors, 
   anyone with a historical understanding of the war knows removing any of the major allied contributions will result in a lost war tl : dr everyone who disagrees with my hypotetical `` what if ... ? '', 
  knows nothing about history . . way to go . 
  also the question ( which is pretty clear `` which nation contributed the most ? '' ), 
  is about the perception of the people back then and 70 years of american films later . 
   overall `` spanish '' culture . 
  i would like to know what is that overall `` spanish '' culture ; as a madrile\u00f1o i hope is not bullfighting , flamenco and siesta . 
  because i 've never done any of that and i have my 8 castillian surnames , 
  exaclty, 
  and franco comes to the conversation ... seriously people , any country big enough have dubbing . 
  you probably do n't speak to old people, 
  not with that attitude, 
  one day every ~ 30 years !!, 
  the dream is real . 
  [ the first rule of the fight club ] ( http://www.flascinder.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/fight-club-de-la-lucha-rey-de-espa%c3%b1a-flascinder1.jpg ), 
  campechano, 
  at least in spain is the range of people who will pay pensions all their life but get none . 
  go home iceland , you are drunk . 
  what about `` national pride , world wide '', 
  in highschool i did a student exchange to france ( chinon to be exactly ) and the french family i lived with , they always give me a sandwich before school . 
  it became a ritual when we , all the spanish students , gather in the break to open the sandwiches and start picking out the butter slices to the surprise of the french . 
  one day i received a sandwich with just butter and cheese and i told my french family that this could n't go on ; remove butter from the premises !, 
  butter is ok for cooking though . 
  probably because there is none below 100 , but they should have shown that in the legend, 
  oh look , south europeans ca n't be expats . 
  when talking spanish i never refer spanish as `` espa\u00f1ol '' , i always say `` castellano '' , castilian ( and a lot of latin americans does that too , not just spaniards ) there is people still rooting for calling it just `` castellano '' but you can use both really . 
  congratulations crackovia , that 's actually very smart . 
  older version of football players who have already won everything there is to win . 
  i predict france 2002 but i have enjoyed the run so far . 
   so why do we worry about the far-right , and not the far-left , when both are horrendous ? 
  short answer , because at least far left is not xenophobic, 
  whenever something bad happens in spanish elections i used to say : `` whelp at least we are not italy '' now what ? 
  in my city we only received sex tourism . 
  yes , i mean erasmus . 
   southern european nations by forcing them to fix their economies and giving them bailouts . 
  economies fixed = 0 , just austerity to make sure the debt is paid back while the economy goes down . 
  the bailout to avoid the possible default which will hurt foreign lenders . 
  khthon is wrong putting the blame on the germans , but there is also no room for `` high horsing '' ( if that 's not a word i 'm claiming it now ) and tell us that they are helping our economy . 
  gross, 
  spanish troll pretending to be a catalan independentist ? 
   we need smart , inteligent and educated people here not the opposite . 
  debatable, 
  islam is not only believing in a magical grandpa . 
  it compromises behaviour and moral values . 
  well if the minister of finance is asking i do n't see why not . 
  i helped the nigerian prince once . 
  ah the uk , the turk 's head for every unpopular decision that the eu actually wants to make . 
  so yellow vs blue , and whoever wins goes against brown in winter so at the end green wins because island ? 
  3 artistas polacos, 
   lack of a unified military / defence force -  difficult to project meh . . 
  i think you left out the most important one , population ageing . 
  mmm it looks like english does not have a clear word for [ victimismo ] ( http://diccionario.reverso.net/espanol-ingles/victimismo ) i wo n't comment then, 
  i would n't say cultures , but expectations , if you look at mexico 's bars it shows they are discontented with everything as much as an estonian , but they have a high life satisfaction . 
  that 's why greece , portugal , etc are so low after the crisis and also the austerity , even though their countries are still in better shape than other happier ones . 
  that we have a `` lisp '' .

  cup have also said they wo n't give their vote to mas . 
  without them and the opposition of the others , he wo n't be able to be president . 
  the leader of cup has just said they wo n't vote mas for president . 
  without their vote , and the opposition of the other groups , they wo n't be able to form a govern . 
  i 'm not in spain so i 'm not watching tv , but has the cup talked yet ? 
  jxs\u00ed would declare themselves victors regardless . 
  we 'll have to wait to see what cup does . 
  they are themselves independentists . 
  but even together with jxsi , they did n't get 50 % of the votes ( 95 % currently counted ), 
  how did i suddenly got a whole army before the government finding out before and putting me in prison ? 
  specially if i have declared my intention of doing so before hand ? 
  what if i become a millionaire and decide to create my own army and declare secession ? 
  the government would find out and put me in prison . 
  same here . 
  applying the law ! = sending the tanks . 
  yeah , it was at the begging , while all the `` go catalonia ! '', 
  comments from estelada-flair guys were leading . 
  as far as i know it 's not clear and it seems that 's going to be exactly the situation . 
  jxs\u00ed have said they 'd go for it anyway , but afaik , the cup , which they 'll probably need , has said they 'd only support it if there is a majority also in votes . 
  yes , it will likely remain like this . 
  at the beginning jxs\u00ed alone had 78 or some other crazy number . 
  to give an explanation , jxs\u00ed ( turquoise ) and cup ( yellow ) are independentists . 
  absolute majority is 68 seats . 
  if jxs\u00ed gets 68 or more , they 've said they 'll declare independence . 
  if they need the cup 's seats , they 'll have to talk since cup have said they 'd support independence if the majority of votes , not seats , went for it ( some catalan correct me if this is wrong ) . 
  if jxs\u00ed + cup < 68 they wo n't be able to make it , since the other parties oppose it . 
  right know the independentists are at 73 with 10 % of votes counted , but seem to be decreasing as the counting grows . 
  it 's likely it will be close . 
  or ... you know , you could wait 1.5 hours to have the final results , not just some poll . 
  but ... why ? 
  where are you from originally ? 
  i thought you were spaniard . 
  as if no other country had to deal with constant existential threats . 
  now go and compare english history and geography with that of any other country . 
  twice absorbed poland maybe ? 
  maybe russia , the mongolian highway to europe ? 
  spain ? 
  the balkans ? 
  c'mon guys , you 've had it fucking easy . 
  dude , the whole world knows about you guys , with your cute koalas and badass kangaroos ... 
  that 's just a missunderstanding of what productivity means . 
  this is probably my most repeated comment on reddit , but productivity has little to do with how `` well '' or `` focused '' you work . 
  it 's a measure of how many $ you produce by hours . 
  germans produce many cars and machinery , which are expensive . 
  even the laziest german factory worker is more productive than the hardest working spanish waiter . 
  you were supposed to be having coffee while watching nature documentaries in `` la 2 '' like the rest of the non-working population was doing . 
  but now seriously , most international stores do n't close in the afternoon , specially in the city center . 
  nor do bars or cafes , so i find surprising you did n't find plenty of open stores in madrid 's downtown . 
  in spain , lunch is the biggest meal of the day , while dinner is usually frugal . 
  also , if you eat outside , there 's no way you 'll be done in 30 min . 
  i would, 
  so nordic . 
  virtually nobody goes home in the middle of the day to sleep . 
  most office jobs give between 1 and 1.5 hours for lunch . 
  however , some shops , usually family owned , close between 2 and 5pm . 
  again , this has nothing to do with sleeping or even `` because it 's too hot to work '' ( most places have ac ) . 
  it 's just that in spain there are n't many customers at that time , either because they 're working or because they already expect many shops to be closed . 
  in short , it 's just cultural . 
  edit : also , siesta simply means sleeping in the middle of the day , so it 's more or less the direct translation of `` nap '' . 
  it does n't really refer to the fact of some shops closing from 2 to 5 . 
  that 'd be called `` hora de la comida '' ( lunch time ) or something like that . 
  what 's with the queen in that pic ? 
  she looks so sad i wan na give her a hug . 
  so having education in catalan makes them `` a de facto independent state '' ? 
  that 's just dumb . 
  now i 'm gon na tell you why i oppose catalan secessionist : the rhetoric of catalan nationalism has been consistently victimist , blaming spain , the spanish people , culture and language of every single problem occurring in catalonia . 
  it 's straight forward demonization . 
  currently , there is a 50 % of catalans who have spanish as a first language . 
  how do you think they 'll be treated under a new state , which has based its very existence in demonizing spain ? 
  spain is not the richest country in the world , but it 's in no way poor and is stable and peaceful . 
  and these guys are willing to make us the balkans 2.0 . 
  but maybe you are bored with your life and would like to see that just because . 
   minimizing minorities how does spain do that ? 
  catalan is official in catalonia , valencia and balearic islands . 
  can you tell me where any regional language is official in france ? 
  nowhere . 
  in catalonia , education is 100 % in catalan , except for the spanish language lecture . 
  this is compulsory , even if you just moved there from the rest of spain . 
  now please tell me more about how we `` minimize minorities '' , which is fucking rich coming from ** a ** ** french ** . 
  specially in rostock ... 
  you are describing cultural cleansing . 
  is that what you defend ? 
  again . 
  the catalan law says every single lecture except spanish language one must be taught in catalan in every single public school . 
  you can bring franco from the grave all you want , or call me a dictator , but it 's you who are imposing your language over the half of catalans whose first language is spanish . 
  and still dare to talk of oppression . 
  in your educative system every single lecture is given in catalan except the spanish language class . 
  there is no work around . 
  even if you have just moved to catalonia from the rest of spain , your children will have to have 90 % of their lectures in a language they do n't understand . 
  if there is a language under harassment in catalonia , it 's spanish . 
  it 's weighted by the number of residents . 
  if i had to guess , i 'd say that 's likely tourists from australia are getting caught doing drunk tourist 's stuff and since the number of aussies residents is so low it looks like they 're all criminal . 
  it 's not us who are still crying about it though ... 
  so careful , or i may give the duke of alba a call . 
  claro , claro . 
  and how many languages do you speak ? 
  if only ... 
  jam\u00f3n and sangr\u00eda for everyone !, 
  northern castille spanish . 
  did n't you get the memo ?

  and it would n't endanger calatan , as some people argue . 
  the basque system is pretty good btw . 
  parents have 3 choices ( percentages are approximate ) , 90 % basque -10 % spanish , 50-50 , and 10-90 . 
  this system allowed your parents , who spoke spanish to you at home , to choose a model of full immersion , so now you are proficient at basque . 
  do n't you think that a catalan speaking couple could reach a similar conclusion ? . 
  your grandparents could n't choose , and that was unarguabily bad . 
  how is this compulsory `` immersion '' that different ? 
  even if demand is n't as low as you say , and this system could put pressure on catalan , remove the 3rd option and allow 2 itineraries , 90 ( catalan ) -10 and 50-50 . 
  that would end a debate that is used as a weapon by politicians of both sides , and that 's a non-issue in galicia , euskadi , etc. . . do n't you really see any merit in any of these solutions ? 
  i think he 's referring to roads and train connections suitable for commerce . 
  there was a train connection between aragon and france ( canfranc ) but is n't used since the 70s . 
  as it seems , it was n't profitable for the french side . 
  historically aragonese people have demanded investments to reopen that line , but catalan and basque representatives have blocked that aspiration , and france was n't too interested . 
  there is an initiative called `` central crossing of the pyrinees '' that hopes to improve this , but i would n't hold my breath ... 
   the french basques are struggling to keep the language and culture alive , demanding financial help to establish basque schools and basque cultural events , and always being denied by the french government . 
  but ironically , french basques would n't jeer the marsellaise . 
  spain is much better , in your own words , and get much more hate . 
  and , btw , using public money to give services in a foreign country is a crime under most legislations , and i should n't have to argue a lot about why , should i ? 
  private donations are perfectly ok . 
   the spain of 2015 may also have been disrespectful with catalunya . 
  there was absolutely no need to change an educational system that works , with its students having a good level of spanish after leaving school , only for political reasons . 
  what i do n't understand what do you find offensive about giving parents ** the choice ** of scholarizing their children in spanish , or at least with a decent amount of classes in spanish ( like 50 % ) . 
  some people ( like public servants or militar personnel ) are in catalonia just for some years in their lifes . 
  note that has n't still been enforced , and you believe that 's enough motive to be disrespectful with spanish national symbols . 
  so you can choose . 
  in catalonia you ca n't , everything is taught in catalan except spanish language class . 
  edit : i accept downvotes with sportmanship , but this comment is purely factual . 
  is it false what i 'm saying ? 
   the towns are completely different , the sensations you have in each are completely different . 
  i feel that too at some level , but i do n't feel `` foreign '' . 
  i was n't denying that people does n't feel spanish , i just was wondering if there are objective reasons for that . 
  as it seems , it was n't a good comment since is being downvoted . 
   if you mean a civil war i doubt we would see such a drastic scenario . 
  of course , i do n't think a civil war its possible , but i would n't rule out some kind of violence in the streets at some point , even after an hypotetical independence . 
  a society fragmented in a half is dangerous , i 'm sure some compromise that satisfies the majority is possible . 
   so because he killed other people the `` no hay espa\u00f1oles fuera de espa\u00f1a '' policy to arrest the exiled spaniards in nazi-occupied france has nothing to do with the regime ? 
  with the regime yes , but not with the spain of 2015 . 
   full welsh education i 'm honestly curious . 
  in wales all the education is in welsh ? 
   important to note that catalonia and the basque country have very distinct cultures and their own languages as well . 
  well , i do n't agree with that . 
  first of all , cultural differences are at its minimum . 
  i do n't think i should argue a lot about that , here we are an aragonese and a basque talking in english in a europe wide forum . 
  globalization and the internet have ~ ~ erosionated ~ ~ eroded lots of cultural barriers . 
  probably hollywood movies have shaped more our views than any other cultural representation . 
  i 've met a lot of basques , and i do n't see them more foreign that galizian or asturians . 
  i do n't believe that there are more differences between an catalan and a extremenan than between a valencian and a canarian neither obviusly if you want to focus about differences , you will find them . 
  if you would want to focus about similarities you would find lots of them too . 
  about the language . 
  there are regions like galiza and valencia with their own languages , and independentism is very weak . 
  it 's true that basque is special because it 's not a romance language , but i do n't see why it should matter . 
  so , that ca n't be the reason for strong nationalism in those reasons . 
  my opinion is that those movements were born in the xixth century when ~ ~ they ~ ~ nationalisms were popular in europe , and they have just survived . 
  edit : some grammatical changes . 
  franco killed lots of people , catalan and not . 
  is franco representative of whole spain ? 
  nobody in catalonia supported franco ? 
  agree . 
  agree . 
  so do you think that the president of the republic of spain would get better treatment ? 
  ( hint : no he would n't ), 
   either have been born in one of the basque territories well , `` being born '' defined loosely sometimes . 
  as the joke says , bilbao people are born where they want :-), 
  it 's a bit sad , but it 's protected by freedom of speech , at least in spain ( probably it would be a crime in other countries ) , as a court already stated years ago . 
  but , while i do n't like national symbols of any kind ( they could also shit in a spanish flag and would n't blink an eye ) and this does n't affect me at a personal level , i believe it 's a big mistake . 
  one of unpredictable consequences . 
  the fact that some politicians are even promoting this kind of behaviours show how irresponsible and short sighted they can be . 
  a lot of people are deeply hurt in their sentiments right now and feel a mix of rage and hate . 
  those are dangerous feelings and someday all of us could point to these events about `` how this madness started '' . 
  while catalan independentism has been essentially non violent , and i ca n't praise it enough for that , this also constitutes a form of violence . 
  i do n't want to enter in an argument about who started the provocations , as someone surely is going to do right now . 
  as i said , i personally try to be `` post-nationalist '' and wo n't identify myself with the spanish nationalist side . 
  but i appeal to everyone who has a take in this issue ( myself included ) to keep things civil as much as they can , and not spread more rage and hate , and try to calm those of `` their side '' who lose manners , in this forum and in `` real life '' . 
  as someone write , i would n't like to see catalonia seceded from spain , but i would hate much , much more to see barcelona converted in donbass . 
  not true . 
  well known self defined leftists like serrat and sabina like bullfighting . 
  it 's true that it 's not a national pride , but a national shame , though . 
  ironically they could force a renovation in the popular party that in the end could boost their options in next elections . 
  it 's going to be really interesting what happens in madrid 's regional parlament . 
  only aguirre has the power to make the changes that ciudadanos demands , but that would mean the end of that power . 
  at the same time , she has said that she would do anything to avoid podemos reach any goverment , which almost literally puts her `` between a rock and a hard place '' . 
  they are n't to the right of british labourists or french socialists . 
  somehow this makes you `` right wing '' in spain . 
  did you see it ? 
  they smelled the blood and came like hyenas !!, 
  your username , how appropiate . 
   they 've lost their identity pretty much , all of those regions , especially aragon , i 'm having a hard time not taking that as an insult . 
  you can retain your identity while being part of something bigger , as the spain or the eu ... 
  i do n't know why i 'm feeding the troll . 
  well done , i bit . 
  i do n't think so . 
  sefardi jews have conserved their traditions included a kind of spanish called ladino and recorded their genealogical tree . 
  i doubt that moriscos could say the same . 
   you stated that is that way because low interest rate . 
  it 's actually the other way around . 
  low interest rates , low guarantees ( 100 % was financed happily ) are the result of the law . 
  but you are pressing me to justify why the law it 's like it is , and it 's fine :-) sincerely i did n't know . 
  i 'm researching it right now . 
  mortgage law references article 1911 of spanish civil code ( from 1889 , still applies ) . 
  do n't know the rationale behind it , honestly .

   as everyone should do despite their different ideals maybe these images make you change your opinion : * [ afroamerican jesse owens on the podium after winning at the berlin 1936 summer olympics , not doing the nazi salute ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/55/bundesarchiv_bild_183-g00630%2c_sommerolympiade%2c_siegerehrung_weitsprung.jpg ) * [ kathrine switzer running the boston marathon in 1967 .

  what are the olympic games , the euros or the world cup ? 
  gon na leave you something a wise man once said :  those who defend sports should not mix with politics usually belong to 2 categories : they are either ingenious souls who have n't realized how the world works ... or what they are trying to say is that sports should n't mix with the politics * they do n't like * . 
  this last case is the most frequent , and it still can be dangerous , because at the end it 's only a crude attempt of censorship . 
   everything we do is politics . 
  maybe the only way of not doing politics at all is being all day lying down on the couch watching big brother ; i do n't dismiss this being what , those who demand not mixing sports and politics , in fact want : all the others spending the whole day without doing anything at all . 
   maybe it 's a legacy from that fateful person who said it many years ago : '' * be like me and do n't go into politics * '' ( francisco franco , fascist dictator of spain ) .

  his message is simple :  * catalans are bad people and corrupts and they want independence so they can be more bad people and corrupts . 
  *  * fc barcelona are also corrupts that 's why they want independence . 
  * even though fc barcelona never positioned in favor of independence ...

  ** credits ** : [ from the flight deck ] ( https://twitter.com/golfcharlie232/status/854026554896261122 ), 
  i 'm not denying some barcelona presidents evaded taxes . 
  like many real madrid presidents did ( and the current one do ) , and other european clubs . 
  it 's a real problem in top football teams from all over the world , and not only barcelona ( a team far below compared with corruption in other teams like madrid for instance ) . 
  you are trolling because what you said here has nothing to do with the link i posted : supporting a democratic referendum . 
  you just wanted to attack something you do n't like ( catalans voting their future ) , and you said the first thing you came up with to attack it the hard way . 
  if barcelona tax evasion is a problem for you , why you do n't submit a link here in reddit in a new post and let us all analyze it in detail ? 
  why here commenting something has nothing to do with ? 
  just read what you said :  the longer their populist friends are in charge , the more they can steal . 
  what does that even mean ? 
  who are you trying to fool ? 
  i 'm tired of seeing you trolling every place on reddit ... you are even so `` smart '' that you did n't realize that what you said is so stupid . 
  you are implying the fact the longer * catalonia is part of spain * , the longer * they can steal more * . 
  because catalonia can not adopt legislation in criminal law and tax law fraud ; is the spanish one being applied . 
  and the spanish law in tax fraud sucks ( i agree with you here ) . 
  so with a new country ( catalonia ) , new legislation can be approved to solve this problem . 
  you see what you said ? 
  edit : oh now you edited your comment to add '' * the same applies to real madrid too * '' , just in case your trolling was too clear ... 
  why are you trolling on every `` catalan '' thing you see on reddit ? 
  edit : wow you edited you comment below to add '' * the same applies to real madrid too * '' , but of course you are not going to say it in the comment up here , because it does n't help with your argument when attacking something you do n't like ( catalans voting on referendum about their future ) . 
   i do n't get this , it 's like moving out of your parents and going to their house to eat and do the laundry . 
  well for many people football is not the most important thing in their lifes . 
  i mean i do n't think when people want independence ( for x many reasons ) they stop to think what will happen with their football team and make their ultimate decision based on that . 
   i never imagined a sports entity supporting an independence movement ok you have to differentiate/be more precise here , because that sentence is not ture . 
  supporting a democratic referendum so the catalan people can decide their future , is not the same as `` supporting an independence movement '' . 
  bar\u00e7a is supporting a referendum ; in other words bar\u00e7a supports both the people voting yes and voting no , that 's what a referendum means . 
  i understand it can be `` weird '' when seen from an outside perspective , specially when comparing fc barcelona with sports clubs from other countries . 
  but here in catalonia it 's seen as a natural thing . 
  fc barcelona is part of the catalan culture and history , and part of the society . 
  just by reading this from [ wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fc_barcelona ) 's article , you can get an idea of what fc barcelona represents ( more than a club ) :  founded in 1899 by a group of swiss , english and catalan footballers led by joan gamper , the club has become a symbol of catalan culture and catalanism , hence the motto `` m\u00e9s que un club '' ( english : `` more than a club '' ) . 
  unlike many other football clubs , the supporters own and operate fc barcelona . 
  fc barceona is a `` catalan '' team and it has always been involved supporting whatever the catalan society do . 
  in this case , a referendum about `` creating '' a new country is an important thing for the catalan people , therefore fc barcelona shows support ( without expressing one choice about the voting options : favor or against independence ) . 
  you have to go back in history to understand it better ; during franco dictatorship in spain ( where catalan language and culture was persecuted by the spanish government and many catalans were executed ) , fc barcelona represented the resistance of the catalan people fighting for democracy . 
  so you have many examples of the club engaging with the society , for example fc barcelona also supported the non-binding [ referendum ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/catalan_self-determination_referendum,_2014 ) we had in catalonia on 2014 . 
  or a few years ago when then the spanish government `` contested '' the presence of catalan language in schools of catalonia , you could see puyol ( barcelona captain ) or guardiola ( manager of barcelona ) expressing his disagreement with this decisions and supporting the catalan schools and students . 
  and of course many non-political stuff : like [ la marat\u00f3 ] ( http://www.ccma.cat/tv3/marato/en/ ) ( a catalan tv initiative to raise funds for scientific research into diseases which are currently incurable ) , etc. 
  tl ; dr : what 's my opinion ? 
  i like a powerful organization like fc barcelona connecting with its society and showing support on many aspects . 
  fc barcelona 's motto is `` more than a club '' and i like it not being only a `` motto '' , but really making an impact on society and roots . 
  bar\u00e7a has been doing the same since last century when it was a small team , and i like it keeps doing it now despite being a top world rich team . 
   i thought the status of fcb was in question should catalonia become independent well nothing is official . 
  opinions of managers , players , journalists and people . 
  of course neither la liga or the clubs have anything official said . 
  anyway barcelona signed in support for the referendum , not for the `` yes '' or the `` no '' . 
  just supporting the fact the referendum can take place . 
  lol that was real ? 
  xd well in the case of fc barcelona this has been a conversation here in spain for the last decades . 
  it 's been said that in case of independence , bar\u00e7a would be allowed to keep playing in la liga . 
  just as monaco plays in french league . 
  today fc barcelona signed for the ** national pact for the referendum ** [ campaign ] ( https://pactepelreferendum.cat/en ) ( founded on 23th december 2016 ) . 
  this is the campaign 's manifest ( approved on 1st february 2017 ) :  the people of catalonia 's feeling of nationhood and their longing for self-government have undeniably deep historical roots , and have repeatedly been manifested throughout history . 
  at the current time , catalonia is part of spain , which , for irrefutable historical , linguistic and cultural reasons is plurinational , although this fact is not acknowledged by its political structures . 
   catalonia 's desire to decide its own political future has become increasingly apparent to the whole world . 
  to the point of becoming a sustained longing , which now reflects the will of the great majority of its people . 
   the right to decide one 's political future is universally recognized as being one of the essential and inalienable rights of democratic societies . 
  it is this right that underlies the demand by a majority of the citizens of catalonia , who wish to exercise it through the means of a referendum . 
   we wish to state that the catalan people 's desire to express their will via a referendum is the majority view and cuts across all strata of society ; and it is in keeping with the civic , peaceful and democratic determination expressed in the multitudinous demonstrations held by organized society in favour of its right to decide . 
   we uphold that the current spanish legal framework , as confirmed by constitutional experts , allows for a referendum to be held in catalonia in agreement with the state . 
  if this option has not been pursued so far it is due to a lack of political will on behalf of successive spanish governments . 
  the law , since it is open to multiple interpretations , ought to be understood as an instrument for finding democratic solutions to political problems and not a means to create new ones or exacerbate those that already exist . 
   the individuals , organizations and institutions that countersign this manifesto view the referendum as a unique instrument for consolidating democracy , for allowing plural political debate , the search for consensus and ultimately the implementation of effective agreements . 
   therefore :  we urge the governments of catalonia and spain to overcome the political obstacles and their preconceptions , and to finally reach an agreement that establishes the conditions and the fair and necessary guarantees for holding a referendum recognized by the international community , the result of which should be politically binding and effective . 
   we recognize the parliament of catalonia as the democratic institution which expresses the popular will of the country . 
  therefore , we support any initiatives and agreements that it should make relating to the holding of this referendum . 
   we express our belief that the referendum is an inclusive tool that will allow the free expression of the different positions that the citizens of catalonia hold regarding the political relationship between catalonia and spain . 
   we declare that democratic culture demands political solutions to political problems . 
  this is done by appealing to the fundamental mechanism available to contemporary societies : acknowledging and validating the majority will of the people in the form of a vote . 
   the referendum ought to ensure everyone feels they have been invited to participate . 
  this requires a scrupulously democratic , plural and equal debate between the legitimate options that currently exist in catalonia .

  highest one must be around 4/10 , at most . 
  ... to start masturbating furiously ? 
  same in spain , people vote * against * , not for , and all politicians are rather shit in their ratings . 
  stupid low petrol prices , stupid ecb , stupid domestic cons ... oh wait ... 
  he eats french ? 
  well at least it 's more fat-free than eating americans . 
  dude , the french state is the most centralist thing right now ... spain being very very decentralized compared to that , but i tell you that 's not enough for me , i too want a federation style relationship and of course a spanish republic ( that includes the catalan nation ) . 
  i know what you mean , but i did n't mean that paris gets that kind of tourism , but that barcelona gets a huge amount of tourists probably not too far from paris . 
  and yes , the kind of tourism is different , but barcelona 's tourism is diverse as well , and there 's a lot of cultural tourism ( gaud\u00ed , sagrada familia , the liceu ... ) just wanted to say that our `` paris '' is not madrid ( as in both being the capitals and biggest cities ) but barcelona , in the terms i 've explained . 
   spain are you sure you mean spain and not `` the middle of the ocean '' ? 
  you probably think the interior of spain and things like [ this millenial-old historical building ] ( http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-h5czswegoos/vxdo2v6vx2i/aaaaaaaaetw/2uftaeajbs0/s1600/1.jpg ) do n't exist . 
  another thing would be that we do n't sell it very well , but there are many japanese around ( and not as many chinese , but they 're starting to come ) . 
  but seriously , you should check your facts ... 
  you do n't get that kind of tourism in cities like madrid or the monumental cities ( toledo , \u00c1vila , segovia ... ) in the interior . 
  i think that 's only in barcelona and ibiza most of the time . 
  the southern part of the levante is full of elderly brits and germans and the north gets the same kind of tourism that the interior gets . 
  in all that regard , france and spain are pretty much the same , except our paris is barcelona instead of madrid . 
  actually it has much more to do with an urban/rural difference rather than ideologies based on the origin of the people of catalonia , so that logic is only valid for those that do care about the origin . 
  i doubt they refuse or do n't feel part of the catalan culture . 
  it 's just that some exclude the catalan culture from being part of spain 's diversity and how spaniards are ( catalans , basques , castilians , galicians , valencians , asturians ... etc ) while others do n't . 
  which is very very different . 
  it is as simply as [ looking at the data ] ( http://images.eldiario.es/catalunya/distribuye-voto_ediima20150928_0023_5.jpg ) , not just what flags people wear the most . 
  [ even with their 9n \\ ( the independentist movement called for a referendum that was n't official at the end and only participated a part of the population , mostly just people in favor of a change in the status quo \\ ) shows that just the interior rural areas the independence won based on the census . 
  they have a majority in the parliament because of the d'hondt electoral law , that greatly favors these rural areas . 
  barcelona and its metropolitan area has the least independentist party sum in every election  pretty sure they like it . 
  of course . 
  * and , if gibraltar wanted to have access to the single market and the rights we enjoy today of free movement , we would have to once again consider joint sovereignty with spain * if spain = portugal then you 're right . 
  except not . 
  come to spain please , 
  well i think the 99 % agrees with that ... 
  so what ? 
  the point is literally non-existant . 
  we do n't have a problem of a huge community of non-white people refusing to speak the language . 
  we do have a problem of british people refusing to speak the language ... why the hell would you bring up that some people is racist when it 's not even what we 're discussing ? 
  and why would you say that people in spain do n't care or do n't complain about colonies of brits in the levante , south and canarias that refuse to speak the language of the place ? 
  i mean , you 're asturian , have you been there for a long period of time to check ???? 
  i just do n't understand what you two are talking about . 
  we are talking about real , existant issues , not making up stuff because racism exist . 
  ( sorry for the rant ), 
  last time i checked , you guys were talking about the double standard * in spain * regarding not complaining about those brits that refuse to speak the language but doing so with supposedly cases of non-white africans and arabs that do the same ... am i right ? 
  if that 's the case , then it 's a non-issue . 
  because you 're making that shit up by comparing something that does n't exist ( a * huge * community of africans or arabs that refuse to speak the language versus one that actually does ) . 
  you 're making the double standard , actually . 
  since you and / u/gkat are simply making up this story ... 
  i do n't remember any news regarding what you 're talking about ( a very big community of non-spaniards that refuse to speak the language , besides the british retirees ) , plus i do n't think there are 200,000 to 2 million africans or arabs living in our country mostly because they retire and go to the coast and build their ghettos ( they instead are usually young and work hard in very bad conditions sometimes ) . 
  when that happens , then we can compare . 
  not even pointing out the fact that arabs and africans most of the time speak a very unique broken spanish , that are usually mocked ( because it would n't be us if we did n't ) in a good way ... so yes they actually try . 
  please be more serious and stop making up shit when there 's not . 
  spain is fairly tolerant unless you 're the kind of guy that goes `` spain is a backwards country except my own piece of progressive , advanced land within spain '' . 
  he 's saying they should be expelled , you 're saying that people would complain . 
  i complain that anyone that comes to spain refueses to speak in any of the languages that we use in spain to communicate with eachother ( either be spanish , catalan , basque , galician ... but you know , speak what the native speaks ) . 
  but even if i complain i do n't think we should expel anyone . 
  they 're two very very different points . 
  actually the expelling thing is not even a point , just a radical idea . 
  that 's very francoist of you o_o, 
  you got ta add the / s because some people actually agree lol . 
  nice flag you 've got there . 
  \u00a1 viva la rep\u00fablica !, 
  i obviously meant lax ( bad translation from laxativo , which is not laxante ) . 
  and the water in spain ca n't be improven because it 's basically top notch ... except for the [ levante ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/levante,_spain ) . 
  there avoid tap water at all costs !!, 
  madrid 's water is the best :p, 
  which is part of spain , for at least half the population . 
  and that spanish is the first language in use in catalonia also says a lot ( even when the vehicular language is catalan in the education ) . 
  we actually cringe when people call bar\u00e7a the city . 
  it 's either barna or bcn . 
  there were a lot of controversies about the project . 
  adelson wanted a series of tax heaven measures and pro-smoking laws that was going against the eu common law and the standards that we already had in spain and the autonomous community of madrid . 
  the central government itself said no , but the regional government was more laxative . 
  many many people were against this project because it could cause a lot of trouble : gambling and such provoking lots of financial and tax evasion stuff , adding crime and drugs problems that this kind of theme parks bring ( more concerned about the crime stuff tbf ) . 
  oh , and also the idea that this was the continuation of the `` mentalidad del pelotazo y econom\u00eda del ladrillo '' ( i actually do n't know how to translate this , if you do n't understand it tell me and i 'll try to make an effort lol ) . 
  many parties claimed that we should focus on i+d + i , new technologies , renewables , it industry etc. 
  instead of this kind of stuff . 
  ... turned out [ we actually have a chinese substitute ] ( http://www.elconfidencialdigital.com/dinero/madrid-sustituto-eurovegas-macro-complejo-millones_0_2382961683.html ) . 
  this time with no casinos , and a 7bn $ investment , in the south of madrid as well . 
  i do n't want to oppose forever to this kind of things because i know they 're good for spain in the long run probably . 
  and more for a city like madrid , that 's seeing how the big events are leaving for barcelona instead :(, 
  [ benidorm has 400k population for like half the year , or more ] ( http://www.abc.es/hemeroteca/historico-27-08-2007/abc/valencia/doce-localidades-costeras-superan-los-100000-habitantes-en-verano_164532275925.html )  the 70k number is just the people in the census , but the actual people in the city is much bigger , because of its status of big holiday sky-touching city . 
  yes , i prefer barcelona in almost every aspect , and i actually prefer bcn over madrid landmark-wise , but san francisco just looks nicer to me . 
  maybe it 's a bias because i like how us cities look , with cities around 200k inhabitants with awesome high skyscrapers everywhere . 
  it 's fucking big . 
  it just goes upwards instead of wide , [ being the city with the most skyscrapers per capita in the world . 
  too soon . 
  an italian actually knowing this o_o i mean , that was pathetic , the regional government trying to change every law just to please sheldon adelson ... and that with half the population against the project . 
  good thing it did n't happen i say . 
  madrid = atlanta . 
  san francisco fits barcelona very well , but san francisco landmarks are superior in that regard ( i mean , the golden gate is so kewl ) . 
  barcelona 's nightlife  san francisco nightlife , though . 
  and the mediterranean is also superior , always :p and yeah , barcelona is definitely not sub-tropical . 
  are you kidding ? 
  they 're fairly common in spain as well . 
  and they 're cool af . 
  why would n't i expect it ? 
  greece is awesome . 
  i do . 
  but nutella is clearly and objectively superior , sorry guyz :p, 
  nocilla is much more sweet and tastes more to chocolate . 
  i prefer nutella for instance . 
  here it 's around 0,80 $ / l but it can go up to 1 $ / l as well . 
  from known brands i mean , if you try to find * marca blanca * ( marque de distributeur ) then it might be cheaper .

  that 's all great and works well to campaign but now everyone seems to realize that the priorities of various issues is very different for different groups and now that it 's necessary to form pacts , nobody wants to give up their particular priority so they basically have to form pacts within the organization before even going to the table and at that point it 's so fragile they basically ca n't give up anything to negotiate with any seriousness . 
  tl ; dr ; left is fragmented like always, 
  podemos seems to be having a hard time getting agreement within podemos . 
  they editorialize shit like crazy but wo n't out and out make up facts like that . 
  i 'm starting to think this is a catholic vs. protestant thing . 
  do n't know why , though . 
  an italian and a spaniard together . 
  it 's great because talking louder and slower ( and generally more obnoxiously ) actually works to make us understand each other . 
  i 'm originally from the us where you can just walk up to complete strangers and talk like complete friends . 
  it 's not at that level , but it 's a pretty normal thing to talk to stranger on public transport around here . 
  my favorite is the flights to madrid from heathrow . 
  when they first try to call the flight all the spanish people form an agglomeration that is basically queue of the fittest while the british people just look on aghast . 
  it 's not wanting it so much , but even in small groups , spaniards tend to group themselves very close together . 
  the whole idea of a detached house is very uncommon and everyone gathers in small bars near each other even in small towns . 
  it 's a very social culture . 
  i just think of the new year 's concert . 
  i guess my biggest thought of common people things would be ski resorts . 
  exactly why . 
  basically the us saw how horrible smog could be back in the 70s with los angeles ' air quality out of control and implemented some pretty strict guidelines . 
  especially back then , diesels just could n't cut it in that regulatory market and is the main reason why petrol has such a controlling share of personal vehicles there . 
  europe 's engine makers had bet on diesel and when it was starting to become clear that they really were worse for local environments , the whole carbon reduction thing happened and they got governments to go along with them as the `` less polluting '' option because they emit less carbon . 
  and while true , the reduction of carbon really is n't worth the damage it has caused and i firmly believe betting on diesels has been the greatest policy error as a bloc in recent decades . 
  nobody would even think about allowing market prices of fuels to actually be reflected either where petrol is significantly cheaper and would help alleviate the problem all on its own . 
  basically that cars in europe cause much worse local air pollution . 
  cars in the us tend to emit more carbon , though . 
  i mean . 
  that 's pretty much exactly what happened on 11-m, 
  they 'll just take taxes from bank accounts as they are owned ( they can and do do this ) . 
  and any bank that wants to operate in the rest of spain will have to follow spanish law . 
  so basically catalonia would need a completely separate banking infrastructure and then make sure everyone would use it . 
  la caixa already said they would move to madrid in that case too . 
  so my question is how does catalonia actually plan on getting any money ? 
  yeah they want to set up their own tax agency but the central government will also demand the taxes from catalonia and businesses that operate in both parts will have to pay . 
  if they actually force a double taxation situation , thing will either get insanely expensive or businesses will just move to basque country or madrid . 
  like , i still do n't see how this works out well in any way without catalonia being very economically isolated . 
  i get that a lot of people would rather be poor and be rid of spain , but i really doubt it 's the majority and the technical details just seem to be escaping a lot of people . 
  we drove up to andorra for some skiing . 
  one good day and now rain and little snow . 
  i mean , i 'm not against a referendum in general , but a government has to operate within its laws , otherwise it 's a really dangerous precedent . 
  the fact that nobody has even talked about changing the law to allow a vote until the current negotiations is what seems to be the most ludicrous thing about the whole mess . 
  there is no cup , only mas . 
  my question is what prevents them from just saying jxsi wants mas after a govt is formed ? 
  i use atocha cercan\u00edas daily . 
  not that comforting . 
  birth rates there have fallen dramatically . 
  a lot of it is because of education of women . 
  despite alarmism and a lot of extremism right now , i 'm actually fairly optimistic about the long term prospects of the arab world . 
   people are more concerned about getting their party in power and making the other party/parties look bad than they are about actually fixing problems . 
  that 's pretty much the case no matter what . 
  democratic systems allow you to punish people by getting them out of power if they fuck up which is the advantage . 
  fringe ( i mean small representation , not necessarily ideologically ) groups tend to come in 2 flavors those that will lend support to coalitions or other parties in exchange for small , but relevant favors and those that will just yell at everything and be angry and not actually try to achieve anything . 
  the die hard ideologues tend to be the latter . 
  i do n't know what to believe about china . 
  they 've been lying for a long time to at some point to get back to reality , they were going to have to have `` correction '' numbers . 
  their stock market is basically like a casino . 
  the best measure i 've truly seen for china is just looking at quantities of shipments going in/out, 
  also , in a foreign country , you should just request consular assistance . 
  it 's still the holiday period here . 
  but i have worked every workday except christmas eve and new year 's eve . 
  i actually like it though , i just bullshit on reddit making sure nothing goes terribly wrong in the office and i can take the car to work without the terrible madrid traffic issues . 
  and my holidays start tomorrow so i 'm very happy about being off to andorra for some quality skiing . 
  yeah , they are a fairly typical fringe left group . 
  they probably got extra support this time around because if your primary issue is independence you had the choice of the unified list with artur mas at the head or the cup to vote for independence . 
  they really mismanaged the outcome and may have been able to force mas out if they had been very firm from the beginning but that 's just pure inexperience . 
  by junqueras shutting up , he may well have made sure that erc gets the majority of the independentist bloc . 
  never interrupt your enemy while they are making a mistake and all that . 
  so jxs\u00ed could have formed a government if they were willing to ditch m\u00e1s but just goes to show when it really matters that him staying in power was more important than any idea they professed . 
  the biggest winners out of this are likely to be podemos ' affiliate in catalonia which is pro-referendum and uses that to not have a strong stance either way on independence . 
  it 's unclear if erc and cdc/dil ( m\u00e1s ' party ) will run as a single list again , but probably unlikely at this point . 
  the current declaration appears dead in the water . 
  this also makes the situation all that more complex regarding catalonia in the negotiations to form a government in the national parliament . 
  the big winners out of this is likely to be the podemos affiliate in catalonia which as a pro-referendum stance and uses that to kind of side-step taking a strong position on independence . 
  it 's yet to be seen if cdc/lid ( mas ' party ) will run together with erc as a unified list again , but it seems pretty unlikely at this point . 
  capital gains is still much higher than corporation tax . 
  the change uk should make is make travel days in/out of the uk count as a half day toward residence rather than a full day and you can get rid of commuters to monaco or isle of man . 
  honestly , gas prices are really visible an annoying but as a percentage of most people 's budget it 's really not that high so even a 50 % or more variation will have only a minor impact on people 's habits, 
  i grew up in the center of the country and it 's fairly normal to have to dodge holes in the middle of motorways . 
  wow , someone who actually understands taxes around here . 
  it 's also good if a company hoards a bit of cash in reserve as it means they are able to better survive economic cycles and keep people employed that keeps the cycle from getting worse . 
  i get that it sounds bad but man , you 'd think i were hitler for most people when i say that corporation tax should n't exist . 
  the government helps that by making taxes much lower there . 
  things like gasoline get way cheaper . 
  a fun side effect is you technically have to declare customs for domestic flights from the canaries . 
  few people do and if you are buying a nice laptop or something , people will often just fly down there for the weekend since the savings can be almost as much as the cost of the flight . 
  filled up for 0,92 $ / l today in central madrid . 
  feels good . 
  this was discussed ad nauseum when it happened . 
  it was given as cash so it 's income . 
  but even if it were capital gains ( that way to lower the burden ) it 's still much higher than the corporate rate . 
  it may play into it , but new elections are almost certainly worse for them . 
  they are having major problems in their internal conflicts . 
  the last thing psoe wants is new elections . 
  they are falling and now could have a leadership battle during a campaign if that happen . 
  it 's possible s\u00e1nchez is able to somehow maneuver to allow a government to be formed , possibly by having soraya replace rajoy and see if he can survive in his own party . 
  if he fails , it will mean new elections and be very bad news for psoe in general . 
  podemos has figured out the grand way of getting their base from catalonia without actually having to have a strong stance on the in/out position by making it all about the referendum . 
  it wo n't happen so they can keep riding it but if it were , it would split their base in catalonia in 2 . 
   but the targeted public does . 
  they are uk citizens . 
  if they sell in the uk , they should pay the uk gov taxes at uk tax rates .

  the current eu treaties do n't contemplate that possibility . 
  leaving only the euro would require the approval of all the eu parlaments and a refer\u00e8ndum in ireland at least . 
  leaving the eu . 
  no , you should complain more , or you would end with rulers like him . 
  the flag of the 2nd spanish republic . 
  yes , but i would only describe like that the part until zaragoza . 
  what about jobs that allow you to have a good living ? 
  most refugees want to work in my experience . 
  all the rural areas are losing population except mediterranean touristic villages . 
  i want to point that we have a big continous area without any city : if [ this area ] ( http://i.imgur.com/jjac6h8.jpg ) ( called by some the serran\u00eda celtib\u00e9rica ) was an autonomous region it would : * an area of 63,098.69 km ^ 2 , twice the size of belgium . 
  * 503,566 inhabitants . 
  * 7,98 inhabitants/km ^ 2 . 
  it would be the only region outside the lapland with less than eight . 
  [ article in spanish ] ( www.eldiario.es/sociedad/espana-desaparece_0_323717749.htmlfce ) and most of, 
   a ) an european manufacturer they are * designed * ( using generic components ) at spain . 
  manufacturing is done at china . 
  far right is very small at spain , but they are catholic and homophobic . 
  take [ 2011 elections ] ( http://resultados.elpais.com/elecciones/2011/generales/congreso/ ) from 24,590,557 votes the far right parties : * pxc : 59,781 votes . 
  you can see it as the catalan version of the national front , but it has never been in the catalan or spanish parliament . 
  and it is bigger than all the other together . 
  uses the name of the dictatorship single party and claims to be its heir . 
  but most of the high officers of the dictatorship integrated in the currently ruling pp ( its first leader was an information minister of the dictatorship ) . 
  after 3 years of civil war and 36 years of dictarship , the far right is very hard to sell at spain . 
  spain and portugal are probably the two countries with the smallest far rights . 
  far left : the only pure far left in those elections were the pcpe ( soviet union nostalgic , they do n't talk about this ) with 26,436 votes and izquierda anticapitalista ( not very well defined economic ideology , but socially progressive ) with 24,456 votes that has been integrated in podemos . 
  including [ the leader in andalusia ] ( http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/teresa_rodr%c3%adguez ) . 
  spaniards ca n't go to spanish universities without paying . 
  the same rights as the local citizens . 
  and only for eu citizens . 
  do n't think that you can move to spain and go to university without paying . 
  the spanish financial sector is against a more debtor-friendly law . 
  and the two big parties have very interesting relationship with the financial sector . 
  * [ santander group and bbk have forgiven 22 millions in debt to the psoe ] ( http://www.elmundo.es/elmundo/2010/01/21/espana/1264105308.html ) . 
  surprisingly the psoe has done a lot for the santader group , [ including a pardon for a former ceo ] ( http://www.tumbit.com/news/articles/6910-psoe-went-too-far-with-santander-pardon.html ) * [ pp also got forgiven 2.8 millions ] ( http://elpais.com/diario/2005/11/19/espana/1132354803_850215.html ) . 
  and the [ santander group has paid rodrigo rato as adviser many times ] ( http://www.rtve.es/noticias/20130917/banco-santander-vuelve-fichar-rodrigo-rato-para-consejo-asesor-internacional/747092.shtml ) . 
  and rodrigo rato as former director of the imf , former minister of economy and former vice-pm is influential in the party . 
  i probably could put more examples of revolving doors . 
  the current minister of economy worked in lehman brothers . 
  [ the european union and the imf asked us to reform this ] ( http://economia.elpais.com/economia/2014/02/02/actualidad/1391361928_983094.html ) . 
  but it is not going to happen with a conservative government . 
  or reforming the property register notaries system , the pm and two of his brothers are * registradores . 
  mostly due to family traditions and to participate in the holy week celebrations . 
  you can be a member of a * cofradia * and atheist , [ it is not unheard ] ( http://www.andalucesdiario.es/ciudadanxs/un-hermano-de-monte-sion-no-soy-creyente-pero-me-encanta-la-semana-santa/ ) . 
  rajoy and pp have been doing lately some stuff that goes in the opposite direction of the first uears of government . 
  * they did a regressive income tax reform in december of 2011 with an emergency rdl , they did a progressive in 2014 . 
  * they removed primary and emergency health care for immigrants in irregular situation with health care cards ( mostly immigrants that lost their visa when they lost their jobs , but are staying ) . 
  they are restoring it this year . 
  * they started the legislature with a pack of measures pandering the catholic right and dictatorship nostalgic . 
  they reverted almost all of them ( catholic religion grades now computes for calculate the mean mark for high school , but that mark is mostly symbolic anyway ) . 
  some hard right people created vox , but nobody is voting them . 
  * they cut contributory unemployment benefits in 2012 . 
  the long term jobless that participate in insertion programs ( after +2 years seeking employment ) get noncontributory $ 426/month if they live in households with mean income below minimum wage during a maximum of a year . 
  before it was 6 months . 
  a total of 3 years on benefits ( 2 years of contributory around minimum wage and a year of noncontributory is the longest in our history ) . 
  and some other things . 
  although we are in an electoral year , so this should be taken with a pinch of salt ( or something like that ) . 
  edit : the law that you are pointing has not been relevant until now . 
  unless the creditor has goodwill is hard to get a clean up . 
  * pressure group : pah ( literally mortgage victims association ) , they got a [ european citizens prize from the eu parliament ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_citizens%27_prize#2013_winners ) . 
  * political party : podemos , iu ( united left ) and some regional hard left parties . 
  ada colau , the former spokewoman of the pah , is a candidate to mayor of barcelona by barcelona en com\u00fa , a voters 's platform ( not a formal coalition ) backed by podemos , iu , icv ( catalanist eco-socialist party ) some other minor parties . 
  she is not a member of any of the parties . 
  [ and she is leading the polls by a small margin ] ( http://www.elmundo.es/cataluna/2015/04/07/5522e4cee2704e293d8b457c.html?cid=smboso25301&amp;s_kw=twitter ) . 
  so this is going to an important matter in the near future . 
  ciudadanos does n't have a position about the matter as far as i know . 
  it depends of laws . 
  bankruptcy is for life at spain . 
  unless you pay everything and the official delay interest is a yearly 12 % right now . 
  almost nobody gets out . 
  edit : how is the bankruptcy law at italy ? 
  good luck !, 
  the federal eu . 
   really when people say this they mean it is the slowdown of the transition in to a closer more federal type eu that 's not gon na happen . 
  would it increase them ? 
  you know nothing !, 
  i suppose that everything is relative , for somebody in china spain may be a paradise of tolerance , co-existence and respect without tension between different cultures . 
  and yes switzerland handles better the relations between different communities that keep different languages and traditions better than belgium or spain , and i do n't like the elimination approach that france has mostly used . 
  me too , please !, 
  who counts the votes is critical , and should be a way difficult to manipulate and easy to audit . 
  advantatges of bailout boxes : * des-centralized counting , . 
  * easy to audit . 
  * privacy i still do n't know a e-voting system that can ensure secret voting and protect against manipulation . 
  i do n't trust my institutions so much . 
  the risks introduced are too high for so little gain . 
  voting with bailout boxes and paper is n't so hard guys !, 
  how switzerland manages to keep different cultures together without the level of tension that we have on spain , or the french frenchification . 
  protect the oppressed russian minority . 
  spain : you can have weapons ( hunting and handguns ) . 
  you only need to check if you are a drug addict , convict , alcoholic , physically and psychologically able , and you have to do test theory and practice . 
  what would you change ? 
  why ? 
  the point about how the votes are counted is true . 
   rodents one of the traditional ingredients in paella was a [ rodent ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/southwestern_water_vole ) . 
  you ca n't find paella with it anymore . 
  i blame all this modernization shit , the next thing will be stopping eating rabbit . 
  try [ sueca ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sueca,_valencia ) and suecia ( sweden ) in spain . 
   that would only apply while greece 's ppp adjusted per-capita welfare payments are below the eu average . 
  greece has an unemployment of 27 % , saying that the welfare payments should stay below eu average means that most of them should keep getting nothing . 
  [ spain also ] ( http://elpais.com/diario/2010/01/05/madrid/1262694258_850215.html ) . 
  and the catalan tv was good when we had it at valencia at least .

  camarada was used a lot in the spanish tercios in the xvi century as divisions for example , it 's funny that of today spaniards think that that word is from german or soviet origin :p, 
  yeah , the whole 5 of them that knows english and use reddit . 
  come on now . 
  to be honest `` hermandad '' ( brotherhood in spanish ) is genderless . 
  but i think this is called `` cofradia '' , translator says `` brotherhood '' , `` guild '' , `` fraternity '' i guess it should be guild ? 
  i mean usually in games the `` thieves guild '' is translated as `` cofradia de ladrones '', 
  while it 's true that i do n't like cold , and winter is my least favorite season , i 'm pretty sure i can get by that , and we all know that northern countries have lots of advantages . 
  but the problem is that i 'm not happy if i do n't talk spanish ; i do n't think i can express myself as who i really am if not in spanish and get burnout fast , it was one of my main problems when i did erasmus in berlin , that and the rain , the fucking rain . 
  yeah we have `` chivo expiatorio '' too which is scape goat ( well literally is `` atoning baby goat '' as `` atone for your sins '' so basically `` goat baby jesus '' ) but we use turk 's head like 90 % of the time . 
  you mean apart from `` scapegoat '' being `` cabeza de turco '' , `` turk 's head '' in spain ? 
  we used to have `` judeomasones '' ( jew free masons ) in dictatorship times , and without sarcasm which is even worse . 
  no , not as big and pretty as `` cerezos '' . 
  it 's like [ these ones ] ( http://miradordepozuelo.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/dsc00839.jpg ) , you can see the before and after . 
  they bloom practically overnight , and after a week the pink flowers fall , and they only have the dark red color of the leafs . 
  the ones in my street bloomed early march , it 's never that soon it 's usually about now really but they are all dark red now . 
  to me spring starts when the pink flower trees on my street blooms ( i do n't know the name of the trees ) , they last a week before falling off leaving only some garnet colour leafs , this was like a month ago so to me it 's almost summer now . 
  we know , but we like the joke, 
  i guess france or italy , maybe argentina also , just not portugal . 
  some may be wondering , any northern country ? 
  nope , i censure any country where it 's acceptable to eat while walking . 
  and murder, 
  [ ** highest healthy life expectancy ** ] ( http://www.scotpho.org.uk/population-dynamics/healthy-life-expectancy/key-points ) there is a new stat everyday . 
  no , he is not . 
  we have 4, 
  humans are born with trousers , it is known, 
  and getting closer , one of my coworkers is saying that he knows one of them . 
  he is telling us that lately he is being getting into fights and shit . 
  and where does that road pass through , iran ? 
  more people than russia in the same space of greece, 
  it reminds me of the tv program about alcohol and driving . 
  they stopped a visible drunk maghrebi . 
  - `` i have n't drink , i 'm a muslim '' - `` ok , then let 's do a drug test too '', 
   oliven\u00e7a you mean the other way around ? 
  if it were portuguese it would look like [ an exclave ] ( http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-9pqj4athtyo/tdoxa8fqtxi/aaaaaaaab-a/hqvumgtckis/s1600/olivenza_map.jpg ) . 
  at least war between european countries, 
  to relax ? 
  i do n't know about portugal but we have a russian town in alicante , and every summer there is a police raid to arrest some mafiosi . 
  in fact , i think spain arrested some corrupt ukranian politician just there last week . 
  fighting social injustice with legal injustice . 
  3/11 for me but the questions about `` too much control over ... '' are so ambigous , subjective and stupid , perfect bait . 
  i do n't agree , it 's not that the government it 's islamic , it was n't some years ago , it 's been the other way around , the government change because the population demanded . 
  i enter the thread because i was triggered by the term `` asian gangs '', 
  because i follow international news enough to understand that if putin had a rival with options , i would have heard the shit out of it . 
  that 's why i asserted my ignorance and proyect it to other people who also have n't heard of him to see if they get/got to the same conclusion as i did . 
  recently ? 
  we 've been doing civil wars sine celtiberan times where the national sport was tribal raiding . 
  - we had civil wars as rome ; i like this emperor better than this other one let 's kill ourselves here about it . 
  - as visigoths , is god singular ? 
  or a trinity ? 
  let 's talk this calmly over a nice civil war also about two thirds visigoths kings were killed . 
  - as muslims , who are better muslims , arabs or berbers , only war could answer this . 
  - what 's reconquista ? 
  civil wars inside a civil war inside a religous civil war . 
  civil warception . 
  - as spanish empire , rebellion at every and each one of the king 's decision , i do n't want to go fight in italy , rebellion !, 
  i do n't want to go fight the netherland , rebellion !, 
  i do n't like the accent of the king , rebellion !, 
  - spanish succesion war , nuff said . 
  - as napoleonic spain , let 's follow napoleon , he is the best , so modern !, 
  but he is a foreigner , i will war you to put the worst king in spain history . 
  - should a woman inherit the throne ? 
  let 's have 3 carlist civil wars over the century to discuss this . 
  i mean , we had a terrorist group until very recently , let 's just not focus on the last civil war , this is tradition . 
  it depends in the humidity , 30\u00bac in spain is ok . just avoid direct contact with the sun , he is a douche . 
  pink -  yellow -  greens -  purple -  red bonkers !, 
  some numbers would be good to make an opinion , sadly there is none . 
  as far as my country is concerned , even if we only spend 1 cent our contribution is still net positive . 
  we gain absolutely nothing from nato . 
  so about the 2 % ; pass ... 
  i should also add that other countries , who are more threatened or seek to more influence in world politics should spend accordingly . 
  i 'm at a point that i care very little about muslim countries . 
  it 's not fixable , let them do whatever they want just do n't bring their problems . 
  there is plenty of trouble ridden countries in south america or south east asia and such with better chances to make it to a good spot and contribute to the world . 
  let 's forget about muslims already . 
  not worth it . 
  i still think it 's better to declare islam a sect , and apply current law . 
  so on top of my head and checking the wikipedia for the names ; since xvi century : [ revolt of the comuneros ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/revolt_of_the_comuneros ) and [ revolt of the brotherhoods ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/revolt_of_the_brotherhoods ) also called ** germanias ** : about the same time and against the new king charles v. [ rebellion of the alpujarras ] ( https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/rebeli%c3%b3n_de_las_alpujarras ) war with the muslims left in spain with genocide and enslavement included . 
  [ catalan revolt ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/catalan_revolt ) - that will end up losing part of catalunya to the french forever . 
  [ war of the spanish succession ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/war_of_the_spanish_succession ) - the disaster , an european war where whoever win , we still lose . 
  [ peninsular war ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/peninsular_war ) - we call it independece war so people forget that spaniards , usually the smart ones , fight alongside napoleon too . 
  [ hundred thousand sons of saint louis ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hundred_thousand_sons_of_saint_louis ) - the worst king in spanish history , ask for help from the english and french to crush the constitutional monarchy and make it an absolutist one again . 
  [ carlist wars ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/carlist_wars ) - three of them , each one even more absurd . 
  [ cantonal revolution ] ( https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/rebeli%c3%b3n_cantonal ) - my personal favorite , in which cities and regions declared themeselves independent with the highlight of the city of cartagena declaring war to madrid and prussia !!!!, 
  [ spanish civil war ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/spanish_civil_war ) - almost a century ago but still going in our hearts . 
  those that i remember , and i 'm not counting succesfull independence wars , independence from us , the american ones , portugal or even all those dutch-flemish wars . 
  and all those change of governments , two coup d'etat , two republics , random italian king . 
  not enough bullets for all the firing squads we use . 
  what i mean is that we , spaniards , fight more inside our borders , than outside them . 
  my country is the civil war capital of the world . 
  i put this because it 's in english , the spanish ones are not different . 
  there is one from my home town that it 's the most infuriating thing you will ever hear if you understand what they are saying . 
  they are interviewed by a very left-wing daily . 
  [ here it is ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsz_i6s2tio ) but the highlight its all the bitching and asking for more money and stuff . 
  `` we are people , they have to give us a payout and that 's it '' `` we live like rats , they have to give us a house and that 's it '' the `` y ya esta '' = `` and that 's it '' gets me on my nerves , like nothing else in this world . 
  [ gypsy slum in spain ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lygemtajiq8 ), 
  one of the few conspiracies i really believe , and gets me angry every time i hear about it . 
  it 's all because the subsidized agriculture , if you want to know why those countries exactly . 
  i sometimes hear `` chequia '' in spanish but i always thought that it was just lazy speak . 
  we do that a lot though . 
  i mean both , calling ambassadors and posturing .
