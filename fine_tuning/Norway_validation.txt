  the state acts with the consent of the people . 
  in norway they tried to push for sunday shopping , but people were like `` how about you go fuck yourself instead ? '', 
  people do n't want another day where they 're pushed into more consumption . 
  remove the sunday shopping ban and you take away the one day part-time retail workers have to not get called up and asked to work . 
  it 'll just be a race to the bottom until everyone 's expected to work that day , and the majority of the population ca n't have a shared day off anymore . 
  if anything , we should expand the ban to saturdays , as well . 
  regardless , this will be a moot point in 5-10 years when the entire retail industry is automated . 
  how about we assume that the government acts with the consent of the people ? 
  anybody forcing you to work like that ? 
  most people work 40 hours a week over 5 days , if you chose to do something else , that 's your problem . 
  or you could just keep it the way it is instead of creating problems to find solutions for . 
  because it is n't about someone being willing to work shop that day . 
  it 's about how those people result in a race to the bottom where you end up with everyone having to work sundays . 
  by allowing shops to be open on sundays , you 're setting up another situation in which an employee will have to say `` no '' to their employer . 
  the employees that are okay with working sundays get preference , and to stay competitive everyone else has to work sundays , as well . 
  these things are n't about individual choice . 
  there is no individual choice here .

  / r/evilbuildings, 
  of course they 're not made out of thin air , but that has no relevance on the inherent value of a mutual protection alliance . 
  whether or not the ussr/warsaw pact exists anymore is completely irrelevant . 
  i do n't really understand the notion that nato is n't about anything . 
  nato is a mutual protection alliance , and that will always remain relevant even if every country on earth was a member , to maintain peace . 
  actually , only seven muslim majority countries have capital punishment for homosexuality . 
  other countries have everything from imprisonment to small fines , while it is completely legal in others . 
  several non-muslim countries also penalize homosexuality with anything from fines to imprisonment . 
  while persecution is common in islamic majority countries , and extra-judicial killings happen in some of them , the notion that homosexuality is punished by death in any islamic country is just factually untrue , and historically ignorant . 
  it may seem idiotic to people who have never had a single thought on the subject , but to anyone making simply a cursory investigation into it will find how insanely disadvantaged women are in this area . 
  but you 'll probably be happy to have your pre-conceived notions reinforced by your own biases . 
   this specific law will lead to people quickly promoting women to board status regardless of how qualified they are for the job . 
  this will lead to companies being run worse and also reduced respect for women in important positions . 
  that 's what mandating things like this does . 
  apples and oranges . 
  this is about putting more women , who make up roughly 50 % of the world population , in leadership positions because of the disadvantageous system and culture constructed during a patriarchal society . 
  men are more likely to hire men , men are more likely to reject ideas and opinions from women than they are from men , men are less likely to understand the problems women face in the workplace and so less inclined to try to solve them . 
  and people are n't given positions they 're not qualified for . 
  qualified women are given an advantage because they are disadvantaged in society today . 
  you 're just putting forth a poorly thought through argument because it fits your biases . 
  no , it has not been negative . 
  you 're retarded . 
  i think you mean `` fahly '' . 
   yes and treating someome different because of some innate traits is not the same thing as treating someome different because of his/her behaviour , beliefs , values etc. 
  why should these two be conflated ? 
  conflation is not equivocation . 
  besides , nothing of what you just said is relevant to the definition of racism . 
   but they do the same thing when they assume malicious thought when someone says something not nice about a minority group . 
  why they deserve more courtesy than they grant ? 
  if you actually know what the counter-jihad group is about then you will know that they 're not assuming anything . 
   is it racist to treat someone differently if you strongly dislike fhis/her beliefs ? 
  it 's discriminatory . 
  but discrimination is n't necessarily a bad thing . 
  which is another reason why that word is ineffectual . 
  but if you used the word ` racist ' in the context i would quite easily understand what it is you meant and i would not waste time engaging in semantics instead of arguing the actual subject . 
   who are we talking about ? 
  anybody who read the article , anybody who was exposed to the protesters , people in sweden , etc. 
  keep telling yourself that . 
  because there 's no way there 's any actual written record of this conversation ... 
   to equivocate means to be deliberately ambiguous or unclear in your wording in order to mislead or withhold information . 
  i do n't understand why you think racism ca n't be used in a misleading way . 
  in the context you 're using it it means to use one word to mean different things as i did in my sentence example . 
   i have my doubts about the innocence of their intentions . 
  now you 're just forcing malice upon them . 
  racism is used in this context and is pretty much accepted as synonymous with discrimination , nobody 's confused as to what their cause is , and using the word ` racism ' is n't confusing anyone . 
  i think you 're just forcing the issue because you want to win an argument on the internetz . 
  we 're not living in some political conspiracy thriller here . 
  well , i can tell that you do n't mind being wrong , you just mind appearing to be wrong to others . 
  it is amusing that * you * accuse * me * of being childish , though . 
  you not getting the point is not the same as me not having a point . 
  that is entirely your problem . 
  these people have a cause . 
  that cause is obvious to everyone . 
  they use a word that is not technically accurate because it is conversationally more practical . 
  but you 're still here arguing semantics even though the situation is clear to everyone , even yourself . 
  you 're just wasting time and energy on a completely pointless discussion . 
  it 's not equivocation . 
  equivocation would be `` the weather is fine , which makes me happy , so if i get a fine i 'll also be happy . '', 
  neither does it have anything to do with framing any discussion . 
  i has to do with succinctly conveying information , which the word ` racism ' does far better , even though the term does not technically apply . 
  people know what it implies and it ` ss a more malleable word . 
  it 's not deceit or anything like that , it is simply the effect of an evolving vocabulary . 
  the answer is yes . 
  well , you most certainly are living up to your username . 
  i have n't heard anyone complain about it . 
  owned is itself a synonym implying the ownership of a person , i.e slavery . 
  why do n't you get all uppity about that instead ? 
  it has to do with discrimination , and if racism is used as a synonym for discrimination then your argument is one purely of semantics . 
  it does n't matter whether you have a problem with it or not , it matters how words are used by people . 
  but i would n't expect you to understand this as it 's past grade school level . 
  because you ca n't stop it . 
  i hate to break this to you , but you 're an idiot . 
  sadly , this is a chronic condition and has no known cure . 
  semantics is pretty much the most useless argument to get involved in . 
  stop it . 
  and anyway , `` racism '' is becoming a catch-all for all forms of discrimination against groups because other words are just cumbersome and less charged than it . 
  just let it happen instead of derailing actual arguments with semantics .

  they wo n't stop a determined attacker . 
  i 'm more impressed with the fact it only cost $ 80 000 to repave almost 50 km of road . 
  it would probably have costed $ 80 mill here in norway, 
  i know a scotsman who doesnt drink . 
  imagine that . 
  sure , but then switzerland just won the psychological warfare , which most likely was the intention . 
  you are not going to blitzkrieg your way through a landscape where practically every hut , house or barn could lob high explosives at you . 
  you would do that very slowly and methodically , halting the invaders to a crawl . 
  the same idea that was behind torpedo and gun emplacements along the coast . 
  it 's not so much about stopping an invasion fleet , as denying them the freedom to roam as they please . 
  even the at the time 40-50 year old and almost unmanned coastal forts managed to halt the german invasion of norway enough to let the royal family and the entire cabinet escape the country . 
  of course , warfare have changed a lot , and these kinds of static systems went obsolete when gps , surveillance satellites , bunker busters and cruise missiles were developed . 
  yes , he went through the system . 
  legal hunting and sport weapons . 
  took him months of gun club membership and training though . 
  cant do much about that kind if dedication with a clean police record . 
  and nobody except you and all the other strawmen-builders in here have said anything to question that . 
  this is about crime prevention , not sentencing . 
  it 's about politics , not courtrooms . 
  and not everyone is equal under the law . 
  citizens have more rights than non-citizens . 
  as it should be . 
  obviously it 's the lack of gun laws that is the problem . 
  i mean , all the automatic weapons used in terror was registered , store bought and in compliance with the existing law , right ? 
  and exactly how is nationality random ? 
  oh , you are suggesting we just send off all spanish people to concentration camps ? 
  maybe we should have checkpoints to check their luggage for tapas . 
  tell me more on your plan of world dominance via tapdancing . 
  now tell me , how does it feel when i construct blatant strawmen in your garden ? 
  does it feel good ? 
  first off , collective punishment is your words , and yours alone . 
  secondly , as long as you refuse to keep statistics and stick your fingers in your ears and close your eyes each time stuff like this happens , you can keep telling yourself it 's only individuals . 
  that way , german does n't have a gang problem among the minority groups , and everything is swell in the universe . 
  i could n't put it better myself . 
  these are in many cases 2 . generation , some times even 3rd generation immigrants . 
  born and raised in europe . 
  going to european schools , it 's not syria that caused these people to become fanacics . 
  that 's their european home country 's fault . 
  it 's their fault for having hopelessly naive politics regarding foreign ( read : saudi ) funding of radical mosques . 
  it 's their fault for completely turning a blind eye to extremist muslim leaders and their influence , often even inviting them to speech at schools and conventions . 
  it 's their faulty for taking in more immigrants than the country can integrate , leading to high unemployment and ghettos . 
  it 's their fault for having a political climate where criticism against islam is seen as equal to racism . 
  europe have complained for decades about groups of radicals from middle eastern countries doing terrorism attacks around the world . 
  now there are thousands of europeans doing terrorism in the middle east . 
  and the first thing we do is take no responsibility what so ever . 
  well they did have 800 cars burn down in paris on new years eve . 
  that 's probably more destruction in one day than most wars . 
  like amazon gives a rats ass about refugees . 
  they got what they wanted . 
  their name in the paper , and publicity . 
  or wait , they probably care : refugees = low wage workers . 
  what a stunningly beautiful country !, 
  they just ignored almost the entire central-eastern europe ? 
  why , that is clearly the interesting part . 
  swedes are . . well . . our sensitive brothers . 
  we once got complaints about [ cardamom town ] ( http://www.newsinenglish.no/2013/01/09/cardamom-town-bad-for-children/ ) , a popular children 's story and theater play , for being right wing and extremist . 
  yeah sure . 
  when russia does it , it 's war crimes . 
  when the us does it , it is . . 
  when saudi arabia does it , it is . . 
  and where does the cluster munitions factor into anything ? 
  russia , as the us , never signed any ban on cluster munitions . 
  as such they are perfectly legal to use . 
  this is just an attempt to connect cluster munitions to war crimes , which is just not true . 
   it 's stereotype for which you have to thank gypsies . 
  some stupid people use rom ( gypsie ) and rumun ( romanian ) interchangeably as it was the same thing . 
  i do n't think average pole has something against romania , it 's just average pole does n't know much about romania and their knowledge of romania and romanian people is based on gypsies which often had romanian citizenship . 
  happened here in norway as well , after some geniuses decided our old word for `` gipsy '' was derogatory , and replaced it with `` rom '' in official and media use , which is confused of course with a person from romania . 
  i do n't think people assume the words have the same meaning , but they probably think a `` rom '' must necessarily come from romania , so the country unfairly get negative publicity . 
  this was at the same time we got a huge influx of `` rom '' beggars , thiefs etc , so lots of media attention . 
  i wonder what they will change it to now that `` rom '' carries the same stigma as `` gypsy '' . 
  since when did regulating models equate disallowing photographs of fat people ? 
  that 's like me saying the french just disallowed photographs of thin people . 
  if you ca n't see your own strawman arguments , you need some self reflection . 
  or you 're just a troll . 
  ok . let 's have overweight models need confirmation from a doctor that their weight is healthy then . 
  semantics . 
  yes ? 
  you realize france just banned models with a bmi below x , which the article is about . 
  and you ca n't fathom a ban of models with a unhealthy overweight / obese bmi ? 
  what is the difference ? 
  strawman much ? 
  at least invent something remotely close to what i said . 
  many are , then are told they are not to not hurt their feeling , or because their parent genuinely do n't see it as a problem . 
  healthy diets are formed in the childhood . 
  fat as a child often means fat as an adult . 
  fat parents often means fat children . 
  it 's really a vicious cycle . 
   it 's pretty pointless to create legislation for something that happens very very rarely . 
  if the problem is body image and not the health of models , obesity causes far , far , far , far , far , far more problems than anorexia . 
  we should fight tooth and nail against normalization of obesity , including banning fat models . 
  in short , the us is a nation state , europe is not . 
  stop pretending it is . 
  sacrifice europe ? 
  europe is a collection of nation states . 
  not a federation . 
  no matter what some people seem to think . 
   do n't project your own view as the only relevant view . 
  when refugees came to my hometown volunteers streamed in to help them and give them basic things like old jackets . 
  since when did asylum seeker mean refugee ?

  i love 'em , just like the chewing gum question they are oddly great . 
   the profile of typical euroskeptics : voters for the populist right , poor , and low education . 
  no wonder i see less and less people being honest about having non pro-eu feelings on reddit if doing it paints you in this light in the eyes of others . 
  people that move tend to be people that do it to become famous . 
  all other reasons i can think of can fit any nation so do n't think they really answer your question . 
  so i imagine it 's probably how people view people that move to hollywood . 
  no one really knows . 
  not really . 
  we were players on the world stage back then . 
  now we are just pawns . 
  the 1200 's . 
  we had lots of land , growing culture , foreign trade , economic and political power . 
  a central government with a king . 
  then it all went away as the black plague came and ruined shit, 
  my first through it no because there are waaay too many issues that would cause the deal to break down and if they ordered us to do it or `` face consequences '' i highly doubt the deal would be anything close to fair . 
  transportation security administration the people doing the security checks at airports in the us . 
  norwegians . 
  komler ( potato dumplings ) we call them here but they are called all sorts of things depending on what region you are in , they are also made differently and what you eat as a side dishes differs . 
  for desert i like lefser ( soft flat bread with butter sugar and cinnamon on . 
  when you ask about europe are you looking at it as a whole , the eu region or some other way ? 
  i 'm positive as we ( norway ) are going away from oil and focusing on other things instead at a much more rapid pace than would happen if the oil flooding the market would n't have happened . 
  he 's a bit of a troll or something i think . 
  his other threads from about a week ago were similar to this so i do n't take much faith in what he says . 
  just sucks i did n't remember him sooner . 
  thanks for correcting and telling how it 's done though . 
  remembered name of op went to see if it was who i though it was from older threads . 
  no pennies will ever drop . 
  nope , do n't know enough about the constitutional changing system of the us to have such ideas . 
  people in power would mean the people that could actually do something and i do n't know the name of the governing body responsible for that so therefor `` people in power '' . 
  for the better ? 
  no , probably not, 
  it should be changed , but i would n't trust people in power to change it for the better . 
  interpret it as outdated language and concepts not applicable in this time . . 
  i 've seen both sides argument and both seem to be extremes suggesting things that wo n't or is n't working . 
  ever closer co-operation sure . 
  superstate no . 
  i do n't even want to be in the eec but that 's not really controversial in the eu question . 
  it 's a bad deal that politicians like because it brings us closer to the eu ( because actually getting into the eu ai n't happening any time soon ) so it wo n't get voted on any time soon . 
  wo n't find many euro sceptics in that sub so not sure it will be representative . 
  if you are you end up feeling driven away if you 're not pro eu . 
  i 'm suprised at no 1397 , 1524 and 793 . 
  yes , from first grade ( 6 ) and onwards . 
  terry pratchett . 
  i do n't like my own language so reading local authors so to speak is n't big on my list . 
  i wo n't be reading them in english either as if i am going to read their stuff i 'm going to do them the service of reading them in the language they wrote in . 
  do n't learn american history so nothing . 
  the few american history things that are mentioned are the revolution side by side with the french revolution ( the major topic being age of enlightenment ) and ww2 nuke things ( the major topic being ww2 ), 
  apart for walking busses i would guess . 
   was all that extra energy and money spent on trying to make western europe like us a waste ? 
  are you refering to the marshal plan because if you look at the long title of that plan you see it 's not some purely altruistic motive behind it . 
  if not , what money are you referring to ? 
  personally no i do n't hate americans . 
  not going to hate someone for being born somewhere or somehow . 
  the government on the other hand i got very little love for . 
  i know who poe and twain are same goes for the other authors , maybe read a few books of some of them too , but that is it . 
  im not from an anglo nation thought so my english classes was used to make us better at english not learning its literary history and writers . 
  that we did in norwegian classes alonh with learning the history of the language , different types of writing and how to do those ourselves . 
  my taxes were all done by the government and was online . 
  i just logged onnand checked if they looked ok then logged out again . 
  i didnt have anything to add . 
  companies probably have folks to do it thought as there is a bit more to it for them . 
  it was a sign of danish oppression , can you really blame us for using aa instead for a while after ? 
  bokm\u00e5l ( based on danish ) and nynorsk ( based on dialects ) . 
  both separate from spoken norwegian . 
  there is no standard to that mess , more general dialect differences . 
  i know , we got two written forms for norwegian because of that whole situation . 
  i 'm pro standards though and so far this is one us scandies should use seeing how it 's the majority atm, 
  really depends on who you ask . 
  do we go against the danish for being a weird flat country without wilderness or mountains or do we go against sweden for not fully accepting the glory that is \u00c6 \u00d8 and \u00c5 . 
  or are both horrible for being eu members or both great for giving us lego and minecraft ? 
  who knows ? 
  all i know is that my reasons are shallow and change depending on whatever random way we feel like at that moment in time . 
  we blindly accept it because we never consider being a fan goes beyond the music . 
  in a lot of cases the popstar do n't even write their own songs so there is limits to how much you could like about a singer . 
  a world leader however does a lot , their actions go beyond signing , you can show to where their actions changed the course of a major event or an entire country . 
  you will never see taylor swift become `` the singer that helped broker a nuclear deal '' or `` the drone strike popstar '' . 
  why are you a fan of him ? 
  local patriotism is a thing but i think most consider themself to be norwegian first then regional . 
  `` the neighbour region sucks , we the best because we are n't the neighbour region '' works from small towns to country level but it 's a joke thing so do n't put too much thought into it . 
  all would support the neighbour if their own team did n't make it . 
  joke patriotism i guess you could call it ? 
  car , house and stuff in your house are the ones i have . 
  in 1925 the total estimated amount of wood in norway was 300 million m ^ 3 these days it 's at around 900million m ^ 3 growing by an estimated 15million m ^ 3 a year . 
  they did some planting in the 1960s , 100million spruce a year . 
  even with this scientists ca n't explain the massive growth of spruce , pine and leaf trees . 
  [ here is a chart ] ( http://forskning.no/sites/forskning.no/files/styles/large/public/skogvekst_0.jpg?itok=wd83tajf ) gran = spruce , furu = pine , lauvtrer = leaf trees . 
  year at the bottom and mass in m ^ 3 on the side . 
  only when mentioned on reddit . 
  all metric at my job , could n't find a single imperial one . 
  maybe some of the old ones in the assorted screws are imperial but nothing besides that . 
  are they made the american way or is the recipe different when sold outside the us ? 
  my dads grandparent is the furthest i know and i probably only know of him because my dad met him and mentioned him once . 
  i know one of my cousins invited me to some family tree thing on facebook once but never bothered to read it . 
  honestly i do n't care about my ancestors . 
  ancestry does n't matter unless it 's some medical relevant thing . 
  i have a friend that wondered but that was mostly because he wondered where his uncommon last name came from , not what his ancestry was . 
  even in some cities there are areas that just look like shit while others look great but is n't the whole point of traveling to see all of these different things ? 
  well there 's your problem . 
  right now ? 
  lacking money and a job to stay anywhere .

it wo n't be here forever . 
  soon different issues will take over . 
  thanks mr merkal, 
  they mayor in norwegian communes does n't have any real power . 
  he/she 's essentially there to be a rallying figure for the council and has no real veto rights over anything . 
  therefore it 's often given to smaller coalition parties as a gesture . 
  still better than industrialized factory farming . 
  at least these animals have seen the sun . 
  you think the average cow has a fair chance of escaping as it 's fed into the meat grinder ? 
  i think these people are n't punished because they 're killing animals but because they 're bold enough to do it out in the open . 
  as long as you hide it behind thick industrial steel walls you 're okay . 
  can we please all agree that you 're no longer a refugee when the country with the 7th highest gdp in the world is n't good enough for you ? 
  like , could n't they just stay in sweden and then go visit their families in norway or finland ? 
  it 's not far , you do n't even need a visa . 
  the bus is like $ 20 . 
  to get a train to finland you have to go all the way around the gulf of bothnia . 
  or through like latvia and st. petersburg and shit . 
  you'er evil , sweden . 
  evil !!, 
   their job of making themselves feel good was accomplished . 
  this is ignorant , you 're forgetting about the other really important job they did making people who did n't want to hold signs feel bad, 
  nah , they 're the loudest like it or not , `` white girl problems '' is essentially synonymous with feminism these days . 
  it 's a joke . 
   just a heads up , euro truck simulator ( scs software ) is czech and farming simulator ( giant software ) is swiss . 
  my entire life has been a lie, 
  because they are in spain . 
  just because english is the lingua franca of our time does n't mean the english should get off easy when living abroad . 
  what if they decide to stay there and have kids ? 
  mate ... do n't even ... there 's no use, 
  you 're right that high income individuals can also be against immigration . 
  that 's no big secret . 
  i 'm not talking about them . 
  my point is that those who are for are generally not those who will have to deal with the negative consequences . 
  if they do they have the means to fairly easily avoid it . 
  in the report you posted ( fig 10 ) it 's stated that people in low income brackets are worried about competition in the labour market while those in high income brackets are not . 
   you realise anti-immigration sentiment is far higher in areas where there 's none at all , right ? 
  generally working class ethnic nationals ( `` chavs '' in britspeak ) are very against immigration because they will be hit the hardest by immigration , will have to face lower wages , and have the fewest resources to deal with it . 
  upper middle class white people love immigration because supporting it makes them look progressive , they generally do n't compete directly with immigrants for work , and when their neighbourhood goes south they can just pack up their bags and move somewhere else , no big deal being pro immigration is extremely bourgeoisie, 
  shit is going down !, 
  the brits have fired off their angry letters !, 
  malaysia , a country that 's about as far from syria as the uk in terms of both culture and geography , takes in even fewer . 
  man ... we have it pretty good do n't we . 
   i obviously do n't know the exact numbers . 
  but generally , the regions were sd are the most popular are small towns , villages or the countryside in general , often with very few immigrants . 
  i do n't know if you 've seen what can happen to lower middle class/poor proletarian small towns when a country gets high immigration . 
  those people are rightfully worried about their way of life . 
  the fact that you just want to ignore sweden 's rural proletariat is classist as hell , though i 'm not surprised because that is typical swedish . 
  on the one hand journalists should n't get arrested but on the other hand , it was a vice reporter ... 
  thank you hitler !, 
   the president then ( benes ) xd, 
  well you 'd be correct if you think i only wanted this in eastern european countries , but i 'm just as sad when buildings are powerwashed in london , new york , or in my own country . 
  i get your point though , but i hope you do n't get too eager to distance yourself from your recent history as you might lose something in the process . 
  if it 's worth anything , i do n't think about communism when i see the first photo , i think about the culture that preceded it , back when budapest was a part of the austrio-hungarian empire . 
  it probably would have looked similar back then . 
  i 'd rather compare it to wine . 
  that slight degradation is something that 's impossible to buy instantly with money . 
  it takes 50-60 years to achieve . 
  it 's literally impossible to replicate , at least you wo n't get the same effect . 
  why is a building supposedly better when it 's brand new ? 
  why is a bright shiny surface better than a gritty textured one with 60-100 years of history ? 
  like it or not , but former glory * is * budapest 's charm , at least in terms of architecture . 
  it 's what sets it apart from places like paris . 
  without those old buildings you 'd have a lot less . 
  if you make it look like a shiny disneyland it 'll look about as distinguished as the cities that were bombed in ww2 only to be rebuilt . 
  i think it 's great that the faroe islands are being open about what consuming meat actually entails . 
  much more brave than hiding it behind industrial steel walls , which is what scotland does . 
  seth rogen, 
  looked better before . 
  part of the charm with budapest is that the buildings actually look old . 
  it 's a shame you 're powerwashing away the thing that makes your city unique . 
  soon it will look like any other dull european city . 
  they found it a bit creepy just how welcoming the swedes were and figured they 'd rather go to the uk where at least they 're treated as equals . 
  lol found the butthurt guy, 
  they do n't conflict with it , they are alternative courses of action that benefit people in other countries while not hurting us in any significant way . 
  i 'm trying to have an actual discussion here , if you 're just going to resort to straw-men and caricatures i 'm not going to reply any more . 
   `` help them where they are '' that 's one of many possible solutions . 
  another is for norway to stop producing weapons and arms . 
  another is to invest in third world countries . 
  another is to apply pressure on foreign governments . 
  another is to spend some of our oil money on new technology and to enter into partnerships with developing nations . 
  there are literally a billion ways to help countries and people which are having a tough time . 
   i think you have a very pesimistic view about it , and even if we cant help it , we should not embrace the differences . 
  it 's not pessimistic , it 's realistic . 
   the whole point is to help people in need , and i cant think of anything better to base politics on . 
  if that is indeed the whole point , there are many ways to go about doing that that maximizes benefits towards those we are helping , while minimizing negative effects on us . 
  it 's just so satisfying to watch sweden tear itself apart . 
  so many people are so butthurt about a party that reflects a perfectly acceptable opinion that 20 % of the country holds . 
  `` ghasp , democracy at work ! '', 
  i do hope you stop before actual civil war breaks out though . 
  all politics are about scoring points with certain demographics, 
  it 's not a big secret that having lots of different people living together in one country causes cultural and racial antagonism . 
  people seem to think that good intentions , integration and campaigns against racism can stop this , but it ca n't . 
  no matter how hard we try , we will always end up with a racialized class system . 
  there is literally not a single multi-ethnic country where this has not happened . 
  people are inherently favourable towards those of their own group and one group will come out on top . 
  hell , in norway people from the north and south can hardly get along , how are we going to manage a 50/50 ethnic norwegian/immigrant population ? 
  you 're naive if you think that 's going to work , especially once norway 's gilded economic age inevitably comes to an end . 
  it 's causing our country a wealth of future problems for short term economic gains ( cheap labour ) and short term emotional gains ( look how good and kind i 'm being ) . 
  i 'm not saying that no immigration should happen , but if anything it should be highly controlled , and highly mixed so as to avoid large separate ethnic groups . 
  it 's possible to be against immigration without being a racist nor a bigot .

refugees will also be using health and social welfare from local authorities , correct ? 
  and east asians . 
  being half japanese it is assumed we will do well and excel . 
  immigranten from the middle east and africa get special programs , native language educators to help them learn the language and special programs . 
  but if they still perform poorly it is execused . 
  if a poor white person or east asian performs poorly it is blamed on them for not trying hard enough . 
  sounds good . 
  it is quite obvious none of them are convinced by humanitarian ideals . 
  the humanitarian approach did not work with former gitmo detainees who have been committing regular terror attacks around the globe . 
  great . 
  to bad that is not applied . 
  instead these people are only persecuted when it can be proven they committed crimes . 
  many returning isis fighters are free in germany today . 
  `` it will take time , '' as in forever . 
  india has had a muslim minority for centuries yet still experiences muslim - hindu riots . 
  it is just european hubris to assume we can do what india and china could not . 
  another no borders activist . 
  denying entry to any country is not oppression when applied to non citizens . 
  every country has the right to decide who will enter there . 
  if this had been enforced in europe over one hundred people would still be alive in paris . 
  but for us citizens trump supports freedom of worship beyond what many liberals in europe allow , for example where the wearing of hijab is banned , yet you will not call those leaders facists . 
  even more bizarrely you seem not to even be aware that we ( the west ) are already bombing in iraq and syria . 
  the difference is that trump wants to work with assad and bring the war to a quick end , unlike sanders and clinton who support the farcical idea of moderate islamists winning syria against assad . 
  that is simply a rehashed neocon interventionist idea that everything would be fine if they just have democracy ( in other words if assad were gone ) . 
  it is really bizarre to now hear leftist use this reasoning . 
  as to `` uneducated fears '' , that is just an empty talking point . . but trump has the honesty to talk about the problems we already have with middle eastern immigrants forming parallel societies , supporting terrorism , honor killing and having terrible employment outcomes even after generations . 
  if we as scandinavians have this bad result how could the us with its smaller social services , worse schools have a better outcome ? 
  pointing that out is not fear mongering or facist it is honest . 
  the people who deny these problems are the ones who pave the road to facism , surveillance and so because these are the unavoidable results of a society split along ethnic and religious lines . 
  europe is heading quickly in that direction , germany has prisons where 30 % of those are foreign born and the prison population is exploding , the same here in norway where we have a 35 % growth in prisoners since 2000 . 
  do you mean hillary or sanders ? 
  both of them supported the libya resolution which was understood to be the lead up to military action there . 
  both of them also want to secretely intervene in a civil war to help the guys they like . 
  on the other hand there is a relatively pacifist donald trump who seeks less foreign intervention ... so i assume by fascist you must mean sanders , clinton ? 
  why would an immigrant be proud of being swedish when swedes are not proud of being swedish ? 
  when the leaders of sweden make statements like `` sweden has no culture '' why would a foreigner feel any value of joining it ? 
  it 's 2016 people , if people want to fight with bulls then give them the freedom to do so !, 
  what kind of nonsense is this ? 
  we eat animals that are raised in farms and then slaughtered for us , but fighting with them is too cruel ? 
  either ban all animal slaughter completely or let the bull fighting continue l . if i were a bull i would love to fight with people . 
  no . . the headline reads that they are actually paid in `` bitcoin news '' so i think they get printouts of news articles about bitcoin . 
  when i say left wing i am not going by your definition , but if you prefer i will instead say left of center . 
  green parties and parties like die linke favor liberal immigration policies . 
  majorities in every country where i have seen a poll want less immigration and more selective immigration , including germany and the uk . 
  that 's not to say it 's black and white , indeed some want zero , others just want less , others just want better immigrants . 
  yet instead of addressing this left of center parties waste their breath accusing these voters of racism . 
  ultimately , if you can not see that the current european refugee and immigration policy has created cultural and religious conflict i do n't know what to say . 
  for example : what else do you call a crowd of protesters wearing islamic garb saying `` british police go to hell '' ? 
  what were the paris attacks ? 
  right wing parties do not cause tensions and hatreds like these , they point them out . 
   i 've lived in norway my whole life and i 've never heard of anyone being taken away from their parents . 
  i lived for four years in usa to study and never saw any black people abused by the police . 
  i never saw anyone get shot . 
  i never even heard a gun shot , not one . 
  does that mean anything ? 
  as opposed to left wing parties that oppose nuclear power or genetically modified good ? 
  both sides have their own peculiar hostility to science . 
   politicians already know that the best way to control the working class is to divide them by overplaying ethnic and religious differences so they 're just going to keep doing that . 
  so why do many left wing parties insist on creating the conditions for ethnic and religious conflict ? 
  surely putting groups of people together who you know will be in conflict with each other it is not surprising when there is conflict ? 
  so i guess it is actually the right wing that wants to avoid conflict ... 
  this is an endless discussion that avoids what voters want : an end to unqualified immigration . 
  the problem is if it is reduced to this topic you lose , so you try to confuse it with all this bs about race and class . 
  oddly enough the left could win if they just come down firmly in favor of selective immigration and get back to domestic political issues . 
  more `` white van '' types ... usually with an english flag hanging from their balcony . 
  the question is , if they are spending their weekends putting down pints and shop at a pound shop , exactly why are they proud of being english ? 
  also you say recent years ... you must be older because i think anything before 2000 is old history . 
  that 's when the us rate started dropping . 
  the us rate has been dropping for a decade , our has been experienced rapid growth and more than 35 % are foreign born in prison but less than 15 % of our population is foreign born . 
  there are no statistics on prisons in norway by race but from the documentary i have seen on tv it seems about 20 % of those in prison here are african . 
  so a similar rate to the us when you consider how few are in norway . 
  so we have i think a similar race problem , we just cover it up . 
  the fact that we have less people in prison as a total rate is just that we have a small criminal under class . 
  but it grows quickly and europe as a whole is converging with america . 
  say what you want , but our prison population has grown 45 % in the last fifteen years . 
  more than a third of those in prison are foreign born . 
  how long can we continue with this `` humane '' system ? 
  our system is well on its way to dying . 
  our prison population grew 45 % since 2000 and 35 % of those in prison are foreign born . 
  the courts here are also overloaded and trials take too long , 26.3 % of those in prison are pre-trial detainees . 
  do n't worry . 
  we will have similar prisons in a few decades . 
  treating prisoners nicely is a luxury you can afford when you have low crime rates . 
  as we deal with more and more people who are totally alienated from our northern european societies and have hundreds of people for whom prison is a revolving door , committing rape and similar crimes a few years after release europeans will demand the same . 
  already with breivik the calls for stricter punishments are growing louder . 
  that 's one incident . 
  one . 
  a decade ago we were lecturing america on how we know how to deal with different races and how we will not suffer from racism as they do . 
  that 's mostly gone . 
  now we are down to moral superiority about how bad their prison system is . 
  that will go to . 
  the us has its current prison system because the situation lead to it , not because americans are sick people who love senseless punishment . 
   inaccurate . 
  nope . 
  states are allowed to restrict freedom of movement of asylum seekers for reasons of national security and safety . 
  germany did so until 2014 . 
  until the end of the year 2014 , freedom of movement of asylum seekers was restricted by the so-called `` residence obligation '' for asylum seekers ( legally called `` geographical restriction '' ) . 
  section 56 of the asylum act stipulated that asylum seekers ' residence permits ( aufenthaltsgestattung ) should be limited to the town or district in which their place of accommodation was located . 
  they had to apply for permission from the authorities whenever they wanted to travel to another region .

  thanks , i listened to it on my return commute today . 
  much appreciated . 
  thanks , this is exactly what i 'm looking for . 
  nobody understand danish . 
  yes they are . 
  and to suggest anything else is politicial , professional and social sucide . 
   i think that it is unacceptable for us women to be recommended to decrease the extent of our space in society and not move completely free . 
  the recommendation should be aimed at the men , who should be told to behave . 
  see this is utterly retarded . 
  there is more than a recommendation in place that men do not assault women . 
  there is a system of law and order and enforcement in place to prevent and punish such actions . 
  the problem however , is that there are people refusing to follow these laws . 
  i 'd wager that any recommendation will fall short of altering their behavior when the full force of the law is unable to do so . 
  the problem in sweden is made in part by fucking imbeciles like this making arguments that are based in moral and rhetoric and semantics , instead of honestly assessing a situation and make judgments on fact , statistics and actual events . 
  i applaud sweden for being willing to take in refugees . 
  it 's a great initiative . 
  but the situation has become absurd . 
  still today , the swedish public refuse to classify any of the people coming as migrants , because that 's the `` wrong position '' . 
  all the while 100.000 of thousands of syrians and other people coming from actual war zones , in need of protection , are being shut out because europe is swamped in economic migrants . 
  the denial and the insanity of the swedish left are directly contributing to a humanitarian disaster , and the collapse of law and order in sweden . 
  `` a dangerous area in \u00d6stersund '' . 
  something is seriously fucked up in the state of sweden when that sentence is not said sarcastically . 
  your comment is pure catch 22 . 
  let it go . 
  so considering you are a country that cut down just about all your forest , you did n't cut down that much ? 
  you are not making any sense . 
  that has no context to your previous statement . 
  and that 's hardly anything to celebrate . 
  3 % natural forest is still just 3 % . 
  that 's 3 parts of 100 . 
  no matter how you turn that , it 's a low number . 
  and to be clear , the only reason this number is as high as it is is because most of these 3 percents are low productivity mountain birch . 
  sweden has a huge potential for improvement when it comes to protecting natural habitats , and the same goes for the rest of europe as well . 
  yes that 's absolutely correct . 
  i 'm not sure what that means ? 
  this is the same for sweden . 
  the only proper old growth ( not natural forest ) is low productivity forest at higher altitudes . 
  mostly it 's mountain birch , which has no economic value . 
  thank you . 
  always appreciate constructive criticism . 
  the 3 % you are referring to is not old growth , is `` natural forest '' which is not really the same thing . 
  and yes in the context of europe that has been mostly deforested it 's at least more than the average , but that 's not really saying a lot . 
  it 's not doom and gloom , it 's a simple observation , if perhaps a bit sentimental . 
  i would have loved to walk though the ancient temperate forests of europe during the warm periods of the middle-ages . 
  i 'm not shy about wanting them back , but not at the cost of our well being . 
  i think one day technical advances will allow us to let the monoculture revert back to natural forests and landscapes . 
  that would be absolutely fucking awesome . 
  the farms being abandoned are in large subsistence farms in the coastal and mountain landscapes , and norway being a modern economy , a rather affluent one at that , life as a subsistence farmer is less attractive . 
  norway 's cultured landscape is not being covered by forest because the farmers are destitute , rather the opposite . 
  edit : just adding . 
  go to google maps and zoom out and look at europe . 
  just about all of it where covered in forest not long ago . 
  the forests have been cleared and given way to gigantic mono cultured landscapes that feed us and our livestock . 
  that some small parts of europe ( where modern farming is not even viable ) get to return to a natural state is not exactly a tragedy . 
  [ it 's super not made up . 
  it 's a fact . 
  ] ( https://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/skog_i_sverige ) natural forest and old forests are home to far more species than cultured forests . 
  the bulk of swedens forests are less than 100 years old and mostly comprises fast growing species of pine and spruce . 
  edit : as per request . 
  i think it 's absolutely amazing , it 's very good for biodiversity . 
  and in chosing a view between mono-cultured landscapes and lush mixed forests , i 'd take forest any day . 
  to be honest neither do you as something like 97 % of sweden forests are part of a cultured landscape . 
  3 percent is natural forest , and old growth forest is almost non existent . 
  i think we eat more . 
  [ `` spagetti og kj\u00f8ttdeig '' ] ( http://www.superkokken.no/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/dsc_0846-i-blogg-spaghetti-al-rag%c3%ba.jpg ) is basically our national dish . 
  it 's kinda like a shitty take on spaghetti bolognese . 
  this is in a suburb to the city of harstad , and as a suburb/small town at least in northern norway this is extremely typical . 
  [ this type of house ] ( https://www.google.se/maps/@68.7450461,16.5445267,3a,75y,291h,81.06t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sbnjlbt1u1w9kdtk6xv34ca!2e0!7i13312!8i6656 ) that you see here is called a `` husbank hus `` and they where built in droves in the 70ies and 80ies . 
  basically it 's a form of subsidized mortgage from the [ norwegian housing bank ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/norwegian_state_housing_bank ) , and you pick the house you want to build from a catalog with some variety in size and shape , but the basic design is unmistakable . 
  earlier more traditional type of farm or village houses [ looks like this ] ( https://www.google.se/maps/@69.0383813,17.4781476,3a,75y,113.73h,79.55t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1svgksbwo7bblrcy2nqnsfuq!2e0!7i13312!8i6656 ) i do n't know if all this holds true for all of norway , but drive through the northern norwegian countryside these two will be an extremely common sight . 
  my ( admittedly poor ) attempt at a direct translation . 
  svartvanns might be better . 
  the description of the video said the bus was heading to the nearby school ( s\u00f8rvik skole ) . 
  the video shows there being guardrails on both side of the road and you can also see trees on right , so it 's fair to assume its along the coast and its heading north . 
  the positive id is finding the bridge ( you can see the railings in the video ) and then the speed sign follow by the destination marker . 
  as long as we are showing off our google streetview skills , i 'm pretty sure [ this is stretch of road ] ( https://www.google.se/maps/@68.68231,16.5399936,3a,75y,326.57h,74.6t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sekts-evk2kjg_opzsgo-dq!2e0!7i13312!8i6656!6m1!1e1 ) where the crash happened . 
  the video starts right before the bridge and the moose runs out just between the speed limit sight and the destination signs . 
  translation : children : moose !, 
  look the moose !, 
  driver : yes there he was !, 
  children : and there too !, 
  * crash * driver : devils roasted hell !!, 
  this ... 8/10 have no identification papers . 
  keeping that in mind it 's absolutely bizarre to read these kind of statistics over and over again . 
  so and so many from syria , so and so many are under 18 . 
  granted that everyone from syria and under 18 's are more or less guaranteed asylum ( in sweden ) , i find it more than a little naive to assume that the stated age and nationality of all these persons are correct . 
  actually , in my experience it 's pretty easy to make friends with finns . 
  i mean there is a culture for directness , so if you engage with a finn , you tend to form a real friendship . 
  sweden has a culture for the exact opposite . 
  if he where to drive a motorcycle though , he would at least have the helmet part already covered . 
  i have to ask . 
  what they fuck is up with his hair ? 
  the pm has that look of confusion and resignation my dog gets when she is realizing that she is getting a bath . 
  sweden alone had 80k in november . 
  does not make a lot of sense in context of `` european '' terminology . 
  liberalism in european context usually points to economic liberalism or neoliberalism . 
  a political ideology often associated with margaret thatcher and ronald reagan . 
  most political organizations in europe saying they are liberal are economical liberalists , i.e free market proponents ( and often socially conservative ) . 
  i think at some stage you have to assume that a national paper has real sources , even if it can not name them . 
  i dont understand why this was removed .

  since the state now finally after 3 sessions was safe from imminent annexation , the country could be stabilized , and furthermore we now had the time to both embrace the renaissanse and begin colonizing our backyard . 
  we ended the session with manilla being colonized , having +1 stability and last but not least by having catched up in administrative and military technology . 
  * kutai , like a fledgling empire looks outside it 's borders , and outside it 's borders . 
  a storm is brewing to the north-west . 
  will the peace prevail , [ or has kutaian diplomacy again made for a righteous new coalition ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfum5xhuy4m ) ? 
  peace in our time !, 
  kutai brings good news , and wish to inform all that we 've reached a thorough agreement with malacca . 
  diplomacy prevails once again !, 
  ### kutai - the sultan of borneo and it 's dependencies we started the game in a much better position than in the last session , however we were now faced by a greater threat that could spell the end of our nation . 
  i was not uninformed in the choices i made in the last session . 
  i had made my ally malacca so powerfull that he now was 2 provinces away from forming the kingdom of malaya . 
  this would give him permanent claims on all my lands , which was unacceptable without a doubt . 
  the sultan called for a coalition to stop this threat from spiraling out of controll . 
  with the silver tongue of my diplomats , i convinced malaccas allies of the just cause we were fighting , and *** they agreed to abandon the alliances to preserve the balance of power in indonesia . 
  *** close to the end of the session , we began the assault on malacca , our military readiness was far from perfect , but we had no choice ( it was now or he could pick us off one by one as some of us were rivals ) . 
  due to delays and diplomatic incidents the invasion was seen long coming . 
  however , what he might not have expected was the sheer number of carracks that we had massed together . 
  this gave us an early dominance of the seas . 
  on the other hand on land , the resistance was though , and he managed to fend off our first assault on his forts . 
  however , we are slowly making gains all around . 
  which means that in time , he will have no choice but to surrender . 
  due to the embarrasing defeat at our first assault . 
  the sultan has decided that it 's time to mobilize our forces to make sure that our future assaults wo n't go the same way as our first . 
  at the end of the session , the war was still undecided . 
  the coalition will make mediocre demands on malacca , to reinstate the balance of power in the region . 
  if we did n't intervene , we could have risked the possibility that we ca n't contain this threat in the future . 
  [ how i expected the coalition to go down . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0gw0vnr9yc ) [ what actually happened . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqdxp2m79n8 ) new dependencies of kutai : during this session , the sultan annexed the spice islands of ternate and tidore , integrated the nation of makassar , and finally the nation of buton . 
  #kutai , the true king of borneo * ## aar day 1 what are my goals for this campaign ? 
  to preserve the balance of power in indonesia , going the diplomatic route . 
  however , show of force may be used in dire situations . 
  i started off in a pretty bad spot , and was faced with the choice of blitzing brunei before they were coming for me . 
  without allies i blitzed brunei with `` the no cb '' and made peace with his allies in a brute show of force . 
  i secured royal marriages with my player neighbours , to make sure i would n't get coalitioned after annexing brunei . 
  my country was now in heavy debt , and my stability was down the drainer . 
  due to the high risk of revolt , our prestige was used to convert to sunni . 
  at the second session , kutai was in a very weakened position . 
  the economy made it impossible for me to have more than 6k soldiers without taking more loands . 
  i was stagnating and facing further recession when majapahit , my rival to the south threatened my eastern frontier by advancing into makassar ( giving them the option to fabricate claims on us , with a bigger fleet , and 14k troops ) . 
  fortunately for me , majapahit made the mistake of landing all his forces in makassar . 
  with shrewd diplomacy , i united my fleets with malacca to seize control of his island . 
  all of majapahits forces where on makasar , which meant i now could secure makassar , money and war reparations to fund my next session . 
  it was not my intention to damage majapahit more than necesarry , and kutai 's intentions are only to preserve it 's own territorial integrity ( we must seize the means of a safe expansion ! ) . 
  kutai 's future now looks promising , but the no cb 's have come at a cost , our stability is at -3 , and the corruption from devaluating the currency will have it 's cost on our power points . 
  we started the game in with a militaristic approach , but it was deemed necesarry to secure our survival for the next session . 
  our intention will always be diplomacy and colonialism . 
  in the next session we do not intend to conduct war , unless forced . 
  ** here are the two most important events for those who want the visual context of what kutai did : ** the brunei blitz : https://clips.twitch.tv/magniveke/famousruffstrawbeary how we beat majapahit : https://clips.twitch.tv/magniveke/blushinglapwingosfrog * additional islands may apply . 
  there 's only room for 1 nation on this island . 
  sound quite savage to me . 
  england : visualized [ operation ` thunderstruck ' ] ( https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/344793454804729856/344919668609253387/unknown.png ) orchestrated in part by me . 
  together with france , we initiated the great war . 
  we were the first to revolt against the ottoman tyrrany , demolishing their navy at the seas , while chasing the moorish scum out of the christian lands in iberia . 
  once the world got hold of the great war england-france vs morocco-ottomans-georgia-muscovy . 
  the commonwealth rallied their alliance and struck the ottomans in the just cause of saving the persecuted christian minorities in the balkans . 
  matters where made worse when the proud ottoman sultan , who refused to negotiate with the perfidious albion . 
  got hold that the timurids saw this as an elegant oppurtunity to regain it 's cores . 
  after 11 years of constant fighting . 
  the ottoman alliance collapsed . 
  having lost on all three fronts . 
  now remains the question : * what happens next ? 
  * king richard iii ` the second lionheart ' passed away after a period of illness , long live the king !, 
  king william ` the great conqueror ' has ascended to the throne . 
  long may he reign !, 
  it 's quite disturbing . 
  i got news while my country was in chaos at -3 stab , to suffer a stab hit for my ruler to trip on his sword , or accidentally fall and kill my heir instead . 
  i chose the former . 
  henry was a 1-2-2 , richard is a 5-6-2 . 
  we deny any allegations of murder . 
  england in this session we 've made amends with the french , and united our banners to create the western alliance . 
  it came at the expense of burgundy and castille , but sacrifices have to be made to ensure our own survival . 
  once we heard word of the turkish betrayal of their loyal ally timurids , we were quick to rally france and the knights to our cause , where we valiantly fought the saracen scum untill the treacherous bankers at home forced us to pull out . 
  king william iii died of a heart attack soon after the news of the white peace , followed by king henry v taking over the throne . 
  henry v , like henry iv was n't celebrated for his long reign . 
  the nation faced bankruptcy due to william 's lavish spending to root out corruption caused by the 100 years war . 
  after tripping an falling on his own sword , henry died , leaving 3 stab wounds to the chest and the new king richard iii ` the second lionheart ' . 
  henry 's reign had caused chaos , and now richard faces bankruptcy , the saracens , whom for the third time have invaded iberia and the saboteurs are revolting in the north . 
  [ it 's time for richard to make england ready for war . 
  yes , the eu4 multiplayer netcode is much more suited for this . 
  #england : - get called in by portugal to defend vs morocco - do n't get land because castille blackmails portugal . 
  - side with france to prove to castille that blackmailing my allies is unacceptable . 
  - get called a traitor and a backstabber followed by the castillian player tag switching after losing the war . 
  - europe goes bananas that france is huge . 
  - rival france and not cede my mainland provinces to stay strong and not give in to the big blue blob . 
  now france is confused , europe doese n't care , and i 'm confused what people expect me to do . 
   calls me out for conspiring against him pre-game . 
   followed up by him admitting he was planning to do the same . 
  sure , no problem !, 
  b-but my daily karma-trains !, 
   if we ca n't split the playerbase over the entire world , we risk ending up with a vast part of the world being `` free development '' for few players . 
  there are a bunch of arguments for and against , we change our rules between campaigns to test what works or not . 
  we previously had lithuania unbanned , which made it challenging for poland to survive and be a competetive eastern european power vs the hre/ottomans/muscovy . 
  we might revoke this rule later on . 
  but currently it stays this way . 
  i 'm sorry if this comes as an inconvenience to your potential plans . 
  because then we go past your bedtime . 
  after consulting with the lithuanians home and abroad , we simply lacked the potato batteries to let someone steer the magnificent duchy of lithuania . 
  in all seriousness , the faq at the bottom of the rules explains why . 
  [ `` the million crowns toilet '' .

  it 's known for large suburban areas with big houses owned by well off families . 
  stereotypically speaking they are snobs and the children that grow up there are extremeley spoiled . 
  it 's not technically in oslo so i included it but its sorta cheating i guess as its so close . 
  the number of upside down roofs on top of your letters is too damn high !, 
  pretty nice and clean . 
  i never take a dump on a public toilet no matter where i am but you would probably be fine doing it here in most places , i just have a policy that i do n't . 
  well , [ bouvet island ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bouvet_island ) is the most remote island in the world , and no one lives there . 
  1700km from closest land . 
  i win :p, 
  on [ finnmarksvidda ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/finnmarksvidda ) you can probably be 50-60km from the nearest settlements . 
  i drove through parts of this summer and it 's insanely remote . 
  literally drove for about 120km and passed through 1 village only . 
  yeah the jew clause was pretty embarrassing but apart from that it was pretty progressive . 
  na : canada sa : idk , chile or uruguay perhaps europe : norway africa : namibia maybe ? 
  asia : japan oceania : new zealand, 
  i 've actually been suprised every time i 've been in germany of how bad they are at speaking english . 
  they 're not often talked about in the discussion of having the worst speakers but i must say they 're far under the level i imagined they would be at . 
  still above france and spanish but hardly by that big of a margin imo . 
  49kr nok $ 6.17 usd $ 5.29 eur in other words , too damn expensive . 
  yeah true . 
  our 1814 constitution was one of the most modern and progressive constitutions at the time it was written . 
  retarded just because it 's not the case in your country ? 
  not like the difference is very big anyway , criminal responsibility age is 15 , the same as the whole nordics . 
  in your country maybe ? 
  does n't mean that is the case everywhere . 
  in norway you literally ca n't be punished for any crime when you 're 14 , because you 're not responsible . 
  in my country that 's not the case . 
  here a 14 year old is not even close to as responsible for his/hers actions as an adult . 
  yes of course , our whole prison system is based around rehabilitation rather than just punishment . 
  and a 20 % recidivism rate clearly shows that this system works when looking at a recidivism rate of 76 % in the us . 
  they get treated very well with the nicest prisons in the world and they get some help to get their lives back on track once they 're out . 
  and yes i like it to be this way since it benefits everyone keeping people out of prison . 
  yeah , russia was why i was unsure . 
  checked on wiki and it only gave me the density of the whole of russia , which obviously is lower than ours but you ca n't really count the whole of russia so i guess you could say we have the 2nd lowest . 
  then it 's pretty different here compared to in italy . 
  `` no '' kids here bike in the middle of the road , they pretty much always use sidewalks or bike on the side of the road on low traffic roads if they abseloutley have to . 
  here at least the difference is huge between riding a motorized moped compared to a regular bike . 
  asina is my favourite orange soft drink , it 's rare to find though and its only produced by a couple of small industries but it 's fantastic , easily best orange soft drink imo but many do n't even seem to know that it exists . 
  solo is a good 2nd with fanta a good way behind imo, 
  assume you mean non-motorized bikes right ? 
  kids use them in areas with less traffic , streets with low speed limit and on sidewalks . 
  and it 's not like kids drive in the middle of the road like a car with their normal bike . 
  what i 'm mainly saying is dangerous is 14 year old kids driving on the road without good judgemental abilities , if you ride your non-motorized bike on the side of the walkway obviously that is much less dangerous than being in the middle of the road with your moped going 40km/h ? 
  very different though , you cant ban kids from being near roads . 
  that danger will always be there . 
  however letting 14 year olds drive around in moderate speeds with the lack of sensible judgement they have is just strange . 
  kids have very poor judgement of risk and other factors related to driving . 
  they 're far behind even 16 year olds in terms of mindset , which is the abseloute minimum age someone should be allowed to operate on a road in my opinion . 
  norway and my municipality both 15 / km ^ 2 very sparsely populated country , 2nd or 3rd in europe i believe . 
  least sparsely populated county is finnmark , with a huge 1.5 / km ^ 2, 
  that 's just stupid imo . 
  let 14 year olds on the road next to cars and large trucks ? 
  a 14 year old is very little developed in his mindset , you 're not even fully developed until you 're in your mid 20 's and when you 're 14 you still have a long way to go before you should be let on a road imo . 
  even many 18 year olds drive like idiots and should never have had their car license , imagine how much less developed 14 year olds are . 
  a 14 year old can legally drive one on the road ? 
  wtf, 
  relatively common as you can take a moped driver 's license when you 're 16 . 
  it 's not uncommon for people to take the license once they 're 16 , buy a moped and use it for 2 years before completley abandoning it when taking the driver 's licence for cars when they 're 18 . 
  mainly just cs : go dunno , used to be a casual player playing all kinds of games but since i started playing cs : go a couple of years ago i just get bored so quickly when playing other games , i hate it . 
  bought cities : skylines in the steam summer sale and i 've enjoyed it quite a bit . 
  used to play quite a lot of hearthstone as well but not played it much the last year . 
  even some cabins here do n't have running water , it 's not super uncommon :p, 
  yeah 5 times . 
  2 times antalya , 2 times marmaris and once in istanbul , where i also drove down the west coast to a town right north of izmir . 
  istanbul is a really nice city . 
  hmm interesting did n't know . 
  the guy domracheva is married to is also very famous here :d, 
  biathlon due to domracheva i assume ? 
  elementary ( year 1-7 ) enjoyed it a lot , i played football besides school with almost all of my classmates so i became very good friends with pretty much everyone in the class . 
  i was always outside playing and hanging out with my friends . 
  i had 4-5 extremely close and good friends during that period , never had anything close to that since middle school ( year 8-10 ) old elementary school classes were mixed with kids from another school . 
  unfortunately i ended up in a class without most of my good friends from elementary school . 
  i lost friendship with sooo many people in this period , i ended up in a group of 5-6 people , 2 from elementary and some new blokes . 
  they were all very nice but i was n't able to create that close of a relationship to any of them . 
  high school ( 11-13 ) honestly the worst period , new school in another town , about half the class was from my old school and the other half from other schools . 
  ended up in a 5 man group who was together every lunch break and in classes we shared . 
  2 of the guys i knew from my middle school class and 2 others i knew from elementary . 
  again , they were nice blokes , intelligent all of them but they were quite nerdy and unsocial which led to my social life outside of school to be shit during this period . 
  i never went to parties except for a few during the graduation period and mostly sat at home alone when i was n't playing football . 
   did you make a lot of friends ? 
  many during elementary school but it went downhill from there . 
  had about 5 decent school mates from the start of middle school to the end of high school . 
  lost sooo many friends after elementary school due to changing classes . 
   did you learn a lot of things ? 
  did n't put in much work during middle - and high school but ended up with decent enough grades . 
  good enough for the work i did anyway . 
  the subjects i found interesting , like history i got top grades in but there were too many subjects i did n't find interesting so it brought my grades down a fair bit . 
  as the other guy said cross-country skiing and handball . 
  next are other winter sports , biathlon , alpine skiing , ski jumping , nordic combined ( to a lesser degree ) cycling is also growing a lot , tour de france is quite popular and we 've had some sucessful riders who 've helped grow the sport here , we 're hosting the world championsships this year so it 's definitely becoming more and more popular by the year . 
  is n't rogfast just the name of the 30km underwater tunnel ? 
  which i think i 've heard will be 90 km/h . 
  understandable as it 's a tunnel with worse visibility . 
  the whole project is `` fergefri e39 '' i believe and if the speed is 110 for most parts that 's really nice . 
  pretty insane they 're cutting the overall time between kristiansund - trondheim from 20 to 10 hours . 
  will be a pretty amazing road when it 's all finished . 
  to be fair 90km/h on most highways is just annoyingly low . 
  i drove on a roadtrip this summer through large parts of norway and sweden and in sweden they had 100/110 on shitty ass 2 lane roads with curves that would be a 70 zone in norway . 
  and it 's not like sweden have many road accidents . 
  on straight 2-3 lane highways with a median strip 90 km/h is just annoying and i do n't see how it makes sense when looking at other worse and more dangerous roads in sweden and other countries were the limit is 100 or even more . 
  on 80 km/h roads basically no one is under the limit , that is just how it is here .

yes , but do you ever google things that you do n't really care about ? 
  hence people 's misconception . 
  i would have approved most of the macedonians , as their women are absolutely beautiful . 
  lol . . 
  i 've never seen so many spaniards commenting in r/europe before . 
  oo what 's this ? 
  a foreigner telling the citizens of a different country what to do and how to behave ? 
  say , who are you to make such requests ? 
  do you not remember how it went for you poles when a certain country in the 40s were calling for the arrest of your citizens ? 
  most people probably came to the conclusion of how after watching the movie braveheart . . 
  i frequently travel between norway and sweden . 
  the border there is relatively open . 
  there are random checks if you try to pass through with car . 
  however , if you try to take then train then there is pretty much a high chance of there coming officials onto the train . 
  the officials bring their drug sniffing dogs and question people that do not speak a nordic language ect . 
  as mark twain and benjamin disraeli said `` there are three kinds of lies : lies , damned lies and statistics . '', 
  ( my statistics teacher actually used this line in the first day of class back in the day ) . 
  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/lies,_damned_lies,_and_statistics statistics are meant to be anonymous , not done over the phone . 
  this is because you are n't taking into consideration of what type of people the people whom are at home answering those phone calls are . 
  a sample size should be big enough to be able to actually reflect the size of the population that you are trying to represent . 
  this article is just bullshit . 
  they basically did 1229 interviews over the phone to get these statistics . 
  all that tells me is that they interviewed a couple hundred idiots ( when there are millions of people in sweden ) to give validity to their agenda . 
  nope . 
  i live in norway ( eea country ) , and i 've never had a problem getting something shipped to me from a eu country ( or the usa ) . 
  what does suck is the 25 % toll that you have to pay in norway when you buy something online from a foreign country when the amount exceeds 350 kr . 
  let the globazi propaganda commence !, 
  maybe they can educate them on what happens when you betray your own country by letting yourself become a pawn of religious fanatics . 
  and this : http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-18519395 the un migration chief who is a member of the bilderberg group and goldman sachs said back in 2012 that the eu should `` undermine national homogeneity '' . 
  because mass migration result in hurting the weakest members of our society . 
  do n't even start, 
  how is / u/ragnar _ ok even considered to be allowed mod on this sub reddit ? 
  that guy is a straight up self declared far left extremist who will do his very best to enforce his beliefs of censorship on anyone that isent as insane as him . 
  you have heard the saying , `` arguing on the internet is like running in the special olympics : even if you win , you 're still retarded . '', 
  right ? 
  hence why your burden of proof philosophy goes out the window . 
  the rules of the internet are final , so unless you provide proof that internet user must follow that philosophy , then your statement is invalid . 
  i guess that you missed the `` rules of the internet '' part , but oh well . 
  it 's not like you actually took a second and think about what i 've been writing to you . 
  `` as far as i 'm concerned romanians and gypsies are the same thing . '', 
  that statement right there proves that you are a ignorant dumbass . 
  there are loads of beautiful , intelligent , and horny romanian females at my uni , and they look as white as the rest of europe . 
  the gypsies are the ones that you see `` begging '' on the street . 
  nope . 
  would you mind providing a source/link to the rules of the internet that say that i need to provide a link/source whenever i make a comment . 
  not if you really do n't care about proving yourself right . 
  believe me or not , i do n't care . 
  if you seriously doubt something , then do as i do and look it up , as self educating humans are supposed to do . 
  there is a big difference between unleashing the war machine and dropping a few bombs ( like in libya ) . 
  the us military actually annihilated the iraq army back when they first invaded . 
  the biggest problem were of course the insurgents that hid among civilians , so the only way that this would work if we all agree on doing some evil for the greater good . 
  i actually agree with erynam , fuck wasting time finding a source every time you post a comment about something that you read in the past , as if you need to prove yourself to some random internet person . 
  there are far to many `` source '' people on reddit that are simply too lazy to do a google search . 
  i can speak with people from sweden with no problem , but i struggle to understand what danish people say as they sound like they got a cock in their mouth when they speak ( no offense intended ) . 
  you do realize that south park was very popular among the 90s generation right ? 
  most of those people are now in their 20s , so that statement right there is completely wrong . 
  besides , have you been to r/videos lately ? 
  cause its on the front page there . 
  ps - dont let the 16 downvoting fools trick you into thinking that you are right . 
  well . . at least they are n't in france where they 'd be fed french cuisine . 
  imagine having to eat snails every day . 
  `` pc hysteria '' , lol !, 
  although i agree with you , i ca n't help to think that you just watched the latest south park episode . 
  gota love it how south park shapes people 's opinions and give them new words to use . 
  yup . 
  most economic migrants head towards norway when they figure out that sweden was n't the `` freedom land '' that they were told of . 
  there are also plenty of them that take the route through russia , and then buy a bicycle to ride it across our northern border . 
  most norwegians are friendly towards foreigners ( and support legal immigration ) , so the people that you met were probably just dicks . 
  none of which actual libertarians would recommend . 
  https://www.reddit.com/r/libertarian/comments/39p2zh/what_are_some_books_that_are_recommended_for/ i just want to know why you would think that a libertarian would be regarded as something negative . 
  my understanding of what being a libertarian is , is that you believe that the rights of the citizens of a country should be protected . 
  the government should exist to act in the defense of the citizens ( prosecute murderers , rapists , and criminals ect ) . 
  the government should also exist for the purpose of national defense ( military ) , but avoid getting caught up in interfering too much in the daily lives of its citizens . 
  every country is unique , so any country that have libertarians would have to adjust accordingly . 
  libertarianism is to me , the best way to combat the rise of the far left/right extremism , if people were only educated to the fact that there are alternative methods of government ( since there are so many people that are fed up with their current governments ) . 
  would you care to elaborate ? 
  becuase i dont think that you fully do . 
  tell me , do you know what a libertarian believes in ? 
  hey !, 
  not all libertarians are nutjobs !, 
  do n't forget about norway -_-, 
  `` being killed or severely persecuted for your political beliefs or ethnicity '' , so i think that we all agree that in the case of syria , most people are seeking asylum based on the persecution of their political views . 
  i dont understand how the western governments that accept them based on the fact that many of them are being persecuted because they believe in sharia law . 
  so do tell , why is it that subreddits such as r/videos do not allow videos of police brutality , or police harassment ? 
  do you honestly think that the government has had no say in what type of rules the mods have to enforce on one of the world largest social media site ? 
  subreddits such as ; r/europe , r/worldnews , and r/videos all need to be cleansed of their mods and start from scratch . 
  it is bullcrap how some biased internet trolls are allowed to control freedom of speech , just because they thought of the name to a subreddit first . 
  a business should always refrain from getting involved in politics . 
  no matter , as i am sure that their competitors will be more than happy to provide hungary with what they are asking for in exchange for money . 
  if there are n't any competitors close by , then i am sure that china will be more than happy to provide . 
  i do n't understand . . spain 's native young population have a massive unemployment rate , but they want to give a foreigner that dosent speak the local language a job instead . 
  makes perfect sense right ? 
  did i not just describe in my previous comment which videos are deemed trustable ? 
  there are also various ways to check if a video is authentic . 
  i would rather leave it up to viewers to determine whether something is authentic than trust the words of a author . 
  i really cant be bothered to rewrite my responses to the comment that you just made as i have already answered this . 
  try reading a bit further down ( and comment ) if you have something to add to the discussion . 
  i never said that it was a new decision . 
  eu regulations are a joke , especially when many policies are influenced by peter sutherland , the un migration chief , and a member of the bilderberg group and goldman sachs . 
  they can , but videos and photographs are held to be much more reliable than text ( or a person ) as most uncut , raw videos/photographs will allow the viewer to actually witness the scenario .

  you can drive 80-90 km/h without any problems on the narrower roads in the summer . 
  in the winter however it can be pretty bad , especially with all the trucks . 
  organisation in the public sector mostly . 
  the transport sector is a brilliant example of inefficiency . 
  when someone wants to reform it the answer from the previous transport minister was : `` we have a tradition of doing things that way in this country '' . 
  just recently it was decided that we are going to increase the speedlimit of some streches of motorway to 110 km/h . 
  so many people are against it even if it 's a totally normal speedlimit in the rest of europe . 
  in other words people there are so many people here that wants to keep the nanny state going . 
  ironically it is these people who appreciate the extra freedoms when going abroad . 
  it 's has been like that in norway too and we are still very conservative . 
  we do n't want change or to try out new things at all . 
  the jante law does n't really mean anything in modern scandinavia . 
  also the economies in scandinavia are more free than the u.s despite what people think . 
  private property rights are very strong here . 
  also laws like the jones act would never have been passed in europe . 
  the u.s is extremely protectionistic . 
  not very free-market is it ? 
   i am hearing that pretty much all of the nordic countries now have large volumes of personal debt , including student loans , in spite of nominally free education ( the housing market in major university towns is dysfunctional beyond most americans ' belief , from what i 've head about sweden ) . 
  how true is this ? 
  it 's very true . 
  [ take a look at this picture which shows debt as a percentage of disposable income ] ( http://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/sites/factbook-2013-en/03/03/02/housdebt_g1.html?itemid=/content/chapter/factbook-2013-28-en ) . 
  in the u.s it is around 120 % while in denmark it is over 300 % !, 
  one ca n't argue against the fact that unemployment benefits are better in scandinavia . 
  but for the average family this does n't really matter . 
  when it comes to material wealth we have it good in scandinavia as well . 
  but basic necessities like food , transportation and housing is pretty expensive . 
  for youth today it is very difficult to enter the housing market . 
  i hear americans complain about it , but they have it pretty easy compared to norwegians . 
  [ take a look at this graph which shows the development in real estate prices ] ( http://static.e24.no/drpublish/images/article/2013/12/03/22654896/1/default/2007559.png ) . 
  it should be no surprise then that the debt spiral keeps increasing . 
   but you do ( or at least did ) have a ton of protections for workers and most industries are collectively bargained so almost no one probably makes < $ 15 an hour . 
  it varies a lot by country . 
  denmark for example has very flexible labour laws . 
  what most americans do n't take in to account when factoring in wages is that everything is a lot more expensive . 
  [ you can see for your self . 
  ] ( http://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/compare_countries_result.jsp?country1=norway&amp;country2=united+states ) what it basically tells you is that americans can afford 40 % more than a similar norwegian . 
  it is pretty clear when you have been to both countries . 
  cars americans take for granted is something the average norwegian can only dream of owning . 
  funny you would mention social democracy since no scandinavian countries have a minimum wage law . 
  the stock market is far from dead . 
  it 's been going on a rally since 2009 . 
  what happens next though can be interesting . 
  with the stock market doing as good as it has the last years , it really is n't surprising . 
  the increased wages makes up for it . 
  there are cheaper and free alternatives if you get a stipend or go to a state school also . 
  reddit exaggerates everything . 
  atleast in the u.s you are pretty much secured a job compared to a lot of youth in the eu . 
  but as i said there are pros and cons everywhere . 
  what i am tired of is a lot of reddit makes the situation seem much worse than it actually is . 
  some states does n't have a vat . 
  the ones who do have much lower rates than the 25 % that is normal in europe . 
  it 's only the `` poor '' people that have it better in europe . 
  for the majority of the population life is better in the u.s compared to europe . 
  heck , having a low income in the u.s is better than having a low income in france and italy . 
  it 's what most people think . 
  if you are on the bottom 20 % in income you generally have it better in europe . 
  the majority of americans have similar or better living standards compared to european countries . 
  the prices in the u.s are much lower as well as the taxes . 
  when you take in to account that the wages are higher it 's pretty easy to see why . 
  there are things european countries do best and there is things that the u.s does better . 
  to call the u.s undeveloped is very ignorant . 
  too many people think that everything is so much greener over here . 
  we do still have some manufacturing . 
  it 's just that petroleum is the largest export . 
  not to mention sweden and liberal !, 
  i 'm sure communists in government would not make things any better . 
  the last remaining capital would just exit the country over night . 
   the left did n't take power in france . 
  francois hollande is n't the left , at least not the kind of left that i am talking about and that is on track to win the elections in greece . 
  nor did france experience anything remotely close . 
  what kind of left are you talking about then ? 
   of course , austerity in the uk only deepened their recession . 
  furthermore they are experiencing a slightly smaller version of the us ' discouraged workers problem . 
  people from all over europe go to the u.k for work . 
  the situation is not nearly as bad as further down the continent and france . 
  because when the left took power in france the unemployment rate went down and economic growth took speed right away . 
  it was of course the opposite in the u.k with their right-wing govt ... oh wait . 
  more people work here i guess . 
  well he has kind of a point though . 
  did you see the brennpunkt documentary on the issue earlier this year ? 
  that being said i still find it ridiculous that saudi arabia and russia are criticising us . 
  - said no one ever . 
  what i meant by conservative is that we are scared to death by the though of doing things differently . 
  even if that means things take longer time and is less efficient . 
  sweden is very different from norway in that regard . 
  here in norway we still do things less effective even if there is a better way . 
  it 's usually justified by the politicians since `` it has always been that way '' . 
  that 's why building roads take ages here for example . 
  ironically enough our new conservative government is the one that tries to reform this sector . 
  i actually find scandinavian countries and especially norway to be really conservative . 
  it 's not the difficulty that is the reason why norwegian roads are bad . 
  horrible management , low funding and general neglect has all contributed . 
  luckily we have now gotten a good transport minister for the first time in decades . 
  drive north of trondheim and you might change your mind . 
  it 's like a rollercoaster after the frost has done its work . 
   besides from the nav-part , i got it all set !, 
  the language part are a bit tricky though . 
  since you live in rogaland i can imagine the dialect being quite tricky for a foreigner . 
   hehe , i do understand it though . 
  people should be more adaptable , even though there 's such minor differences , we should respect the values and culture of yours , which i see that some swedes can lack the respect of .

   happy liberation day and veterans day to my norwegian followers . 
  this is the flag i used to wear on my uniform . 
  i used to wear it with pride and i was willing to die for this flag and everything it represents , even on foreign soil and even though norway is n't my country of birth . 
  and i still am , if the opportunity would arise . 
  the reason i have been reluctant to reveal my background , is n't so much because of personal security , but because i know this will create some drama back home . 
  i know my former employer , the norwegian armed forces . 
  wo n't be happy about this , but to be honest , i do n't care anymore . 
  i would n't have gone to the media like i just did , if they had the decency to answere my lawyers calls and not treat me as if i had joined a terrorist group . 
  this is my way of getting some answeres . 
  i 'm also dissapointed that the command of my former unit have told my old colleagues , friends , to break of all contact with me , wich they have . 
  and i know for a fact that certain people in the norwegian armed forces have labeled me as a mercenary . 
  these people should look up that word in the dictonary . 
  i left a well paid job to volunteer here for free , i have spent $ 13,000 of my savings doing so so far , the army is holding back $ 8-9 ,000 they owe me because i 'm with the peshmerga and i have no insurance at all ... if i get injured , i will have to pay for the medical treatment myself . 
  i do n't know if this is a view shared by many or just a few , but that someone thinks i 'm doing this for personal gains , is hurtfull . 
  does n't matter much right now , though . 
  it 's veterans day and i 'm going to spoil myself with the last can of wild tiger i got left and a book i got from one of the guys from the norwegian newspaper i met up with in erbil . 
  fishing regulations is a major point of disagreement both for norway and iceland . 
  it 's a top hit every four years around february or so . 
  * [ solveig 's song ] ( https://youtu.be/ii2adi2ifrm ) * [ anitra 's dance ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcensitnagm ) * [ the last spring ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7umlhynqxe ), 
  as far as i can tell you are only * ranked * worse . 
  that does n't mean the numbers themselves are worse . 
  i have german-speaking friends who learned conversational norwegian in three months . 
  makes me envious . 
  i certainly had a tougher time with german . 
  wait . 
  are you trying to tell me everybody 's dead ? 
  i know you can distinguish the breathing patterns of someone who is sleeping and someone who is awake at least . 
  i assume this is not so different . 
  you think that 's bad ? 
  today i was sitting by my usual window . 
  it 's the one right in the front , behind the driver , so there 's a wall in front of me . 
  i sit there because by the time passengers entering through the front door have pocketed their wallet and are looking for seats they have usually walked past this point , so the seat next to me remains free more often . 
  there 's only one button i can conceivably press to signal a stop , and it 's about belly-button height in front of the seat next to me . 
  so this morning , not only does someone sit next to me , he puts his bag on his lap so that it covers the button !, 
  i had to actually excuse myself as i moved his own bag before pressing ... * shudders *, 
  uae is n't on the map . 
  you 're looking at saudi arabia . 
   `` be sure to weigh conflicting armies carefully ! '', 
  it says to weigh conflicting * claims * carefully , which is honestly not such an unreasonable suggestion . 
  as a flag collector , this makes my mouth water .

  what are the prevailing winds like in montenegro ? 
  coastal locations with inland prevailing winds are typically a lot colder than those with oceanic winds . 
  almost all of norway gets its weather from the west , originating from warm places in the southern united states , which is why it is so mild compared to places of similar latitude in russia , for example . 
  in fact norway has one of the largest temperature anomalies compared to mean at latitude . 
  people will tell you ( and are telling you ) that the major contributing factor is the gulf stream , but this is a myth . 
  no , the scandinavian elg ( alces alces ) is not the same animal as the american elk .

  yeah , screw you pinnekj\u00f8tt-eating half . 
  most `` traditional `` norwegian cuisine is just accidental byproducts of having to come up with creative ideas on how to store things for a really long time , e.g. 
  fermented ( rakfisk ) , salted to death ( pinnekj\u00f8tt ) , or dried and revived with lye ( lutefisk ) .

  i 've always heard this one with `` and a virgin '' added . 
  tip for you . 
  much of this is accurate . 
  so many swedes have become naturalized norwegian citizens lately ( who can blame them ) that the average iq of norwegians has fallen dramatically . 
  honestly , we deserve all the banter we can get right now . 
  i know it 's kind of abstract , but as a norwegian , this gives me the creeps . 
  what is * crude * rate ? 
  does it have to be refined somehow ? 
  that 's what i 'm talking about : funding for research . 
  i wish . 
  try getting politicians to back that with these voters . 
  it 's a shame though because we have large thorium reserves and it could potentially be a big deal .

  i live north of the arctic circle . 
  what you call spring , we call summer . 
  in norway we have mandatory school untill you 're 16 . 
  in high school you can choose between learning a trade or doing pre-university studies . 
  if you do the standard pre-uni , you 're finishied by the year you turn 19 and ready to start at the university if you want to . 
  unless you 're male , then there is a chance that you have to serve a year in the armed forces and have to wait until you 're 20 . 
  bachelor is three years , master is five years . 
  obvious , really ? 
  maybe i 'm a bit blind being pro-eu and all , but i think it 's a rather complicated matter . 
  it 's not like the eu could just take our money away . 
  we have to pay to keep efta up and running , and iirk the `` membership fee '' in the eu would n't be that much bigger . 
  an interesting point about norway and the eu is that some of the main arguments against membership are complete opposites of realism - for instance a typical no-argument is that we 'll lose controll of our marine resources , but they seldomy mention that a membership would make it possible to have large-scale procesing here instead of in alredy member-countries . 
  but to answer your original question : we 're bound by the eea-agreement and have to follow bruxelles anyway , so even if we only get a small voice it 's better than being a fax-democracy like today .

  it 's basically boiled cod served with fish liver , roe ( ? ), 
  and potatoes . 
  there is no sauce and hardly any vegetables , because the fish is supposed to be good enough to eat without other flavours . 
  i ate it last year . 
  i dunno about sweden , but here in norway it 's not common to wear a bow-tie . 
  if i was a bus driver and someone dressed like that asked for a ride in the way he did , i 'd happily get the man to the wedding he apparently is late for , given the bus is n't full . 
  if some guy that obviously have been shopping said ( with a totally different attitude than suit-man ) that he forgot his bus card , i 'd think he was trying to trick me . 
  i 've fallen asleep on the buss while dressed casually and been given a free ride to my destination on the way back , and i 've been talked down to while wearing professional clothing . 
  i do n't think the scenarios presentet in the video were that similar to begin with . 
  that 's true . 
  i remember watching a cartoon about a mole or something in the 90 's . 
  i think it was either czeck or slovakian . 
  while inteded for adults , we do have [ this gem ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01taijfa-ww ) of creepy animation made by the public broadcaster . 
  i 'm no expert on the matter , but i think what russia really fears is the domino effect of sweden joinging nato . 
  i was speaking with some swedes and finns a few weeks ago , and when the conversation turned to russia , the finns told me that they 're staying out of nato as long as sweden is staying out . 
  sweden is n't exactly a huge military power , but it would be a hassle to defend the russia-finland border in regards of defending from a nato invation . 
  i 'm not sure on how that border is guarded today , but the russian border is our only military guarded border . 
  we 've been in nato since the beginning and has spent a lot of time building diplomatic bonds with the russians after the fall of the ussr to remain friendly . 
  i saw a documentary about the differences between us and norwegian integration that dealt with somalis specifically . 
  here in norway the somalis have a horrible reputation and are over representated in certain crime stats . 
  if i remember the documentary correctly , the somalis are one of the more successfull refugee groups in the us while they are the opposite in norway . 
  the main reason has to do with how the systems are different . 
  in norway , it 's a lot harder to get a job . 
  i 've even heard refugees are discouraged to do so by their case workers , sometimes . 
  you 're not supposed to work untill they descide if you can stay , and that can take a long time . 
  then you need to know the language and then you still might be out of luck because we like to formalize a lot of jobs , so you might need some training before you can work . 
  while in the us , they help you to get a job and you do n't have to speak english . 
  this helps on intergration , as you have a contact surface for meeting americans and learning the language . 
  another point in the documentary was that the refugees were met by the government in norway while they were met by ngos in the us , and that also helped them because of a systematic distrust of the government from somalia . 
  i 'm pro eu and i have a hard time understanding why most of my countrymen does n't weight the pros and cons the way i do . 
  at the moment we have to follow most rules from brussels , but we have no say in them . 
  our political debates over eu regulations happens years after they 're passed . 
  we have massive amounts of fish , but we have to sell them early in the process to minimize the eu 's import tax . 
  this costs us both jobs and revenue . 
  at the same time , we are stuck with our mediocre farm products . 
  our main brand of meat does n't differentiate different quality cuts , only what part of the animal it 's from , so every time we buy a steak it 's a gamble . 
  i have to admit , it seems quite fun !, 
  nope . 
  do n't think i 'm licenced and i do n't know if there are any tracks nearby . 
  * nytt for nytt * is probably my favorite norwegian tv-show running at the moment . 
  it 's a current affairs/humour programme running since 1999 based on a british show called have i got news for you . 
  before norwegian language children 's channels were a thing , we had a british cartoon channel called tcc that showed that show . 
  loved it as a kid !, 
  we also use the word * varg * in some dialects , as well . 
  i think whaling is regulated by the iwc and todays whaling operations is done in a scale that serves the domestic markets . 
  i do n't think it would be sustainable to hunt whales as an export business model . 
  afaik , there was a change around the late 00 's regarding the eus fishing regulations that streamlined it to combat overfishing . 
  i do n't know the details , but i 've been told they adopted a system close to the one we have ( in regards to how me reduce over fishing ) , so they should be comparable . 
  i also suspect that we could get away with some kind of special deal to keep our fish , just as some countries got to opt out of the euro or swedens exception to sell * snus * . 
  as long as the eu gives us the right to use our own currency among other things , i 'm quite sure that we 'll join sometime in the next 20-30 years . 
  when discussing norway and the eu it 's important to understand that the question of joing the eu is a non-topic . 
  we do n't really talk about it outside academic discussions on universities and the like . 
  this has had some effects on the general polulations understanding of the eu . 
  a lot of the arguments from the 70 's and 90 's are still used today , and many people believe that we will have to hand over our soverign wealth fund , stop subsidizing farming and lose our fishing rights if we join . 
  afaik , none of these things are true . 
  the fish farming industry is booming at the moment and it 's projected that it 's gon na increase manyfold in size over the next years . 
  since foodstuff is n't a part of the eec agreement , we have to sell these products to the eu at an earlier part of the process to be competitive . 
  if we were a member , we could do more of the prossesing here and create more jobs in rural areas . 
  ( the same rural areas that 's traditionally mostly against the eu ) . 
  when the industry grows even more , i think we 'll start to see a shift in the general views of the eu . 
  it is , but we have spend enormous amounts of resources keeping the population decentralized , something that 's strating to pay off in the form of fish farming and other natural resources . 
  just compare the population denisty of northern norway , sweden and finland . 
  we have higher public operating costs and a lot more road per capita than our neighbours . 
  if you add the terrain , then you get why we 're still behind . 
  iirk , the tolls are * supposed * to dissapear as the road is paid for , but it 's up to the road owner to descide if they want to keep them for new projects . 
  the thing is that we have a huge backlog on road upkeep .

  everyone here speaks english ... 
  ok , thanks for the info , 
  it comes from the same guy who claims that norway is n't a welcoming country for strangers and that the progress party is a anti-immigration party on par with sd . 
   i never said they hated immigrants . 
  i was referring to the way in which norwegian society handles ` outsiders ' . 
  the example i gave of my dear old mum was a society that is accepting and welcoming and friendly to outsiders . 
  i asked you before , but you did n't answer . 
  how many people do you know that befriended a ` fresh off the boat ' immigrant and tried to introduce them to the ways of your society ? 
  is the treatment your mom got very normal in australia ? 
  everyone is queueing up to help fresh off the boat immigrants ? 
  i know noone who has befriended a fresh off the boat immigrant . 
  that is mainly because they keep to them self . 
  i know the municipaly has arranged several activities to get them in contact with the locals . 
  it seems to have worked so far . 
  i should also mention that norwegians are cold people in general . 
  most people does n't even say hello to their neighbors . 
  we only really talk to eachother when we are drunk on the weekends . 
   i want to very strongly reiterate again : i do n't think norwegians are xenophobic or racist . 
  that said , i do think that they are n't particularly open to foreigners as shown by the discrepancy in employment and problems with integration . 
  aaaaaaaand , of course , now we 're back to you not answering most of my points and instead deflecting it all onto australia . 
  i would like to see similar employment statistics for australia . 
  non-western immigrants of course . 
  about australia , i just think it shows the double standard when you say that australia is so open and welcoming , but at the same time has had tough asylum policies . 
   you know diddly squat about the election in australia and our immigration policy . 
  the liberal party did n't win , the labour party lost because they had two public leadership betrayals in the span of a few years , and because the murdoch press , which owns around 50 % of newspaper circulation in australia , was heavily siding with the liberals . 
  their main newspaper , the australian , once claimed it 's goal was to destroy the australian green party , which was in coalition with the labor party at the time . 
  the liberals did n't win because of immigration policy , the labor party lost . 
  really ? 
  it seems like a bad excuse to be honest . 
  that 's like saying labour lost our election . 
  most people wanted abbots policies , simple as that . 
  interesting thing about the media . 
  [ in norway labour owns most of the media . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/amedia )  secondly , the ` immigration ' debate in australia does n't have anything to do with traditional immigrants . 
  it 's rather centered around the fact that many refugees , that have already reached safe destinations , but continue on to australia regardless , board shitty boats in indonesia and try and land in australia to claim asylum . 
  now , i personally have no problem with people coming and wanting to claim asylum , nor do the overwhelming majority of people . 
  what most australian 's do worry about is the frequent boats that sink on the way , including one that had around 30 children on it a month ago that all died . 
  so please , in future , if you 're just basing your opinions off of half remembers newspaper articles and reality tv shows - do n't . 
  sounds like something similar to the boats that sink with several hundreds outside italy . 
  the only difference is that the eu think the solution to this is to let these people come , while australia wants to remove the boats . 
  and we get called racists ? 
  i would say [ aftenposten ] ( http://www.aftenposten.no/ ) is the most neutral newspaper in norway . 
   the white australia policy was in the process of being dismantled from at least the early 60s , before formally being destroyed in the mid 70s ( it had withdrawn in practice for years before that ) . \u00a8 but you did n't like the current immigration policy so you voted in tony abbot . 
  [ ill just put this here . 
  when legitimate political parties gets excluded from debates i find it to be a legitimate concern . 
  denmark even wanted un to monitor the swedish election because they were concerned about the coverage . 
   the overwhelming majority of them try and learn norwegian , try and find a job , try and obey the laws , do n't cause trouble . 
  but when the host society demonizes them through populist politicians railing against immigrants , or in the media ( which , admittedly , is n't as common in norway with respect to the media ) , how can they not feel like outsiders ? 
  [ the vast majority of norwegians have nothing against immigrants . 
  ] ( http://www.ssb.no/innvhold/ ) the media has actually been very anti-frp ever since its beginning . 
   first . 
  this point is n't relevant , it 's a distraction . 
  second , australia takes the third or second highest rate per capita of refugees from un camps in the world . 
  as for ` strict immigration policies ' , about a quarter of australian citizens were n't born in australia , and in the city i 'm from , melbourne , that number is somewhere around 34 % why is n't it relevant ? 
  now you have gotten a new government which is even more stricter on immigration . 
  the liberal party got twice the amount of voters as progress in norway . 
  un refugees will never be the same amount as asylum seekers . 
  we accept our fair share and it 's not un refugees people complain about . 
  in oslo almost 29 % of the population is immigrants . 
  the most popular baby name for males have been muhammed for three years in a row now . 
  we have our fair share . 
  in australia most foreign born immigrants are from europe , it really is n't comparable . 
   as to frp , are you really trying to tell me it 's not a right wing populist anti immigration party ? 
  because i just checked wikipedia ( to refresh my memory ) , and they claim it is , with multiple sources . 
  the left-right axis in norwegian politics is very narrow . 
  the right here is the same as many european labour parties . 
  frp was funded on a small state and lower taxes , so you ca n't compare it to sverigedemokratarna for example . 
  they are the only party in norway who wants to limit immigration . 
  they do n't even want to stop it . 
  how about this then , 84 % of the population voted for parties that wanted immigration at todays level or more . 
  the wonderful history you have yeah ? 
  australia was fucking racist until only a few decades ago . 
  i find it funny the shows we have here called border patrol . 
  it 's from sydney airport where they just throw immigrants out like garbage . 
  at the same time i do n't expect journalists to know everything either . 
  if you want factual news i would recommend you to read magazines or newspapers specializing in the field you want to read about . 
  i like to read about innovation and technical stuff . 
  that is why i like the website '' [ teknisk ukeblad ] ( http://www.tu.no/ ) '' which have lots of interesting articles . 
  spot on !, 
  well , you are right about it being a debate article . 
  but it does reflect the newspapers view because it is written by their editorial writer . 
   in the post i linked , you literally said that ` most do n't even bother to get a job ' . 
  which was wrong by me .

i think you need to read up on your old history lessons about kalmar , because it was not what you seem to think it was . 
  ... or sweden ... or norway, 
  but , but think about all the welfare !, 
  too bad you 're not any good at speaking danish though . 
  is welfare a language too ? 
  i 'd like to count that . 
  i know a swede . 
  he just speaks silly . 
  you were talking about population . 
  to support a larger population you historically need a lot of agriculture . 
  norway has always lacked that for obvious reason . 
  41 % of austria is agricultural land , norway has just over 3 % 17 % of austria is arable land , in norway it 's just under 3 % just under 25 % of norway is above the arctic circle , how much of austria is above the arctic circle ? 
  right 0 % zilch , zip , nada . 
  i do n't think it was such a bad argument after , reacting to your statement norway has `` barely any population '' . 
  it 's all relative . 
  well , that 's the truth . 
  i guess its the same for people from copenhagen . 
  i 've often been mistaken for being swedish over there , and people are really quick at switching to english when they hear i speak norwegian and not danish . 
  and i am from grimstad where the norwegian is even more like danish . 
  hmm , i do n't know about his mother , but his father is a prominent norwegian actor nils ole oftebro . 
  he does take some of his looks . 
  wow , that 's impressive !, 
  never would have thought he could speak it that well . 
  my impression is that people from oslo have a hard time with the danish language . 
  wonder where he picked it up ? 
  edit : found out from reading his wiki that amongst norwegian theater schools that he also studied in copenhagen , so that explains that . 
  jakob oftebro speaking danish ? 
  that should be interesting . 
  fyi : oslo is pretty dead in the summer . 
  most norwegians leave the city to visit other places , mostly domestic , but also abroad . 
  so there is a huge difference between summer oslo and rest of the year oslo . 
  i can highly recommend massimo dutti for not too pricey , but quality clothing that looks great . 
  well ... iceland is also a nordic country . 
  someone did n't read their history . 
  you never gave us freedom , you lost us to sweden after the napoleonic wars . 
  we declared our own freedom , from sweden . 
  a bit of lube is never a bad thing for lovemaking, 
  guys , ca n't we all just be friends ? 
  love , norway, 
  i really do n't think norwegians have a grudge . 
  it 's not like we have a grudge against germans anymore either, 
  bybanen is nice but it would generally not go under the definition of being a tram , but a light rail . 
  we need some new trams in oslo !, 
  i 'm working on that building now \u263a, 
  i really like that building . 
  the finnish buses look like they are high on something . 
  i am sure the nazis would yes . 
  by - og regionsplanlegging at umb , now nmbu in \u00c5s akershus , 30km from oslo . 
  you can also study at uis i believe , but i 'm not sure if they have the gis courses . 
  edit : i also did a semester abroad at umn minneapolis , studying urban design . 
  get your history straight . 
  that was a coordinated attack not only by the british , but also by french , polish and norwegian resistance forces . 
  shetland was sold to scotland by king christian i of norway/sweden/denmark , not conquered . 
  that was n't conquering , you were helping us out against the nazis . 
  i am a consultant in urban planning and design . 
  tons of natural resources up there though . 
  since when did uk/england conquer lands belonging to norway ? 
  easy . 
  it 's a map error . 
  the river tana separates the landmass . 
  i make lots of maps in my proffesion . 
  that 's part of norway , parts of the county of finnmark ( which btw , is larger than denmark ) . 
  looks like everything east of the river tana got screwed up . 
  there are three towns there : vads\u00f8 , vard\u00f8 and kirkenes . 
  that 's because the title is wrong . 
  should say `` in the eu '' . 
  i do n't know if you remember the real reason for norway joining nato , but it had something to do with wwii , if you remember how that went for us . 
  * - i 'll ^ show ^ myself ^ out . ^ . ^ . 
  phew, 
  til all the european countries love the netherlands . 
  good on you guys !, 
  cause a whole country is to big for you eh , eh ? 
  what are the sizes of these holes ? 
  small bucket sized ones ? 
  i used to do this as a kid and i am now afraid that i am secretly german . 
  i think they were trying to be nice , but i appreciate your enthusiasm . 
  well is n't it illegal to go abroad to kill in norway ? 
  to fight for another country ? 
  if you do this then you should get deported if you return . 
  we 'll manage . 
  fyi : the literal translation of utopia is `` no place '' which is not a good thing . 
  eutopia on the other hand means `` good place '' . 
  * the term utopia was coined in greek by sir thomas more for his 1516 book utopia , describing a fictional island society in the atlantic ocean . 
  the word comes from the greek : \u03bf\u1f50 ( `` not '' ) and \u03c4\u03cc\u03c0\u03bf\u03c2 ( `` place '' ) and means `` no place '' . 
  [ 1 ] the english homophone eutopia , derived from the greek \u03b5\u1f56 ( `` good '' or `` well '' ) and \u03c4\u03cc\u03c0\u03bf\u03c2 ( `` place '' ) , means `` good place '' . 
  this , because of the identical pronunciation of `` utopia '' and `` eutopia '' , gives rise to a double meaning . 
  ca n't we all just be friends ? 
  well only if welsh people shag sheep because of their english dialect . 
  norwegians shag moose . 
  right on the money . 
  norwegian and i speak and write american english . 
  not bad . 
  g3 , mp5 , grenades , rocket launcher , mg , glock tons of fun . 
  i was in the kings guard in the urban warfare unit . 
  i remember hating my service , like being on mg duty outside when it was -37 c , but i also remember a lot of great times . 
  all in all i enjoyed my service and would have done it again . 
  if 5 million danes migrated to norway i 'm sure they would get the political power to change the taxes on beer . 
  that would be nice . 
  we can all eat * panert r\u00f8dspette med remoulade * and drink beer together . 
  yes , you can say a danish person or a person of danish descent , but not `` a german and a danish '' like in your sentence .

yeah . 
  that was last year . 
  it 's not like we 've only taken in refugees in 2015 . 
  we 've got a lot more afghani/iraqi refugees than syrians , though . 
  both of those were your ( your , meaning the neo-cons ) wars . 
  you invaded afghanistan as a result of 9/11 , and iraq because of wmds , wich ment we had to go to war as well ( you triggered article five for the first , and only time since when you went to war with afghanistan ) . 
  do you really believe we would have invaded any of those countries if we were n't allies ? 
  exactly . 
  what crisis ? 
  there 's people flooding over the border like they did in world war-z ? 
  i thought net immigration was basically down to zero in the last few years ? 
  i did n't say mexicans = swedes . 
  i said they 're a better comparison than syrians/iraqis/afghans . 
  i never said the war in syria is 100 % ( or even close ) to being your fault , you 're right -- that would indeed be ridiculous . 
  i 'd say the wars in iraq and afghanistan were your faults , though . 
  do n't you agree ? 
  both of those wars had their part in destabilizing the entire me . 
   also , you 're the richest country on earth . 
  we 're not . 
  not even close . 
  we 're one of the richest per capita in the world , though . 
   maybe you might want to dip into the trillion dollar rainy day fund you keep to help out the troubled people of the world . 
  i do n't really believe you 're familiar enough with our foreign aid contributions to make that statement , because we 're showering people with money all over the world . 
  mexicans are not comparable to people from the other side of the world , with vastly different cultures and sets of norms escaping war and persecution . 
  if anything , i 'd compare them to swedes . 
  they commit less crime , pay more in taxes than they take in benefits ( they 're illegal , after all ) and contribute greatly to our economy by taking jobs the natives are too lazy - or not willing - to do . 
   as soon as you send them . 
  i doubt you 'd take them . 
  you 've got a population of 300 + million people and made a fuss about taking in 10k refugees . 
  we granted 30k refugees ( the vast , vast majority were from syria ) last year and our population is only 5 million . 
  i find it particularly hilarious when the question of military expenditure in nato countries gets brought up in the us election . 
  they moan about us not spending 2 % of gdp , and wants to blackmail us ( like some mafia , offering protection ) into paying more . 
  or else they wo n't come to our aid if article five gets triggered . 
  what they fail to take into consideration , is the vast amount of money we spend on refugees mostly as a result of their neo-con wars in the me ( you know , when the us got attacked -- and the only time article five has ever gotten triggered , and we had to step up and help you guys out in afghanistan ) . 
  already did . 
  i signed the petition ( wich is the only real way for us to influence this policy atm ) , and i 'm not gon na vote for the parties who concocted this scheme in the future either . 
  when are you gon na take the refugees ? 
  i 'm sure our neighbors in sweden and germany wants to send you some as-well . 
  have you petitioned your government to encourage them to withdraw their troops from europe , though ? 
  there 's no one here atm , but there 'll be some 500 troops in 2017 . 
  they should n't be allowed to stay here , obviously . 
  foreign troops here is kinda unprecedented , has n't happened since ww2 . 
  hopefully our government changes it 's mind . 
  when will you take our 100k + refugees ? 
  yeah . 
  we 'll redirect every refugee that has been displaced as a result of the war on terror as well . 
  you can have both . 
  if anything , i hope this teaches us ( europe ) to be less dependent on the us for all sorts of things . 
  donald is n't suitable to lead the us , never mind the whole world . 
  it 's pretty terrifying to contemplate the world being run by a reality-tv show star . 
  someone contemplating electing donald to the highest office in the world , is not someone we should depend on in the future . 
  this is not funny anymore . 
  should we then accept refugees from russia as well , then ? 
  or how about the us ? 
  they 've droned american citizens without a fair trial . 
   you must be joking . 
  how are syrian people responsible for the clusterfuck in their country ? 
  this is how :  the war grew out of the unrest of the 2011 arab spring and escalated to armed conflict after president bashar al-assad 's government violently repressed protests calling for his removal . 
  they are responsible , even though they should n't have been . 
  you forgot the joos . 
  do not take a cab if you 're going to norway . 
  some family from south-america did . 
  they took the cab from the airport and to their hotel some 100 km away . 
  spent their entire vacation budget . 
  yeah , i 'm not pro eu myself -- but i do see their point in being a full-fledged member , instead of our current situation . 
  but a part of me believe - like you alluded to - this is their way of pressuring us to join after losing two eu referendums . 
  those sneaky sobs . 
  she - the princess - actually claimed a sudden appearance of a feather from one of their `` seances '' -- originated from an angel . 
  a professor , and expert , in dna-analysis offered to dna-test the feather . 
  she did n't like that very much . 
  too little genetic diversity in the gene pool , if you know what i 'm saying . 
  careful , now the eastern european immigrants will be up in arms . 
  they will not tolerate being told they 're not able to spank/physical reprimand their children . 
  they 're in favor of the eu because it would give us a say in the eu , as opposed to being just a member of the eea and having basically no power to influence the policies . 
  that 's basic statistics , it 's not my opinion . 
   also when i look on / politics the same kind polls have an entirely different answer than those from / thedonald but they both have a high number of people polled . 
  how am i supposed to believe one but not the other ? 
  because sample size is not the only metric , you 'd have to look at the methodology as well . 
  give me an example of two conflicting polls published on t_d and here . 
   one argument would be that holocaust denial is n't ` opinion ' but dismissing a fact . 
  should it be illegal to dismiss a fact ? 
  where are you from ? 
  this is pretty common in europe , just look at how hard it is to get citizenship in a lot of countries . 
   i do n't understand why people start bringing eastern europeans into the equation when it comes to immigration with citizens from places that have proven not to be a good fit because of the open borders , a lot of eastern europeans come to wealthier , more prosperous countries to rob , steal and scam . 
  like a lot . 
  i 'm not french , but it would not surprise me one bit . 
  even here - in very , very liberal norway - they 've started to use this rhetoric . 
  they absolutely love russia and putin can do no wrong . 
  it 's rather bizarre . 
  the margin of error among a 1000 sample size is + / - 3 % . 
  it 's a survey among eu28 countries ( european union ) and the source of the survey is ** eurostat . 
  ** did you even read the list ? 
  there 's a eu28 section on the list itself ( average ) . 
  original source :  this article presents an overview of european union ( eu ) statistics related to self-reported foreign language skills . 
  it provides information on the number of foreign languages known , as well as levels of command/proficiency . 
  the data are analysed by age , sex , level of educational attainment , labour status and occupation . 
  note that there is no information available for the 2011 reference period from croatia [ 1 ] , romania or the united kingdom and that data for other eu member states may be missing depending upon the type of analysis being conducted . 
  better read again , then . 
  like i said , we 're not part of the eu . 
   eu28 aggregate includes only member states for wich date is available,

they also change spelling for adopted words , often to mockery in the contemporary period . 
  for instance `` chauffeur '' -  `` sj\u00e5f\u00f8r '' back in the fifties or sixties some time . 
  and also , as long as hegge was one of the editors at aftenposten , his style-guide for the paper tended to be up to scratch for what spr\u00e5kr\u00e5det recommended . 
  unfortunately , online distribution has changed media , turning it into more rushed work with a lower linguistic quality . 
  national language council tends to adopt a name that 's closely based on the native name , and preferably pronunciation if possible . 
  it stems from the time we got out from the union from denmark , and later sweden , with a conscious policy to distance norwegian language and create a defined language and identity . 
  anyone suggesting independence of anything from denmark has my backing . 
  i wondered why they included a norwegian-looking church in the game , but i never got around to actually caring enough to start googling it . 
  is n't that basically [ borgund stave church ] ( http://i.imgur.com/oizt70d.jpg ) , if memory serves me ? 
  and for those who have played `` the vanishing of ethan carter '' who just went `` waaait a second ... have n't i seen this before ? '', 
  yes . 
  yes you have . 
  and the - ka ending is often added to names and words as a diminutive or affectionate form . 
  make of that what you will . 
  honest mistake . 
   basically , the srebrenica massacre is the epitome of one of the grandest failures of a ** un operation ** in recent history . 
  i can translate , i speak troll . 
  basically , the srebrenica massacre is the epitome of one of the grandest failures of a un operation in recent history . 
  the un `` demilitarized '' the srebrenica area , before failing to protect the so-called `` srebrenica safe area '' , before collapsing entirely under a small push from serbian forces , who then rolled in and conducted the largest act of ethnic cleansing on european soil ever since a small austrian chap with a charlie chaplin moustache had died 50 years earlier . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/srebrenica_massacre i would definitely say that disarming a side to a conflict , and the leaving them in a position where they get kettled by their opposition , and later slaughtered to a man , counts as `` facilitation '' . 
  30 years from now , do you think explorers of the internet archives will ridicule these people as badly as we ridicule the brits who tried to argue that the irish were a people of iberian descent , because they desperately needed some reason to set the irish apart from the glorious anglo-saxon master-race ? 
  mohammed was the 35th most popular name for a boy in 2013 , if combining all spelling variations . 
  that being said , you have a greater chance of running into a kid born in 2013 named liam , than mohammed ( 329 liam 's vs. 215 mohammad/mohammad/mohamed / mohammed ) . 
  but oddly enough , i 've seen zero news articles fearmongering over the `` celtification '' of norwegian names . 
  ( and source : http://ssb.no/a/navn/topp40g.html ), 
  then again , hooking up with someone on iceland requires some quick genealogy in order to make sure you 're not hitting on some second cousin and making future family reunions awkward . 
  so icelanders probably breed carefully and meticulously . 
  it 's not as if they can rely on forming relationships from random drunken hook-ups like the rest of us . 
  these people stopped being relevant for employment back when st. maggie of the curdled cunt slaughtered british industry . 
  the fact that a a whole generation raised since then , have failed to acquire training and skills making them relevant to the job-market that exists , is really not an immigration problem . 
  and what little employment there is for unskilled labour , sees them loose out in competition of the people they describe as lazy , useless and unable to communicate in english . 
  to be entirely honest , that says a whole lot more about how suitable they are for employment , rather than what it says about english immigration policies . 
  the edl represents those too fucking lazy or dumb to be of use to the work-force , thus ending up as a drain on national welfare resources . 
  please do n't tell me that a single one of these fuckers would even consider working a kiosk or doing any other job their unskilled , untrained asses are qualified for , instead of collecting benefits and feigning anger over not getting a job because `` they tuk err jerbs ! '', 
  please . 
  the working class is what these people hate with vigour . 
  the edl does n't represent the working class . 
  the edl represents the unemployment benefits class at best . 
  a bit more natural than the lake district defence league ( lddl ), 
   slavic-looking chap  alcohol abuse `` you have reached the department of unnecessary redundancy department . 
  how may i be of assistance ? '', 
  why does that overweight , aged , slavic-looking chap have an edl-tattoo ? 
  ah yes . 
  you would assume that someone who spends weekends dressed up as confederate soldiers , have some healthy views on race-issues . 
  but yeah . 
  there tend to be a lot of obsession about history in racist circles . 
  preferably some history they invented on their own , to fuel their national pride over how awesome things were . 
  the germans tried to borrow a lot of norse mythology during the occupation , which leads to a whole lot of fun with neo-nazi organizations in norway adapting `` odinism '' or other confused misappropriations of old norse paganism as part of their creed . 
  at the same time , parts of the black metal scene also has latched onto a lot of the pagan symbolism . 
  some with genuine historic insight , and some approaching it with a quite muddled view of what it is all about . 
  and then you have some genuine paganists or neo-paganists , who are actually into the entire old pantheon thing , wihtout buying into the metal-scene or the neo-nazi scene . 
  and of course your everyday man who likes symbols of norwegian cultural heritage , without necessarily buying into one scene or another . 
  which means that if you meet someone wearing a thor 's hammer around their neck , or having runic tattoos , then you have no idea what level of wanker you are dealing with . 
  december 2015 . 
  still at least six crew rotation missions to go before that . 
  i really have a hard time seeing how they could . 
  i mean , if russia starts demanding a russian visa in order to enter the sevastopol area , you pretty much recognize and accept their claim . 
  travelling via kiev for `` logistical reasons '' on an ukrainian visa just does n't cut it if russia demands that a russian visa needs to be issued in order to enter the area around the base .

  [ hey hey , not so fast !, 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_rsfpgfmjli ), 
  yeah , but now you bring in fishing , which is another important reason for why norway declined to join eu . 
  decimation of fishing in the north sea would ( possibly ) have been an outcome of norway joining eu . 
  so not only would we loose our agriculture , we would loose our fishing as well . 
  what we would be left with is oil . 
  and as recent events has shown , narrowing the norwegian industry to only one sector is a really shitty idea in the long run . 
  probably , but it is subsidies that allow the farmers to continue to farm despite low ( fairly ) income , and the import tax protects them from eu competition . 
  basically , if norway wants to continue to farm and have norwegian produce , we need both . 
  ( at least it is the way i understand it ), 
  well if your claim is correct and that i am indeed pulling strawman arguments , then lets look at a destilled version of what i believe this discussion is about : * eu is a body where larger countries carry louder voices through representation . 
  * as a result , larger countries decide what is going to happen , possibly at the expense of the smaller countries . 
  now over to the history ( i opened the door to norway , so i will keep it open ) . 
  one of the major reasons why norway decided to stay out of [ eu was because of fishing ] ( http://www.euronews.com/2013/03/29/norway-and-the-eu/ ) . 
  we feared that opening our waters to fishing from eu countries would lead to a collapse in fish , as did happen in [ canada ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/collapse_of_the_atlantic_northwest_cod_fishery ) . 
  by a brief google search i found [ this ] ( http://www.ianduncan.org.uk/index.php/site/article/current_eu_norway_fish_talks_more_important_than_ever ) regarding the agreements of fishing in the north sea . 
  now to the point i am trying to make : if olav ( the norwegian ) entrust fritz ( the eu politician ) to allow fishing by gregor ( the scot ) , and all the others ( faroese , islandic , english , and irish ) in norwegian waters , it could lead to a fishing collapse which does not directly affect fritz . 
  this would be a decision pushed through by the uk ( loud voice ) and norway ( the quiet voice ) would be hurt by this . 
  fritz on the other hand , does not give two shits , because fritz does not work with fish . 
  and since norway is a [ contributor to the eu ] ( http://www.eu-norway.org/eu/financial-contribution/ ) , the support of olav , by fritz would be completely absent . 
  ( norway is not part of eu , and i cant find any estimate of how much norway would have been paying anually if we were , but when the eu discussion was big , it was said that norway would be giving , not recieving ) . 
  yeah , you were right , i didnt understand your empire point until you drew it out , but you are kind of supporting my argument with it . 
  roman empire was romans ruling over the english ( in your example ) more or less by force and on the expense of the english . 
   and your wrong . 
  following my logic , you would get ` hire the right person for the job , regardless of where they come from ' . 
  it 's how successful businesses run . 
  it 's how empires have been run . 
  ** i 'm gon na presume you 're of working-class income ** , for argument 's sake : you have much , much more in common with a working-class person from the other side of the world , than you do with the rich people in your society that form the political class . 
  didnt miss the `` purely for arguments sake '' bit , because its not there . 
  it did come off as if you were saying `` you are clearly an eu sceptic , and as such you must be working class '' . 
   local politicians are to be trusted , senior ones not ? 
  no politicians are to be trusted . 
  but if they are not `` local '' and situated far away , they should be trusted even less . 
  this is because no reprocussions will come of a decision made to affect an area far removed . 
  any person working with the emense amount of power these politicians do , should not be trusted . 
  we need them , no doubt , but still . 
   i do n't think i 've ever seen such a contradictory sentence . 
  i wo n't bother arguing , because that statement comes across like the angry ramblings of a pub drunk ... you have really no way of knowing that , and you are definitely not qualified to make that call by yourself . 
  not remotely . 
  heh , yeah but it was kind of the point . 
  it was a statement from me , so that it would allow you to get a clearer picture of my own opinions . 
  but if what you want from me is a way to `` solve '' the problems of governance in the eu , you wont get it . 
  what i am pointing at is the governance of ( lets say ) estland , by german delegates , and how the interest of the two not always allign . 
   `` this is the internet , no one is winning an argument here '' totally agree , ** if winning is indeed your goal ** . 
  nope not my goal . 
   so i took time to write this and illustrate how all your argumental ` facts ' are hubris : personal opinions , and a general air of ` everyone knows that ... ' . 
  its not scientific , it 's just your opinions , and should be framed as such . 
  and i appreciate the discourse . 
  while the statements i have made in this thread has mostly been opinions ( and given you plenty of ammunition against me ) , some of it is actually factual ( i included some sources this time around ) . 
  same thing could also be said about your statements btw . 
  this is the internet , no one is winning any argument here , but i think it is important that you get some input from a different perspective . 
  so here we go :  you forget that fritz 's tax contributions fund the hand-outs that keep olav in a job . 
  if the handouts were n't there and fritz and olav were actually competing , instead of cooperating , olav would probably be unemployed by now . 
  but of course , olav does n't notice the food , infrastructure and social systems kept afloat by the eu . 
  olav only gives a shit about himself , ethics be damned . 
  factually wrong . 
  overfishing in the north sea puts olav out of a job , and a rich norway makes norway a contributor to eu , not a recipiant of whatever fritz gives . 
  also fritz and olav are not directly competing , and fritz \u00b4 s lack of local knowlege destroys olav \u00b4 s possibility for long term sustainable work . 
  all due to short term gains for fritz . 
  what i am saying is that while some goals for both fritz and olav may allign , on most points they wont . 
   it 's how empires have been run . 
  feel free to start listing them , because i cant come up with a single one . 
  chinese ? 
  japanese ? 
  roman ? 
  british ? 
  which of them has ever been ruled by forigners as an empire ? 
   i 'm gon na presume you 're of working-class income your assumption is really far off , and that was an excessively arrogant statement . 
  lets say i was a member of the working class , does that somehow invalidate my point ? 
  does it fit your narrative better if i were from the working class ? 
   you have much , much more in common with a working-class person from the other side of the world , than you do with the rich people in your society that form the political class . 
  then why would i like to get my life dictated by some politician in brussels ? 
   you want a symbolic mascot politician that looks and sounds like you , assumptions are the mother of all fuckups . 
  no i do not want a mascot , but if you honestly think the politicians in brussels ( or anywhere else for that matter ) are there to `` serve the people '' , you are incredible naive . 
  local politicians listen to local population because of local repercussions of not doing so . 
  here is a statement for you ( so you can stop assuming ) : no politician really knows what the hell they are doing . 
  politicians are given positions , not due to ability , but rather political seniority ( how that assures quality is a mystery ) . 
  they are all power hungry animals , living in a small bubble . 
  if they had been working towards the greater good of europe , you wouldnt have any focus on which region would have too much power ( strasburg vs brussels ) because it wouldnt be a factor . 
  all countries in the eu would have equal votes with one representative only . 
  and creation of a federal eu would not be a problem , because politicians would not mind giving up power . 
  none of this will come to fruition because its not the way the world is . 
   xenophobia is the only answer . 
  it has nothing to do with xenophobia and everything to do with a local understanding of local problems . 
  while fishing rights in the north sea does not affect the fritz from berlin , it does affect olav from troms\u00f8 . 
  as a result it would serve olav less , to allow fritz to decide .

  i do n't understand `` 3 . 
  reform for national tv/radio '' . 
  why would it pass ? 
  tv as a medium is dying . 
  the proposed change would take a fee you can avoid ( by using netflix for example ) , and transforms it to a fee you ca n't avoid ( every household must pay , no matter what ) . 
  only an idiot would vote yes to that , considering what will change in the near future with internet based entertainment . . 
  but maybe i 'm biased . . 
  i have n't had a tv subscription in years . . and i have n't missed it either . 
  i would be very cross if i got a hefty bill for something i never use . 
  i 'm sure you do . 
  does not change the fact that every single fat person on this planet is eating more then they burn . 
  and that the only `` cure '' is to either eat less or to be more active . 
  what you linked is merely a huuuuge list of excuses people can tell themselves to justify why they are not in control of their own food consumption . 
  none of those things influence the amount of calories going in . 
  the only thing influencing calories going in , is your spoon or fork hand . 
  first of all , they are n't thin automatically . 
  either they eat way less or healthier than you think , or they are more active than you think . 
  probably a combination secondly , you probably eat more then you think you do . 
  there is no such thing as calorie free food . 
  if you are serious about losing weight , start [ counting calories ] ( https://www.myfitnesspal.com/ ) . 
  it 's a bit of a chore in the beginning , but there is no way to lie to yourself when you write down every calorie you eat or drink . 
  i guarantee that if you try religiously counting calories for a week or so , you will get a revelation . 
  pun intended , 
   i blame their parents and thank mine for the genetics there is no such thing . 
  fatness is a lifestyle problem , no matter how much fat people try to convince the world of `` conditions '' , `` genes '' and other reasons why it 's impossible for them to lay off the cheesy poofs or take a walk . 
  and what 's the probability of being killed by an arab terrorist attack in europe ? 
  just keep us out of it , and you can take in as many economic refugees as you wish . 
  had a similar thing happen with my tank when i was in the army , although luckily it was noticed before it ignited . 
  it 's most likely heat developing due to a pressure loss/leak in the transmission oil , it first smokes like crazy and eventually the oil catches fire . 
  it was very much a sleeping paragraph indeed . 
  in fact it was meant to be removed already in 2005 , when the parliament updated a bunch of laws . 
  it was delayed until know however , because of bureaucracy and implementation of new it systems . 
  so the afghan military and police death toll in afghanistan increases each year because the taliban is getting weaker ? 
  and american , until they started pulling out . 
  the drop in casualties coincides with the withdrawal of soldiers , not a lack of taliban activity . 
  politically , yes . 
  but in 2001 , their fighting force was a few thousand men . 
  now it is 60 000 strong . 
  in the same time frame , al-qaeda has gone from obscurity to ruling vast sunni populated areas in the middle east . 
  and that is called progress . 
  are you serious ? 
  the taliban is [ much stronger now than in 2001 ] ( http://www.voanews.com/content/despite-massive-taliban-death-toll-no-drop-in-insurgency/1866009.html ) take a look at the [ afhgan death toll ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_afghan_security_forces_fatality_reports_in_afghanistan ) .

  i do n't see any increasingly disorganized stragglers that are unable to coordinate attacks , do you ? 
  and we sure have killed a lot of them . 
  i 'm sure this will lead to less terror indeed . 
  how can it be poorly worded when they are literally writing the word `` homeopathic '' in the legislation ? 
  it could n't be clearer actually . 
  if it 's some weird attempt at sarcasm , let me just say that sarcasm in legislations would probably be the only thing that is worse than snake oil . 
  well , they basically have two choices . 
  either lose their certification over bullshit , losing quite a lot of money in the process . 
  or knowingly letting their sick fish suffer using ineffective treatments . 
  a lot of places do n't have a proper government , but that does not equal asylum rights . 
  it 's a bit like mexico . 
  there is open armed warfare with gangs like in somalia , but mexicans ca n't just seek asylum in the us . 
  you either need to be a proper un vetted refugee , like a syrian coming from a refugee camp , but then you simply `` win the lottery '' and get a proper plain ticket to europe . 
  or you need to a have a valid reason for asylum , i.e your own personal life or well being need to be in danger . 
  simply living in a poor or dangerous country is not enough . 
  the majority of the ones who come to norway is actually rejected . 
  but the whole process is slow and idiotic , often taking years . 
  a huge part does not . 
  they come from poor countries like eritrea and somalia . 
  they do n't flee from war , but from poverty . 
  unfortunately for them , that does not qualify for either refugee status or asylum . 
  then they come to europe , gets denied , and is shipped back . 
  or they just run off and become criminals . 
  oh , and a few percent of them die on the journey , because europe is afraid to say no . 
  it 's `` funny '' how fleeing is more dangerous than staying . 
  you do n't need to send them \\* back \\* , you just need to keep them from reaching europe . 
  just like australia did . 
  i 'm sure it 's possible to find some place to process them that is not in europe . 
  and is it more aligned to your ethics to send someone on a fool 's errand that will kill a huge percent of them , that only exists to line the pockets of unscrupulous middle men ? 
  legal proceedings against british companies drilling oil in british waters ? 
  good luck , argentina . 
  ~ ~ and yet , while only 22 % of norwegians answered they believed in any god in 2010 , and 29 % claimed to be atheist , we are expected to believe over 75 % of norwegians are religious today . ~ ~ edit : yeah i read it wrong . 
  the norwegian numbers can be around 50 % non-religious , which makes it plausible with a huge margin of error , considering the abysmal 22 % who believed in a god on the eurobarometer ( how can you be religious without believing in any god ) . 
  but the swedish numbers are still way off compared to norway . 
  they should be within ~ 5-10 % off each other . 
  i do n't believe the swedish numbers at all . 
  what on earth are these numbers based on ? 
  on the [ eurobarometer ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/ebs/ebs_341_en.pdf ) poll in 2010 ( page 204 ) , 34 % of swedes answered they were atheists , compared to 29 % of norwegians . 
  not a 25 % to 50 % difference as this thing claims . 
  unless 40 % of sweden suddenly turned atheist in the last 4-5 years . . 
  according to [ lego ] ( http://stores.lego.com/en-us/stores ) , there is only one official store in scandinavia , in denmark . 
  there is a ton of them in the us and canada though . . 
   all joking aside , poland has a better military than germany . 
  who is better in a strictly professional term is hard to say , but there is no doubt the polish armed forces have a lot more political and financial backing ( relatively ) , then the bundeswehr does . 
  the german army is constantly underfunded for its size , causing the sales and mothballing of existing military equipment and slowdowns and halts in new purchases . 
  well , of course they can . 
  they are europe 's third largest economy . 
  they can negotiate a better deal , because they are several times more important to the eu economy then we are . 
  it 's pretty damn stupid to think the eu can freeze out the uk without at the same time shooting the eu in the foot . 
  or in the first place wish to do such a thing . 
  yeah , just like switzerland is a poor country . 
   ( also increasing a 5 % tax by 300 % makes it a 20 % tax ) me no smart at math :(, 
  this tells me absolutely nothing without context . 
  if previously the lowest income was taxed 5 % , and it was increased to 15 % , that 's a 300 % increase . 
  if the highest was previously taxed 45 % , and it was increased to 49 % , that 's a 9 % increase . 
  there is nothing unreasonable about either scenario . 
  you ca n't increase already heavy taxation by the same percent amount as the lower tax brackets .

  [ thank god for university internet !, 
  ] ( http://www.speedtest.net/result/3693911004.png ) romania is lucky though , being able to build a network from scratch . 
  here there is a lot of adsl , but fiber is becoming more and more available . 
  it 's expensive though !, 
  i blame the lack of competition . 
  they already earn the same if not more than a factory wage as well as paying less taxes . 
  the results would n't surprise me . 
  everyone i have met does n't care about cannabis legalization . 
  people have more important issues on their hands , especially now . 
   what you can see here is that it is actually quite efficient to hire a danish employee . 
  danish employers have to pay a relatively high income tax for their employees , but still denmark is at the bottom of this chart ( i.e. 
  less costly to employ ) . 
  which is useless when you do n't factor in wage levels and productivity . 
  [ danish workers are less productive than belgians therefore it may still be more worth it in the end . 
  ] ( http://stats.oecd.org/index.aspx?datasetcode=pdb_gr )  in most other countries , employers and employees are forced to pay stuff like social security and health insurance . 
  we handle everything over taxes in denmark . 
  does that mean you get a better system ? 
  it does n't have to be since both norway and sweden handle healthcare and social security through dedicated taxes . 
  does n't mean the service is better in denmark though . 
   we also have stuff that they do n't have in most other european countries , like the study grants that give each student $ 1000/month for studying ( not a loan ) as well as cheap student loans like elsewhere . 
  the money covered by grants is probably the only benefit that is a little better in denmark than other countries . 
  is it worth paying 50 % tax for ? 
  i do n't think so . 
   we have various other kinds of transfer payments , at the top of my head there 's boligst\u00f8tte which is support for renters , high child support . 
  not unique to denmark . 
   and lots of money spent on infrastructure and culture . 
  how do you define lots ? 
  everything is relative . 
  the infrastructure in denmark is on par with the rest of the western countries . 
  not to mention that denmark is a very tiny country which makes it very easy to build infrastructure . 
  culture spending is also something that does n't really matter . 
  why should i pay for some mediocre artist or painter to be able to live of his work if it 's not sustainable without public support ? 
   that is a moot point . 
  norway is still much wealthier even when you compare at purchasing power parity . 
  maybe because we do n't tax people as much as in denmark !, 
   most western countries do not have the same level of welfare at all , not sure where you get that from ? 
  you 're from norway , you should know better . 
  so countries like the netherlands , germany , austria and france does not have free schooling , free healthcare and unemployment benefits ? 
   yeah , and that is a huge part of the budget . 
  not at all compared to other oil producing countries . 
  also it 's not like 100 % of the budget goes to welfare . 
  the state waste a whole lot of money so with a little more efficiency we could reduce costs by atleast 10 % with no problem at all . 
   and that 's not counting the higher wage in general in norway that come about as part of the petroleum sector ( 20-25 % of gdp ) which results in a higher portion of taxable income . 
  the higher wages also result in higher costs . 
  around 25 % actually . 
  that means that even if we use more money on something , it does n't mean that we get more of it . 
  then your welfare state has to be horribly inefficient considering most western countries have the same level of welfare while paying less taxes . 
  most of norway 's welfare state is actually paid for by regular taxes that does n't have anything to do with the oil industry . 
  around 10 % of the state budget is financed with petroleum money . 
  that 's insane . 
  i know that no one here would have accepted a 50 % tax rate !, 
  i do n't know anyone who pays 50 % tax . 
  the average person in norway pays around 30 % . 
  really ? 
  i have never seen so many empty shelves in my life . 
  usually it 's just a few items missing , but they either get it later or another store has it . 
  on the motorways in the southeast the speedlimits are 110 km/h, 
  i know that a lot of countries who have just found large natural resources look to norway as an inspiration on how to manage the money . 
   as i said in another comment the massive sovereign wealth fund for a small population is good for future security too . 
  the way norway had handled their state finances ever since the war has been absolutely brilliant . 
  the number one priority for politicians regardless of where they have been at the political spectrum has been to keep people working . 
  that means that unemployment has always been low , even during recessions . 
  the sovereign wealth fund is also going to help a lot during harder times . 
   norway has a lot going for it it seems . 
  it 's pretty great , but there are some things that need improvement . 
  rail and road infrastructure comes to mind . 
  in the next 10 years however we are going to invest around 72 billion euros in infrastructure so it 's going to be a huge improvement . 
  i can see already when driving around that there a lot of roadworks and freshly paved asphalt !, 
  norwegians like to complain about how expensive things are . 
  but when compared to income it evens out pretty good . 
  your average grocery job pays like $ 18 per hour + added pay when working weekends and nights to give a perspective . 
  not to mention people here have no problem finding a job . 
  it 's nearly impossible to fail at life here . 
  you can really say you are living life on easy mode !, 
  if you buy all your drinks out then sure . 
  if you buy some beforehand it 's not that expensive . 
  you can only do this with best before products though . 
  if they are labeled `` use-by '' it 's not allowed to sell it , atleast in norway . 
  to be fair , it 's only in lower paying jobs like in retail you have a higher quality of life in norway . 
  because things are so expensive , highly skilled jobs pay better abroad . 
  if i would still keep a norwegian salary however it would be a simple choice !, 
  in case you did n't understand , it 's annoying from a norwegian , swiss , icelandic etc.

  [ from the city of harstad in northern norway ] ( http://www.speedtest.net/result/3672884728.png ) .

  i would still prefer norway to romania even though the internet is slightly faster in the former country . 
  it was forest fires in the middle of the winter in norway . 
  if it has n't rained and the grass is dry , it can happen pretty easily . 
  norway can actually pay off the greek debt and still have a negative debt to gdp ratio !, 
  how are they going to work hard when there is n't many jobs available in the first place ? 
  guess you kind of get used to building tunnels here . 
  that 's why they are pretty decent . 
  just like crossing the border into norway from sweden . 
  it could be worse . 
  you could be driving on norwegian roads ... 
  meanwhile in norway we have a lack of labour and need to import it . 
  this is despite automation . 
  i assume there is n't much public support of it either . 
  a poll in norway showed that only 13 % were positive to legalize it .

  and it is still has a quite extensive welfare state . 
   `` the numbers of refugees wanting to go home is growing every week -- ** once they discover they ca n't bring their families here , they give up on germany ** , '' said ardalan hassan , the head of the dania travel agency in the wedding district of berlin . 
  i think this is the main lesson to take from this . 
  adult men have typically travelled to germany on their own with the thought of bringing their families over once they have made it there . 
  take away that right , and it will be much less practical and affordable for people to come . 
   the increase in the number of refugees returning home could offer some unexpected relief to chancellor angela merkel she , frankly , does ** not ** deserve that . 
  but in all fairness her countrymen certainly do . 
  after all , not many people will ask them their side of the story if the question is more likely to be answered with rocks than with words . 
  those scenes are so beautiful that no nearby country will ever allow it to be independent . 
  and to create a safe haven for swedes when they eventually start fleeing the mess . 
   many are refugees fleeing war in the middle east , while others are escaping human rights abuses in afghanistan , eritrea and other conflict zones . 
  well , if they are refugees fleeing from that then why the heck do they take with them the ** same behavior they are fleeing from ? 
  ** i have no words . 
  amen . 
  i wish this could be done by other european countries instead . 
  i think it 's not safe to rely on a faraway country that is increasingly indebted and that might have its own agendas and interests in mind . 
  after all , it would take one day for the us to leave nato , but many years for other nato members to fill the resulting gap . 
  realistically though , this will either be done mainly by the us , or not done at all . 
  and i definitely understand why it is being requested . 
   trump the second most anti-war candidate , he 's never going to use a nuke . 
  he is on the record of having supported the wars he now claims always to have opposed . 
  also he seems like an extremely impulsive personality . 
  looking at his reactions when he feels `` insulted '' by individuals , it 's scary to think about how he will react when feeling `` insulted '' by countries . 
   criticizing a presidential candidate for being narcissistic or brash is absurd . 
  are you , personally , comfortable with handing a nuclear arsenal over to someone widely suspected of being a pathological narcissist ? 
  then where will germans flee ? 
  and will it turn into neu-deutschland ? 
  but hitler is first and formost known for the type of atrocities that putin has n't even been close to committing . 
  i think comparing putin with mussolini makes much more sense . 
  but even a person who is 100 % right on the issues might still be disliked for personality reasons . 
  given trump 's extreme narcissism and brashness , even those who agree with his policies might at the same time be scared as hell of giving that man control over thousands of nuclear weapons . 
  why ? 
  putin is a repulsive human being . 
  meanwhile his actions , although ** very ** unsympathetic , have made his country a powerful player on the world stage , he has been repeatedly successful in outsmarting his western opponents , and he is more popular than ever at home . 
  obviously his actions have been stupid in terms of the economic consequences . 
  but since he happens to lead a country where the electorate prioritizes more territory over more money , he himself has nonetheless ended up stronger than ever . 
  it 's not zig-zagging to express recognition of putin 's political skills while at the same time recognizing him as an unsympathetic human being . 
  yeah . 
  obviously they do n't want to see the societies they fled from being recreated in their new home countries . 
  in other words , both americans and europeans will get a chance do what they enjoy the most . 
  i think it 's impossible to expect germany to have any control over this situation when they do n't even have control over the situation unfolding in their own country . 
   reason why germany sends ukrains back ? 
  fucking arabs man ... because the risk of deportation being met with a violent reaction is ** significantly ** lower when it comes to them . 
  if they want to avoid deportation they should probably behave more like some of their me counterparts . 
  for the sake of the city of iskitim , i really hope the two beavers in the first one are of the opposite sex . 
  but i think the biggest problem with the us interventions is that when you choose to engage in the middle east ( and elsewhere ) , the plans seem to be based on an assumption that mentally speaking the people who live there are americans who just have n't discovered it yet . 
  but the fact is that there is a huge historical and cultural gap between america and the middle east , which is why the american attempts to nation-build and democratize that region have ended in chaos and strengthened the very forces that hate america and threaten us all . 
  i guess that this ignorance is the downside of being located far away from that region of the world . 
  but obviously i guess the upsides of it more than make up for that . 
   ` we will not give up now ' well neither will we !, 
  ^ ^ i ^ ^ hope these people should definitely be helped a lot more than they have been . 
  but the solution ca n't be to bring them all to germany , or other european countries for that matter . 
  they must be helped in local countries that have a culture and mindset that is closer to them . 
  http://www.forbes.com/pictures/mel45efdk/mark-zuckerbergs-backyard/ how many syrian refugees has he welcomed ? 
  that 's difficult to forget , especially after the libyan intervention . 
  toppling a cruel but tamed dictator in libya , which predictably turned africa 's richest country into a jihadist mess full of refugees heading for europe , has been the biggest act of lunacy from european powers so far in this century . 
  edit : misspelling . 
  compared to 75 years ago , germany 's approach has shifted from populating the rest of the world with germans , to populating germany with the rest of the world . 
  i hope that germany will find a middle way one day . 
  it was probably easy to take these guys out of afghanistan . 
  taking afghanistan out of them on the other hand ... 
  yeah , good that they are doing something about this degeneracy , instead of focusing on virtuous patriotic acts like political assassinations , embezzlement and massive corruption . 
  no , but to create a situation which will deter more refugees from coming . 
   the calculus behind the decision was clearly stated by austrian interior minister johanna mikl-leitner weeks ago . 
  greece can not and will not hold migrants and refugees . 
  ...  mikl-leitner said that ** one needs images of desperate refugees and migrants stranded on greece 's beaches in order to deter people from coming to europe . 
  ** she says that after a few weeks north africans , afghans , and perhaps even syrians and iraqis will stop coming because they will know that they have no chance of arriving in the north of europe . 
  [ about the national interest ] ( http://nationalinterest.org/about-the-national-interest )  it is about american interests . 
   say what you want about trump but at least he has platform that doesnt benefit only small amount of rich people . 
  but he in turn seem to be very extreme in terms of personality . 
  although his platform might not be , the thought of someone like that in charge of thousands of nuclear weapons is n't exactly calming , to put it that way . 
  germany 1939-45 : let 's populate the rest of the world with germans !, 
  germany today : let 's populate germany with the rest of the world !, 
   so no harry potter fandom in ksa i guess they reject german weapons then . 
  true . 
  i think it would decrease the flow to an extent , so it should be done , but unfortunately greece would still have a problem i think . 
  partially because syria is much closer to europe , making more people willing to try to come , and also because the size of the refugee population has grown so massively recently . 
  as for libya , it 's impossible now because of the unstable situation there . 
  i just hope that we have learned the lesson now that toppling a dictator when the most likely replacement is a jihadist chaos should ** not ** be done again . 
  ideally that should be the solution . 
  if we want to take in , they should be filtered outside the eu and then be brought in , rather than them just storming in illegally . 
  but that very much depends on a cooperative approach from turkey in order to decrease the flow to the greek islands and send back those who come illegally . 
  and that approach does n't seem to be there at all . 
   our islands are n't human storages either . 
  they have people living in them . 
  then the camps , if built , could be fenced off from the local population . 
   it would be like saying `` oh , it 's fine , we do n't ask all of norway to become a refugee camp , just a couple of regions '' . 
  would that be acceptable to you ? 
  of course no , but if the choice was between all of it or just a couple of regions , obviously the latter would be the least bad option . 
  and if news then spread that refugees simply wo n't get out of those regions/islands , the flow would get a lot smaller i guess . 
  isolating the refugees on the islands might therefore be the best option . 
  or maybe avoid shipping all of them to the mainland , and rather ask other countries for help to build camps on the islands ? 
   the wider issue is that refusal of refugees is against international law , but the refugees concerned are already in safety in turkey and other countries before they travel to europe . 
  it should n't be a problem to refuse them then . 
  true , and as a norwegian i wo n't moralize . 
  but in the times we live in , we might not have any choice . 
  i know it sounds harsh . 
  but he should have been open about his plan to travel to austria when he applied . 
  the fact that he concealed it made the immigration officer sceptical , especially since he comes from a very radicalized country from which europe gets many illegal migrants . 
   turkey , lebanon and jordan have been dealing with a refugee problem for decades .

  i 'm not saying they wo n't face tough readjustments , nor am i supporting their system , but in terms of economy they 've still pulled off some incredible feats . 
  but so have many other dictators done - it 's amazing what you can do when you do n't have to give much consideration to individual suffering . 
  a meritocracy without elections is still a dictatorship . 
  and dictators are only good for target practice . 
  personally , if anyone like that was dictator , i 'd pick up arms to fight them . 
  and this is the biggest problem : no matter who you pick , if there 's no prospect of voting them out , someone will pick up arms to fight them sooner or later . 
  personally , my threshold for considering armed rebellion against a dictator would be * very * low . 
  the foremost problem with a meritocracy is that we do n't agree what is best for people . 
  most dictators do n't set out to be evil , and many of the worst dictators through history has explicitly set out at least initially with the goal of doing good , and will look good to a lot of people . 
  heck , many dictators that are widely reviled * did * do lots of good stuff too . 
  saddam hussein started his career in politics ( after participating in a coup , mind you ) as an effective reformer that built the iraqi education and health systems to some of the best on the region , and did lots of good for the iraqi economy , for example . 
  he presented himself , and probably believed it , as doing what the nation needed . 
  even when later murdering dissidents and throwing iraq into wars . 
  but if you looked at husseins * early * record before he got enough power to do as he pleased , and were to judge based on merit , he might have looked like a good candidate . 
  even with the coup - it was against a dictator ; an unelected stooge of britain and the us that was widely reviled . 
  his bad sides were first truly exposed once he had spent a long time consolidating his power and it was too late for anyone to oppose him . 
  this is the problem with creating a system where the transfer of power and the support of that system of transfer of power is not deeply ingrained throughout society : you need the idea of someone not going peacefully after a few years to be so jarring , shocking , and offensive that even an initially good leader that suddenly decides they 'd like to hold on to the reigns will just get laughed at and brushed aside , without anyone consider it a serious option . 
  because the moment it is a serious option , it becomes just a matter of time before someone takes advantage . 
   the soviets where only arguably communist , they claimed they where and enacted some communist sounding ideas but fundamentally they where just a very oppressive extremist socialist totalitarian regime . 
  just to add to this : most people have heard about the october revolution . 
  which is a * remarkable * feat of `` branding '' . 
  because the actual revolution happened in spring . 
  the czar abdicated . 
  a new preliminary government was * elected * , where sr ( socialist revolutionaries ) and the mensheviks ( `` left communists '' that believed russia needed to further develop as a capitalist/bourgeoise society before a socialist revolution could happen - in line with marx ' theories ) and other smaller socialist groups together formed a workable majority , and kerensky , a liberal socialist , took over from lvov . 
  in elections later in the year , the bolsheviks got only about 10 % , decided this could n't possibly represent the will of the people ( because people did n't vote for them in much larger numbers ) , declared that the soviets - organized predominantly by the bolsheviks themselves , and thus dominated by them , - were the legitimate sources of power , and wrested control away from the democratically elected * socialist and communist dominated government * in a coup . 
  then they systematically started alienating , arresting and/or murdering their opposition , which included pretty much * everyone * including the * vast majority * of communist politicians and ideologists in russia who opposed them . 
  the point being of course that you can have libertarian and authoritarian groups on opposing sides of a conflict that both claim to represent the same ideology ... 
  i 'm a marxist , and i find the thought of police visiting people for statements like in the example absolutely abhorrent . 
   i 'm scared of the hidden terrorists in the migrant population . 
  even if the number of terrorist victims increases by an order of magnitude , terror would n't be likely to even make the top 100 list of causes of death . 
  so far in europe you are far more likely to get killed by lightning than by a terrorist , for example . 
  does n't mean the risks should be ignored , but neither is there any reason to play them up . 
   far lefties hate liberals the term `` libertarian '' was coined by a french anarcho-communist , and was frequently used by founder of the socialist league , that counted friedrich engels and eleanor marx amongst their supporters . 
  right wing libertarianism was first invented about a century later . 
  libertarianism is generally considered a subset of liberalism . 
  the first international split over the conflicts between the liberal socialists , communists and anarchists that wanted to dismantle the state rapidly , and those willing to use the state apparatus . 
  yet new libertarian socialist factions rapidly arose again in the international after the liberals left . 
  lenin was so incensed over the liberal communists , that he wrote a screed called `` left communism : an infantile disorder '' specifically denouncing liberal and libertarian communists . 
  the socialist and communist groups that actually got widespread support after the revolution in spring 1917 in russia were all liberal , and for that they ended up being hunted down and arrested or killed in the years after the bolsheviks coup . 
  you know of the collectivists today because they 're the ones that were willing to use violence and military style discipline to get what they wanted , while the liberal socialist and communist groups were caught off guard by the bolshevik coup . 
  internationally many of the liberal left wing groups were pushed into obscurity , harassed , assassinated in many cases ( stalin sent komintern agents to `` help '' the left in the spanish civil war , for example , but at the same time he wanted franco contained , not beaten , and so his agents were murdering socialists and communists that were opposed to stalin all over the place ) until most of the liberal revolutionary groups left were small fringe groups . 
  that 's because it is n't a direct requirement . 
  membership in the council of europe , on the other hand , is a requirement . 
  and membership in the council of europe does require participation in the echr . 
  so the requirement is indirect . 
  ( note : do n't confuse coe with the european council ; the coe is not a eu organ - and even russia is a member ), 
   but as a lot of eu countries are looking to change dublin iii into something else that will probably feature relocating them it wo n't necessarily be around to participate in at that time nor forever . 
  tha 's what i was referring to . 
  except of course it 's not a eu law , and not a law where the highest court of appeal is an eu court . 
   saying every person who lives in `` self made intolerable conditions '' deserves refuge in gb is insane . 
  which is why nobody has said that , and certainly not this court . 
   there is no such right as `` being able to live near your family '' , ok ? 
  the european convention on human rights grants a right to family life . 
  a british court has just found that this in some cases does give the right to being able to live near your family . 
  of course you are free to disagree with the court , but unless overturned on appeal , it does appear that in the uk you have that right in some circumstances . 
   but we do n't organize our laws around `` likes and dislikes '' , but around what will work best for citizens . 
  which is the reason the right to a family life was written into the echr . 
  while i realise i am pretty much calling down godwin : the parliament/reichstag was the control for the weimar republic too . 
  it voted to hand hitler dictatorial powers , despite the nsdap holding a minority of votes and depended on a number of other parties votes to give hitler his powers . 
  unlike most other countries today , the uk is one of very few countries where parliament has the legal power to do something similar . 
  in other words : elected representatives have a history of doing fucked up shit that they should not be allowed to do . 
  while it seems exceedingly unlikely that something like that would happen again , nobody thought it would happen in the first place , and nobody thought those powers would be abused the way they were , which is how they managed to convince the other parties , who mostly actively disliked the nsdap ( but disliked the left wing parties even more ) . 
   parliament 's sovereignty is taken directly from the mandate it is given by the people , it can not therefore be abused because if it is , they have already lost the mandate . 
  the current majority in parliament does not have the support of a majority of the people . 
  it only has a mandate under a broken electoral system that effectively disenfranchises large parts of the population . 
  want to make sure to set a good example for russia etc. 
  i see . 
  indirectly . 
  eu membership requires membership of the council of europe , and membership of the council of europe requires being part of the echr, 
  does n't help if the countries you try to deport people to are now longer part of the agreement that requires them to accept said people in . 
  you can try to deport them , and watch them get stopped as they try to enter the schengen area without a valid visa . 
   no legal basis for deporting asylum seekers back to other eu countries . 
  i 'm looking forward to using this line to people who want the uk to leave the eu for anti-immigration reasons and watch their heads explode . 
  ( yes , i realise there 'd be various tradeoffs in how many might be allowed in ; does n't mean it wo n't be fun watching them try to process that little bit ), 
  this is by design , exactly because as successive british governments have shows , national governments are very eager to try to stamp all over human rights if they 're allowed to . 
  in the case of the uk , uk constitutional principles explicitly enshrine the sovereignty of parliament : parliament can at any point decide to alter the law to specifically override the echr ( though doing so would put uk membership in council of europe , and by extension of the eu , at risk ) . 
  the echr is indirectly a binding part of eu treaties , as membership of the council of europe ( not to be confused by the european council ) is required of all eu members , and membership of council of europe includes accepting the echr . 
  even russia is a member of coe - leaving it would leave the uk a pariah in europe . 
  it 's much easier now , i believe . 
  it was n't easier then to get off the hook * before * moving . 
  afterwards it was a formality , though they kept writing demanding that i applied for permission and atached evidence of residency ( ! ) . 
  i ended up telling them something along the lines of `` you wrote to me on my uk address , and i 'm answering that letter , proving i got it , so fuck off '' . 
  i have n't heard from them since . 
  it also probably would have been easier if i had n't specifically made a nuisance of myself , and this was the second or third time they i 'd tried drafting me ( the previous times just did n't show up , and got an angry letter a few months later , and was put back in the pool ) . 
  basically they want you to give * them * control over whether or not they allow you to avoid service . 
  and that was explicitly what i was objecting to . 
  it 's kinda funny in norway because they make very little effort at hauling you in . 
  basically police find it a waste of resources , and military police have basically no rights until you 've been enrolled . 
  so they 'll use military police to hand over the draft notices to ensure they have witnesses ( courts have long refused to accept that it 's enough to mail them , and anyone who cares enough to do this know better than to sign for recorded delivery around the times the notices go out ) . 
  but then when it 's time to show up they ca n't do much more than call and occasionally try to convince police to show up on your doorstep . 
  so then they 'd charge you afterwards instead . 
  but these days they very rarely do - only about 40 % of eligible men are enlisted anyway , because the military does n't need more , so it 's only very occasionally to make an example if someone tries very hard to make them pay special attention ( like when i wrote a letter pointing out that i would on principle refuse to obey orders without considering on a case by case basis whether it 'd be more moral for me to obey or to shoot superior officers in the back - that kind of thing ... ) i must admit i took some pleasure in being a nuisance too . 
  i was called in for a police interview for the above , because the department of justice somehow inexplicably had decided that since their rules had nothing in them for letters like mine ( where i demanded to released from any and all service ) , they would treat it as an application for civil service ( despite my letter explicitly stating that i would refuse that too ) . 
  so i spent several hours being interviewed by a police officer i hope was dyslexic ( there 's no other reasonable excuse for an adult to spell that badly ) and giving her really obnoxious answers ( e.g. 
  despite my letter clearly stating that in certain situations i would be prepared to shoot superior officers , she dutifully followed her script which asked me questions to determine that i was not a pacifist , as being a pacifist is a valid reason for refusing conscription and one that they * really * do n't like , so i answered things like `` sure , in hypothetical case x i 'd happily shoot the person in the face '' and similar ) . 
  then the morons sued me , stating that they wanted the court to declare based on my interview that their refusal of my `` application for civil service '' was valid . 
  so i wrote the court a letter and pointed out that anyone with any kind of reading comprehension could see that i specifically had not applied for civil service , but in fact refused civil service categorically . 
  i was as rude as i could about them while sticking to the facts . 
  the judge dismissed the case without even holding a hearing :d frustrating bureaucrats is fun . 
  the principle of it .

  above average , not equal though . 
  although it 's not actual * spending * , it 's done by using tax breaks . 
  the oecd report compared apples to oranges in that sense . 
  the article goes on to say :  you might say that a tax break is n't the same as a spending program . 
  you would be wrong . 
  tax breaks do not apply universally or equally for the citizens in question . 
  speaking of tax breaks :  european governments offer public childcare . 
  in the u.s. , we have child tax credits . 
  is n't it great to have the money to pay for a childcare professional !, 
  that market does n't actually work that well . 
  it 's either amateurs or expensive commercial facilities . 
  in the uk childcare is so expensive it 's often more profitable for the mother to stay at home ... 
  i 'd rather have the public childcare . 
  well , it appeared higher/different when i wrote it , i blame reddit . 
  still , one too many . 
   not helping either side would result in so many more civilian deaths , and years more conflict i 'm not even sure that 's true . 
  if we support the fsa , and the extremists among them , are we setting up a state that will commit atrocities in the name of religion for decades to come ? 
  is that the price for saving * some * lives now ? 
  - if western forces enter , destroy the regime , what happens to the alawites and christians ? 
  would the wahabist-jihadis attack nato peacekeeping forces afterwards ? 
  - if the assad regime remains in power , even in just parts , it would probably `` clean house '' and rape/kill their enemies . 
  so that 's no good . 
  - if the democratic elements of the fsa won , it could turn out well for everyone . 
  i doubt * that * will happen , the foreign and local `` extremists '' probably want a strict islamic republic . 
  as it stands neither group is gaining ground , but i believe the regime is consolidating and reinforcing its grip on key areas and cities . 
  if the conflict ended now , the native sunni population could possibly split away , the alawites keeping their part of the country . 
  the kurds were already more independent , and have always wanted their own country , as promised by the british ( before wwii ) . 
   yes , at this point in time the muslim brotherhood has been much less violently totalitarian yes , of course , they have n't had the chance yet to be that totalitarian government . 
  well , except in egypt , where the `` ex-mb '' president tried and failed to grab extended powers . 
   i 'd prefer it did n't , in both cases . 
  let me rephrase that , i do n't want it to reflect any religion , but i have to respect that they want something different . 
  it 's entirely reasonable that they want their religion and values to be represented . 
   you ca n't convert from islam , there are sexist inheritance laws , and more nonsense . 
  those are objectionable from a western/secular point of view , but it 's not our place to decide either . 
  those are quite `` acceptable '' from a muslim point of view . 
  i would n't accept them in europe , but i can see why those central tenets of islam would be put into law in an arab country . 
   there 's a difference between a powerless head of state technically , the cabinet ministers also had to be members of a christian church until last year . 
  the cabinet nominated bishops until 2012 . 
  the king is still head of state , and head of our armed forces , but that symbolic in reality . 
   i do n't support an intervention . 
  i just do n't think that assad 's totalitarian `` secular '' state is worth much more than a totalitarian theocratic state . 
  we are in agreement then , hehe . 
  i just favor the devil we know ... 
   not that syria under assad is actually secular anyway . 
  it 's still an islamic state pre-conflict syria was n't much of a theocracy . 
  assad comes from the socialist ba'ath party , as i 'm sure you know , not exactly the muslim brotherhood . 
  there is a difference between islamic state and an islamist one . 
  i live in a constitutionally christian kingdom , is my state automatically a theocracy ? 
  the head of state has to be christian , the church is official and so are the values of our lutheran religion . 
  syrians are muslim , their state should be allowed to reflect that . 
   i have no idea what western countries can/should be doing in this situation . 
  but i wo n't be relieved at all if assad wins . 
  yes , i 'm not saying either outcome is better , just that i do n't see why we should support any of them . 
  is n't it better that they find their own solutions ? 
  the west has done enough harm in the middle east , and we get nothing good from intervening . 
  yes . 
  though i admit , i rather meant that * those who do n't agree * with koleye and myself are likely overwhelmingly arabs or muslims . 
  those who see assad as bad , and claim the `` opposition '' is simply good . 
  i edited my statement to conform to this . 
  i would like to believe europeans in general do n't have this black/white image . 
   syria is a mess at the moment , with many factions within the rebels , ranging from those who want freedom and democracy , to al queda and far right extremists . 
  so many downvotes for daring to speak the truth about a conflict !, 
  i doubt many of those who downvoted you were without ties to the region or religion ( s ) . 
  europe should stay out of that mess , i ca n't see any good coming from of helping either side there . 
   i think it will come bite us in the ass . 
  maybe not literally * our * asses , but i think it will mean more suffering of various kinds for the syrian people ( s ) ; and possibly in the neighboring countries . 
  either way it 's not positive for humanity . 
  what rises from a brutal war ? 
   every day my respect for the eu lessens . 
  greece has a very different view of the eu than most other countries . 
  i 'm * not * saying it 's loved in every other european country . 
  still , the greek view is far from average . 
  i have some greek friends , it 's like we live on different worlds . 
  your media 's demonization of the eu and germany is understandable , but not objective reality from where i sit . 
   as both sides are pretty awful . 
  interestingly , you were `` heavily '' downvoted for speaking the objective truth [ from our point of view ] . 
  i believe those who disagree with us in europe , about the nature of both sides in this conflict , are people of arab descent , or religious muslims . 
  the most extreme of them want a `` religious '' state in syria . 
  while assad 's supporters , i.e. 
  some syrian expats , mourn the loss of their once stable country . 
  sweden has a huge minority of syrians , i wonder where they stand . 
  edit : clarification, 
   i am not sure what game the eu is trying to play but it will back-fire . 
  we have supported arab dictators too long . 
  it 's great to support democratic movements , but syria is more complex than libya . 
  i 'm afraid we risk making things even worse for decades to come . 
   assad is no friend of the west yes , but are the groups fighting in syria , including the fsa , actually * our * friends ? 
  i 've seen a few recent documentaries from within syria , * some * of the sunnis fighting assad 's troops are far from moderate muslims . 
  i would not support them , because the outcome might not be to our liking ( theocracy ) . 
  i do n't like assad , but he kept syria secular . 
  it 's reddit , always assume the worst , hehe . 
   more or less integrated into the society yeah , that 's the issue i was thinking of . 
  the same applies in every european country , just with more recent immigrants . 
  it 's a good sign when your country 's media is free to mock your leaders , 
  i 'm pretty sure barcelona & co are watching and dreaming , 
   it 's just that his name did n't need to be publicized to the rest of the country . 
  yeah , but i 'm pretty sure he gave his explicit permission for that to happen . 
  otherwise the newspapers and media would have stayed silent about the name . 
  i think he realized his name was ruined , so it 's better to be `` open '' and on the offensive . 
  that way he could create doubt and possibly survive politically .

  it 's not only interest rates either , but also a ton of other policies , like forcing banks to lend out to customers that could not otherwise get a mortgage and so on . 
   the hoarding comes from individuals who want to save money , cause  they think that future prospects are not so bright . 
  individuals do not save money , cause they think that they can influence prices with it that 's what any responsible person would do . 
   or they are calculating that the money will gain value in the future no . 
   why . 
  if you see that money loses value due to more money being on the market , you will be more likely to spend it . 
  why is that a good thing if it 's not purposeful ? 
   why would that happen , tho ? 
  you do not give out money for free , your are lending money to the banks for  low/negative interest . 
  so only people who need/want money will borrow it . 
  this is what i am talking about : misallocations in the economy , bubbles etc. 
  it 's a boom/bust cycle created by this train of thought . 
  money is very very cheap . 
  the cheaper the money is , the more risks people take . 
  and that 's what 's happened . 
  if you compare , maybe , but http://www.nationaldebtclocks.org/debtclock/spain -  99 % of gdp is not good . 
  and yes it has everything to do with greece . 
  both countries have spent more money than they can afford . 
  in a keynes world it is a nasty problem . 
  but in a healthy economy it would n't be . 
  it would just mean that people got more productive . 
  no , it forces people to invest , and often it ends up being bad investments because the money are so cheap . 
  how 's that working for europe ? 
  the economy has been `` boosted '' by low interest rates for a long time , but sooner or later you will hit a wall . 
  inflation / money printing leads to huge misallocations in the economy and can allow a bloated public sector to live . 
  once it tries to clean itself up , or slows down , you will get deflationary effect . 
  because it rewards spending and punishes saving and production . 
  the value of money is watered out . 
  https://mises.org/library/economics-one-lesson https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj4ttnesudq, 
  you know you have a screwed system when you `` need more money printing '', 
  source ? 
  and i would like a historical one from 1950/69ish-present, 
  in short - they consume more than they produce !, 
  and faking numbers and loaning money lets them continue doing that . 
  and that is true for a lot of countries . 
  that is not what a government should be doing . 
  i am talking about what got greece in the hole to begin with - debt !, 
  they got goldman-sachs to forge fake numbers to get more loan than they should have . 
  and it 's not only greece , but portugal , spain etc etc. 
  it 's like `` if those people can do it , then i can '' , and it spreads like cancer . 
  methaphorically speaking : there is no nice way to get a drug addict to go cold turkey . 
  no , it is really that simple . 
  you simply do n't spend money you do n't have , and certainly not money you ca n't pay back . 
  true , and it shows how violently it grows without them . 
  even they could n't stop the spending ... 
  of course they say this , they have to defend their own policy of endless money printing . 
  yes, 
  funds ? 
  what funds ? 
  i thought the * whole point * of reddit is to be an * alternative * to mainstream media among other things ... good luck waiting for a mainstream media to report it ... 
  you can appeal , the flair is now `` removed - lacking credible source and low quality '' . 
  now you have the `` credible source '' and low quality = ? 
  thanks . 
  so it 's not a `` forged '' video . 
  the dangers of sharing from the `` wrong '' youtube account . 
  i have been there , 
  did you find that video there from them ? 
  ok i traced the video to the fb page `` f ** k you im from skaune '' . 
  in the description it says this : `` the video is part of a global campaign launched on april 15th 2016 entitled , `` muslim youth : pioneers of real change '' and organised by the women 's section in the central media office of hizb ut tahrir that seeks to address the identity crisis facing many muslim youth internationally today . '', 
  right , so let 's find this site . 
  https://www.youtube.com/user/therevivalproduction/videos the swedish one is nowhere to be found . 
  someone must have gone through a great deal of effort to fake the video since the intro etc is identical . 
  here 's a `` legit '' uk example : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=txkdvpnhjh4 - pretty similar message !, 
  it 's stupid if it 's a setup , no other sources ? 
  does that change the video though ? 
   i alle \u00e5r ?

  usa er intet eksempel p\u00e5 et fritt marked .

  nope . 
  for \u00e5 sette det p\u00e5 spissen . 
  la oss si at du er slave . 
  du kan le , men det er faktum !, 
  i am not opposed to healthy environment , it 's just like idiots like `` mrjonas '' think that i am opposed to something that 's not a law . 
  too bad the constitution we celebrate has been butchered recently . 
  i totally agree , 
  i am just saying that since they have in-group preferences and the west does n't , they will gradually influence our society and not the other way around . 
  which is obviously happen if you take a look around . 
  it 's always about europeans having to adapt to them by having separated pools etc. 
  imagine having 2 football teams . 
  where team a only pass to their own , and team b pass to the other team sometimes . 
  who is likely to win ? 
  are you high ? 
  look what 's happening in europe . 
  they stick to their own . 
  yes exactly !, 
  the point is that they do n't welcome other cultures warmly and prefer their own . 
  so within these countries you have factions and movements of islam which oppose eachother . 
  not even within their own countries they are friendly to diverging cultures and views . 
  mostly all other cultures than the modern western one . 
  ethnocentrism is natural . 
  it 's biological and human nature . 
  acting against it by forcing multiculturaism through government programs is immoral when it acts against what 's natural for us . 
  using force itself is immoral . 
  depends what morals you have but that 's another discussion . 
  i am just saying that what we have now is clearly not working well with parallel societies . 
  even 2 villages in the same country europe may view eachother as strangers . 
  the statement is still true though . 
  labeling the expression as `` far-right '' does n't make the glaring problem go away .

  i think that counts for every country . 
  that being said i have n't heard swedes lacking respect for our culture , just some friendly joking . 
  to be fair we do joke quite a bit about eachother , but it 's all fun . 
  i wish the scandinavian countries would be better integrated . 
  i think that would benefit everyone . 
  i can imagine if we combine all the good things from each country we would end up being extremely close to perfect !, 
   yes , but still . 
  what if i were to travel to the us ? 
  travelling is different . 
  what matters is the cost of everyday goods . 
  if you earn $ 50k in norway and $ 25k in the u.s you can afford the same since the prices are twice as high in norway compared to the u.s.  hell , you 're from norway we get paid $ 1.000 + for taking an academic degree in anything . 
  lots of americans have something like $ 30.000 + in debt when they graduate . 
  the $ 1000 dollars or something a month are student loans though . 
  40 % of it gets turned in to a scholarship if you pass the exam . 
  that means that you will end up with student loans anyway . 
  even in public schools you can end up with $ 30k in debt if you study anything higher than a bachelor degree . 
  if you go to private school like bi you end up with even higher debt . 
  studying in norway is free , living however is not . 
   is there any more integration besides eating mysost and skiing that we swedes need to go through ? 
  you have to wake up every morning and look at this [ picture ] ( http://i.imgur.com/myplqxg.jpg ) while singing `` ja vi elsker '' . 
  after you have gotten that routine you need to drive atleast 2 times a year to sweden to stack up on cheap alcohol and bacon . 
  the final skill you need to aquire is to complain about absolutely everything from prices , roads to nav . 
  once you got these three things in check there you are pretty much set . 
   at some times i find it to be more swedish than sweden over here in rogaland  it 's gotten pretty rediculous . 
  not that i 'm complaining as swedes are wonderful people . 
  we have plenty of them over here !, 
  it 's true that alcohol is extremely cheap in bulgaria , or everywhere else in europe compared to norway !, 
  if you want to relax on holiday greece is good . 
  eastern europe and places like ibiza are the best for partying though . 
  you need to keep in mind that everything is a lot cheaper in the u.s compared to denmark . 
  all the swedes have gone to norway already so integration should n't be too difficult , 
  i did n't like sunny beach at all . 
  crete is loverly in comparison . 
  i find greece to be one of the few places in southern europe where you do n't find annoying sellers on the beach and streets . 
   so , if a mod came here and started editing your comments would you find that okay if some third person vouched that the meaning was the same ? 
  it seems like you do n't understand what the problem is . 
  if they edited one word which meant exactly the same i would be puzzled , but in the end i would n't really care since the point would be the same . 
   i wo n't keep replying to your off-topic remarks about how the austerity is a good policy and all that . 
  feel free to check out my submission history if you want your opinion challenged . 
  i do n't think austerity is a good policy , but in greece it is the only option . 
   what makes you think it 's becoming better , or `` clearer '' as you say ? 
  i 'm not saying it has gotten better . 
  what i mean is that when the crisis came , it was pretty easy to see how the state had fucked everyone over , even before the crisis by living beyond their means . 
   a shrinking deficit still means your finances are becoming worse every year , just at a slower rate . 
  if reducing debt and living within your means is your objective , then greece is n't achieving any of that . 
  i 'm not going to discuss the economics of it in detail , it has nothing to do with the issue at hand . 
  they are slowly doing just that . 
  the point is to reduce the deficit so it turns to a surplus . 
  right now greece has a primary surplus so it 's going the right direction . 
   if it had the same meaning , why did they care to change it ? 
  the two words obviously do not have the same connotations and that 's why they censored one word and forced them to use another . 
  please do n't rationalise a serious incident like this . 
  censorship is not okay , even if you think the meaning is the same . 
  who are they to force us to use one word and not another ? 
  does it seriously not disturb you ? 
  maybe it was changed in translation . 
  there can be other reasons as well . 
  it would have worried me if the word that was changed had a completely different meaning . 
  but when the two words mean exactly the same i do n't really see the issue . 
   ah , the mythical impartial websites . 
  i 'm sorry , but there is no such thing in these matters . 
  again , the fact that a website is left-wing or right-wing has nothing to do with the validity of the presented story . 
  now , if the article was an opinion piece , then it would be a debate worth having but that 's neither here nor there . 
  there is actually some . 
  they may be a little biased , but they are able to look at things from both sides . 
   the level of mental gymnastics is off the charts . 
  if the state does n't exist by the people for the people , what 's the point ? 
  the state has fucked the greeks for decades already . 
  it 's just getting clearer after the financial crisis . 
   of course i can . 
  the deficit is almost as high as ever and thus the debt pile keeps growing . 
  greece has a 170 % debt-to-gdp ratio , you know . 
  bottom line : the country 's finances are getting worse and worse , but again , this has nothing to do with the issue at hand . 
  the deficit is shrinking with a primary surplus this year . 
  the bonds interest rates have gone down a lot and greece may be able to borrow from international markets again . 
  the debt to gdp ratio is high , but the u.k has had over 200 % debt to gdp ratio after world war two . 
  now , as far as i see it the alternative to austerity is to spend even more . 
  what would the debt to gdp ratio be then ? 
  again , you ca n't borrow yourself out of a crisis when you are heavily indebted beforehand . 
   so , censorship is okay if state finances are improving ( which they are not ) ? 
  gosh , good to know . 
  i do n't see how it 's censorship if the word that was changed pretty much have the same meaning . 
  how is it hiding anything then ? 
   just above you said that a government forcing a news agency to change a translation is not important because `` austerity is a good thing for greece anyway '' . 
  it 's a non sequitur argument : `` state finances being a success story '' ( which they 're not ) in no way justifies censorship and meddling with journalism . 
  again , the definition is pretty much exactly the same . 
   so what ? 
  people post right-wing websites all the time . 
  i do n't see you protesting about those . 
  i would react to those as well , but i ca n't protest against every link that gets posted . 
  i think it 's important that the sites i 'm getting my news from can look at things from both sides . 
   well , they are right : the greek media landscape is riddled with unprofitable companies that only exist to help the owners with their other businesses . 
  does n't sound like a good business plan to me . 
   the change is important because in the german psyche the word `` austerity '' is associated with the success of the agenda 2010 programme . 
  in greece the word is associated with the recent economic catastrophe . 
  sure , people like you might believe that it was for the best but it was a catastrophe nonetheless and people are associating the policy with the changes in their lives . 
  for most people the reforms are a catastrophe , but for the state it 's a success story . 
  i still believe this will benefit greece in the long run . 
   now , the government orders the news agency to remove the word because its own narrative depends on convincing the people that `` we 've done our homework and we are now a success story ; the need for austerity is over and soon everything will be sunshine and rainbows '' . 
  merkel 's wording inadvertently sabotages this narrative so the government decided that the media ought to lie so that their `` success story '' does n't get disrupted .

  nah , we have a quick procedure for groundless applications now . 
  we even send people straight back to russia now . 
  `` just turn your bicycle around ! '',

  nato treaty article 5 is always an option for denmark and norway . 
  on the other hand they do n't have to invoke that to make us act as allies ( or whatever we are ) . 
   finland 's nazi `` collaboration '' ... that 's one way of looking at it ? 
  it 's not , it 's fairly normal . 
  it does show that the bonds exists and beyond nato 's article 5 requests . 
  sweden and finland are not in nato though . 
  what 's worse is that they bought their latest fighters from the us . 
  they got slightly better control and access to their f-35 's software and technology than others ( see norway ) . 
  they also assemble [ their own apache versions etc.

  while the liberals ( v ) are the most pro- * immigration * . 
   now they 're asking for the same who are you referring to ? 
  do you mean the uk ? 
  norway 's not asking for a two-speed europe , as we 're not in the eu . 
  that was a very odd episode indeed , not really sound empirical data for a conclusion . 
  i 've flown with norwegian , sas and ryanair many times myself . 
  if they actually flew to those countries ... 
  i 'm not sure if you 're joking or not ? 
  they did n't forget them as they just do n't fly to those destinations . 
  uh , have you ever flown with norwegian ? 
  they 're * not * ryanair . 
  the scandinavian languages ought to be a buy-one-get-three deal !,

  that would n't make much sense either since they 're reforming their language to fit the brazilian spelling ( i.e.

  thanks , that was an interesting podcast . 
   but pronunciation and spoken dialect is still very much the same . 
  i 'll just repeat the central quote from the article : `` more and more people are using and pronouncing words in the way that people from london and the south-east do '' . 
  i do n't know your country as well as you do , but the researchers surely know a lot more than both of us .

  the oil represents < 25 % of our gdp anyways . 
  did you not notice the fall in the oil price ? 
  we 've already seen the worst ( layoffs , bankrupt firms ) . 
  in many ways it 's already `` run out '' . 
  you may certainly claim that , but the researchers say otherwise . 
  here 's one such study : http://www.cam.ac.uk/research/news/cambridge-app-maps-decline-in-regional-diversity-of-english-dialects, 
  thanks , yeah , that document was on my mind , but i chose to not make my post too detailed , 
  yeah , but it 's converging , according to some ox-bridge uni study . 
   mangling of a version pre-mangled overseas ? 
  the pre-mangled version could become the standard for europeans in the distant future . 
  as for mangling that version again , based on what i 've read some researchers predict that it could become an entirely legitimate , new form of english . 
  on par with american , australian and indian english . 
  it would sound strange and mangled to some english speakers , but it could become normal for europeans . 
  a bit like french in quebec and france ( or rather vice versa ) . 
  the union is n't a federation at the moment , so it does make sense to change the name to reflect it .

   is n't it breach of privacy ?

  any attempt to amend the bill will be about trying to ensure the tories are responsible for the outcome , not much more . 
  it 's one potential way of being able to go `` we told you so '' when may gives up everything to the eu for a fiver . 
  one direction ? 
  fuck that - i 'm moving back to norway . 
  whatever you think does not stop the fact that others * are * interpreting it . 
  not * trying * . 
  they may be interpreting it in a way that is wrong according to your interpretation , but it does not change the fact that they are . 
  you have a point . 
  in norway , frp ( fremskrittspartiet / progress party ) retained their anti-immigration policies to a large extent , even causing their own coalition partner to negotiate a broad settlement on immigration with * every other party in parliament * rather than come to agreement with their coalition partner and one of the other parties ( they 're a minority government but could get away with support from just a single other party ) . 
  but at the same time they * have * been forced to moderate themselves in many areas . 
  i do n't necessarily think it 's a solution in itself , though . 
  it can help take the worst edges off , but it can also let them demonstrate their ability to function in government . 
  in norway , when the king gave the norwegian labour party it 's first chance at forming a government after the right wing parties had failed to come to agreement , it only lasted two weeks the first time ( there was a solid right wing majority in parliament ) , but it let labour prove that they were * willing * to form a government , and is widely credited as one of the things that let labour continue to grow - it both changed labour and made people more willing to fight for an election victory ( until then labour was a revolutionary socialist party ) and changed their image , in showing to voters they were prepared to step up . 
  the same effect could easily happen for some of these right wing parties - showing they 're prepared to step up might push away some of their more extremist voters , but it could also win them voters from others on the right that have previously written them off as pure protest-parties . 
  it 's a risky game . 
  while - as someone far left - i consider castro an ass and an oppressive dictator , the reason for the difference is simple : magnitudes of difference in the numbers of deaths and political prisoners , and castro managed is a far more ambiguous character - on one hand he certainly did oppress ; on the other hand he provided a massive amount of assistance to a large number of developing countries , both in terms of healthcare , education and military assistance ( e.g. 
  mandela credits cuban help a great deal for their help in pushing the apartheid regime to the negotiating table via their interventions in angola , that helped ensure the collapse of the south african invasion of angola and zambia , and the collapse of the south african puppet regime in namibia , for example ) . 
  they 're not even remotely on the same scale , that 's why it is treated differently . 
  if you 're going to pick fucked up examples that got support from the left that never should have , then at least pick someone like stalin or mao . 
  i have yet to meet a single muslim ( i 'm sure some exist , but of th many i have met , i have n't found one ) that believes that the quran is not widen open to interpretation . 
  in fact , i 've met plenty of muslims with mutually incompatible interpretations of what the quran means . 
  ah , yes , no violence involved in israels illegal occupations . 
  and yet somehow i have met muslims with widely diverging views on what various parts of the quran means . 
  somehow they 've managed to interpret it differently despite your insistence it ca n't be done . 
  well , if you go to norway i think you 'll find they 've invaded 7-11 . 
  it 's a bit like the sinister australian invasion of british pubs . 
  the `` elites '' in this case is simply a shortcut for `` random collection of people with more money and influence than the average worker '' . 
  nothing more . 
  nothing i wrote implied any kind of party that controls negotiations , but it remains a * fact * that political influence is tied to certain political classes - e.g. 
  most top politicians in the uk has been educated at a vanishingly small proportion of top universities . 
  there are exceptions , but the average top politicians have had an extremely privileged background . 
  same is the case in most places in europe . 
  so while our elected politicians are meant to represent everyone , they come from a background that tends to skew their viewpoints quite substantially from those they represent . 
   not some `` elite '' cabal that coordinates things . 
  we agree about that , but this `` elite cabal '' of yours is a strawman that was never implied or stated by anything i wrote . 
  it 's dumb , but the alternative is to be prepared to use war as a means of enforcing it . 
  the cost is simply too high . 
  i 'm not saying it 's enough yet to have a major effect on broad categories , but there are enough individual hikes that a lot of people certainly are directly personally affected . 
  apple ( mac prices up 20 % , app store prices up 25 % ) , microsoft ( price increases up to 22 % attributed to the pound ) are a couple of the ones that immediatly springs to mind because tech prices personally affect me , my friends and colleagues and businesses disproportionately much ( e.g. 
  those two alone have a direct impact on the profitability of many of my clients , and by extension they affect the cash they have available to spend on project likes the ones i live off ) . 
  it does n't help if your overall spending power is largely unaffected , if your spending power for the things you actually want to buy is affected , and inflation does n't capture this well . 
  this is also just the very leading edge of the wave . 
  companies will tend to hold out as long as possible if they fell any kind of competitive pressure , and many of them will have hedged against currency changes for a relatively long period anyway and so many are not affected yet , so we 'll keep seeing these increases piece by piece for a very long time . 
  if the pound stays stable at current levels ( right ... ) , i 'm guessing we 'll start to have a reasonable picture of the full effects on prices about a year from now . 
  there is no `` might makes right '' in international law , but the point is that there is not much of an enforcement mechanism ( and ca n't be unless the entire world agrees on strict enforcement criteria against anyone found guilty , to the extent of being prepared to start wars over it ) , so while there de jure is n't , de facto there is . 
  even if russia 's takeover of crimea is against international law , the icj does not have jurisdiction to make a binding judgement , because neither russia or ukraine have issued a declaration accepting the courts jurisdiction in general . 
  it could * get * jurisdiction if both ukraine and russia voluntarily decides to grant jurisdiction for a case brought by either party , but good luck with that . 
  beyond that , relevant un bodies could ask for an advisory icj finding ... 
  which would achieve pretty much nothing . 
  even if russia was found guilty of something in the icj , enforcement actions would ultimately be down to the security council . 
  want to bet on a veto ? 
  we have great historical examples , such as when nicaragua sued the us in 1986 over us support for military and paramilitary activities in the country . 
  nicaragua won an extensive list of claims , and the icj ordered reparations paid by the us . 
  the us refused to accept the ruling and vetoed enforcement in the security council . 
  the result was that the us substantially limited it 's declaration of acceptance of the courts jurisdiction to prevent similar cases in the future ( the court had to exclude some of nicaragua 's claims based on exceptions in the previous declaration too ) , but the us also never obeyed the courts decision , even though it was bound by combination of treaty and their declaration to do so . 
  the icj can only issue binding decisions if both countries involved in a dispute has either issued a declaration giving the court jurisdiction ( most countries have n't ; neither ukraine nor russia have ) , or consent to binding jurisdiction in a specific case . 
  even then , enforcement ultimately is down to the security council - guess how well that goes if the decision is against one of the permanent seat holders who can veto . 
  the icj has very limited powers , because that 's all anyone would accept . 
  it may be `` convenient '' for them , but the un in general and the icj would certainly prefer it if more states agreed to compulsory jurisdiction , but how would you make that happen ? 
  in any case the * fact * remains that the icj has no legal basis for interfering with respect to crimea at the present moment . 
  the icj has compulsory/binding jurisdiction only when the involved states agree they do , unless both states have made a declaration they preemptively accept the icj 's jurisdiction . 
  neither russia nor ukraine have made such a declaration . 
  so unless both russia and ukraine ** both ** voluntarily decide to try the crimea situation in front of the icj , there 's nothing the icj can legally force either side to do . 
  the case on kosovo is a different type of case : an advisory decision , which can be requested by un bodies and agencies . 
  these decisions do * not * have the force of law . 
  in this case , a decision was requested by the un general assembly . 
  ukraine could ask for a vote on a similar advisory decision , but it would not be legally binding on russia even if the icj deemed the crimea takeover illegal . 
  in either case , the icj can not pre-emptively pick a case on their own - for them to have jurisdiction to issue an advisory decision on crimea , someone ( ukraine , most likely ) would need to petition a relevant un agency to bring the case to the court . 
  so in other words : the icj are not hypocrites in this respect - they handle the cases they are given , and have no legal power to take up cases on their own accord . 
  if you want to complain about hypocrisy , then the party to level the complaint at would be the un general assembly , which is the un body that petitioned the court over kosovo , and who could do the same over crimea ( i have n't looked to see if anyone has asked the ga to consider such a petition over crimea and why/why not , so it 's not clear there 's any hypocrisy there either depending on what reasons there might be for not doing anything ), 
  of course they are preparing for the worst . 
  but preparing for the worst does n't change a thing about what i wrote : that theresa may does n't have the legal authority to make that decision on her own . 
  the comment i responded to is factually wrong . 
  the issue is not that they 're taking their time . 
  i 'm hoping they drag it out forever . 
  the issue is that they promised otherwise , and then went back on their promise . 
  i 'm glad cameron turned out to be a spineless weasel , but that does n't change the fact that he went back on what he promised he 'd do , and that 's a major reason so many estimates had to be changed afterwards . 
  because inflation measures a `` basket of goods and services '' , and not all of them have seen price increases yet . 
  that does n't change the fact of major increases in individual product categories . 
  as someone living in the uk that just came back from spending a week with family in norway : tanking is not a bit of an overstatement . . 
  it 's being felt , both when we travel abroad , and with a series of massive price hikes on various imported goods . 
   theresa may announced literally yesterday that britain is leaving the single market . 
  keep up with the damn news . 
  theresa may does n't have the authority to make that decision on her own , unless the supreme court overrules the previous judgement . 
  she can say what she want , but until she 's either won in the supreme court or parliament approves her plans , there is still not certainty about what will happen , or when . 
  edit : loving the downvotes for stating facts . 
  the notion of the united states of europe dates back at least to napoleon , and was also suggested by victor hugo in 1849 , and bakunin and the french national assembly in 1871 , and many others . 
  it 's an old idea , but an idea that has been tied to elites and rebels rather than regular people . 
  then in '46 churchill brought it up again , and so it had was already on the table before the ecsc . 
  not least because churchill 's idea lead to the council of europe and by extension to the european convention on human rights . 
  the problem is that the goals of the elites are very different from those of ordinary working people , and that is going to create ongoing tension . 
  in that respect , it has moved fast . 
  consider the us - the us was a far simpler state building project , yet the modern , federal us did not truly emerge until after nearly a century of tensions , reworking ( from the original articles of confederation ) , and civil war , had transformed the originally very lose confederation into a singe state . 
  and cameron promised to invoked article 50 right away . 
  they 've had to revise their estimates because the uk government proved to consist of unexpectedly spineless weasels . 
  that 's the only plus in this - the eu can move forward without being held back by the uk , and when the uk is finally desperate enough hopefully it 'll have to just take what 's on the table .

  all of western europe plus some countries in eastern europe , for example poland . 
   whether you 'd get enough benefits as a single parent of two children ( the criteria used here ) in the nordics i do n't know , though . 
  after doing some research i found out that you are entitled to around 16 000 nok ( 1 900 $ ) per month in benefits after tax if you are a single parent with 2 children here in norway . 
   relative poverty here has been defined as making less than 50 % of the median household income . 
  median household income after tax is 35 915 nok ( 4 277 $ ) a month . 
  so in other words you are theoretically in poverty by using that standard . 
  the poverty line is even higher in norway where it 's calculated based on 60 % of the median income . 
  living on 16 000 nok a month is possible , but with two kids it can get difficult . 
  you will not starve to death though . 
  build proper roads and railways . 
  my impression is that large amounts of tourists come here using a camper van and therefore stock up on food before they come here . 
  asians are the ones who spend the most money here so they do n't seem to mind it . 
  if everyone did that then low paid work would pay a lot more . 
  i would have though it was higher in germany . 
  not to mention you get enough benefits that you do n't live in poverty despite not working . 
  they are usually represented by the confederation of norwegian enterprise . 
  i have worked with an employer that was n't part of a union , but they followed the general guidelines anyway just because it 's practical . 
  you will get no one to work for you if they do n't get the benefits and wages that are negotiated and agreed on by the unions . 
  the only attachment i get from eu symbols is a large undemocratric bureaucracy . 
  so they are the only sane ones in the union in other words . 
  it 's rather your post sounding something like `` if people continue to vote for parties i do n't like they should just leave '', 
  because fuck what the people want . 
  not any different from the eu if i 'm honest . 
  has uk redditors gone together to create the party `` cannabis is safer than alcohol '' ?

  they can join us norwegians and swiss in our not-relevant corner . 
  not a bad place to be in if i say so my self . 
  in norway food has a 15 % vat . 
  it 's a bit lower than the general vat of 25 % though . 
  seems like us norwegians actually have a reason to complain this time !, 
   one obvious difference is that the latvian network coverage is poor . 
  our sixth biggest city ( and probably the 2nd most important economically ) has no rail link at all . 
  too many small towns are unreachable by rail . 
  then there is the speed - the trains are old and slow . 
  the train ride between our two largest cities is some 220 km , but takes close to 4 hours . 
  many trains ( including on this route ) are still diesel locomotives . 
  i do n't think our trains go over 70 km/h . 
  could have been a description of the norwegian railroads . 
  it 's true though . 
  real estate taxes suck and are a good argument against it . 
  people have to sell their properties since they have inherited it but do n't have the income to pay the taxes . 
   most are taxed already : if you sell ( or receive dividends ) you pay a tax on the profits . 
  25 % in germany . 
  the difference here is that you get taxed when you sell them . 
  when they are not sold you ca n't tax the holdings because you need to sell them to pay the tax . 
  in a full time job you work 37,5 hours a week . 
  do n't know how it is in sweden but i would imagine it 's not that different . 
  how would you go about taxing non liquid assets like real estate and stock holdings ? 
  or because for the average worker it does n't matter that the richer get taxed harder . 
  it 's not like that money end up in the voters hand anyways . 
  why ruin the system that has made europe prosperous ? 
  disagreement in labour terms should be resolved before industrial action is even necessary . 
  guess two weeks on , four weeks off and a salary of 800 000 - 1 000 000 nok a year is n't good enough ... 
  not true for norway atleast . 
  captains easily earn 130 000 $ a year and first officers 60 000 $ + . 
  this is despite having 200 free days a year . 
  i do n't think we work less , it 's just that more of our workers are working part-time . 
  could be wrong though . 
  appearantly it 's popular to take the friday off -, 
  cameron will get a good paying job when he 's done being pm so it 's probably more of a `` personal goal '' . 
  here in norway politicians either go into pr-agencies and spend the rest of their career lobbying government or they end up in company boards ... 
  here in norway we use sweden as an example of what happens when immigration is not discussed openly . 
  [ among journalists in norway it 's much more balanced , but still a left-wing bias ] ( http://i.imgur.com/mjqf6ax.png ) . 
  besides , what politician is n't career-minded nowadays ? 
  that 's all we have over here atleast . 
  norwegian workers have it better than ever . 
  but we do have more issues with underpaid labour from especially eastern europe working construction and other type of manual labour . 
  it should rather be the opposite . 
  strikes are annoying as hell . 
  the interesting thing is that it 's mostly the highly paid jobs with the best benefits that go on strike . 
  oil workers , pilots , it-workers , air traffic controllers and public workers . 
  they have the most bargaining power so it 's not that surprising . 
  it 's the same here in norway though . 
  well obviously norway does n't have a worldwide known cuisine since we are a tiny nation on the outskirts of europe . 
  despite this we do quite well . 
  norwegian seafood is world class for example . 
  one ca n't expect more from a country of 5 million . 
  i doubt you will find any other countries with the same population that has a known cuisine . 
  that does n't mean the food is bad , it 's just that it 's not that well known . 
  the new and modern scandinavian cuisine is beginning to gain popularity lately . 
  if you go to a city in norway there are loads of good restaurants that serve world class food with local ingredients . 
  i am absolutely sure that there is a bright future for norwegian food ahead . 
  we still have a way to go though as most people know almost nothing about norway in general . 
   that is true but norwegian is usually not brought up in the best european food debate . 
  it is probably brought up in the worst european food debate more often . 
  people do n't know norwegian cuisine . 
  it 's the same as saying british cuisine is bad because it looks like shit even though it taste amazing . 
   you do n't see norwegian vs italian or norwegian vs french often . 
  i do n't have any statistics but i assume norwegian would lose by a lot ststistically . 
  you are wrong though . 
  norway has always won or been at the top in cooking competitions . 
  [ we actually won this year 's bocuse d'or ] ( http://www.bocusedor.com/norway-wins-the-bocuse-d-or-2015 ) . 
  they only think so .

  the us and europe have a unique relationship and shared history . 
  without the us we would n't be where we are and vice versa . 
  the relationship is a fruitful partnership even today . 
  i do n't believe gaining citizenship of another country `` removes '' your background . 
  i 'm saying south africa deserves credit for giving birth to this man . 
  that 's honoring one country , without taking away from the fact that the us * enabled * him to acheive greatness . 
  - a great athlete is nothing without a stadium to perform in [ and support staff ] . 
  in my mind the us has plenty of great homegrown inventors , innovators and scientists . 
  others are immigrants that get lauded for being great americans with little regard for the fact that they only became americans after having been fully formed ... einstein was about as american as pizza . 
   tries to veil their `` yurop stronk '' beliefs so sorry i do n't agree with you ... ** south africa ** is hardly europe is it ? 
   a country that he merely was born in , but willfully chose to leave . 
  now , who 's taking credit away from whom ? 
  well , it 's as i said , just my view - and probably a lot of countries [ with native populations ] . 
  yes , you have to belong to the culture and be raised in it ? 
  we 're products of our environments , race for example has nothing to do with it . 
  well , that 's the way i see my culture anyway . 
  you americans talk a lot about being blind to your citizens ' origins , but i see it as folly to ignore/obscure it . 
  yes , i know , i just answered your question with a reference to that fact . 
  despite it all he was a south african . 
  his move to the canada/us does n't make him very american in my eyes ... moving to my country does n't make you norwegian , it makes you a citizen . 
  things are different in other countries of course . 
  you mean besides already having canadian citizenship before he ever applied to become a us american ? 
  and then you 'll get them all back !, 
  oh , do n't worry , that eu thing is going to blow over ... 
  ireland is europe 's biggest `` exporter '' of bananas ( fyffes ) . 
  my understanding is that the spoken language is slightly different in brazil though ? 
  naturally , since it 's so far away . 
  i also remember portugal and brazil signing an agreement to standardize using one written norm recently ? 
  i do n't know about the lusophone countries in africa though ? 
  they make me sad because there are so many during rush hour in oslo !, 
  the lane is filled with them and leafs . 
  europeans simply * do n't * have access to venture capital to the same degree . 
  you 're comparing two very different environments . 
  the people who want to build something have to leave for the us . 
  it took a ** south african ** to start tesla ... ( using a european inventor 's name ) . 
  yeah , i 'm only joking though . 
  we 've have got to rub our neighbors noses in it , it would n't be a friendly sibling rivalry without it , 
  hehe , we 'll have to join the russians so we can truly become the `` last soviet state '' ( rosengren ) , 
  i predict the following ( winter games ) : - 1 . 
  norway - 3 . 
  european union ( that 's you sweden , finland ... ), 
  okay , but then we should give points according to where those athletes ended up ( not just the medal winners ) . 
  damn , that 's actually surprising . 
  you have some really good athletes ( winter and summer games ) . 
  oh , it 's like that . 
  yeah , we 've done the same , over the last decade , for exactly the same reasons . 
  finland 's beating both our butts ... 
  i see . 
  we all have our problems , at least yours was fraud based , 
   years ago prague attempted to replace paper tickets with electronic cards . 
  the project was a costly and unusable failure but prague town hall refuses to cancel it . 
  instead , it will sink another 100 million czk ( ~ 3,5 million euro ) into the project we 've spent many times that trying to get a new ( er ) electronic system here in oslo . 
  the old plastic cards worked just fine , but they wanted to improve it . 
  in the end it cost something like 600 million nok = ~ $ 72 millon euro . 
   the government will tighten the rules for admission to university ( it will only affect those with the worst grades ) . 
  quality over quantity ? 
  or is it just a matter of finances ? 
  no , we clearly disagree , i 'm saying it 's a symbol for europe in general . 
  they are europeans , they want their freedom and are asking their leaders to align more closely with europe - over russia 's eurasian union . 
  i do n't think the people on the ground in ukraine or the author really care to distinguish between europe or the eu . 
  it 's not about the organization itself , while it 's clearly important , it 's about belonging to europe as a free nation . 
  the ideals are what matter . 
  what do you think the norwegian and danish ships were carrying before they picked up the chemical weapons from syria ?

  to be fair , it 's not that bad in the city any longer . 
  you can go on guided tours , but you do n't want to stay too long near the reactor site . 
  the area around the reactor will be habitable in around 500 - 600 years .

  just [ look at the spanish flu ( 1918 ) ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1918_flu_pandemic ) . 
  it was equally potent , but that only killed people - it did n't ruin civilizations . 
  or more recently h1n1 bird flu . 
  the next disaster will be better handled , 
  no , you poles do n't seem to understand building in wood . 
  i 've met a few polish construction workers here in norway , they 're always surprised by the difference . 
  your wood is nothing like ours ; yours grows too fast and is bad for buildings . 
  it 's only good for firewood . 
  here in scandinavia we have wooden buildings that are many centuries old . 
  it 's not a problem if you do a little maintenance . 
  the buildings are much better to live in with our climate , a lot better than concrete ... now , from what my friends in the american building materials industry tells me , the mcmansions are built using cheap materials that do n't last very long . 
  the [ recent scandal involving imported chinese dry-wall ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/chinese_drywall ) just underlines the problem . 
  it 's the stuff hanging on the wooden framework that does n't last ... 
  was n't dublin a [ norwegian ] viking settlement ? 
  even the official guides at the castle in dublin said so when i was there . 
  i also remember him saying the name was based on `` black pool '' .

  while [ bouvet island ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bouvet_island ) , near antarctica , is completely empty . 
   i strongly disagree with your assertion that immigrant born people will never hold high office in european countries high office ? 
  that 's not * exactly * what i said , is it ? 
  obviously there are any number of those , from france to italy ( arab justice and african integration minister respectively ) . 
  president/prime minister is another matter , one that requires popular support . 
  it seems to me that you 're extrapolating and applying what 's a reality in britain to all of europe . 
  i 'm sorry , but the reality is that we are not as multi-cultural as you are . 
   second gens generally stand just as much chance of making the cut as a full blooded native , assuming they have the resources and the influence to do so .

  bah , we fired the polish workers and relaxed . 
  we 've barely felt the change nationally since we 're not reliant on oil revenue . 
  a few regions have seen unemployment rise . 
  we 've made sure that this scenario would n't play out any other way . 
  it 's why we invested * all * of our oil & gas revenue abroad ; so that we own your companies and real estate . 
  1,25 % of the world 's shares . 
  now , work harder , so that we can demand more profits from our holdings !, 
  :d p.s. 
  oil & gas represented 25 % of our gdp last year . 
   eu should be allowed to fight its own wars . 
  eh , are you joking ? 
  we 're fighting in your wars ... see afghanistan , iraq etc. 
  or are you talking about wwii ? 
  did you check out the dublin link ? 
  we send them back to their original country of registration . 
   not many people go all the way up to norway ? 
  oh , quite a few , the migrants know very well what the conditions are . 
  they prefer germany , sweden and the uk . 
  norway is sort of a second choice over sweden , since they allow all syrians automatic refugee status . 
   you experience the effects of the open border we 're mostly fine with the border with regards to refugees , we 're more annoyed by the thieves/scam artists from the balkans etc. 
  there 's some public frustration about the beggars from romania ( roma people ) , as we do n't have many beggars in need of our own ... 
  they 've also taken to selling drugs , stealing and sleeping in public spaces/land or occupying abandoned homes . 
  the open border has also resulted in visits from pick-pocket gangs , the above mentioned gypsies robbing elderly women on the street , a few rape cases , gangs performing home break-ins , planned business pillaging , etc. 
  a nuisance , but not a major problem . 
  these are mostly eu citizens , and they have to show passports to enter ( as they 're from * non-schengen * countries ) . 
   you experience the effects of the open border/ignore what 's going on in the mediterranean , and you do n't even get to influence the eu to deal with it directly ? 
  yes , it 's something we do feel both directly and indirectly . 
  we have ships in the med helping out with the refugee crisis . 
  we only land them on-shore as per our agreement . 
  there are fewer african migrants in these parts , but i can assure you several of those that have landed have family in norway or scandinavia . 
  they very much wish to get right on the train from milano heading north . 
  we have plenty of somalis and are currently experiencing a rush of eritreans ( military regime ) . 
  we will investigate and treat each case as they apply for asylum . 
  we 're more interested in what we can do to help syrians . 
  we 've decided after much public debate that an * additional * 8000-10000 over the next three years would be our fair share . 
  that 's in addition to those arriving on their own , and in addition to the annual un quota . 
  i checked the primary anti-eu group here and they say it 's primarily about the transfer of power to a central government [ without much accountability ] . 
  the people hardly bother to vote in the eu ( 40 % ) . 
  they also say a lot of decisions are made behind closed doors and ordinary people ca n't keep track of it . 
  on the other hand if i remember correctly the executive ( commission ) is not elected directly , and the council 's role versus the parliament is improvable . 
  the legislative power should be in the hands of the elected representatives and only them . 
   but norway is in schengen , so it 's effectively still your problem ? 
  yes , and no . 
  [ the dublin agreement ] ( https://www.wikiwand.com/en/dublin_regulation ) decides . 
   schengen schengen [ and its information system ] is a separate system from the eu though . 
   norway 's half in half out situation with the eea and eu nope , we 're all-the-way-in [ efta . ] ( https://www.wikiwand.com/en/european_free_trade_association ) . 
  the efta countries have a fta with the eu . 
  we have our own efta court and other mirror institutions . 
  no , no , you 're mistaken , as my country is ** not ** in the eu ... :p see the title of this post , hehe :d, 
   we do n't have any un-documented workers/migrants/refugees on the streets like you see all over , for example , spain , france , italy , and we 'd like to keep it that way . 
  yes , i can understand that . 
  it 's your country and you have every right to decide , but op was breaking a lot of glass by attacking the eu 's policies , hehe . 
   the open boarders ideal is very impractical . 
  now , they do come in ships , but they 're not boarders  seriously , our open borders are just fine ( as opposed to perfect ) . 
  the fact that italy lets them go is * not * a mistake ; they do n't want them to register or stay there . 
  it 's not a weakness in the internal border policing , it 's the external that 's the real challenge . 
  [ frontex ] ( https://www.wikiwand.com/en/frontex ) is the answer , but it 's currently underdeveloped . 
   a lot of aussies do n't see the sense in allowing low skilled immigrants from low waged countries to pop over into britain they do n't even represent a fraction of the skilled eu migrants that enter the uk legally . 
  the free movement of goods , capital , services and people is the eu 's reasons for being . 
  the illegal , low-skilled immigrants attempting to enter the chunnel represent a microscopic amount by comparison . 
  absolutely . 
  ideas and names can gain popularity over time , so much so that we forget their previous names . 
  after all most countries in europe have changed dramatically over the last two-three centuries . 
  oh , i see , you certainly have enough of those , 
  ok , i guess you can be opposed to both . 
  though i do n't see much wrong with the eu itself . 
  the eu simply is n't empowered to do anything , the individual countries just do n't want to deal with it . 
  it 's like blaming the head nurse for striking doctors . 
  thanks for the update !, 
  yes , but i do n't see them as entirely separate . 
  if we shut down the alliance tomorrow , europe would still be able to communicate using european manned and controlled nato resources ? 
   spineless approach to migrants . 
  you did get the glass houses imagery ? 
  at least the eu is n't dumping them on an island ... 
  i mean you have to be opposed to your own country 's policy if you 're so upset by the eu 's way of doing things . 
  at least they 're giving them residency and permission to walk around freely . 
   due to its undemocratic nature and spineless approach to migrants . 
  haha , the glass must be raining down on you !, 
  want another rock ? 
   it 's a true union where members are expected to work together willingly . 
  yes , but also unwilling [ for good reasons ] to sacrifice their national interests on the altar of the common good . 
  except for the existing european nato command structure we do have ? 
  even france is in the nato command structure these days , 
  you missed your chance to use `` defenestrated '' !, 
  apparently , [ according to the israeli leader we work against them ... ] ( http://www.thelocal.no/20150313/scandinavia-accused-of-meddling-in-israel-vote ), 
  you know that benjamin netanyahu claimed that scandinavian governments were conspiring against him during the most recent elections , right ? 
  i think that was op 's point about puerto rico . 
  you asked , 
   recently its been very incompetent when it comes to big issues that 's because it does n't have the mandate or power to act . 
  they 're bankrupt and the us refused to bail them out recently . 
  the eu does have its common defence policy , the weu-nato relationship and the eu 's battlegroups . 
  - this is why [ the eu is training somali forces in kenya ( eutm ) ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=udepdiperqe ) . 
  - [ eu navies are working to combat piracy in waters off somalia ( eu navfor ) . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgk-zmsylko ), 
   additionally there does n't seem to be any sort of unified military structure , even for defensive conflicts you 're wrong on that account . 
  please , see the [ western european union ] ( http://www.wikiwand.com/en/western_european_union ) and the current eu 's [ common security and defence policy ] ( http://www.wikiwand.com/en/common_security_and_defence_policy ) [ the eu battlegroups ] ( https://www.wikiwand.com/en/eu_battlegroup ) is a manifestation of this . 
  - `` at the 1996 nato ministerial meeting in berlin , it was agreed that the western european union ( weu ) would oversee the creation of a european security and defence identity within nato structures . 
  the esdi was to create a european ` pillar ' within nato , partly to allow european countries to act militarily where nato wished not to , and partly to alleviate the united states ' financial burden of maintaining military bases in europe , which it had done since the cold war . 
  the berlin agreement allowed european countries ( through the weu ) to use nato assets if it so wished ( this agreement was later amended to allow the european union to conduct such missions , the so-called berlin-plus arrangement ) . '', 
   the country has fuck all to gain from it .

  the oslo-fjord really stands out in size compared to the rest of the nordics . 
  sources ? 
  ** crises and growth , 1914-1945 ** officially norway was neutral during world war i. 
  however , in terms of the economy , the government clearly took the side of the british and their allies . 
  through several treaties norway gave privileges to the allied powers , which protected the norwegian merchant fleet . 
  during the war 's first years , norwegian ship owners profited from the war , and the economy boomed . 
  from 1917 , when germany declared war against non-friendly vessels , norway took heavy losses . 
  a recession replaced the boom . 
  norway suspended gold redemption in august 1914 , and due to inflationary monetary policy during the war and in the first couple of years afterward , demand was very high . 
  when the war came to an end this excess demand was met by a positive shift in supply . 
  thus , norway , like other western countries experienced a significant boom in the economy from the spring of 1919 to the early autumn 1920 . 
  the boom was followed by high inflation , trade deficits , currency depreciation and an overheated economy . 
  the international postwar recession beginning in autumn 1920 , hit norway more severely than most other countries . 
  in 1921 gdp per capita fell by eleven percent , which was only exceeded by the united kingdom . 
  there are two major reasons for the devastating effect of the post-war recession . 
  in the first place , as a small open economy , norway was more sensitive to international recessions than most other countries . 
  this was in particular the case because the recession hit the country 's most important trading partners , the united kingdom and sweden , so hard . 
  secondly , the combination of strong and mostly pro-cyclical inflationary monetary policy from 1914 to 1920 and thereafter a hard deflationary policy made the crisis worse ( figure 3 ) .

  the distinction lies between the nordics and northern europe . 
  the nordics are more than just scandinavia , but scandinavia is part of the nordics , and northern europe for that matter . 
  norwegians of course refers only to people from norway . 
  norden is norwegian for the nordics . 
  did that help at all ? 
  lol, 
  god i love living in oslo . 
  also , norway ( and probably oslo ) is the easiest place to get a one night stand in the world if i remember correctly . 
  my point exactly . 
  we even have cities in norway , if you translate `` by '' from norwegian to english as `` city '' ( which is common ) , with populations around 20k inhabitants . 
  there used to be a more rigid system about what a city was , but nowadays pretty much any administrative center can call it self a city in norway . 
  woa there buddy . 
  having lived in the us my self i am not talking down on them . 
  what gdp per capita are you looking at ? 
  both here : http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/ny.gdp.pcap.cd and here : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_gdp_ ( nominal ) _ per_capita - then we have about twice the gdp of the us . 
  if you look at ppp ( currency exchange rate ) , then it is more like you stated . 
  potatoes !, 
  vodka . 
  vodka happened . 
   however due to the extremely high gdp per capita of the us ... [ ] pfffff, 
  well , at the very least you can have our upboats dear friend . 
  different languages and states use the term city differently . 
  for example b\u00e6rum is a fairly densely populated county outside of oslo , and is considered part of metropolitan oslo . 
  more than 100 000 people live in the urban area of b\u00e6rum , but it is not considered a city . 
  sandvika which is the urban centre of b\u00e6rum has historically neither been considered a city . 
  - i am an urban planner, 
  well , not quite . 
  mission accomplished !, 
   but seriously , if a whole country all focuses their knowledge on playing the market no wonder they 're doing good . 
  well , of course * the whole country * does n't focus on this at all . 
  we focus on staying competitive and doing what we are good at . 
  although i am sure the guys we have working on the fund are top notch brokers , it 's still just a small fraction of what we are doing here in norway . 
  i am sure you guys have something similar in the us and it 's not like you guys * focus all your * knowledge on 1 thing . 
  ... keeping all your eggs in one basket ... and all that , 
  tell that to the us , uk , germany , sweden , or numerous other countries who have relied on immigration to grow and prosper .

   or does corruption in the northern countries look more elegant or something ? 
  please clarify , do you mean northern countries as north of you guys ( as in most of europe ) , or northern europe ? 
  i thought there would be enough jobs here in norway for the swedes ? 
  i also like how my home area on the south coast of norway is greener then the rest of europe . 
  this is the best one yet . 
  upboats from norway, 
  as someone who uses gis and has made a few maps before , i would like to upvote your comment/response more than just once . 
  or perhaps because this is a map showing the information on countries in eu not europe ...

  the ones i did n't get was kaliningrad , i had never even heard of that one before . 
  til and i like it . 
  same , but that 's even harder to make happen i think . 
  it 's a foreign concept to many and new things are scary , better the devil you know or how it goes . 
  direct democracy style voting though is thought to basically all children `` how many want burgers and how many want pizza for dinner ? 
  3 vs 6 , pizza it is ! '', 
   sorry , but people are idiots that 's the point . 
  so are the politicians , they are just power hungry idiots . 
  why are lawyers and economists more suited to run our country than any other person ? 
  the current system is far from a technocracy after all . 
  seeing how they are economists and lawyers i 'm all for them being in charge of the budget and following the laws for that . 
  we are all idiots , but we are idiots in different areas of knowledge so lets vote like the idiots we are instead of being led by a small group of idiots . 
  when voting on an issue i get my vote heard . 
  when i vote for a party i need to find the one that fits me the best . 
  the party only votes the way i wanted ( if i 'm lucky ) some or most of the time while me voting i vote like i wanted to all of the time . 
  it wo n't be perfect and we will fuck up , but at least it will be our fault not some representative that , if lucky , have the same view on all issues as 50 % of the voters . 
  e : hopefully my foul mood is n't showing through in text . 
  if it is disregard , it ai n't you just general foul moodiness . 
  we would still elect parties directly like we are now and you can exclude votes for people already . 
  i 'm thinking more like voting on country changing things so we can avoid stuff like drd ( dld ) getting passed even though most were against it and is now found to be annulled in the eu . 
  now we are stuck with people representing us by pushing their own issues in the way they want . 
  the little direct democracy we got on voting on joining the eu seems to be just for show considering how far up eu 's ass the politicians are and how many directives ( above 99 % ) we are implementing . 
  we should really just build another prison or two , it would create jobs on top of the needed jail space . 
  it really is a win win . 
  i wish we had more direct democracy . 
  fuck the representative assholes . 
  did n't know that , have n't been in oslo in ages . 
  do n't got max in norway i think so would n't really work . 
  not a bad burger though , would eat again . 
  is n't that for a single big mac and not a value meal ? 
  it claims it costs 48 nok for one here but a value meal is closer to double that . 
  i looked at way too many people shitting on people being eurosceptics in the comments ( see even the dumbest jokes enough over time and it gets to you i guess ) and i forgot about the voting part . 
  i think i get what he means but his wording could be better i agree . 
  sorry if i came off as an ass . 
   he knows the solution would be a different eu so he is sceptical to the current one ? 
  not wanting it in it 's current form ? 
  so a different one would be great right ? 
  not to sound like a dick , honest question but have eurosceptic meant euro abolitionist all along ? 
  just because i see a car and see how broken down it is or how much it pollutes does n't make me want to swear off cars all together . 
  i just think we should try to fix the car before getting in so the wheel do n't fall of or pollute even more . 
  everyone sees the benefit of the car , only blind people want to ignore that the car is in need of some serious repair . 
  he is pointing out how a proper system could have fixed the problem back in the day , but seeing how the system is n't good enough its just one of the reasons he has turned into a eu sceptic . 
  he is n't claiming that the current system could put something into place now and fix it . 
  then he would n't be a sceptic at all and probably still be a federalist . 
  it 's a poll for european countries . 
  i blame all the eu lovers . 
  clearly it 's racis . 
  uhm . . unionism ? 
  ah , did n't think of that . 
  was n't sure what you meant and the only thing i could think of was a bordercrossing thing but that did n't make sense 'cause schengen . 
  semi unrelated but whatever happened to that buss thing ? 
  ( i think it happened in sweden ) . 
  some immigrants did n't want to move out of the cities so they they sat on the buss an moped . 
  in what way should/would it be protected ? 
  `` there 's a reason you separate military and the police . 
  one fights the enemies of the state , the other serves and protects the people . 
  when the military becomes both , then the enemies of the state tend to become the people . '', 
  i like to imagine something like that quote was the mindset for rules like that . 
  what ? 
  did you just misread my message completely or did i write it all wrong ? 
  no big news that other than people from that country would care about and upvote . 
  most of the news from our coutries would also be in out local langage so unless it 's a huge bit of news i do n't see the point of posting only news interesting for locals that can mostly only be read by locals . 
  that 's more news for `` what happened in your country this week '' threads . 
  ive never really though about it but would n't they use their country flag ? 
  like if they are living in germany they use a german flag etc ? 
  seems about right for 5 people . 
  everyone seeing how getting your record is a pain in the ass so you wo n't get it unless you really really need it . 
  i feel both are correct just like us/uk spelling of words . 
  our treatment of the sami is kinda bad too though . 
  canadas pants got a hat ? 
  i guess deleting stuff for not being racist enough is a sort of moderating . 
  cool , thanks . 
  do n't know much about finnish history . 
  so the scandinavian peninsula was named for the scandinavian countries on it and then finland later decided on becoming it 's own country and it just ended up on the scandinavian peninsula because that was named long before finland was even a thing ? 
  i honestly just though it was named by majority being scandianvian thing . 
  s & n - `` this is scandinavia now because we are on it . '', 
  f - `` but we are on it '' s - `` too late , already named it . 
  so i guess we are going to conquer you now so we are n't wrong . '', 
  is n't the scandinavian peninsula named after the scandinavian countries occupying majority of it ? 
  if it was named while finland was part of sweden then in theory the peninsula was all scandinavian so the name makes sense , but when finland became it 's own country part of finland ended up being on the peninsula . 
  i mean scandinavia is n't about geography at all so i 've always wondered about the peninsula and the naming . 
  feels like there is some odd history behind it . 
  it 's not a geographical region at all but a language , history and culture region . 
  kinda like the anglosphere is . 
  finland do n't got the same history mixing as the scandinavian countries do it only sorta does by proxy by being swedish for a while . 
  language , well do n't really need to explain that one . 
  culture sure in most ways , but so does iceland , faraoes \u00e5land etc. 
  we ca n't just pick finland and leave the others out just because finland hits one out of three . 
  it 's either all or none . 
  is n't this comment a circlejerk comment too ? 
  `` get out of here with your logic '' or similar can be seen on basically any slightly controversial topic these days ? 
  dude , it 's an american , he said so himself so do n't do anything rash !, 
  sorta click baity headline is n't it ? 
  we liked the danish design a lot so we stole it , we liked the swedish idea of stealing so we stole the colour blue from them but we are the best scandinavians and felt like this should be shown on our flag so we went with three colours instead of just two . 
  honestly i do n't know . 
  some say the colours were picked because it was the ` color of freedom like in the french flag ' some say the colours are for our union partners from the past ( denmark ) and current , at the time , union partner sweden and i like to think it 's the latter . 
  the nordic cross is because nordic . 
  and greenland !, 
  yes ? 
  i have yet to see them actually endorse guns , but if you got a source where to prove me wrong please share .

why aye man ? 
  if that is representative for the town and the region , i am glad they where taken into the russian sphere , because i do n't want them in the eurosphere . 
  does this mean that they will be giving up their efta membership as well ? 
  this seems to explain her quarrel with norway http://voiceofrussia.com/2012_04_18/72168091/, 
  norwegian salmon , inferior to the belarusian . 
  she has a norwegian surname , which makes it stranger . 
  underpricing your oil/gas for geopolitical gains is something russia can not afford with where the current energy prices seems to be heading . 
  `` he calculates that at an oil price of $ 85 per barrel , russia would run a deficit of around 3 percent of gdp - enough to wipe out the whole of the reserve fund in a single year . '', 
  `` it sounds like a lot of money , but it can go quite quickly if oil prices were to fall much further , '' he said , noting that new production technologies are adding to the risk . 
  `` it 's perfectly possible given the shale oil revolution and the increase in global supply . '', 
  http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/08/19/russia-economy-budget-oil-idusl5n0qp1ar20140819 one one side you have shale producers investing a lot of money in extraction , and opec pushing up production to try to make less shale-projects viable . 
  well . 
  the nazis did not call it festnung norwegen for nothing . 
  a soviet occupied norway would put the soviets next to the uk . 
  surely the allies would not like that . 
  i think both sides were trying to put as many buffer states as possible between each other . 
  because they knew that their two political systems would define the coming decades . 
  surely norway was talked about at the yalta conference . 
  you do n't think the soviets left norway because the allies said `` hands off ? '', 
  norway would have been one hell of a geopolitical spoil of war with its geography and geology . 
  the allies and the soviets started carving up europe long before the war was over . 
  that is not strange at all . 
  because the process is practically ( but not technically ) irreversible , those who are uncut does not have a race in the horse in the same way . 
  basically , a uncut person could still do the operation , but when you are uncut , its a higher emotional and psychological barrier to admit that you do n't feel it is natural , because it is irreversible and something that always have been a part of you . 
  of course you are glad to be cut , the alternative would be to be unhappy with something you can not change . 
  if that is the case , then this surely must be evident in the std statistics between eu and the us ? 
  `` limited data is available for sti rates in europe . 
  however , data from the netherlands found that rates of reported incidence are considerably higher in the united states . 
  [ 6,7 ] further , comparisons of prevalence ( the proportion of a given population which is infected ) find that the chlamydia prevalence among young adults in the united states is twice that among young adults in the netherlands .

  which leaves two alternatives : do you mean that greece should have defaulted ? 
  or that germany ( and many others ) in effect took over their debt-burden without making them fix their deficit ? 
  there were only two tools available , raising taxes or cutting costs . 
  the problem was simply that there was coming less money in , than was going out . 
  raising taxes was obviously not considered the best of the two options , because of the effects it would have on the struggling private economy in those countries , and there was obviously a lot of waste in the public sector of those economies , which made the solution pretty clear in my book . 
  those nations had to accept austere policies before anyone ( eu , germany , imf you name it ) could provide security . 
  the problem had to be attacked at the root , so it did not involve into a black hole . 
  in my book , it could not have played out in any other way . 
  crushing austerity ? 
  the alternative to austerity was not paying sovereign debts and default . 
  turning the whole of southern europe into argentina . 
  you do n't fix a budget deficit by spending more money . 
  using investment as a way to boost economy may have its merit , but it was not the right tool to bring those nations into solvency . 
  they needed to fix the deficit , then use investments . 
  africa + industrial agriculture could feed the world . 
  but yields are not good when investment can not flood into the industry , because western trade barriers are set up to protect our own farmers . 
  i think africa can sustain 2 billion more easier than india/china . 
  its bigger , is is more fertile . 
  just the nation of congo is 2/3 the size of india . 
  norway beaten by jordan . . 
  the probability of slipping and breaking your neck on the keyboard while playing fps is still larger than dying in combat in the bundeswehr . 
  prediction : - turkey will not be able to contain these people , if the flow increases . 
  - these refugees will travel to istanbul to hide from central government . 
  - large slums of refugees will form in istanbul . 
  result : istanbul is going to be evolve into a third-world vis-a-vis hyper-modern megalopolis , as taken out of a cyberpunk novel . 
  ubaydullah was observed driving one of the cars . 
  i do . 
  if everything stays on track and erdogan is not the closet-islamist everyone makes him out to be . 
  and leaders who are taking the country in a more autocratic tradition under the mask of populism . 
  also , hungary takes it name from the huns , which was a turkic or related people . 
  and has been the gateway for people of the steps into europe . 
  so in some ways i see how you would consider hungary more so than say albania or bosnia . 
  who said that there would be no short term loss/damage from breaking out of the union . 
  scots have to ask themselves , what kind of scotland do we envision in 30 years . 
  then they have to see if they best can realize this goal on their own or with the rest of the uk . 
  there are costs and opportunities connected with all options . 
  i wonder what europe partitioned into states of equal gdp would look like ... 
  looks like the way the rest of the uk ( and especially england ) is reacting , only will fuel more support for independence , which would again fuel more of these kinds of reactions . 
  the ottomans and the poles had some battles did they not ?

  it is only a proposal , so . . 
  i can see one or two things the russian could do which would disincentivize membership ... like if they stopped invading ukraine . 
  was not the terrorists strapped with explosives in a cramped space with all the children ? 
  seems like they had two options . 
  kill all the terrorists with collateral damage , or let the terrorists kill everyone ? 
  surely they are attacking ukrainian fishing boats which are infringing on the belarusian shrimp industry . 
  i wonder if nato does the same ? 
  if not , then this is an act of aggression of sorts . 
  got ta keep an eye on their # 1 mercedes market . 
  thats what happens when you oppose the merkmeister . 
  public spending can get an economy out of a rot , but reform must lead the way , if not , you or simply just pumping more money ( ie fuel ) into the machine that demonstratively did not work to begin with . 
  one is simply pushing the problems a head , which sadly has been the mantra of the western world the last decades . 
  that being said , there is probably a mile apart france and greece , in terms of waste , barriers to business and inefficiencies . 
  but every european nation has these issues on some level . 
  their kind should sit in the back if you ask me . 
  now, 
  i am thinking that europe needs the uk and it does not need the uk . 
  it is two futures . 
  one where the uk bring wholesome values to a more and more integrated europe . 
  the other is the scenario , where europe integrate faster with itself without the uk , which will bring value on its own . 
  i am not saying one scenario is better than the other , but the uk needs to make up its collective mind . 
  you should travel to playa del ingles , then you will see first hand the magnificent culture they want to protect from you continental degenerates . 
  / i kid , kind of . 
  perception is reality , we all live in our own collective dream worlds . 
  just , some of us are dreaming more than others , . 
  or neither ? 
  which actually was my point . 
  there is a million ways to pin this , but it all comes down to some deranged extremists . 
  they come in every color and creed , and we can never truly make our society 100 % percent safe from these elements . 
  more often than not , the extremists come from middle class backgrounds .

do n't need it to cover all of europe . 
  let countries join this if they want and any company that wants to compete in these countries will be on the list . 
  ( not on the list = not allowed to compete ), 
  we have something like this in norway for owners or members of the companies , and we have something like this for every tax payer . 
  i do n't see why it would be such an extension atleast her in norway . 
  make all companies register all their workers in a online website that all citizens can check ? 
  then you have a counter fine if your report turns out bogus you pay the costs it took to check out that claim . 
  [ jan mayen ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jan_mayen ), 
  we should have an island to put them on, 
  the nordics have around 1/3 of the gdp of russia , we 'd be able to defend ourselves fine . 
  it 's not like russia will commit 100 % to a war against us , plus norway , denmark and iceland are still in nato plus i do n't think you understand how much centralized government ignore less populated areas . 
  well for one it would ensure more focus on the deference of the nordic countries . 
  an eu wide policy would probably focus less on the deference of the nordics compared to a nordic union . 
  well hopefully , the world does n't need to grow more in population . 
  fuck that, 
  damn i want a cabin like that one day . 
  and this is why many do n't like the eu ... 
  what do you expect ? 
  these people tried before to voice their views and opinions and were promptly silenced . 
  you think that 's just going to make the problem go away ? 
  if you turn the heat up to max and then put on the lid do n't be surprised when it boils over . 
  you could either lower the heat or take off the lid or both even . 
  lowering the heat is reducing immigration , taking off the lid would be giving these people a voice . 
  it 's unreal really how much of a echo chamber reddit really is . 
  but i guess when you make a forum and give people the right to silence others by downvoting and then upvoting what they agree with . 
  yeah probably not the best place to come for political discussion . 
  [ yes there is and it seems #bregret is a very vocal minority !, 
  more people who voted remain are happy with the result even . 
  ] ( https://twitter.com/britainelects/status/746820394217259008 ), 
  yeah why ca n't you just open up the couontry and let anyone come to the uk . 
  and off course anyone who comes to the uk and says they live there should also be allowed to use their social security systems to get money . 
  that would solve all racism right there !, 
  mostly . 
  i want a fta deal like japan has . 
  from talking with most people i know we 'd be out of the e\u00d8s if we had a vote on it . 
  but it is a major part of why people want out of the eu . 
  they do n't want those policies and laws put upon them by brussels . 
  just saying it 's good is not going to make people agree . 
  or they could just trade with the eu as japan does . 
  you do n't need freedom of movement to trade you know ... 
  your economy makes me sad, 
  naw that was germany a long time ago . 
  brussels made this mess so i 'll make them pay for it . 
  they 've fucked it for good until sanctions are lifted again . 
  so why would i care if brussels and eu collapses . 
  their country should be able to stand on its own or it is a failed state . 
  they should be able to sort out issues like this themselves . 
  but yes i am anti establishment . 
  we need major reforms that give local areas much more political will over their own area . 
  i do n't give a fuck about my economy . 
  i just want to watch this union die . 
  russia conquering everything in the world that is n't nato would be another great war no matter how you turn it . 
  also if countries do n't want to be annexed by russia then they should get their shit together and join some sort of defense union . 
  i 'm not the world police that 's the uss job . 
  it 's not my issue . 
  ukraine was n't the best state before the conflict they had major revolts in kiev showing distrust for their own government . 
  the deterrence is n't for ukraine , it 's for norway . 
  deterrence not a fullscale war ... 
  unless the russians are that stupid then yeah there would be a war . 
  but it would come from their hands . 
  just cause you disagree does n't mean you have to downvote . 
  you just ca n't force your world ideals on everyone and expect people to just agree . 
  the eu is doomed because many people inside the eu do n't agree with it 's heading . 
  have you heard of [ nato ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nato ) ? 
  just cause the eu goes down does n't mean nato would just dissapear edit : ohh you 're talking about ukraine maybe ? 
  ehh could n't care less , it 's not my issue . 
  ohh no i agree . 
  i 'm very anti establishment i know those cunts wont care about the rural country . 
  currently live in a rural part of norway waaay up north . 
  we have to bitch and whine to get hospitals and police up here . 
  my friend currently lives in a town 3 hours away from hospital and 1.5 hour away from police . 
  he could call the police right now screaming someone is trying to break into his apartment and he 'd have to survive 1.5 hours ... and then they come and ask for more centralization , fuck off . 
  after the russian sanction a few years back shit went tits up for fishing industry up north . 
  and it 's still tits up i 'd say . 
  all because some suits in brussels said `` hur dur russia bad '' i know people who lost jobs and almost their house because of this . 
  and for that reason i hope brussels burn without the uk so we can jump ship too . 
  why did they need the suits in brussels send them the money ? 
  could n't the uk figure it out internally ? 
  and i hope they all do . 
  brussels can burn to the ground the eu almost wiped my area from the map with their stupid policies on russian trade . 
  we are still cutting jobs and it 's hard to get into the job market here so for me i hope for the love of god that brexit will collapse the eu . 
  against the establishment then ? 
  there will be no `` cold war '' just because a country wants to rule itself from within their own borders . 
  the world is not the same as it was at the start of the 20th century . 
  as long as the uk keeps their laws within their own borders why should we care ? 
  so what ? 
  do you think this will somehow end in a great war ? 
  if so i 'd say that 's very unlikely . 
  i do n't see any issues with countries closing down more and being more nationalistic . 
  free trade , and nothing more should be an option . 
  there will always be held an election later on . 
  if you alienate people now they may never vote for `` your '' side , whatever `` your '' side is, 
  yeah but calling the other side stupid , racist , bigot , uneducated etc etc will not win over those to your side ( your still fighting with ideals vs ideals , so calling the other side names that does not apply will just make them more firmly against you ), 
  still not winning over those votes, 
  giving up sovrenity to brussels ? 
  that 's pretty fucking huge if you ask me . 
  if you really think countries vying for their own sovreighty by cutting diplomatic ties will turn into a world war you are delusional . 
  cause fuck the eu . 
  edit : i would have voted leave myself , but i do n't think it would have been the smarter choice . 
  i only disagree with the idea of a eu .

  thats why it is best to keep both . 
  ca n't think of any place where cash is better . 
  except illegal transactions . 
  here every store goes to the bank with the surplus cash the next day and deposit it . 
  try to pay an institution or business with the same amount in cash and i 'll guarantee you that they will become suspicious . 
  stores over here are required to notify the authorities if you pay with large amounts of cash . 
  that 's the argument i have for banking electronically . 
  my bank even has an option for budgeting where you can see what money you have used on different services . 
  food , clothers , transport etc. 
  we have strong consumer protection laws here . 
  not to mention we do indeed have a large amount of trust for eachother . 
  too bad for the bank as they loose a lot of money by loosing their trust from the customer . 
   what is wrong with the idea of having both side by side ? 
  it 's more the fact that when over 90 % of the population does n't use cash the extra cost of catering to those who do just is n't worth it . 
  i know literally no one here in norway who exclusively use cash for payments . 
  even my grandma only use card when she is shopping . 
  i remember working at a grocery store and dealing with cash is such a hassle compared to electronic payments . 
  i think a lot of time and resources could be used better by having a cash-free society . 
   if power or internet or even the banks servers go down , you ca n't buy food or anything . 
  cash always works . 
  most stores here shut down when there is a power outage . 
  for accounting reasons everything is recorded electronically anyways . 
   this is the estimated cost of five bridges , a tunnel and a stretch where they havent decided what to build . 
  \u00a8 that is the cost for the entire thing including motorway on all stretches . 
  we have the money , just go ahead . 
  too bad politicians want tolls to finance it making a previously good investment a bad one . 
   it 's easy to hate an argument when you do n't understand the point of it . 
  it 's not a good argument when politicians and the state budget have told us for years that the reason for bad roads in norway is not the landscape , but because politicians simply have n't prioritized it . 
  not to mention cars have been called a `` luxury '' item for years making politicians ignore roads to somehow get us to use it less . 
  i am aware of this . 
  the point is that it should have been done years ago . 
  because anything right of centre in politics is taboo on this site . 
  objectivly this is by far the best infrastructure minister we 've had by far . 
  you may not agree with everything the party stands for , but give credit where it 's due . 
  it 's like you say only a real problem if you go away from eastern norway . 
  i now live here in the east and it 's amazing how much of a difference there is . 
  i guess the people in the north and west are very patient people to be content with the situation . 
   where in norway is the first example from ? 
  from helgeland south of saltfjellet . 
  it must be said that the road is in the process of being upgraded , but it 's not done until 2018 or something . 
   we are in a period where there is a shift from building cities and infrastructure to suit cars ( which has been the case from 1965 -  today ) , to building cities and infrastructure to suit people and transit . 
  but why is there parts of the main road between the two largest cities in norway not wide enough for a yellow line ? 
  that 's the least you could expect ... 
   i 've travelled extensively in finland and sweden and the roads are n't that good here either when you get to the roads that just support local people . 
  the e10 through northern sweden is great i must admit !, 
  classic case of `` you do n't know what you have until it 's gone '' . 
  i 've heard danes , germans and brits complaining about their roads and i just have to laugh . 
  never experienced any bad roads in those countries . 
  not in poland either i should mention . 
   this sounds cool , what would you say is the minimum wage in your country ? 
  for people over 18 i would say around 147 nok ( 12,7 # ) / hour since that is what year are entitled to at a grocery store . 
  for people under 18 it 's usually around 100 nok ( 8,65 # ) / hour . 
  the lowest wage i 've heard someone get while over 18 was 130 nok ( 11,25 # ) / hour but she was a waitress so she probably got some tips in addition . 
   do you think the unions are ever disruptive ? 
  not really since employers and trade unions are generally pragmatic . 
   what happens when an industry dies and people need to be fired because it is not cost effective any more ? 
  that 's kind of what is happening now that the oil price has been cut in half . 
  the response from the unions are a general real wage freeze for workers in the oil and gas sector . 
  if the industry is doing bad it 's not much the unions can do to people getting fired . 
  usually the previous employer will try to help them get a new job . 
  on the upside traditional exports are booming because of a week currency so workers in these industries can expect a pay rise . 
   for example what do you think will happen when automation takes most jobs ? 
  i have no idea . 
  employment levels are high and unemployment are low at the moment so i do n't think they have given it much thought . 
  it 's not cheap by all means , but we manage . 
  i agree it was n't the best example . 
  [ but what about the e39 between bergen \\ ( 275 112 inhabitants \\ ) and stavanger-region/haugesund ( population 242 264 ) ] ( http://i.imgur.com/t9jtfu6.jpg ) ? 
  the roads around oslo are great , but only there . 
  like you said the usd has strenghten a lot . 
  so if you go to a bar you now pay $ 10 for a beer . 
  in the store i costs between 3-4 dollars . 
  so for americans wanting to visit norway , now is the time to do it . 
  it 's 30-40 % cheaper than it used to . 
  they have done great when it comes to infrastructure so far . 
  [ a good summary can be found here ] ( http://www.solvikolsen.com/2015/05/1355/ ) . 
  i did n't even vote frp and yet they are the ones i have been most impressed by so far . 
  let 's go to a road that is more widely used should we . 
  [ the e16 at sandvika has a traffic of 35 000 cars a day , but is still a two lane road . 
  ] ( http://i.imgur.com/onl6hjw.jpg ) the treshold for building a four lane road is 12 000 vehicles a day if i recall correctly . 
   and why are you on about building controlled-access highways specifically now ? 
  you 're right . 
  it should have been done 40 years ago . 
   you do n't take into account the total length of the roads needed to be maintained compared to population size and how that maintainance compared to the danish climate must be quite a bit higher . 
  if we would have built roads properly they would n't need so much maintenance . 
  [ instead you end up with roads like this after 1 winter ] ( http://bil.aftenposten.no/prodtest/article19332.ece/alternates/w780c169/telehiv.jpg ) . 
  norwegian roads are no buil to stand the winters . 
   and how about tunnels , bridges , mountain roads etc. 
  that are all expensive and challenging in it 's own right . 
  they 're expensive , but if you build one it will stay there for 50-100 years with minor maintenance . 
  previous infrastructure-ministers have all admitted that it 's more fun to open new roads than to maintain what 's already been built . 
  the good thing is that we have finally gotten an infrastructure minister with vision and efficiency .

  it 's just a shitty excuse for politicans to not take responsibility for bad infrastructure . 
  they 're there but they are badly maintaned and underdimentioned . 
  the world bank have n't been here apparantly . 
  ports , airports , it-infrastructure and the electricity grid is in good condition , the rest is bad . 
  atleast your roads are superior . 
  here both roads and railways suck .

  thrashiest city is drammen . 
  ridiculous, 
  i like our [ current national anthem ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suayojmtbyq ) , but i would much rather have [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_wm0mfatk4 ) which i know many norwegians want too , but the main argument against has always been that it 's * too * nationalistic , and it would make immigrants feel uncomfortable . 
  not too many years ago they stopped singing it in music classes across the country and even on the national day march some places it has been avoided because of this . 
  both links have texts in english . 
  in norway you go through two schools before you choose if you either want to pursue a `` vocational path '' or academic . 
  when you take this choice you are in your last year of `` ungdomsskolen '' ( youth school ) and are 15-16 years . 
  if you want to be a mechanic then you apply to `` mechanic school '' and study for two years and then two years of paid internship until you graduate with a `` vocational '' diploma . 
  if you want to pursue academics then you apply for high school after `` ungdomsskolen '' and attend high school for three years , get a diploma and then apply for university . 
  only people with this diploma can attend universities . 
  i believe all of europe has variations of this kind of system . 
   are there some careers , ( i 'm thinking pedagogy in particular ) , that are considered `` vocational '' in your country that are not in the us ? 
  no , pedagogy is a university class . 
  vocational is only work like carpenter , mechanic , electrician , nurse ( a kind of nurse ) , receptionist , security guard etc is vocational . 
  you could probably attend a vocational school and become a teacher assistant though . 
  but if it 's teacher you want to be then you have take a five year masters to be it , in norway . 
   is there less of a stigma about it in your country ? 
  people with several years less school are radically different than people with masters and phds . 
  they both think some way of eachother . 
  this is n't an american thing . 
  this goes for norway too . 
  that would be cool . 
  i do n't think we will though . 
  something like [ this ] ( http://www.tuil.no/images/artikler/bj_rnar_russ_hviler_i_gresset_1148137417.jpg ) or [ this ] ( http://dbstatic.no/61592596.jpg?imageid=61592596&amp;x=0&amp;y=0&amp;cropw=100.00&amp;croph=100.00&amp;width=1024&amp;height=576 ), 
  and the faroe islands, 
  theres little written from the actual time 790-1050 , the written history is mainly from a couple hundred years later . 
  like snorres edda etc. 
  now i 'm having trouble defining ancient history , it seems to be the antique period from google translate . 
  but from logic it seems to mean old history . 
  the viking age certainly is ancient history as in old history , but it 's not ancient history as in the antique period . 
  it 's the early middle ages and the oldest written history for any scandinavian country . 
  so it 's the oldest written history we have - the most ancient we have . 
  it 's not ancient or old relative to other countries though . 
  vikings, 
  never seen a full game . 
  but from what i 've seen , no . 
  preaty much this, 
  france , italy or the uk . 
   i have a norwegian mother and a danish father , and speak both languages everyone can speak danish , just gag on a potato and make some sounds . 
  i get free food if i work here , [ right ? 
  how about we take all the colours ^ except ^ yellow ^ because ^ fuck ^ sweden . 
  now it 's perfect . 
  norwegian has butchered vienna for me , it 's called wien and is as unsexy as every other german word . 
  would never go there over paris or rome . 
  btw rome, 
  any motorsport are pretty much nonexistent, 
  religion - like . . culturally yeah , spiritually ? 
  agnostic probably , dunno food - love it all , except for [ smalahove ] ( http://media4.origo.no/-/cache/image/2681997_hc5fe00fd465f73892f67_v1412856715_800x.jpeg ) fashion - i recently learned there is a thing called scandinavian fashion or scandinavian minimalism in both clothing and general design . 
  i guess subconsciously i 've followed that fashion gestures - do n't understand what you mean by that ? 
  if it is physical norms then the ones i can think about is not looking people in the eyes in public , not greeting strangers , [ not sitting next to people on the bus ( those two in the front are clearly tourists ) ] ( http://forskning.no/sites/default/files/styles/full_width/public/329154_buss-bredde_none.jpg?itok=pbvuu-hw ) etc. 
  then i 'm definitely a norwegian in those terms . 
  if it 's gestures like the italians talking with their hands then no , we do n't do that in norway , and yes that goes for me too . 
  so overall i guess im quite traditional by your definition ? 
  danish, 
  i used to expect everyone to speak english as a second language in the western world , learned the hard way that it 's not the case . 
   i heard that some people will appreciate it if tourists try to speak their languages i rarely meet a tourist who knows any norwegian phrases , when i do i respond in english because my dialect is basically another language than the dialect foreigners learn , but i find it really amusing though and appreciate the effort . 
  most , if not all norwegians know english pretty good or fluently and are happy to get to use it once in a while . 
  so if you 're ever in norway you can talk english to whoever you want without worrying about offending them . 
  when i test my language skills as a tourist in germany ( took german in high school ) it 's often met with enthusiasm , and sometimes they do n't even bother . . 
  but mostly positive reactions . 
  in my experience people from benelux also does n't care if you approach them in english or their native language . 
  the people i have met from the baltics and poland are not as good in english but they do n't really care as long as they are understood , which i think is a healthy relationship with foreign languages . 
  it 's mainly in germany and france in my experience that i have to approach in their language and ask if they speak english before continuing in english . 
  especially in france , the stereotype that they are cold and distant if you do n't make an effort is very true in my experience . 
  i agree with the brit here , if anything the most democratic thing is to let the people control their country . 
  what could be more democratic than removing a representative government and replacing it with the people ? 
  that 's communisms ultimate goal , which unfortunately has n't been achieved * yet * . 
  but it 's still what communism is defined as . 
  keep in mind that communism is more of an umbrella term for different variations of socialist systems . 
  only some of them has revolution as a core belief . 
  like for example trotskyism . 
  other variations of communism can be achieved through democratic elections , like it has in scandinavia where it started out as communism and developed to democratic socialism . 
  not really much good music from norway on an international level in my opinion , i ca n't stand the kygo/alan walker-type of music . 
  the metal in norway is too hard and a-ha have a couple of `` fun '' songs . . 
  but if you 're into hip-hop i think lately we 've had a boom in really great rap in norway ( and norwegian unfortunately ) . 
  karpe diem did a politically charged album last year which still baffles me how relevant and smart the lyrics are . 
  if you understand norwegian i recommend [ karpe diem 's album `` heisann montebello '' ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ll3_eyzkym&amp;list=pl9xmzveortuuzej8xunj8cs_gvfotyehw ) ( song number one is more of an intro , number two is a normal song with heavy meaning and the rest is top notch rap ) . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ya3h9pkwvze ) you might have heard [ sigrid - do n't kill my vibe ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzonqoon9eo ) on the radio , it 's annoyingly catchy and really big at the moment . 
  other than hiphop and the possibly one hit wonder sigrid , [ i think ary might be onto something ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-tkbnakmk8 ) with a couple of great songs already made . 
  mildly triggered by communist being mentioned in the same breath as neo-fascist . . actual extreme opinions is legal and all , but if you were to practice hatred of any sort towards someone you could be fined or jailed for personal attack . 
  example : a hairdresser in norway talked alot of shit about muslims in general and their religion , she refused women with hijab to enter her saloon and nobody cared until a muslim woman entered , got thrown out and took her to court for discrimination . 
  she lost , appealed and lost again , sued some people for calling her a nazi , lost that too . 
  they last you your whole life , they are full of jewelry/silverware . 
  men have a knife of silver and they are all handcrafted . 
  and 5k euro is n't as much to a [ norwegian ] ( http://statisticstimes.com/economy/countries-by-projected-gdp-capita.php ) as it is to most other . 
  keep in mind a beer on a pub in either major city is between 10-30 euros each . 
  and often a bunad is given as a gift on confirmation day from the parents ( christian tradition , dunno if other countries practice this as a tradition ) . 
  but still it 's a pretty steep price even to a norwegian , but it 's kind of worth . 
  yup , more like languages or variations of scnadinavian/northern-germanic . 
  my dialect has as much in common with lets say oslo as it have with faroese , danish or swedish . 
  pretty cool that we still understand each other . 
  firstly i think norway , and all other countries in nato that already is n't - should spend their fair share of 2 % . 
  if there were a `` euto '' instead , i feel that even more of a contribution should be made . 
  usas ridicolous military spending makes up 73 % of nato . 
  if we were to remove them and team up in europe/eu we would have to replace their share so we could `` rival '' them and have a say in global geopolitics etc. 
  yeah , definitely with some k\u00e5lrabi on the side and a good jule\u00f8l . 
  [ bunad ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bunad ) is our formal party wear . 
  mainly used on 17 . 
  may , two days ago ( still hungover ) . 
  our constitution day .

  it 's probably more prevalent in northern europe compared southern and central europe even . 
  i 've worked a couple of summer jobs in a restaurant in a fairly touristy area , and most , if not all of the brits that visited were of the posh or wealthy type . 
  it probably did not help that i had a posh british guy as a cello teacher and that the conductor in our school orchestra was posh and british as well . 
  i probably had that perception of the brits until my later teens when i was introduced to the wonders of british media beyond mr. 
  beans , harry potter , heartbeat and james bond . 
  the us of a. 
   so abolishing slavery in the us was n't necessary then ? 
   democracy was n't necessary ? 
   women being allowed to vote was n't necessary ? 
   workers rights ( including banning child labor , introducing regulation for safety in the work place and limiting working hours and  ensuring a liveable wages ) was n't necessary ? 
   the details vary , but very few countries have ever moved away from authoritarian regimes without any form of violence or force being used . 
  good job at completely circumventing my point about public support . 
   violence and destruction of property played some role for all of these movements . 
  is that that the reason for their success though ? 
  arbitrary destruction never helped the workers , but rather the fact that they refused to offer their services to employers , and public support , and peaceful demonstrations in the late 60s is what facilitated the women 's liberation , not the episodic violence that occurred . 
  it seems to me that you 're looking at `` revolutionary violence '' through rose-tinted glasses and thus , you 're attributing too much of certain movement 's successes to it , while , in fact , a few broken windows is n't what broke the camel 's back . 
  i 'm not saying that violence never is justified , but in many cases where it 's used , it is not . 
  i like how karl popper put it :  `` the use of violence is justified only under a tyranny which makes reforms without violence impossible , and should have only one aim , that is , to bring about a state of affairs which makes reforms without violence possible . '', 
  and as far as i know , we 're living in a time where reforms without violence are possible through democratic institutions , would n't you agree ? 
  if you have to change things through violent means , the change really is n't necessary as it is unable to garner enough public support to take any meaningful democratic action . 
  that 's why essentially every violent revolution turns authoritarian at one point or another , and oftentimes , you end up with something even more oppressive than what was before where dissidents are killed or jailed left and right , and the leaders , whoever they may be , will make sure to have a stranglehold the populace because they 're aware of the contempt people will harbour against them . 
  rule by fear if you will . 
  public support should be the crux of any policial decision that is made . 
  worker 's rights would n't have been secured by a fringe group without public support , nor would women 's rights and trying to facilitate political change in a way the black bloc does is inherently undemocratic and goes against the basic democratic principles however you may try to look at it . 
  some people use them for weddings as well . 
  a salad as a side dish and fruits for breakfast , lunch , or supper is not uncommon at all . 
  also , just fish and potatoes are not something that 's widely consumed anymore . 
  we 're talking about stds here , not genetic predispositions that 'd be uncovered in a newborn screening test . 
   the government needs money by essentially taxing the poor and making the venue even worse off . 
  although there is a state monopoly on gambling in norway , the revenue does n't go to some treasury or a hedge fund and is never used to fund projects that would have been funded through taxation otherwise . 
  the thing is that `` norsk tipping '' is private corporation where the state is the sole shareholder and it is treated as such as well . 
  apart from the operating expenses ( taxes , hiring , pay-outs , etc. 
  ) , the revenue they make is given out as grants to sports clubs , cultural events , and humanitarian causes , and although it is state owned , it is n't really the state that allocates the revenue to specific causes , as it operates independently . 
  spot on i 'd say . 
  i too have never tipped in norway , but i 've done it abroad , both in the us and in different european countries as i feel like it is expected ( and practically mandatory in the us ) , especially in the touristy areas . 
   there 's just this constant shitty feeling inside me that learning a language is a miserable , arbitrary , authoritarian exercise in forcing you into a mould . 
  if that 's how you feel you should probably let it go , and if you 're living in an english speaking country you do n't relly have any reason to force yourself to do something that you absolutely detest . 
   the bemused looks . 
  the jabs at my birthright . 
  you 're probably overthinking it , most people expect people from english-speaking countries with english-speaking parents to be monolingual . 
  i 'm very comfortable where i am right now and chances are that i 'll never move to another country unless fate throws something my way . 
  however , if i were to move somewhere else it 'd probably be either the us or japan as i 've already spent a fair bit of time in both of the countries and feel that i have a little bit more than a cursory understanding of both the languages and cultures respectively . 
   globalisation i think you 're confusing globalization and globalism . 
  the former is n't ideological in nature while the latter is . 
  obviously , both of them are fairly intertwined as globalists advocate for policies that lead to globalization at a higher tempo , i.e higher immigration , more free trade etc. 
  i do n't think most tump supporters oppose globalization in itself , as it probably would have happened in conjunction with the development of better technology , both in transports and communication regardless of the political affiliations governments might have at the time . 
  rather , they 're staunchly opposed to internationalists and people advocating for the slow dismantling of the nation-state . 
   this is an ideology primarily based on fear ; fear of losing jobs to mexicans , fear of muslims disintegrating american culture , fear of a loss of identity and homogeneity in their society . 
  it 's a human instinct to be wary of the unknown and that oftentimes translate into real life action without a significant connection to an overarching ideology . 
  that aside , if you 've ever seriously engaged with arguments against globalism , and liberalism for that matter , you 'd probably find that it goes a little bit deeper than muslim immigration or homogeneity . 
  political ideologies are more than free healthcare if you did n't already know , and most politically-minded people 's convictions stem from the fundamental ideas of an ideology , not from how much free shit they might or might not receive . 
  really ? 
  it 's safe to say that people would know that the american currency is dollar , but there are probably many people out there who do n't know the names of the other two . 
  ^ ^ ^ not ^ ^ ^ going ^ ^ ^ and ^ ^ ^ spending ^ ^ ^ my ^ ^ ^ time ^ ^ ^ in ^ ^ ^ front ^ ^ ^ of ^ ^ ^ my ^ ^ ^ computer ^ ^ ^ instead ^ ^ ^ :( . 
  hey , at least the king after will be that dabbing meme-connoisseur . 
   i think being a person is the ability to empathize and love . 
  that rules out psychopaths and highly dysfunctional people . 
  i would argue that our ability to make pragmatic decisions rather than decisions based upon emotional responses grant us personhood , more so than love and empathy . 
  personhood is quite complex and saying that our ability to feel love and empathy is the only denominator that should be used to judge one 's humanity does n't sit quite right with me . 
  edit : and if empathy is a prerequisite for personhood , why should it be granted to chimpanzees ? 
  they obviously lack the human perception of empathy . 
  depends , i think in the case of an unregulated society people would obviously find a way to coexist that would be mutually beneficial , and there would certainly be many unspoken rules that are loosely agreed upon . 
  a regulated society would be very predictable and safe but at the cost of any individuality , and i do n't think a society can flourish if people do n't feel like they 're in control of their own lives and to some degree are able to follow their dreams and aspirations . 
  i would probably go with country b. 
   you are n't being `` controlled '' by it . 
  it is simply the system . 
  stop blaming the system . 
  the us is a democracy , you can change the system , how hard it may be . 
  i hear a lot of americans and brits complaining about their respective political systems and how they favor two parties , but what they often fail to realize is that a system with many parties tends to transfer a disproportionate amount of power to the smaller parties through coalitions , which in my opinion is almost just as bad . 
  nope . 
  what a question ... 
  if two consenting adults of different races decide to have sex and/or to get married , they have my blessings . 
   no , culture is not something you can teach or write down or anything , it 's in constant movement and shifted several times massively over the years . 
  i 'm not saying that culture some static monolith that never changes , that would be asinine . 
  but i disagree with the claim that you ca n't teach culture . 
  you certainly can teach cultural cues , such as french people kiss each other on the cheek to greet or that the japanese bow to be polite , you 'd obviously have to immerse yourself in another culture if you want something more than an artificial understanding , and as a person that grew up with more than one culture surrounding me , i know that it is possible to coherently understand more than one culture . 
  secondly , if you ca n't teach culture , how can christians and muslims ever lay down their disputes and differences ? 
  after all , freedom of expression , secularism , and individualism are very much western cultural concepts and the bedrock of our society and culture , hence , i tend to value cultures that purvey these ideas above cultures that do n't . 
  if someone is going to bridge the gap between christians and muslims , it wo n't be the people from a non-secular society/culture and if building that bridge entails accepting values that go against the aforementioned ones rather than telling people to respect and accept them , i 'll always be against it . 
  cultural relativism does a good job of paving the path for something like that to happen . 
  you can throw whatever watered-down pejoratives you want my way , but at least i know that i 'm not the one fighting for cultures that deny people basic freedoms . 
  he never said anything about skin colour . 
  cultural compatibility is probably what he 's on about , and not subscribing to the idea of cultural relativism is not something i 'd regard as racism since culture , essentially , is a taught behavior . 
  judging people based on the amount of melanin in their skin is stupid . 
  judging people based on their moral and values are not , and oftentimes , both moral and values hail from your culture . 
  i do n't , however , i do n't really go out of my way to convey to the world what my beliefs are . 
  if politics ever comes up in a conversation i 'll happily argue for things that i believe are good . 
  sure , if you take a cursory glance at some of my political convictions some people might brand me as things that generally are untrue , but i have yet to experience people using pejoratives against me after a fair discussion where i 've had a chance to convey my beliefs from my point of view . 
  according to fiction i 've consumed , cern is already working on it . 
   '' [ ... ] restricting certain idea or speech by law [ ... ] '' ? 
  it might have been a poorly formulated example , but my point was that positive liberties tend to impede on people 's freedom and consent , i.e the welfare state or through taxes or hate speech laws through the denial of freedom of expression . 
   i dislike the economical part of liberalism . 
  spoiler : that 's the good part about ( classic ) liberalism and perhaps its most defining hallmark . 
   and the focus on negative freedom instead of positive freedom . 
  generally , liberalistic ideologies tend to advertise `` the marketplace of ideas '' , but restricting certain idea or speech by law are in a stark contradiction to the ideological core itself . 
  the contradiction that ( neo ) liberalism really is n't liberal is what draws the focus towards the negatives , as they 're the ones being restricted forcefully . 
  i see where he 's coming from . 
  ideologically speaking i dislike the concept of the nordic welfare state and welfare in general . 
  but for most people , me and op include , moving to a country that is situated closer to your personal political ideology on the political spectrum simply is n't worth it as the place you live is , in general , much more than the ruling ideology . 
  it 's friends , family , ties , language , culture , memories and everything in between .

  thank you norwegian ( and your cheap foreign labor ), 
  however people in norway have very similar standards of living to each other . 
  people sit around with a big house , a cabin , a boat , two annual holidays abroad , and two cars and still complain that everything is expensive . 
  and people can have all of that almost no matter what job they have as long as they do n't fuck around with their money . 
  in addition we have never spent a smaller percentage on our income on food , and people complain that food is expensive compared to other countries . 
  it is in absolute terms of course , but relative to income it is dirt cheap . 
  statistics for norway : 100 % of asked households have a cat . 
  source : has a cat . 
  next they 'll be accusing ( ( ( someone ) ) ) of poisoning the wells and kidnapping and eating children as well . 
  maybe that is what they mean with `` cultural marxism '' ? 
  is n't it fairly typical for young voters to have more extreme opionions ? 
  both to the left and right . 
  man , i 'm pretty open to differing political opinions , but that sub seems pretty much retarded . 
  i mean , jewish conspiracies ? 
  what year are they living in ? 
   similarly , norway does not mean `` northern way '' but `` north-land '' . 
  the most commonly accepted etymology for `` norge/noreg '' is indeed `` northern way '' or `` way north '' ( nor\u00f0vegr ), 
  norway `` northern way '' we 're simple people us nordics . 
  dishes made with dried fish can be quite tasty if done right . 
  we eat it even though most norwegians could pretty much fish from their own front garden . 
  very few italians here i guess , and the town is only about 60 000 people and already has a lot of restaurants . 
  and tbh i can get some pretty good pizza and pasta at a couple of restaurants , but they are more generally continental than purely italian . 
  still , i think a proper place could work out . 
  my brother in law is half italian and works as a butcher here . 
  he is considering opening up a restaurant . 
  hopefully something will come of it . 
  there 's also two italian restaurants . . run by turkish people, 
  yeah , i prefer bacalao to be honest , but my dad always makes me try the lutfisk every christmas . 
  still disgusting after 30 years . 
  we actually have a restaurant in my home town that serves exclusively portugese style bacalao , it 's quite popular in some parts of norway . 
  that 's preposterous !, 
  now excuse me while i go soak some dried and salted fish in lye to make it gelatinous . 
  the context of the article is actually a discussion on brexit and gb having the poorest regions in western europe, 
  yeah , i guess that is a weakness with this statistic since a lot of companies will have their head office registered in the capital . 
  it 's the same for norway . 
  from [ this article ] ( http://www.aftenposten.no/verden/de-bor-i-vest-europas-aller-fattigste-region-na-har-politikerne-begynt-a-hore-pa-deres-viktigste-krav-606208b.html ) in the norwegian newspaper aftenposten . 
  the vertical lines are the countries average . 
  in the article you can hover over to see the name of each region . 
  norways asterix indicate that the average counts off shore oil and gas , but it is n't counted into any of the regions directly . 
  great britain has both the highest and the lowest with inner london and west wales & the valleys respectively .

  looks about like my great grand parents lived in the 20s and 30s in rural norway . 
  this life style was pretty much gone in the 50s and 60s here . 
  interesting that it still exists somewhere . 
  yeah , the nordics drink the most coffee in the world and we come out of this pretty well tobacco and alcohol on the other hand . 
  both murmansk and trondheim are larger afaik . 
  murmansk would be the saddest capitol in the world though .

  the same boring cheese every norwegian eats : [ norvegia ] ( http://img.gfx.no/1988/1988476/tine%20norvegia%20m%20hovel%20farge%5b1%5d.956x538.jpg ) it 's a gouda of sorts i think . 
  having seven children is a leftover from when a lot more children died in infancy , people had that many children because very few were left over . 
  there has been a lag between improving health and the number of children people have , but it is going down year by year . 
  [ birth rates are falling everywhere except for two or three countries ] ( http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/sp.dyn.tfrt.in?year_low_desc=true ), 
  some regions and countries are struggling with conflict and hunger , but it is n't necessarily a trend for the whole continent . 
  the same goes for [ unemployment ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_unemployment_rate#/media/file:unemployment_rate_map_of_the_world_ ( ilo ) . svg ) . 
  you can even say that africa has a huge potential for improving their food output and food safety . 
  today we 're already producing enough food to feed our whole population despite people going hungry : http://www.worldhunger.org/2015-world-hunger-and-poverty-facts-and-statistics/ http://www.fao.org/docrep/006/y4525e/y4525e04.htm in fact some are claiming we already produce enough food to feed 10 billion people : https://foodfirst.org/publication/we-already-grow-enough-food-for-10-billion-people-and-still-cant-end-hunger/ meat also uses 4-5 times more water to produce than plants : https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2013/jan/10/how-much-water-food-production-waste and we are wasting a huge amount of the food we produce . 
  we can run out of some precious metals and fossil fuels , these need to be replaced somehow . 
  if you find a good source of energy it will solve most of our future worries . 
  food and water we can definitely produce enough of with some adjustments . 
  farming is already incredibly efficient and with some shift in global diets ( eating less meat for example ) it can definitely produce more . 
  what resources ? 
  at some point we 'll run out of oil , you need to replace that with something , hopefully before we are too far gone in global warming . 
  if we find a sustainable source of energy this population doubling wont effect us much . 
  we could even handle it using fossil fuels ( there is a ton of coal around ) if we did n't have to worry about co ^ 2, 
  there are a number of crazy people here that adhere to certain ideologies in this subreddit . 
  population growth is slowing and it will stop at some point . 
  we can definitely produce enough food . 
  population growth is slowing down everywhere : http://www.gapminder.org/videos/what-stops-population-growth/, 
  pollution sure , and everyone probably ca n't drive suvs and have huge tvs , but we can certainly produce enough food with a few adjustments . 
  average ( or median ) salary adjusted for living costs would probably give a decent picture . 
  i 'm in the norwegian military reserves and i 'm definitely a negative asset . 
  that light green part of norway is a very rural area with mostly farming and wilderness , so i would n't necessarily say it 's wrong . 
  we definitely have a long way to go , though i think we 're better off than the gulf states by quite a bit . 
  i work in ship building in norway , and the market basically crashed three years ago , to the point that almost no oil service/supply vessels are built anymore . 
  we 've been slowly turning around and have started getting contracts in cruise , passenger transport , offshore wind service etc. 
  my impression is that this is happening a lot of places in the marine sector . 
  i 'm thinking like the nordic countries think . 
  there is an optimal tax rate for companies . 
  it 's not 0 % and it 's not 100 % . 
  sure , a tax decrease * could * lead to more jobs . 
  it could also lead to more robots or just more money in the pockets of the wealthy . 
  spending the tax income also leads to more jobs , since it gets used for either infrastructure or services . 
  the optimal tax rates are where its high enough that you can provide good services ( a level which is hard to define ) , good infrastructure ( that is used by companies to make money ) , good security , and at the same time low enough that there is an incentive to invest . 
  just blanko lowering taxes to attract international branches ruins the system and creates a race to the bottom . 
  it 's not about low or high tax levels , but rather the right tax level . 
   who 'd knew that lowering taxes for big companies would result in a better economy and a higher standard of living for everyone ? 
  if every country lowered their taxes then you 'd end up with not companies moving and instead just the rich getting richer . 
  being a tax-haven only works if there are just a few tax havens . 
  lots , but since the unions set pay in bigger businesses they sort of set the pay floor in general . 
  smaller businesses will have to pay similar wages as businesses with unions or else they lose their employees . 
  2-3 man operations would often be co-owners though . 
  we could be like a tax haven , only with dark bread and drip coffee instead of high level money theft .

  great and depressing movie . 
  russia ( and the other post soviet states for that matter ) are really interesting and a place we western europeans do n't learn and know enough about imo . 
  just finished a book called [ sovjetistan ] ( https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24568113-sovjetistan ) about the central asian ex-soviet countries . 
  fascinating read . 
  the level of corruption and institutionalized crime seems staggering .

  btw . 
  the when they had voted with yes , the former politicians which are responsible for the mess , would be in the government again . 
  the imf member with the most votes is the us ... 
   the eu uses its resources ( and expertise ) to force a change for the best . 
  this is why romanians love the eu . 
  because it keeps our politicians and policy makers in check . 
  the is the best theory on democracy i have ever read . 
  which is a good hint , how much propaganda was involved, 
  even when the government knew about it , it 's different if the police is raiding the spiegel or someone is spying on jounalists . 
  this is interesting . 
  germany has chosen the us as one of the closest friends . 
  it 's part of the reason of state . 
  but in forums of telepolis , a magazine which has millions of clicks every day , the political center is already circle jerking about a germany without sovereignty , because a government who does n't take actions against spying , has clearly not the power according to the postings . 
  the media has until now covered most spy stories without to much hype . 
  when the media is a direct target , this could change . 
  most german citizens interpret such an event from a nationalistic perspective and this might have consequences in the future . 
  at least politicians of cdu an spd will be seen as traitors . 
  this opens the political spectrum to the rights . 
  but merkel is lucky , because - until now - there is no real opposition in germany . 
  anyway , it is n't very wise from the us covering all aspects of the daily life of nato members with spying . 
  there will be a price to pay . 
  that was a different story . 
  i 'm against marking propaganda . 
  the reasons : 1 ) proganda is a source for information about the propagandist . 
  2 ) the readers should have competence or asking an idea what i mean is [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/3bmaos/i_am_james_pach_owner_and_editor_of_the_diplomat/cso6sdp ) on / r/geopolitics, 
  there are people who ca n't afford drugs for medical conditions like diabetes , cancer etc. 
  there are people in greece who have problems to get a sufficient nutrition . 
  you want punish them ? 
  what sort of of people are you ? 
  get out in this world and learn social competence . 
  read telepolis.de where [ wassilis aswestopoulos ] ( http://www.heise.de/tp/autor/wassilisaswestopoulos/default.html ) has published a lot of good articles about greece the last 10 years, 
  just to mentioned it . 
  the german internet magazine telepolis is covered political developments in spain the last 20 years . 
  if you do n't understand german , use google translate . 
   add to that the fact that eta terrorism did n't stop with the arrival of democracy , but actually increased , the problem was on both sides . 
  while the eta killed officials , the government had death commandos . 
  and spain 's government gets too often sentenced to pay money to victims because of practices of torture , which they did regularly in these days . 
  the law which permits a total isolation of people in custody for 14 days is a shame for europe . 
  the eta is basically dead , but gives even nowadays a good opportunity for the government to close down basque media . 
  i 'm hoping for spain other parties than the conservatives or `` socialists '' come into power , which would give this country a better development . 
  guess who supported the chechen . 
  the problem is , the proposals are n't made from leftists and they are knowing what they are proposing . 
  a raising tax for companies without any exemptions is in a globalized world no fun , especially when countries like ireland , the baltics and germany have lower taxes because of a lot of exemptions or flat taxes .

  the fact that my comment can pass as a straight one just shows how fucked up some of the things written on this subreddit are . 
  it 's the `` in a mad world only the mad are sane '' principle  . 
  thank you, 
   yes but do n't forget . 
  greeks are lazy fucks who fap all day receiving free checks you know most of the checks went into paying old debts to save european banks ? 
  don think of a eu like a humanitarian institution . 
  which government do you mean ? 
  the gang who was responsible for corruption has already saved their money on british tax heavens , while syriza is a bunch of idealists , which believed into european solidarity . 
   and fuck it greece was competing against us or spain for example with lower vat rates . 
  take a look a german tax rates . 
  the real taxes for companies are very low . 
  most of the taxes are paid by the usual employee . 
  it 's about international competition and taxes are a tool to win a competition , which is one of the reasons why germany has so much success . 
  when they have demanded greece has to raise the tax income it would be ok . 
  the freedom of the government is how to do this . 
  instead they `` proposed '' some actions or cutting the money , which is pure blackmailing . 
  we have to make a difference for the time before syriza and after syriza . 
  while the politicians of the conservatives and the socialists where responsible for the corruption and the following austerity , while spending money for a german u-boat and 27 military airplanes from france , syriza tried to renegotiate the conditions , which does n't work . 
  it 's my guess it was from the beginning planned to dump greece , to prevent a chain reaction in the mediterranean region . 
  otherwise no one would demand a huge raise of taxes for companies and especially for tourism , which is the huge income source . 
  greece has to compete on tourism with turkey and croatia , which is n't easy when the taxes are raising . 
  the social issue with austerity is that people in greece dying because they ca n't even afford simple drugs for treatment of well known conditions like diabetes . 
  it 's basically a overruling of greece 's parliament and a huge tax raise for greek companies in a economic desolate situation . 
  even now the taxation level of greece is one of the highest in europe . 
  the unification of the vat at 23 % even in the price sensitive branches for tourism is weird . 
  the 100 % taxation in advance of corporate income is n't just usual . 
  the demands for a higher taxation level in this context is just a declaration of an economic war . 
  the demand of reduction of military spending is funny , because germany and france were those who demanded fulfilling all contracts . 
  the reduction of high volume cost for electrical power for high volume facilities ( production ? ), 
  is unusual as well . 
  maybe it 's just the greek implementation ? 
  in countries like germany usual consumer paying much more for power than the industry , which made a aluminum manufacturer in the netherlands blackmailing the parliament of the netherlands , by demanding access to the german grid or leaving the netherlands . 
  selling regional airports : as a norwegian i have mixed feeling about this . 
  our net of airports is very tight and norwegians are using it often . 
  it 's necessary for having an economic sustainable infrastructure . 
  of course , it works with subsidies . 
  do n't care about a message from bavaria . 
  some people there are always using every opportunity to demand more morality . 
  why should gay people do the same shit as heteros and want a license of the government for their relationship ? 
  when greece is cut off from all international loans , they ca n't get money for oil , drugs , food etc. 
  most american web sites of gop followers are simply for campaigning and not for discussion . 
  it 's mostly a cheap argument on such sites . 
  and we have n't we enough arguments in europe ? 
  pjmedia is bad , but this is no argument . 
  at least we should be able to present better arguments , when someone is presenting us such articles . 
  the worst argument mostly without any elaboration be because the posters are usual cowards : - the religion of peace - expansion of articles to a `` statistic '' - using the social status as an evidence critics of religion is easy , but needs nevertheless a little of work for at least 5min . 
  most of the posters are n't able to even write a reasonable text and work on that text for more than 1 min . 
  but the worst is reddit because it 's principle is an invitation for sabotage of a good discussion . 
  reddit is more a platform for political campaigns . 
  doing a massive downvote on a poster means , shrinking his ability of posting and being read . 
  reddit is a weapon against reasonable discussion . 
  no , the number system in denmark is partly based on 20 instead of 10 . 
  so instead of saying fifty , they say 3x20-20 / 2 which is halv tres halv : 20/2 tres : 3x20 ( like tre times 20 ), 
   you are gifted this privilege to live there and you ca n't even show enough respect to attend a class to learn the language of this new place you plan on calling home , this is not how it 's working .

  i 'm not talking about the in-between plays period , i 'm referring to the same as you ; scoring plays , injury time , time-outs etc. 
  where they absolutely do wait for the commercial break to end before commencing play . 
  again , i never said that this happened in between plays , i do n't know where you got that from . 
  the rest of your post has nothing to do with mine . 
  i never said it was 11 minutes of action and the rest commercials . 
  i ** love ** american football , it 's one of the most interesting sports in the world from a strategic point , what i said that that a 4 quarter game lasts 3\u00a01/2 hours ( though i was slightly off on that , my memory failed me , the average is roughly 3 hours and ten - fifteen minutes . 
  see for example here : http://www.sportsonearth.com/article/64441086/nfl-statistical-analysis-average-nfl-game ) . 
  i ** do ** understand af , which is why i love it , so i have no idea what your post is about ? 
  they wait because there 's a commercial on the tv channel that airs that particular game . 
  they ca n't restart the game until the channel is back from commercials , it has nothing to do with the game itself . 
  it would be like going to commercial while a player is down in a premier league game , and the team would n't be allowed to take the free-kick until sky sports ' commercial brake was over . 
  i know right ? 
  american football is one of my top three sports , i love it , but the fact that we ca n't even agree on what constitutes a `` catch '' in a 9 billion dollar professional league should tell outsiders everything they need to know , 
  right , i can see that happening . 
  thank you for the clarification . 
  okay , i honestly did n't know that , but i can see how it 's never really done since the catcher is practically sitting on the plate . 
  or are you talking about the fact that he can steal during errors ( e.g. 
  the catcher loses the ball and he has to run from his spot to pick it up ) ? 
  stealing involves a player on a base running to the next base . 
  back to what i said about safe spots , he 's only safe as long as he 's on the base ( i.e. 
  the white square ) , but there 's nothing to say he has to stand there all the time . 
  the reason stealing is so rare is that the pitcher is paying attention , and it 's pretty far from one base to the next . 
  the ball is much faster , so if the pitcher sees him sneaking , he will turn around and throw the ball to the bases where runner is . 
  meaning the runner can be thrown out . 
  oftentimes in a game you 'll see the pitcher throw the ball back to his base instead of forwards just to let him know `` i 'm paying attention '' , and if the runner is not careful and gets too far from the base , he can be struck out . 
  good basestealers are few and far between , and are usually very , very fast . 
  * edit : to add on to that , stealing the home base is not possible . 
  you can only have one man at each base , and the batter will stand at the home base as long as he 's trying to bat . 
  have you watched it in a stadium ? 
  it 's a weird experience . 
  i absolutely love american football , i 've followed it for close to 25 years , yet even i will admit that it 's gotten ridiculous ( many of those breaks are actually called `` commercial breaks '' for a reason ) . 
  i got the opportunity to go to my first nfl game about 5 years ago , and i was amazed to see that when there is a break in the action , the players are * literally * just standing around talking and bullshitting while waiting for the ref to blow the whistle which signals that the tv is out of commercial and the game is back on . 
  watching it on tv you notice the breaks , but watching it live i saw just how much those breaks destroy the flow of the game . 
  think about it ; a game is 4 * quarters * , yet a full game typically lasts more than 3\u00a01/2 hours . 
  i can give you a breif rundown of the rules . 
  the game is played in 9 `` innings '' , one inning consisting of two parts . 
  team a will throw the ball and team b try to hit the ball and in the second part of the inning team b will throw and team a will hit . 
  then it goes on to the next inning . 
  although 9 innings must be played , a game can theoretically go on forever as a team must win ( there is no draw ) , so if there is a draw after 9 innings they play a 10th , then 11th etc. 
  until one team leaves the inning one point ( or more ahead ) . 
  as you have gathered , the point of baseball is to score points . 
  how do you do that ? 
  by scoring what is called a `` run '' . 
  the person with the baseball bat is called the hitter or batter , and his job is to hit the baseball and run the course laid out on the field . 
  this consists of three `` bases '' . 
  when a hitter/runner reaches the place he stood when he was batting ( homebase ) , he scores one point for his team . 
  the thrower - or pitcher as he 's called - will try to throw difficult balls that makes it difficult to hit . 
  however , the pitcher has a very tight window he must throw the ball into for it to be counted as a proper throw . 
  in short , the pitcher will throw a variety of throws with a hard ball towards the batter . 
  the ball must hit a tight virtual window for it to count , and the batter can choose to try to hit or let it go past him . 
  each batter has a number of chances to hit the ball - these are called strikes . 
  he can miss twice , but getting a third strike means he 's now `` out '' ( i 'll come back to outs later ) . 
  the pitcher , as you know , has a very tight window , and if the ball is considered to be outside of that window it is called a `` ball '' . 
  if the count reaches four balls the batter is allowed a free walk unto first base . 
  the exchange then is for the pitcher to try to get each batter to `` strike out '' , i.e. 
  miss with three strikes , or only allow him hits that are picked up by the pitching team . 
  back to outs . 
  outs are really important , they determine the end of an period . 
  when a team has three outs , the sides are switched and the pitching team becomes the hitting team and vice versa . 
  so after two of these sections you change the inning . 
  outs can be scored in a few ways in addition to striking out . 
  if the batter hits the ball , but the pitching team can catch the ball before the ball hits the ground , it means the batter is out . 
  furthermore , if the batter hits the ball , it bounces and the pitching team picks it up they can now try to get an out on the batter . 
  typically this involves throwing the ball to the base where the batter is heading , if the ball arrives before the batter , he is out ( this will involve the pitching team 's receiver having at least one foot on the base - which is a white square ) . 
  this is a very tl ; dr version , there are numerous nuances to baseball , but the purpose is for the batting team to hit the ball and run around the bases to get a score . 
  if the batter his the ball so well that it goes outside of the stadium ( or the other team fumbles the ball/don ' t move fast enough ) the batter might get around all the bases and home in a single hit - this is called a `` homerun '' . 
  more commonly early batters will score `` base hits '' ( i.e. 
  they get to base 1 or 2 - typically ) and batters coming after them will try to hit the ball and allow their teammates to score . 
  hopefully this cleared something up , if you have any particular questions let me know . 
  ( regards , a norwegian who actually enjoys a bit of baseball every now and then ), 
  if someone had told me 18 months ago that donald trump would run for president of the us , yet it would be overshadowed by uk politics , i would have laughed in their face . 
  at this point , it is more of a very nervous laughter . . 
  so both main men now refuse to take responsibility to clean up what they started . 
  marvelous . 
  in one way or another , the leaders of the leave campaign have cemented their place in history books in europe . 
  let 's hope it will be a `` despite these people '' story , and not `` because of '' . 
   and the differences between the generally poor fisherman / blue collar workers of ~ 70 years ago and the current oil-revenue infused generation ( and being an overall successful modern country ) are astounding . 
  this is exaggerated not only in his books , but in many stories around norway . 
  it seems like it 's been a `` rags to riches '' story , and clearly the oil income has made a huge impact on society for better or for worse , but even before the discovery of oil norway was not a poor nation . 
  at the time of the first world war , norway had one of the largest trade fleets in the world , and through both world wars and the time in between , that merchant fleet took up a large portion of the sea . 
  while fishing and farming where the main employers , it was nothing like modern day farming communities in poor nations . 
  what it shows is that in the 1870 's , norway 's standard of living was higher than most african nations * today * . 
  that 's hardly dirt poor . 
  clearly norway was not the u.k or france , but saying it was a poor nation until the exploitation of oil ( which only started happening as late as the 1960 's ) is misleading . 
  between the farming and fishing , and a huge merchant fleet , the living standard was certainly above what is considered the existential minimum , and i think a lot of people ( also here in norway mind you ) like to jump on the rags to riches because it sounds good . 
  one thing to look at is norway is very much linked to sweden , denmark and the rest of the nordics , countries that have done just fine without discovering oil . 
  moving back to the parent you replied to it sounds like norwegians have dropped the will to work hard and feel entitled to everything . 
  i 'm not saying it is all wrong , * however * is n't that the case in all of the west ? 
  it seems to me the entitlement and the `` do n't offend me '' generation is not just norwegian , but it happens in the us , u.k , sweden , denmark , france , germany . . everywhere in the west . 
  are n't mexicans taking jobs americans are unwilling to take ? 
  are n't poles taking jobs brits are unwilling to take ? 
  this entire article touches on this . 
  my point is that i feel this has less to do with oil and more to do with the west in general . 
  i want to put forth another point on this subject . 
  another reason for fewer `` native '' norwegians in the factory and `` minimum wage '' business is simply that we have a far larger percentage getting university level education than before . 
  unemployment is very low , education is high . 
  if you have a bachelor or masters degree in engineering , you 're not going to paint houses for a living . 
  there are more nuances and grey areas than simply saying immigrants are taking jobs we do n't want to do , or that they are stealing our jobs . 
  i would argue it 's a mix of a lot of factors . 
  do n't know why you were downvoted , i think you 're absolutely right .

  i often buy `` weird '' meats like legs and hearts to get the price down . 
  usually pig , sheep and chicken . 
  sometimes horse , game or cattle . 
  * ** nuts , seeds , etc. 
  ** : not really any nuts . 
  lots of grains and a few seeds like sesame and sunflower . 
  * ** types of cheese ** : the `` generic '' white cheese you get here , brown cheese , and sometimes cheddar or mozzarella if i make something special . 
  * ** pre-made sauces and dips ** : soy sauce , bbq sauce , `` taco '' sauce , mustard , and a ton of home made things or stock for making them . 
  i do n't use much ketchup . 
   `` $ name , please let x in ! '', 
  `` the man/woman '' , or just `` he/she '' really . 
  or his name if we know him . 
   `` x , please help me , i 'm lost ! '', 
  `` could * you * please help me , i 'm lost ? '', 
  * central norway * most of norway and some of sweden * nordic countries * northern europe maybe ? 
  not much more after that . 
  last year probably . 
  happens from time to time for the internet and electricity . 
  phone is never completely gone , but i got a really bad signal at home . 
  central and north-east norway . 
  to be fair , there is a lot of forest and few cool mountains compared to the west and north , but they are there if you look , and lots of historical places . 
  it should be mashed peas !, 
  herecy !, 
  some parts of western norway apparently eats it in waffles according to a friend . 
  lutfisk without bacon or other appropriate side dishes . 
   but another 14 % eats meat only a few days every week . 
  is fish included in that ? 
  south jutland also has remains of the pitch accent . 
  i think it 's ringsaker the guy 's from . 
  northern end of mj\u00f8sa . 
  it 's just that he uses weird words , like `` dugurdskvila '' where dugurd is a meal , `` okkle '' which means `` ankel/okle '' and `` hannom '' which is dative of `` han '' . 
  if he had used normal words it 'd be easy . 
  he tied to speak weirdly . 
   this tr\u00f8nder dialect is also incredibly difficult to understand and it 's also quite funny imo eh . 
  it 's just that one guy , who speaks quickly . 
  his dialect is n't that weird . 
  [ this guy ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fggpi2uqh04 ) has kinda the same dialect , but speaks way clearer . 
  easy to understand . 
  when it comes to a * funny * dialect , i 'm not sure . 
  i 'm not laughing at how anyone speak , but that might be because [ my dialect ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyywrqghvtg ) is often considered weird by others . 
  some may say the dialect in \u00d8stfold as well . 
  most charming i find certain dialects from [ opplanda ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qib8t4_7lko ) and [ gudbrandsdalen ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ky8j-dfktac ) , or maybe [ old fashioned dialects form hordaland ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dd8c7ni15zm ) . 
  ola and kari nordmann ( northman/norwegian ) here . 
  probably varies then . 
  it 's very popular to go hiking at the smaller mountaintops here . 
  what if you get lost in the wild ? 
  i remember reading a few . 
  * anything by astrid lindgren . 
  * anything by roald dahl . 
  * charlie and the chocolate factory , matilda * , etc. 
  * anything by thorbj\u00f8rn egner . 
  * some by tove jansson . 
  * alf pr\u00f8ysen also has some books . 
  we do n't have any street sweepers or whatever , and the roads are only cleaned when volunteers and school children do it , but it 's not too bad . 
  people generally use the trash cans . 
  according to a friend that was there roads in scotland were much worse . 
  all the bigger towns tend to be more liberal/capitalist than the surrounding countryside . 
  farmers and rural/small town people are more left leaning . 
   i 'm denmark there 's something called `` ris dansk '' [ rigsdansk ] ( https://da.wikipedia.org/wiki/rigsdansk ), 
   edit : someone seems to be downvoting all the new comments in this thread ... loads of new posts at 0 points currently . 
  it tends to happen when speaking about language variation for some reason . 
  no idea why . 
   i think together with italy we have the most dialects per square km . 
  i think scandinavia would be high up too . 
  look at the [ `` main '' sub-dialects of jutlandic . 
   i do n't think any swede has trouble understanding any swedish dialect * [ orsam\u00e5l ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yobyvduzlra ) * [ \u00d6vdalsk ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2pxzj6ufvg ) * [ \u00d6verkalix ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgt0h0riol8 ) * [ \u00d6sterbotten ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ph-h1uydyju ) * [ j\u00e4mtland ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ebbfjzjrnui ) i think some urban people may have trouble with some of these . 
  a lot !, 
  just like in denmark and sweden . 
  though the dialects here are much more common to hear in public here , and even on tv people usually speak their dialects or a milder variant of it . 
  compare relatively far apart [ tr\u00f8nder ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyywrqghvtg ) ( lim\u00e5l ) and [ vestlandsk ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n02lzgz7guo ) ( setesdal , the guy ) . 
  [ here 's a simple map ] ( http://i.imgur.com/ypjdz8m.png ) of how you 'd form plurals in dialects for example . 
  not too many miners in norway . 
  nowadays we earn more `` mining '' sand , gravel and stone . 
  but probably labour or centre ( rural ) party . 
  i think he messed up the number . 
   it contains more than * half a million * lithuanian headwords , and is 20 volumes ( 22 thousand pages ) long . 
  - wikipedia, 
  i do n't know if you are wrong , but that wikipedia article says :  it contains more than half a million lithuanian headwords , so , 500 000 + or so words ? 
  sure that is n't the total number of words used to write the book or something ? 
  not a thing any more , kinda . 
  if you 're born before 1971 then the 1905 rules apply . 
  i 've you 're born before 1990 then men go before women . 
  for anyone born after then it 's completely equal . 
  whenever there is a swede in any kind of commercial or short message here , he will be from sk\u00e5ne . 
  i would n't know how to describe those things . 
  only superficial things like i wrote above , since they are basically the same as us . 
  they are friendly at least , but making the friends can be difficult in the start . 
  you have to distinguish between north swedes , swedes and south swedes ( scanians ) . 
  how people in central norway might see it : northern swedes are fine . 
  good people who speak good dialects , struggling against the eu even though they voted no ( like us ) . 
  from about dalarna or even v\u00e4rmland and up . 
  especially those just across the border , who 's considered better than some norwegians . 
  swedes are most other swedish people . 
  the ones you see on the news , pippi and in emil i l\u00f6nneberga . 
  lots of jokes about these , but probably nice people . 
  they better not bring up the invasions though . 
  then there is sk\u00e5ne ( and areas close to ) . 
  people around where i live usually does n't like the dialect there , probably because it 's the go-to choice in commercials and such for some reason .

  the name `` europe '' or `` askeurope '' probably has a broader appeal to people who see themselves as europeans firstly , and those people tend to be left-leaning . 
  `` europe and the uk '' i hope you know that europe is n't one cultural monolith , right ? 
  mediterranean culture is vastly different from nordic culture for example . 
  moldova probably has some alright places too , even the commieblocks are sort of comfy . 
   norway . 
  iceland . 
  switzerland . 
  the eu may very well federalize one day , but one thing is for sure , you 'll never have the nice nature , mwhahahaha !, 
  i mean , if the proposed carbon tax goes through i can still buy american products with a good conscience , right ? 
  on a serious note , i 'd probably not change my consumerist habits based on trump 's stance on the paris-agreement , i 'm rather fond of new technology , and i like to upgrade my computer parts once in a while . 
  if he decides to pull out , i 'm hoping that most businesses will take the ethical perspective into consideration when they 're given the extra freedom , and i hope the international community will pressure them to do so as well . 
  most people are n't religious in any way , but there are n't that many self-declared atheists either . 
  if you were to ask and prod , most people would probably be some shade of agnostic . 
  religion is largely seen as a private matter here and is n't something you ask about unless you know a person very well , though . 
  you should take a look at this video on urban geography , it explains the difference between europe and the us quite well , and why poverty might be more visible in some places https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqsxpzafo_k, 
  i really doubt breaking some windows , looting or blocking traffic will help kickstart that revolution , it 'll probably have the opposite effect , with more and more people getting tierd of having to deal with it . 
  both subjective questions where the answers may differ depending on who 's online at the time , a faq ca n't cover every conceivable opinion . 
  what we could do is to make a faq or a wiki for frequently asked questions with non-subjective answers . 
  as / u/pepperboon said , interactivity * is * the selling point of reddit , and if we want this relatively small sub to grow , we should n't limit interactivity to certain questions . 
  also , we have the upvote/downvote system for a reason . 
  it was on the top of / r/videos . 
  here 's another example : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6mdq9y8xoc, 
  turkey and libya have taken * many * refugees and pulled their weight 5x , but why the gulf-states are n't more generous towards their kinsmen , i do not know . 
   but i do n't want people to hate me for being from the country that elected trump . 
  just be yourself , most people probably does n't care enough to hate you because the constituent of your country elected a certain president . 
  i 'm not going to assume that your post is 100 % serious , but if it is , and it really bothers you to the point where you ca n't sleep at night , i 'm not going to advise you not to role-play as a canadian , but i do n't think it 'll matter that much in the end . 
  all the pms in europe have to semi-endorse and work with trump anyway if it helps . 
  i 'm pretty sure there are no laws against loitering, 
  it 's hard to only pick one . 
  the bioshock series is freaking awesome , especially bioshock infinite , however , there are out there games that i 've wasted more time on like ck2 or runescape ( which i still play on and off ) . 
  i 've also played quite a few visual novels with my favourites being umineko and aiyoku no eustia , which i 'll recommend to anyone who 's into japanese multimedia . 
  honorable mention to fo3 as well . 
  edit : and how could i forget ratchet & clank 3 , i 've probably completed the game 7-8 times . 
  i 've had both good and bad experiences to be fair . 
  one of the most insightful and open-minded people i know is an afghan refugee , but ironically enough , a friend of mine had his phone and wallet stolen by refugees of the same country . 
  we 've had a refugee centre in my city for about a year with about 150 refugees , but the only time i 've seen or heard anything from them is when i accommodate them at the store i work at . 
  most of them are nice , but i 've met rude ones as well and i 've had children of refugees eating candy out of the pick-and-mix trays , not that i blame them for it . 
  personally , the positive experiences i 've had outweighs the negative ones , but the experiences i 've had really do n't matter as to how i approach the question of sheltering refugees . 
  long-term , i 'd like norwegian culture to stay somewhat monolithic so that we do n't end up as an identitarian shithole like the us of a. 
   i saw was two refugees crashing into each other on their bicycles . 
  jesus christ , just send them back already . 
  i would say that the bankruptcy was an important part of the reason as to why the revolution happened . 
  if france did n't spend their whole treasury on the war , king louis xvi never would have suggested to tax the aristocrats and the clergy . 
  the curriculum is heavily centered around european and norwegian history . 
  more specifically around the french revolution , the industrial revolution , ww1 , the interwar years , ww2 and the cold war . 
  obviously , american history is mentioned to some degree too since they had an instrumental role in both the french revolution and ww2 , but we learned next to nothing about asian or middle-eastern history . 
  japan 's role in ww2 and the japanese imperialism was briefly mentioned . 
  generally , i wish we 'd have a more comprehensive curriculum since i find history immensely interesting , but with the limited time we had in high school i feel that we covered our bases fairly well , after all , most of the students probably are n't as interested in history as me , and most people who do n't cultivate such an interest will likely forget what they were taught a couple of years down the road . 
   left wing politically i 'd say there 's a fair split between left and right . 
  i mean , i really ca n't imagine one of those confederate flag-toting , volvo 240 driving individuals showing up at the polling booth to vote either for r\u00f8dt or sv . 
  * how to combat the rising unemployment due to lower oil prices * the migrant crisis * wealth fund expenditure * stationing of us marines on norwegian soil * merging of municipalities if you want me to elaborate on some of these , just ask . 
   liberals are center-right center right in most regards , but they 've adopted the identity politics of the far-left . 
  native : norwegian ( scandi languages ) fluent : english good enough tier : japanese ( currently n3 , looking to pass jlpt n2 within a year ) basic tourist conversation tier : german , spanish i wish i 'd paid more attention in high school tier : russian, 
   because one is false , made up racist propaganda . 
  i was n't 100 % serious for your information . 
  but it 's a known fact that certain areas in certain swedish cities have certain problems with certain demographics . 
   however i once noticed some racist posts on some swedish forum , such as using the 'n word ' , anti-gipsy posts , anti-muslim and so on . 
  in every country on planet earth where a sizable chunk of the population have access to the world wide web , there will probably be a racist forum or two . 
  after all , people with the strong political convictions tend to congregate on forums with likeminded people to exchange ideas in a sheltered enviornment , and it 's in no way exclusive to sweden . 
  sweden is n't some monolithic society where every member embrace every `` progressive '' idea if that 's what you thought . 
   sweden is either considered an egalitarian , progressive utopia or a rape-filled islamist hellhole . 
  why not both ? 
  as of late they 've sort of shelved the whole `` humanitarian superpower '' idea for a not-as-dim-witted migration policy , but wether they 're doing it out of an understanding of the negative social impact it might have , or because they fear the rise of parties like sd , i do not know . 
  really ? 
  i 've been to the us too , and while i agree there are more visible drug users in many cities , i really ca n't say i 've experienced any of the other things you listed as a tourist . 
  did you live there for an extended amount of time ? 
  i 'm not quite sure about how they work to be fair , but i do n't think they force business to use a certain language . 
  as far as i know they 're more like advisors than policy makers . 
  pretty much the same thing as / u/vertitto said about polish , we apply norwegian grammatical rules to english words . 
  on the contrary , we do n't use as many recent loanwords as i 've heard people in other countries do , for example with newer tech gadgets , [ the language council ] ( http://www.sprakradet.no/vi-og-vart/om-oss/english-and-other-languages/english/ ) is actually doing a fairly good job . 
  for example : tablet = nettbrett computer = datamaskin keyboard = tastatur so on and so forth . 
  this applies to norway as well , prehaps except the bathing suits part . 
  if you 're going to go trekking , for the sake of god , be prepared . 
  there have been so many rescue missions this year alone that more than one municipality have considered closing the attractions to tourists . 
  [ the statistics beg to differ ] ( http://www.thelocal.dk/20160829/expats-name-denmark-worst-in-the-world-for-making-friends ), 
  yeah , i guess , but op asked . 
  criticizing how we do things . 
  norwegians , between ourselves , criticize how we do things all the time but if a foreigner comes along and says `` yeah , in fact , i agree with that statement '' , people will see it as an attack on the great kingdom of norway and snarkily point out that `` your third-world hellhole probably is n't any better , i hope you and your family burn in hell for all eternity '' . 
  obviously , this is heavily over-exaggerated but this is a well-known stereotype . 
  * give people seeking refuge the ability to apply from their home countries rather than forcing them to cross the mediterranean . 
  * asylum would be temporary and would n't be a shortcut to permanent residency , refugees would have to apply when their country of origin is safe to return to and be evaluated by their credentials like immigrants from non-conflict zones around the world . 
  * storage of biometric information would be a requirement for asylum to be granted at all , but it is already , is n't it ? 
  * refugees would be provided with free and sufficient education for rebuilding their countries i.e engineering , healthcare , and vocational training , it would be optional , but encouraged . 
  if the need for refuge vanished they 'd get status as international students until their education would be complete . 
  education in the biggest eu languages and european cultural studies would also be an option . 
  * taking refugees should be voluntary and no country should face sanctions for refusing to accommodate them , national self-determination would be respected . 
  however , the eu would provide countries who are willing to accommodate with adequate funding and support . 
  * there would be a zero-tolerance for economic migrants , and economic migrants with a refugee status would face immediate expulsion . 
  this would also apply to criminal activities , extremism , and hardcore fundamentalism . 
  * cash-in-hand would be completely eliminated and replaced with a coupon system . 
  any other nordic country , including faroe islands . 
  other than that , i 'd consider countryside france since i 'd like to brush up on my french . 
  russia i guess , although i do n't really hate them or anything . 
  it depends on how it manifests itself . 
  i am not a fan of violence , nor am i a fan of senseless hatred , but i do think that in the future , nationalism may be a necessity to preserve the european identity and morale . 
  for me , ethnicity or skin colour is n't a defining factor but cultural affinity is . 
  i 'm not a cultural relativist or appreciator of multiculturalism ; i 'll never be an apologist for horrible cultures ( in my eyes , cultures that aggressively impede people 's liberties ) , and if nationalism can act as a vanguard against these regressive values , sure , it might be a good thing . 
  that said , culture is a taught behaviour , not something you 're born with and simply hating someone because of the colour of their skin beyond stupid , ethnonationalism is stupid , i 've grown up with friends of different colours who are just as good a norwegian as myself . 
  obviously , having a country with people of different ethnicities and one cultural identity is a pipe dream , the left has made sure of that through identity politics and mass migration that stifles the need for integration . 
  tpp has is n't really a european issue , however , it is a way for the us to solidify its position and trade dominance in east-asia and while at the same time indirectly sanctioning the brics countries ( mainly china ) .

  i find it kind of funny that the commission is being such a baby about that fact that an `` european nra '' has emerged . 
  the fact is that no such movement would 've have started without the current proposed firearms directive . 
  i hope the parliament/council throws out the bad parts relating to semi-automatics , fixed length licenses , and magazine limits and instead focus on the things that actually matter , namely harmonizing rules for deactivation of firearms and the problems relating to converting of blank firing weapons into fully functioning guns . 
  no surprise there . 
  the commission has repeatedly denied to produce an impact report , yet they claim that no law-abiding citizen will have their rights infringed and that terrorists will have their access to firearms reduced . 
  news flash : criminals and terrorists will still get access to firearms , because they do n't follow the law . 
  the only group who will have their access to firearms reduced are law abiding citizens . 
  i 've written several letters to meps and national politicians with my take on the current proposals , part of it is really decent , whilst the most of it is absolute rubbish . 
  i guess me expressing my democratic rights as a citizen makes me a lobbyist too . 
  edit : if the current states that keep pushing for stricter gun laws , such as germany , italy and france , want them i suggest you implement it yourself in your national legislation instead of imposing such rules on countries that have little to no problems with gun related crimes . 
  trying to force it through via the eu is just a way of appeasing your public by saying that it 's an eu rule and you have no other choice than to comply . 
  well , the low interest rates do inflate the real estate market and reduce the paid interest rates on bank accounts . 
  that being said , the whole crazy ( pseudo ) quantitative easing were seeing is an attempt at increasing the inflation in the ez . 
  it 's kinda working , but they 've thrown trillions of euros into the market , and the inflation right now is at a staggering * drum rolls * 0.6 % . 
  not really that impressive . 
  i guess it 's all you can expect from a central bank who 's only tool is interest rates and very limited bond buying . 
  here we go again . 
  imagine the lovechild of le pen and farage bringing back the angevin empire . 
  that would be something . 
   unless you will deport all of them , this will bite you in the butt . 
  [ the trump tactic ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2uqohksosc&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=2m6s ), 
   decades later , historians will look back in disbelief . 
  i 'm already looking at this cluster fuck with disbelief . 
  my favorite part was the qmv forced relocation quota masquerading as solidarity . 
  `` forced solidarity '' , sounds like something out of ussr . 
  i hope you guys make it out okay , with the financial crisis and now this . 
   then why the fuck would you send them over there ? 
  germany is suddenly tired of them . 
  draghi 's to do list has one line : `` do n't kill the euro '', 
  it 's time we give turkey 's application a coup de gr\u00e2ce . 
  ukraine ; the new turkey . 
  once you 've killed it , you got ta eat it . 
  the brains and eyes are especially tasty . 
  our cuisine is very much shaped by the scarcity of resources . 
  if you 're running low on food , an entire sheep 's head with brain and eyes is a delicacy , not to mention our [ fermented fish ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rakfisk ) , which you can find in different varieties all over the nordics/scandinavia . 
  i was planning on introducing any greeks on the island to the norwegian delicacy of [ smalahove ] ( https://no.wikipedia.org/wiki/smalahove ), 
  i sense a possible business opportunity here !, 
  i 'll have a small island with a couple of goats , thank you . 
  cameron might have got the actual referendum set up , but there is no way it would have happened without the pressure from eu-skeptics , both inside and outside the party . 
  there is no doubt that farage is the single most important person in the uk when it comes to eu-skeptics, 
  we must punish the heretics for leaving the cult !, 
  may their children become blind and their economies destitute / s, 
  well , truth be told , he is probably one of the most influential european politicians this year . 
  like him or not , he has dedicated his life the last decades for this to happen , and has been a perpetual underdog that finally pulled it off . 
   we have loonies in our camp too . 
  do n't we all . 
  i ca n't handle that snaggletoothed belgian . 
  i do n't know why , he 's just so ... 
  dramatic and loud at times . 
   they better march real fast because the situation in aleppo will be over quite soon ( fortunately ) yep , at this rate eastern aleppo will be cleared of rebels come christmas . 
  the front lines have collapsed and the rebel factions are openly waging war among themselves as their territory in aleppo shrinks , a couple of days a go one of the rebel factions stormed the armory of another faction , kidnapped their leader and stole their ammo . 
  no worries for the eu then , only 46-47 % percent of the population in rejected the eu !, 
  / s keep spinning verhofstadt , keep on spinning . 
  go ahead , we neither want or need you . 
  i see erodgan is laying the groundwork for reflecting any sort of blame towards external factors instead of taking it himself . 
  does n't bode well for the economy , that 's for sure, 
  have they checked erdogan 's basement ? 
  truth be told , the government almost collapsed in the first place because frp refused to budge on one of their core policies . 
  it 's going to be interesting to see if it gives them a bounce in the polls . 
  they 're the rightmost party with actual influence . 
  they 're populist , anti-immigration and heavily in favour of deregulation and tax cuts . 
  the situation in norway is different from many other countries , frp got `` accepted '' by the other parties years ago , when they realised that ignoring and isolating them did n't work . 
  they 've , among other things , been in charge of the minister of finance and they 've done okay . 
  edit : frp is also free of neo nazism and anti-semitism . 
  they had some pretty shady characters , but they were kicked out during a party conference in the nineties and the party almost tore itself a part over that . 
  the still have some pretty `` colourfull '' characters , bit they 're not afd . 
  do n't worry , our far right party is already in government . 
  new elections soon ? 
  or just a new government ? 
  got ta get through the antipasti first, 
  no , the point is that russia can within a few days take all the territory and defend it in such a way that it gets extremely expensive to win it back . 
  likening the potential of a russian invasion into the baltics to an us invention into britain is just stupid . 
  this is going to get very exiting !, 
  the previous second round was really close and a small change in relative turnout can be decisive . 
  any austrians wan na give their prediction ? 
  i read that the number of issued ballots is down considerably since the last election ( 30 % in vienna ) , people seem pretty tired of the whole process so i guess it 's going to come down to which candidate has the most motivated voters . 
   p.s europe will defend the baltics no matter what and what happens if russia just goes in blitzkrieg style ? 
  the rand corperation [ ran a wargame simulation ] ( http://www.rand.org/pubs/research_reports/rr1253.html ) with russia attacking the baltics . 
  conclusion : russia can take all of the baltics before the west can mobilize . 
  at that point we face the prospect of invading the area by sea or air , which is going to be a god damn pain if russia has placed heavy anti-ship and anti-air batteries in kaliningrad . 
  edit : the question is not whether or not russia will invade , the point is that if they do , the baltics is screwed . 
  i 'm just waiting for the german redditors to tell us who this is blown out of proportions . 
  we 've had a deportation agreement with afghanistan for many years now . 
  the current , and previous governments , have focused on getting agreements with as many countries as possible . 
  they were working on one with eritrea , but it sadly fell through when the unhcr became hysterical about it . 
  well , mike pence is at least competent . 
  whether or not that 's a good thing depends on if you like pence 's politics or not . 
  huh , is the carpati based on the walther pp ( k ) series ? 
  it looks a lot like it . 
  i personally shot with the glock 26 in the `` special pistol '' class that has strict requirements on size and weight . 
  it 's a very fun little gun . 
   if the german elections are anything other than dull and routine , that 's when people start panicking . 
  just wait for hofer to lose the election and move to germany / s, 
  the turkish lira is falling like a rock . 
  by selling dollars and buying lira the price and value of lira relative to the dollar will strengthen . 
  wow , you guys are really heading downhill are n't you ? 
  truth be said , glocks are very nice guns . 
  i shoot with glock myself when participating in contests . 
  i rarely win , but i ca n't blame the gun !, 
  nato is definitely involved , but norway is generally speaking tasked with surveillance of its own waters on a regular basis .

  violent crime and organized gangs are two different things though , no ? 
  i live in northern europe . 
  we have the occasional group of 15 year old neo nazis form , but i ca n't really say i 've seen other criminal gangs of white kids . 
  does it happen ? 
  not trying to be an asshole , but it 's nowkiss.jpg, 
  you do n't think you can have a will based on wrong or lacking information ? 
  i do n't think we can say a society is democratic or not , but rather that there are democratic processes in a society , for example with referendums and elections . 
  but you can still have democracy ( rule of the people ) without the people being well informed enough . 
  it 's like asking if you can make decisions without knowing enough ; yes you can , but it 's not a good idea . 
   the voters ability to make informed decisions is absolutely vital for a democracy what makes you believe this ? 
  there 's a chinese reddit ?!, 
  is there a russian one as well ? 
  why not just make the rule : lets never go to war ? 
  exactly !, 
  you 're writing , but you 're not producing anything worthwhile , so what good is it as a benchmark for something being good or not ? 
   sometime keyword . 
  norway confirms similar behavior . 
  why would it make more sense that the chinese inspired the greeks than the greeks inspiring the chinese ? 
  i did n't use tall buildings as a measurement for anything . 
  i jumped in mid-convo . 
  but we do n't know . 
  you might underestimate the greeks influence and how eurocentric the world really is as well - right ? 
  well , yes . 
  kill those who actively tries to take away the sovereignty of a nation . 
  like russians who invaded crimea or isis members with western passports . 
  russia is pretty cool and all , but that whole crimea thing was very unnecessary . 
  i know it 's wrong , but i 'm surprisingly positive about this . 
  history of norway would be one . 
  i do n't prefer russians over * usa * . 
  i prefer russians over americans . 
  and my reason is that russians kill less people than americans do . 
  also they invade less countries . 
  it 's not a complicated matter . 
  we live in a world were it would be impossible to not be dependent on other countries . 
  we are currently dependent on both the us and russia . 
  i do n't spend time wishing for it to be different because it is a waste of time . 
  i do wish we were more dependent on russia compared to our dependence on the us . 
  i do n't prefer being invaded . 
  i have stated so several times now . 
  it is not something you seem to pick up on as you keep bringing it up . 
  i do not want russia to occupy norway . 
  i also do n't believe they 'll occupy norway . 
  we currently do host american soldiers here though , and we have quite a bit of american equipment stored here , such as tanks and what not . 
  i wish we did not , as it only helps the americans with their warmongering tactics . 
  why you prefer the most warmongering country on the planet to those that are less warmongering remains unexplained at this point in time , but you did mentioned that your family disliked russians - so all i have to base your objections towards russians being preferential to americans is that you 're unable to think differently than your family does . 
  which is a doctrine i disagree with . 
  i said i prefer russians to americans at this point , and as you 've pointed out : we are not occupied by americans , so why would you equate me preferring russians to americans as a me thinking russian occupation is a good thing ? 
  you 're putting words in my mouth , which is far from having a civil discussion . 
  that 's dishonest of you . 
  how am i not conducting a civil discussion with you ? 
  yes . 
  i am civil . 
  you ca n't be ? 
  america made their stupid decision with bush as well . 
  and let 's not forget all the acts of war they 've done since the 1970s and until now . 
  bush , obama , trump ... it 's not about them . 
  it 's the fact that the american culture is heavily focused on committing terrible acts for the benefit of americans . 
  these terrible acts have benefited me as well - not doubt . 
  but that was a side effect . 
  the terrible acts could just as well have been done to me if it benefits the us . 
  would putin do similar things ? 
  sure - no doubt about it . 
  but we ca n't even begin to compare the extent that the us has done so to what putin-russia has done . 
  crimea was not cool , but neither was iraq , afghanistan , south-america , and all the other terrible things the us has done . 
  they 're both bad . 
  it 's just that the us is much , much , much worse though . 
  and a small country like norway - has - to deal with them . 
  why should we get into bed with the worst of them ? 
  why do you feel the need to suggest i want to do any sexual activity towards putin ? 
  maybe you should take a time out from reddit for the day ? 
  at least - try - to have a civil discussion . 
  do n't let your familiy 's hatred towards russia go out on me . 
  i was not involved in it at all . 
  wished ? 
  yes , we are heading in the right direction in my opinion already . 
  i would n't . 
  but i would prefer to be as friendly towards russia as we are towards the us , and as unfriendly towards the us as we are towards russia . 
  the point is n't that russia is good . 
  i 'd rather have russians than americans at this point . 
  do dutch people consider themselves northern european ? 
  is n't it more a part of western europe ? 
  they invented siesta . 
  i 'm saying not all muslims want to murder gays . 
  do your honestly believe so ? 
  yes , but word of god should be fairly holy and bulletproof . 
  why did we decide we were better than the word of god ? 
  i mean , i know the answer . 
  but it baffles me why it does n't occur to people that the second you start to question the word of an almighty god that you 're going in the wrong direction , or that it 's not really the actual word of god . 
  it ca n't be summarized in a reddit comment chain ? 
  why ? 
  if everyone in the middle east supported hanging gay men from the roof then why did n't he just do it himself ? 
  the fact is that there are plenty of people in the middle east that think exactly like your christian friends . 
  no idea , and race is very undefined - but hair color , skin color , eye color could be a good start . 
  if we could start dna-testing everyone it would be even better . 
  i agree , but then the information is not the problem . 
  the problem is what willfully ignorant people do with that information . 
  by not saving that information we ourselves stay ignorant of knowledge . 
  your way is a sort of censorship , and i fundamentally believe that is much worse . 
  there is no such thing as bad knowledge . 
  i do n't agree that discrimination is objectively bad .

  down with the eu . 
  i 'm sorry , i did n't see any date in the article . 
  it was circulating yesterday so i assumed it was recent . 
  i am what ? 
  talk about strawman when you have no real arguments . 
  actually trailing through peoples profiles to try to find something ? 
  the enlightenment ? 
  the move from a geosentric view to a heliocentric one . 
  the reformation . 
  and how is replacing native populations with immigrants , many who do n't want to contribute , any kind of solution ? 
  christianity was n't a defining part of his ideology , unlike with islam and islamists . 
  yes , contribute lots to pollution + mess up your country with even more migrants . 
  sounds like a good idea . 
  you do n't seem very intelligent yourself . 
  yes , norwegians , danes and swedes had so many colonies . 
  todays dutch are ** not ** responsible for the crimes of their ancestors !, 
  if we help these people in their own countries , we can help far , far more for the same amount of money . 
  the best would be to help end the war in syria asap and close the borders . 
  here in norway most of the immigrants ( non western ) do n't want to work even if they recidency . 
  we have a very genorous welfare state , that only works if the population is fairly homogenus . 
  i think your explanation is a too easy one . 
  you are claiming they would work if they had the chance , but statistics tell of the opposite . 
  denying the facts will lead to nazis gaining power in europe again . 
  the left has to adress the huge immigration issues . 
  [ report of the norwegian welfare and migration committee . 
  only a summary is available in english . ], 
  ( http://www.emnbelgium.be/publication/report-norwegian-welfar ( e-and-migration-committee ) only 4 out of 20 immigrant groups contribute . 
  best are the swedes with 1,5 million nok each , worst are somalians which cost us 9 million nok each . 
  only 27 % of somalians work ( 2013 numbers ) . 
  somalians already here today will have cost norwegian taxpayers 215 billon nok by 2100 . 
  if you add all the immigrants here today , the costs will be 646 billion nok . 
  see also my post above . 
  if they are in such need , why are they not happy just coming to a country which has peace ? 
  no , they want to go all the way to germany and northern europe . 
  and more are coming . 
  most third-worlders who have been here in norway for years and even have citizenship is not working . 
  speaking for norway , most of the third worlders who gain citizenship do n't want to work , and why should they ? 
  europeans are getting sick of your lies . 
  but i 'm not disagreeing with you , politicians should put higher demands . 
  [ the graph is based on official data from the dutch central bureau for statistics . 
  there are many more communists than nazis in europe , both groups are idiots . 
   the fertility is going down worldwide not in africa . 
  the un expects 2 billion africans in 2050 . 
   they are a net gain for our society that 's a complete lie . 
  look at [ these ] ( https://i.imgur.com/dqta8d4.png ) numbers from the netherlands . 
  over 62 % of syrians receive welfare . 
  the norwegian state-funded brochmann report found that all immigrants are a net loss for us . 
  somalians are the most expensive , costing norwegian tax payers 1,1 million euros ** each ** . 
  it 's funny that leftists like yourself claim that the food is a huge benefit , you really admit that 's the only positive thing they 'd bring over . 
  i 'd rather not have them . 
  brain drain is negative for their native countries . 
  antifa are violent scumbags . 
  to be honest , i wish we 'd never found that oil . 
  but we * are * part of the mess . 
  we 're part of the european trade agreement ( e\u00d8s ) and we have ratified more eu directives than sweden . 
  norwegian here . 
  eu sucks and we wish we 'd get rid of the trade agreement . 
  i want north-european stats to leave the eu and nato and lets form our own alliance with the baltic states . 
  you even have many swedes in this subreddit who will claim all is well and fine in sweden . 
  and sd is by no means a nationalist party if anyone would think so . 
  yeah , we 're still waiting to see any benefits . 
  meanwhile we have second and third generation moslems on welfare going to join is . 
  yeah , because this massive immigration from the third world is * so * enriching for european countries . 
  wurst is much better anyway . 
  are second and third generation turks in germany considered german ? 
  so what are the real numbers of turks in germany ? 
   there are way more turks in germany than romanians and poles . 
  you fail to realize that these second or third generations turks might be german under the law . 
  or did that thought cross your mind , but it would ruin your manipulation ? 
  ethnic germans can have more babies . 
  importing millions of immigrants that do n't wont be a part of the society is no solution . 
  it 's good to reduce the population anyways , we are too many people . 
  good . 
  this third-world immigration is gon na bring us only ruin and struggle . 
  nations and states are not the same . 
  not every nation have their own state , like the sami or kurdish nation . 
  many nations can live within one state . 
   colonialism has consequences . 
  who woulda thought ? 
  yes , we norwegians had tons of colonies and got rich by exploiting the third world . 
  it 's not like we have a shit ton of oil and fish . 
  how naive are you ? 
  we had terror warnings here in norway last summer , our secret police had discovered some isis members were on their way to spread terror . 
  they think the idea was to use knives and kill a family to spread fear . 
  norwegian police do n't normally carry guns , but because of islamsists , they have to . 
  of course police and politicians use this chance to get a firmer grip on us :(, 
  there is no real alternative . 
  people complain but still vote and upheld this corrupt system . 
  meanwhile they really believe we have a democracy . 
  what we have is an oligarchy and it 's becoming the same much all over the west . 
  norwegian secret police ( pst ) is the source . 
  what on earth are you smoking ? 
  anarchism might have had something going for it , if if was n't so infested with communists . 
  i thought they were against totalitarian rule . 
  funny thing is that many believed hitler betrayed nazism too , the strasser brothers for example . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/national_bolshevism http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/otto_strasser, 
  i 'm norwegian and we have over 15 % immigrants . 
  the real numbers are much higher because how the statistics are recorded . 
  in 2010 , the immigrant community grew by 57,000 , which accounted for 90 % of norway 's population growth . 
  ethnic norwegians are in negative population growth and all the growth comes from immigration .

   who cares about the unemployment rate if poverty is on the rise and extreme inequality is on the rise ? 
  poverty is extremely relative . 
  `` poor '' people in the u.k have it better than most of the world . 
   with a lot of respect , it seems that the british elite have forgotten that . 
  so what do you think they should do instead ? 
  the state of the british economy is miles better than the rest of the eu . 
  wage increases will happen soon as the job market will strengthen . 
  that 's really awesome . 
  i 've heard that it has catched on in some countries , but that it 's so well known surprises me . 
  it 's great that we can help with weather forcasts to our fellow european brothers !, 
  really cool . 
  it 's probably the best weather website . 
  but i guess i 'm a bit biased since i 'm norwegian . 
  wait , croatians use yr.no ? 
  til, 
  i love denmark as well , too bad they speak with a potato in their mouths . 
  makes their women less attractive . 
  it 's true . 
  the members of our previous social democratic government had 16 times larger fortunes than the members of our current conservative government . 
  it 's very ironic indeed . 
  it 's not always bad . 
  the most important thing however is that you need competition . 
  privatizing a service without competition does n't make for a better service . 
  on the other hand privatisation in sectors with competition will almost always be benefitial . 
   tl ; dr conservatives can be cunts wierd how us norwegians have had a copayment which is over twice as much as 7 $ with over 70 years of labour governments ... 
  they 're not far of in oslo either . 
  houses go for several hundred thousand over rate before the bidding process has even begun ... 
  is n't that how things are everywhere with a multi-party system though ? 
  when voting for a party you are usually pretty aware of what other parties you indirectly support . 
   and who do they favour instead ? 
  other rightists . 
  liberalism is a right wing ideology , just like conservatism . 
  it 's just close to the centre . 
  socialism and social-democracy . 
   if you start portraying views that are actually left of centre ; more worker 's rights , stronger unions , worker ownership , and so on , you will get downvoted as a filthy , dirty soviet fanboy . 
  not in the main subs . 
  reddit circlejerks over europe , not the u.s to say it that way . 
   yeah man , she only destroyed everywhere that was n't south-east england , what a lovely woman . 
  as far as i 'm aware there is still plenty of economic activity outside of london as well . 
  but it comes to no surprise that a global city gets a lot of attention by national politicians . 
  the classic rural vs city debate is something we find all over the world . 
  it 's the same in norway where i live . 
  people from outside of oslo always complain about them getting all the attention and money . 
  large left wing majority ? 
  you 're shitting me . 
  are you really denying it ? 
  it 's crystal clear how much hate there is for conservatives in general compared to left-wingers . 
  just look at how much support abbot or cameron has on this site ...  thatcher got elected because that 's how the power structure of the uk is orientated . 
  anywhere north of london got fucked so hard in the ass , she 's the primary reason there 's even a debate on scottish independence . 
  it 's mainly northerners who are angry because of the mining subsidies that got removed . 
  it was needed though . 
   of course , the people that have n't seen the after effects of the massive dump she took on humanity do n't understand what she did . 
  she basically saved the u.k 's economy , what a disgrace to humanity !, 
  assuming she got elected 3 times in a row i would say that the majority of people were happy with her . 
  on reddit it 's different though since it 's a large left-wing majority . 
  [ denmark is actually one of the best countries in the world to do business in ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ease_of_doing_business_index#ranking ) . 
  quite the opposite of socialist actually . 
  i think an independent scotland should focus on renewable energy instead . 
  also remember that becoming independent would require some effort which means that i doubt you would turn a surplus right away . 
  the best years of oil production is sadly over . 
  it 's just too late . 
  another issue is that there is n't really a majority for turning scotland independent . 
  it will be interesting to see though . 
  i would say small towns that lie `` in the middle of nowhere '' . 
  typically with less than 1000 inhabitants . 
  i have relatives that live in a small town pretty far from any larger places that have fiber broadband . 
  this is despite the mountains and long distances . 
  it 's usually power companies who cooperate with isp 's to expand the network . 
  it 's a really good deal since it means that the government does n't have to spend tax money on it . 
   generally , small towns in latvia have fiber optic connection , the areas surrounding these town generally have decent internet connection . 
  does n't really surprise me when taking into account how small latvia is . 
  is there really that much to gain from it now though ? 
  our fund was created in 1990 which is quite som time ago . 
  our oil production is already declining as well as investments in the petroleum sector . 
  i do n't know what the situation is on the british continental shelf , but i ca n't imagine it being much different . 
   but it gives you a currency you can use far more easily in large amounts . \u00a8 we sell our oil in dollars so it 's not really something that we lack . 
  on the website of our sovereign wealth fund it also says this : `` the majority of the investments are in developed countries , with a high percentage of government bonds denominated in euros , dollars , pounds and yen . '', 
   but obviously norway does n't need to spend a lot of money at once so they have no real reason to invest in us treasury assets . 
  if we were to use a lot of money domestically we would use nok anyways . 
   define a rural area . 
  according to wikipedia : `` in general , a rural area is a geographic area that is located outside cities and towns '', 
  i kinda figured . 
  it 's ok , 
  they own tiny amounts of it though . 
  american debt is a very safe investment , but it does n't give high returns . 
  is n't really that tempting when you want good returns . 
  for the eurozone no doubt . 
  but in norway we already have 2,2 % inflation . 
   we also did the whole loop through brass dsl cables . 
  so ya 'll europeans are just lazy to give in to the optic fibre master race . 
  in the cities sure . 
  but what city in europe does n't have high speed internet ? 
  fiber in rural areas is where it 's at , and here us scandinavians are on par with romania , if not better . 
  #norwayproblems :(, 
   here in norway we could use the oil fund but what about the rest of europe ? 
  pretty sure that would n't be a good idea inflation wise . 
  you kind of have to built a lot from scratch when under 50 % of your population actually has access to the internet . 
  something like that yes . . 
  electronics , electricity and diapers are the only thing that comes to mind . 
  most other things however are pretty expensive ...

   how i feel trumps your facts !, 
  i demand fair and balanced reporting on whether the holocaust happened . 
  obviously , they must be sentenced to death . 
  i doubt you 've even read a single page of the quran . 
  islam has been around for over a millennium , shit like this has n't really been happening until about a decade ago . 
  is the problem islam , or is it the political situation in the middle east and nearby countries ? 
  not always , but we have been sticking our fingers up pretty much every bumhole in the world for the last couple of centuries , so we 've got a lot of baggage . 
   it 's like they 've got more rights than us no , they just have the same rights as you ... 
  it does make a difference if people are trying to set islam apart from all other religions as promoting violence . 
  the claim is that all muslims are called to kill the infidels , which is simply not the case . 
  this is irrelevant to my statement . 
  plese do n't put words in my mouth . 
  i did n't deny that there is violence in the quran . 
  i said that it does n't say to kill all infidels . 
  of course , i 'm the one reading it with prejudice ... you are more than welcome to provide quotes to substantiate your claims . 
   islam , however , says to kill infidels and whatnot . 
  truly , the words of a scholar ... 
  the quran says nothing of the sort , i 'm afraid . 
  only quotes taken out of context say that . 
  welcome to / r/europe . 
  our longboats would rek u !, 
  the recent uptick in terrorist attacks is a result of the success in defeating is in the middle east . 
  they 're losing territory , soldiers , and leaders left and right , so they 've started pushing for more terrorist attacks . 
  this is their death throes . 
  this picture is from when it was being towed , i think . 
  they submerged the feet when it reached its position . 
  and individual polls can be outliers , which is why you aggregate results from many polls . 
  they all left to buy diapers at the norwegian border . 
  i 'd like to be described as a sexual adventurer . 
  yes . 
  it being advisory is a fact , not a matter of opinion . 
  the referendum is ** advisory ** . 
  democracy has nothing to do with it . 
  today i found out that there are stupid questions . 
  the specific amount does n't matter , it 's the proportion that matters . 
  in norway , 1 million is 20 % . 
  in china 1 million is 0,07 % . 
  that does n't make any sense . 
  i 'll let you think it through for a bit . 
  if a little less than 2 % more of the votes went remain , it 'd be 50/50 . 
  when they account for less than 2 % , no . 
  first of all , the referendum is ** advisory ** . 
  secondly , a 2 % difference for something this momentous just is n't enough . 
  stop . 
  calling . 
  that . 
  maybe they should n't act like idiots , then . 
  no , people are raping girls , and your obsession with their ethnic and cultural background in the wake of ** enormous ** sexual abuse scandals simply shows that you do n't give a fuck about the victims of this crime , but are just looking for another excuse to hate brown people . 
  yeah , that 's not equivocation . 
  i 'm not assuming . 
  i have you tagged . 
  it 's easier for you to see shades of gray when the perpetrators are n't brown or muslim , is n't it ? 
   equivocating i 'm not sure you know what that word means . 
  at least , it 's not very clear what point you 're trying to make . 
  catholic priests ? 
  westminster politicians ? 
  british television personalities ? 
  you mean like how those poor deluded fools used to think that you could work for 8 hours and get paid for 12 ? 
  are they coming to your house and inspecting your portions ? 
  they 're cracking down on ** advertising ** that seeks to illicit consumer reactions that overall have a negative impact on their health . 
  they have to review all advertising material anyway , this is n't some kind of moneyhole they 're throwing tax payer pounds into . 
  you do understand that there is a vast amount of scientific literature on the effects of advertising , right ? 
  especially on unrealistic body image . 
  i 'm not losing an argument , you 're explicitly arguing against established scientific facts . 
  [ google scholar ] ( https://scholar.google.no/scholar?hl=no&amp;q=body+image+advertising&amp;btng= ) [ wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/effects_of_advertising_on_teen_body_image ), 
  `` blablablabla , science does n't know what it 's talking about . 
  i do . '', 
  why are medical ads banned ? 
  why ca n't ads just outright lie ? 
  why does the advertising industry spend tons of money on psychology ? 
  why are sales people taught methods to take advantage of cognitive biases ? 
  why do stores put certain products in certain places ? 
  because it fucking works !, 
  you can whine all about how people who are affected by commercials are losers , but you 're one of them . 
  the model in the ad is photoshopped . 
  just imagine what the comments would look like in this thread if you exchanged the word `` christian '' with `` muslim '' in the headline . 
  migrants are overrepresented in every statistic regardless of background . 
  that 's part of the whole migration thing . 
  it is intrinsically a disruptive event . 
  i do n't understand why it 's so hard for people to say `` eeeeh , we fucked up '' once in a while . 
  always with the excuses and blame-shifting . 
  what a weird fantasy world you live in . 
  you do n't understand , dude . 
  there were no muslims involved in this , so there 's nobody to blame . 
  what the fuck are you talking about , dude ? 
  this has fuck all to do with personal freedom . 
  seriously ? 
  did you just compare nrk to fox news ? 
  unelected . 
  you do n't need an example to state that we are at an impasse . 
  you can just state that we are at an impasse . 
  when you start throwing in pointless examples using the islamic state and slavery , you ca n't really hide behind ignorance . 
  no , you implied that my position is equal to that of someone supporting the islamic state and slavery . 
  i fail to see how slavery has anything to do with economic activity ( beyond the obvious ) , unless you 're calling slaves a commodity , which further implies that you support slavery . 
  no , i 'm stating how things are and ** how they should be . 
  ** the state ** should have ** the power to regulate all economic activity . 
  when you engage in commerce , you accept the rules and regulations tied to it . 
  nobody forced this guy to become a landlord . 
  nobody 's forcing him to remain a landlord . 
  the state is n't forcing him to do anything .

  i do n't know anything about these cases so i will refrain from commenting on specifics but barnevernet has always been seen as someone many people think overreact but i am not always so sure , it is behaving the same way towards `` regular '' norwegians for lack of a better expression . 
  this may also be down to differences culturally in regards to child treatment , norway also has a [ children 's ombudsman ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/children%27s_ombudsman#norway ) , norway was the first country in the world to create one back in 1981 . 
  so any such cases can be reported to the ombudsman who will investigate .

   there are many freedoms and sources of funding for companies , so your business will flourish . 
  well , the problem is that entrepreneurship in the us is falling behind and for obvious reasons as it is easier to try and fail in more civilized countries . 
  [ in norway , start-ups say ja to socialism ] ( http://www.inc.com/magazine/20110201/in-norway-start-ups-say-ja-to-socialism.html ) :  in 1998 , dalmo quit his job , bought a used pickup truck , and started calling on clients as an independent contractor . 
  by year 's end , he had six employees , all mechanics , and he was making more money than he ever had . 
  within three years , his new company , momek , was booking more than $ 1 million a year in revenue and quickly expanding into new lines of business . 
  he built a machine shop and began manufacturing parts for oil rigs , and he started bidding on and winning contracts to staff oil drilling sites and mines throughout the country . 
  he kept hiring , kept bidding , and when he looked around a decade later , he had a $ 44 million company with 150 employees . 
  and  this is exactly the kind of pride i often hear from the ceos i have met while working at inc. , but for one important difference : whereas most entrepreneurs in dalmo 's position develop a retching distaste for paying taxes , dalmo does n't mind them much . 
  `` the tax system is good -- it 's fair , '' he tells me . 
  `` what we 're doing when we are paying taxes is buying a product . 
  so the question is n't how you pay for the product ; it 's the quality of the product . '', 
  dalmo likes the government 's services , and he believes that he is paying a fair price . 
  and  norway is also full of entrepreneurs like wiggo dalmo . 
  rates of start-up creation here are among the highest in the developed world , and norway has more entrepreneurs per capita than the united states , according to the latest report by the global entrepreneurship monitor , a boston-based research consortium . 
  a 2010 study released by the u.s. small business administration reported a similar result : although america remains near the top of the world in terms of entrepreneurial aspirations -- that is , the percentage of people who want to start new things -- in terms of actual start-up activity , our country has fallen behind not just norway but also canada , denmark , and switzerland . 
  it is easier to start a company , if you fail , you have a welfare network to catch you so you can try again .

fjords and mountains help , 
  that was n't what i was thinking about tbh - norway is infinitely more beautiful . 
  houses and certainly apartments are smaller though ( just my gutfeel , i have lived in both countries ) . 
  i think the german health care system overall performs better , although it admittedly comes with more inequality . 
  other than that ... nothing major comes to mind . 
  which is n't to say that germany does worse in all other respects . 
  ca n't think of any in norway :-(, 
  we need a language everyone can use , and english seems to be it . 
  i can count myself lucky that 's it in my native language 's family , that made it easy to learn for me , 
  danish , hands down . 
  granted , it 's hard to understand for me ( german immigrant in norway ) , but it sounds hilarious and nice at the same time . 
  like norwegian , spoken while having a potato in the mouth , according to norwegians . 
  legend has it that danes ca n't even understand each other . 
  never heard of money being a purely capitalist concept either . 
  troms\u00f8 , northern norway - the statue of king olav was painted red by `` russ '' - kids who soon finish school and do stupid stuff for a couple of weeks every spring . 
  - people fear that gypsies will again camp beneath one of the city 's bridges . 
  after this being an issue last year , many people are wary of them . 
  as a related news item , the populist right wing seems to be happy to agitate against beggars - it 's election year after all . 
  - a regional airline ( wider\u00f8e ) was struck by a worker 's strike . 
  as a consequence , postal deliveries might be delayed . 
  - a swimming elk delayed a ferry landing nearby so , not that much happening at the moment . 
  i think the people are gearing up for the national day ceremonies on the 17. , and summer is not far . 
  the weather is splendid , and we are busy getting sunburned , 
  troms\u00f8 in northern norway here . 
  we had unusually ( though not exceptionally ) much snowfall and lots of avalanches lately . 
  some people died in avalanches because they were stupid , spurring public discussion about safety when being out and about in the mountains . 
  also , a road connecting a part of the island i 'm living on had to be closed for almost two weeks because a series of huge avalanches buried it in several meters of snow . 
  it opened again this afternoon . 
  politically , the local government is divided and threatened to fall apart because one ruling party ( h\u00f8yre , the conservatives ) agreed with the sami parliament ( representation of indigenous people from the european arctic , living partly in norway ) to collaborate more in the future . 
  the party that rules troms\u00f8 together with h\u00f8yre , the right wing populist fremskrittspartiet ( progress party ) is not amused about this and basically threatens divorce . 
  posnania is a horse . 
  they are after him, 
  run, 
  still does n't matter , does it ? 
  i bet you can configure these things to either only ask for your pin , or ask you for amount of money first . 
  does it matter ? 
  all card terminals i have ever used in restaurants and such ask me to type in the amount of money i want to pay , and all card terminals i have ever used in supermarkets do n't do that ... 
  i have to do no such thing at , say , the supermarket . 
  so , no , this is not an issue . 
  i am with you , it is a disgusting practice . 
  i 'd much rather do away with that . 
  but people here still tip , and it is expected of people to do so . 
   there is no tipping culture in norway why , then , do i have to type in the amount of money i want to pay in a restaurant / caf\u00e9 myself ? 
  i agree that we do n't have as much of a `` tipping culture '' as , say , the germans , but still ...  there has never been a implicit contract between consumers and businesses in norway that they the former * should pay a part of the emplyees salary through tipping * . 
  that much is correct , i did n't mean to imply anything different . 
  ( i added the emphasis here ) . 
  i do , however , still say that it is bad manners to not tip anything . 
  as you say , good service should be rewarded , and i think it is expected of the customer to do so . 
  me neither , before i moved to norway . 
  top voted comment says you do n't tip in germany ? 
  i grew up in germany , and i can tell you that while you do n't need to tip much , not tipping at all for example in a restaurant is just rude . 
  huh ? 
  when you pay with your card at a restaurant or caf\u00e9 , you usually type in the amount you want to pay yourself . 
  that , my friend , is where you are supposed to tip . 
  it 's not a must ( the waiters do n't depend on tips as much as they do elsewhere ) , but i would say it 's rude to not tip anything when the service was good . 
  as for how much ? 
  i usually round up to something in the area of 5-10 % . 
  if i got bad service , i tip less or nothing . 
  edit : who do i tip ? 
  restaurants , caf\u00e9s , pizza delivery guys , that sort of thing . 
  i do n't think i tip anywhere else ( like taxis or doctors ) - usually you do n't even have the option to do so : we pay most things with card , and when there is no option to type in the amount you want to pay , there 's no possibility for tipping . 
  it 's a great dane i guess ... 
  he could at least have painted a pair of skis or something . 
  just ... something . 
  i am disappoint . 
  good point !, 
  edited my post . 
  you 'll find many clips on youtube . 
  there also seem to be complete ( ? ), 
  airings available . 
  i did n't check , because i. . . ca n't , but here 's the link for you : http://www.youtube.com/results?search_type=videos&amp;search_query=musikantenstadl&amp;search_duration=long&amp;uni=3 edit : do n't click the first search result , it 's not the real thing . 
  the real thing is a major tv production . 
  edit 2 : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmjhuibzooa here , this will do . 
  nobody has recommended a norwegian game show yet , so here is the only one i know that is sometimes actually funny : * `` 71 grader nord '' * ( `` 71 degrees north '' ) . 
  it 's sporty people doing sporty things mostly in the norwegian wilderness . 
  and while we 're at it : google * `` lars monsen '' * . 
  he 's the norwegian bear grylls , except he does n't drink piss and he 's of course much better . 
  he made several different nature programmes / shows / entertaining `` documentaries '' . 
  another noteable ( ? ), 
  norwegian production ( not game show ) is * `` lilyhammer '' * . 
  it 's about an italian american mafia guy ( played by an actor from `` the sopranos '' ) who is exiled to lillehammer , norway . 
  it 's semi-funny at best sometimes , but there are lots of funny norwegian stereotypes in it . 
  as a plus , much of it is in english . 
  edit : pmatthew8 points out that i should include `` hurtigruten - minutt for minutt '' . 
  it 's the complete trip of one of our coastal steamers , all the way from bergen in the southwest to kirkenes near the russian border . 
  71something hours of madness . 
  and you can watch it all for free online !, 
  here : http://nrk.no/hurtigruten/, 
  i grew up in ** germany ** , so here are a few recommendations . 
  since others have already pointed you to scripted productions like crime series , let me add some actual shows as in `` game show '' or `` talk show '' - there are some very popular ones that do , i believe , convey lots of ... well ... german-ness . 
  * `` wetten , dass ... '' * ( `` i bet that ... '' ) - used to be the by far most successful `` saturday evening live show '' in german television for several decades . 
  it 's mostly older people watching it now . 
  * `` schlag den raab '' * ( `` beat stefan raab '' ) - a rare example of a more recent game show that has actually been invented in germany and not licensed and adapted from somewhere else . 
  * `` hart aber fair '' * ( `` hard but fair '' ) - one of the most important political talk shows . 
  it always strikes me as very ( present-day ) german . 
  in an altogether rather good way . 
  the downside to all of these shows is that you will probably not find subtitles for any of them ... but here 's a bonus . 
  it 's also all german , but it is so * whacky * you can probably `` enjoy '' it even if you do n't understand a single word : ** `` musikantenstadl '' ** . 
  you have been warned . 
  will you join us ?

  sure , the chinese and europeans spy , but we do n't have access to your networks or citizens wholesale . 
  those american corporations , or their subsidiaries incorporated in europe , fail to abide by our/local laws . 
  the us gov ' t clearly , * knowingly * infringes on our sovereignty by requiring them to hand over information regardless of origin/location . 
  i do n't blame google for following us law , i blame the us gov ' t for abusing it . 
   what if this is actually legal ? 
  what is the bad thing here ? 
  i 'm afraid it 's the same answer as above . 
  the americans might have given * themselves * the laws needed to justify spying on foreigners . 
  it 's not entirely clear if what they 're doing is `` legal '' in the us either . 
  - the bad thing is that , as those foreigners they 're spying on , we have no legal remedy ; i.e. 
  we ca n't sue them , have them extradited for trial or punish them in any way . 
  - democracy and good governance requires accountability and they 've taken away part of our sovereignty as states and the right as citizens to impeach our government . 
  our secret services answer to us ultimately . 
  let 's note that * foreign * spies are illegal . 
  in my opinion this infringement is tantamount to an attack by a hostile power . 
  it 's the modern day equivalent of occupying a country 's telecom operator or broadcaster . 
  even if it 's done with the collusion of our government and officials . 
  it 's illegal for our officials to hand over our sovereignty . 
  it 's called being a traitor . 
   i do believe that they should act according to what the law prescribes yes , but * which * set of laws , american or european ?!, 
  the question is rhetorical because we already know american corporations in europe are subject to us law and agencies ... 
  in conclusion ; what rights are europeans citizens awarded by the us intelligence community or us corporations ? 
  absolutely none . 
  the gini index is useful , but not always conclusive . 
  the income distribution has changed over the last decades , so that also has some effect . 
  a doctor or manager ( 700k ) makes only a little more in terms of salary than an industrial worker ( 350k ) , and then there 's progressive taxes . 
  we redistribute a lot of wealth through taxes and welfare state payments ( at birth , maternal leave , free childcare etc ) . 
  there are many more european immigrants ( laborers ) here now , which do make considerably less on average . 
  most of the research done on scandinavia credits our social cohesion and the public support ( welfare state ) . 
   it explains scandinavia vs the rest , but then you should have inverted values between france and uk , ... 
  i 'm afraid we could write books on the subject and so they have , hehe . 
   where the prisoners were forced to eat lutefisk . 
  i do n't see the problem ? 
  can i move to this camp now ? 
   does anyone have an insight about any other value that seems correlated with this ? 
  in general scandinavia is known for income inequality , generous welfare state and social cohesion ( rights , a stronger sense of representation , functioning of democracy and sense of confidence in the future ) . 
  there 's less need for police if people do n't have to steal to survive . 
  i added [ this map with the data table ] ( http://i.imgur.com/eu7bl8a ) . 
  here is [ a map representation ] ( http://i.imgur.com/eu7bl8a ) using the 2009 data . 
  okay , [ this is my quick version of the map ] ( http://i.imgur.com/pc71zox )  police officers per 100,000 citizens ( 2009 ) according to the table : - finland 156 - norway 159,2 did i miss something here ? 
  2011 numbers : - finland 8 161 officers / 5 375 276 citizens = 151,8 - norway 7 684 officers / 4 920 305 citizens = 156,2, 
  uh , that last one makes norway and finland look odd ... 
  we only export to `` approved '' states , such as the us ... - we supply ammo for the barrett sniper rifle , specifically [ the .50 cal anti-tank ammunition ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/raufoss_mk_211 ) , which when used on humans literally blows them apart . 
  - [ remotely-controlled weapons stations ( crows ) ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/protector_\\ ( rws \\ ) ) for their apcs etc,

   cue to be fair , those greeks in a queue probably * are * moaning , right on cue !, 
  they really ought to include norway 's svalbard archipelago on the map !, 
  it 's an integral part of the kingdom . 
  - it has [ really fast access to the internet ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/svalbard_undersea_cable_system ) ( above 1,280 gigabits per second ) . 
  - all due to [ the satellite downlink base there ] ( http://www.fastcompany.com/48533/where-heck-svalbard ) serving [ clients such as nasa/esa ] ( http://www.ksat.no/ ) and [ the svalbard university centre ] ( http://www.unis.no/ ) !, 
  ironically they 're more online than most people in the world . 
  they 're just few people , with a large landmass !, 
  it 's a shame ; russia truly has a great story to tell !, 
  today 's politics and economic situation is hardly what defines you as a people . 
  oh , how i would like people to know more about russia . 
  - from kiev rus to your great authors and composers - from the magnificent streets of st. petersburg , to the natural beauty of siberia . 
  - sunny beaches , great mountains , awesome plains , massive forests and frozen seas . 
  what does n't russia have ? 
  i for one would love to travel by boat to the white sea , and by train across russia to the far east . 
  you 're not europe 's `` enemy '' , your one of our greatest cultures ever . 
  it will take a few generations to regain that image . 
  i would be quite proud if my country was summed up as `` cheese , wine and napoleon '' , 
  oh , i do n't object to * the idea * itself . 
  no , i was very pro-eu a few years back , as a matter of fact . 
  i even volunteered for the young european federalists ( jef ) . 
  i believe that european federalism is inevitable in the long run . 
  it 's a successful recipe ( see us ) and probably a necessity to compete with other large countries/blocks such as china , other brics etc. 
  that does n't mean we all have to join right now , or that the smaller countries wo n't do better outside the eu as niche players ... 
   the big states have by far the most power yes , i 'm afraid that 's what matters in the end . 
  there 's power in numbers , and we will never have great ( er ) numbers . 
   with regards to icelandic membership i 'd call this quite acceptable oh , i 'm sure you would quickly find reasons to object to eu policies . 
  the efta-eu agreement is limited for a reason . 
  are you sure you want to trust their fishing policy and share your waters with spanish trawlers ? 
  here in norway we 're quite upset at the moment that the eu wants to force their new safety regulations for oil/gas platforms on us , despite the fact that their standards are much * lower * !, 
  we believe it 's outside of the eea 's scope as well . 
  thanks , that was actually interesting . 
  oh , we would !, 
  that is if we were to join , 
   a huge corruption scandal in military intelligence service . 
  what exactly happened ? 
  making 800,000 free condoms with holes ? 
  or are we simply one of * those * worlds ? 
  i bet he simply went home !, 
  again , i 'm not spanish , but i believe the key difference is * los * and * la * . 
  it 's the [ one ] union of soviet republics , but the many united * states * ( plural ) . 
  the eu is also just one union , so it 's called * la ue * . 
  a family has many members , but it 's also one unit . 
  verbose ; using or expressed in more words than are needed . 
  i only learned a little spanish in school , but if i remember correctly it 's la union sovietica ( singular ) , unlike * los estados * ( plural ) . 
  according to wikipedia the full name was la uni\u00f3n de rep\u00fablicas socialistas sovi\u00e9ticas ( urss ) . 
  it 's the plural form of states . 
  the plural is expressed by doubling the initial letter in spanish acronyms . 
  it 's the plural form of states . 
  the plural is expressed by doubling the initial letter in spanish acronyms . 
  yes , estados unidos . 
  as you can tell they do n't call it the `` eu '' , while they call the european union the `` ue '' ( la uni\u00f3n europea ) . 
  the french also call the european union the `` ue '' . 
   eeuu or japan the `` eeuu '' means very little to non-spanish speakers , as you probably know it 's the us [ in english ] . 
  yeah , we 'd order chinese food to be delivered . 
    at least with that time scale .

  it 's easily translatable into norwegian as well : gaijin = utlending gaikokujin = av utenlandsk opprinnelse and the connotation that comes with both phrases are fairly similar to their japanese equivalent even . 
  relax dude , the question was hypothetical ... 
  yeah ... you do n't understand economics at all , do you ? 
   with the ubi you will have organized groups of people working together to work against the markets , for sure . 
  i really doubt that 's how it 's going to play out in the real world , but if we were to take it to an extreme , not only would ubi people stifle the production of goods , but they 'd ruin the economy for everyone else including themselves and that would n't be in anyone 's interest , and again , the ubi money would n't be worth the paper they were printed on . 
  in a worst case scenario , you 'd end up with famines with millions of people starving to death and a severe lack of medication and sanitation amongst other things . 
  i 'm sorry to break your spirits , but deconstructing capitalism is certainly not going to be that easy , there 's a reason lenin introduced nep and millions of people died from starvation when stalin removed it . 
  i have no idea how you came up with this crackpot theory of yours . 
   companies will have to adapt . 
  by lowering their products and match those of the parallel economy . 
  but those having the ubi will continue lowering the prices and providing the people with cheaper products . 
  that does n't make any sense , honestly . 
  uib would just be regular money and a part of the monetary cycle like everything else , and if the markets operate as they do today there 's no reason to assume that people would be able to buy stuff with their ubi money ( ? ), 
  and resell it for cheap . 
  the implications would be that you 'd starve businesses for a little while then the market adjusts itself and your ubi money would n't be worth squat while the money used to make transactions between companies still would keep its value . 
   we will reach ... you can write it because i think you know it . 
  no , probably not . 
   would you promote the spread of secular liberalism in religious regions like the middle east as a factor in foreign policy ? 
  honestly , we should n't meddle with countries we have no business meddling with unless they pose a direct threat to europe . 
  forcing an ideology upon people does n't seem like a particularly good idea to me either , and it 'd probably create more tension and contempt towards europe amongst middle-easterners which is something we do n't need in this political climate . 
  well , if you want to donate , find an ngo in romania that 's working on the relevant issues . 
  this one for instance : http://www.apd.ro/en_us/, 
  it 's an actual public protest , not some professionally paid ngo protest . 
  `` l\u00e5t den r\u00e4tte komma in '' comes to mind . 
  [ nrk ] ( https://www.nrk.no/ ) generally is regarded as the news source with the least amount of bias . 
  nrk used reports ^ ^ ^ ^ [ 1 ] ( https://polisen.se/global/www%20och%20intrapolis/%c3%96vriga%20rapporter/kriminella%20natverk%20med%20stor%20paverkan%20i%20lokalsamhallet%20sekretesspr%2014.pdf ) ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ [ 2 ] ( http://polisen.azurewebsites.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/eu-rapport-utvardering-jarva1.pdf ) by the swedish police as their reference too and if you bothered to read the article i 've linked the swedish police even described it as such :  en politirapport den svenske rikspolisen offentliggjorde i 2014 , lister opp 55 av utenforskapsomr\u00e5dene som spesielt utsatte bydeler , hvor kriminelle nettverk har sterk innflytelse . 
  i really do n't know if it 's the norm or not , honestly . 
  but the family i stayed with were lovely and almost treated me like a son-in-law . 
  this was almost five years ago and i regularly stay in touch with them and i 've visited them again after my initial stay there . 
  politics and serving our own interests really . 
  if russia were our ally and if all of europe were a part of the warsaw pact or some form of alliance other than nato , we 'd probably turn a blind eye on crimea as well and sanction the us because of the alleged `` war on terror '' . 
  yup , they actually had those too . 
  i ended up just showering regularly for the most part , though . 
   ( especially since the police get little more than a hot dog and a pat on the back in terms of resources to actually operate with ) . 
  probably because it really was n't a necessity with before these `` ghettoized '' areas started forming , and both police and government have n't properly adjusted to the new realities yet . 
  i knew quite a bit before moving there as well , but there are always the small things you * do n't * know about . 
  i lived with a host family and one of the things that really caught me off-guard was that the family shared the bathwater , and i was expected to do the same . 
  obviously , you wash your body thoroughly before entering the tub , but still , it was off-putting for me initially , then you get used to it and it is n't all * that * weird anymore . 
  i think it 's real to some degree . 
  our state-owned tv channel has done a lot of in-depth reporting and research on these issues in sweden where they 've interviewed police chiefs in these areas about `` problematic zones '' or `` utenforskapsomr\u00e5der '' as they 're called , and according to the police , there are about 50 or so places in different swedish cities where the police partially have lost control and where the violent crime rate is elevated . 
  [ source ] ( https://www.nrk.no/urix/svensk-politi_-_-vi-er-i-ferd-med-a-miste-kontrollen-1.12920404 ) the nrk crew has been attacked on several occasions trying to report from some of these areas as well . 
  [ source ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6pt2dmilsq ) people that say there 's not certain problems in some areas are either ill-informed or willfully ignorant . 
  i 've lived in japan for one year and the us for 6 months . 
  both countries gave me different flavors of culture shock and i honestly could n't tell you which one of them that gave me the greatest amount . 
  in japan , like in norway , people are really not intrusive at all and leave you alone unless you specifically address someone , while in the us people you do n't know might strike up a conversation while you 're waiting for the bus or doing something mundane that involves waiting , and i 've experienced it first hand . 
  the language barrier obviously was bigger in japan and if i did n't speak the language at all , i 'd probably be inclined to say that japan gave me the greater culture shock of the two . 
  i 've been to other countries too obviously , but not outside of being a tourist , and being a tourist really does n't give me an authentic feeling of the day-to-day life in said countries and certainly not the foundation to assess whether i 've experienced a culture shock or not .

  eu was n't created to prevent war or ensure stability , nato was . 
  the eu as it is today was created with a mix of pragmatic and ideological underlinings . 
  ideologically as in `` united states of europe '' , and if you 've listened to people like guy verhofstad speak , he certainly is an ideologue and has a clear vision for the future of europe , but i sometimes get the impression that he cares more about the european project than the peoples of europe . 
  i listened to an interview with him about brexit and his new book the other day , where , in one of the segments he and the host discussed `` the rise of populism '' and the refugee crisis , and i was left with the impression that he cared about limiting the influx of refugees for purpose of shutting down populism , rather than appeasing the worries of the public -- the working class in particular , and generally to prevent problems the immigration might cause . 
  the pragmatic part would be everything that 's bilaterally beneficial for the member states , but you do n't need to federalize to have all of that . 
   germans who buy `` norwegian hydroelectricity '' essentially buy certificates for the electricity to be produced in norway . 
  ah , makes sense . 
  i 've read that we 're still buying a lot of nuclear/coal from countries since we 're exporting energy , but perhaps that 's unrelated to the certificate thing . 
  one thing i find really dumb is that some germans buy hydroelectricity from us specifically because it 's clean , and the logic they use to justify it is so short-sighted that i want to shoot myself thinking about it . 
  essentially , they 're paying to virtue signal whilst moving the carbon footprint elsewhere , and as the net output of renewable energy is n't increased or affected positively , it wo n't have any environmental impact whatsoever since we 'll have to buy the energy we sell back , mostly from coal/nuclear plants . 
  actually , it might even have a negative impact in the long run since i reckon some of the energy would be lost during transportation . 
  i do n't feel too strongly about it honestly , but i do understand why the decision to close the subreddit was made . 
  i have doubts about the reasoning behind the ban , and i think the mods increasingly have been looking for a legitimate reason to shut it down since the label `` hotbed for nazis '' really is n't a good one from a business perspective . 
  in norway , ideologies ( communism , socialism , national socialism and french/german nationalism ) and their history are covered extensively throughout the history lessons while the mainstream political parties , what they stand for etc. 
  are covered in `` samfunnsfag '' or `` social studies '' which is a subject we have . 
  according to statistics , yes . 
  some are integrated , others are n't . 
   i 've become biased as to what i 've seen online and i do n't know if i 'm in the right or wrong . 
  you 're asking a bunch of people that has their own biases and anecdotes you know , the best thing would be to look at actual statistics and the long-term impact it might , or might not have . 
   could you elaborate ? 
  yeah , sure . 
  progressives in america would n't like it very much if every illegal immigrant were to be deported , and there has been a huge ruckus over trump wanting to deport illegals with a criminal record even . 
  in norway there 's no question about it , every illegal immigrant is deported , with or without a crime record . 
  when it comes to refugees we have one of the strictest laws in europe as well , and out government has been criticized for it . 
  for example that they 're taking x-rays of the skeleton and the teeth of refugees that claims to be underaged amongst other things , they 've also committed to sending people back as soon as their respective countries are safe for return . 
  lots of our immigrants are from the eu and the schengen area though . 
  they have adopted parts of the russian traditional dress due to their shared history, 
   it 's supposed to describe an environment that can lead to a fascist regime and does n't really concern itself with a particular implementation of fascism . 
  i 'm not quite sure if trump is the manifestation of such an environment since the * far * right in the us still is a fringe , albeit a growing one , mostly due to the fact that white people are disgruntled with the identity politics of the left . 
  the best case scenario of a trump presidency as i see it would be if he 'd manage to create even growth , thus making the left/right polarization stagnate and rekindle the spirit of american patriotism which in the past has been the common , uniting denominator amongst people of different ethnic and religious backgrounds and something that is sorely needed in such a multicultural society . 
  if he ca n't do that , i have no idea what the future holds . 
  but , give the man a chance i say , after all , he 's the symptom and not the underlying problem . 
   fascism does n't require anti-jewish or anti-israeli opinions . 
  no , but i think it 's a prerequisite if you 're going to draw parallels to hitler . 
  other than that , i agree with the rest of your post . 
  the far-right forces like trump because he 'll nudge the public discourse and the overton window rightwards , more so than anyone else . 
   has so far spent a week badly reenacting hitlers early policies . 
  i know you 're emotional , but try to be sensible about it . 
  trump did n't bully people into voting for him , he has n't in any way tried to outlaw other political parties or to abolish democracy , his daughter converted to judaism and he is vehemently pro-israel . 
  michael moore and many progressive americans praise norway as some progressive utopia and uses it in their political narrative , but fails to aknowledge that some of the reason the systems we have in place work so well is because of cultural homogenity and cohesiveness which ensures lasting social stability , low leves of corruption etc. 
  and god forbid if they knew about our `` progressive '' immigration policies .

   and could help companies shed new light and get different views on the most optimal strategies going forward . 
  i definitely see how that * can * be beneficial for certain companies , but the premise of that argument is still wrong in many ways , namely that `` diversity '' oftentimes mean tangible diversity such as skin colour or gender , rather than diversity of minds and talents . 
  i generally subscribe to equality of opportunity , not equality of success . 
  yeah , i feel like the policies enacted in norway are based on the assumption that every individual , regardless of gender or any other relevant vector , is a blank slate without any predispositions at all . 
  social scientists , which i 'm going to assume are planted somewhere far-left on the political spectrum describes the gender distribution in certain professions as problematic , and i always find myself asking `` why ? 
  '' , what 's the problem with people picking traditionally , why is it a problem that there are more female nurses and more male engineers . 
  if a woman wishes to work in a male dominated profession , nothing is stopping her . 
  our state channel did a documentary on this a couple of years ago that i 'd recommend you to watch : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvatc15plvs, 
  egalitarianism went a little too far here if you ask me .

so are all 354 russian ones in europe ? 
  you do not need flights or tunnels to visit europe . 
  you are in europe and have always been . 
  althought it 's not strange people do n't feel europeean after the hysteric brainwashing you have been trough . 
  yes you have the channel between england and the mainland . 
  but i live on an island in norway and i 'm still norwegian . 
  i remember my granddad talking about usa as the place you could go to get freedom and liberties and get away from opressing regimes . 
  and you guys - forget about facehook and twatler - they will demand our reddit password !, 
  yes people wanting an excuse to do bad things tend to forget the last part of the christian bible about love your neighbour . 
  i 'm starting to think the 911 guys won . 
  when usa - the champion of freedom everywhere - remove one freedom after another . 
  what we are left with is not the us i grew up with . 
  sigh . 
  ok thanks - i 'll delete this one then . 
  too fancy page does not work on my computer . 
  condolences to broderfolket !, 
  london , st. petersburgh and now this !, 
  and not forgetting all the terrible things in the middle eastern countries . 
  it 's a sad day . 
  i do n't mind joining denmark again - but this time it 's our time to rule . 
  colour of passport is all right - but the rest ? 
  england want to go back to the middle ages !, 
  rahmyoghurt from germany . 
  with 10 % or more fat . 
  in norway we only get 0.1 % yoghurt which is not suitable for human taste buds . 
  oh but we are definately part of europe . 
  just some eu members behaving like high school . 
  you know - deciding who 's cool or not . 
  is n't this / r/europe and not / r/eu ? 
  so why so many grey countries ? 
  the pear one taste fantastic - and a little like pear . 
  no - it 's a country . 
  lol !, 
  the uk is still going to be in europe even after brexit !, 
  did you think the uk would become asian or american or something ? 
  so when many norwegians say we are eu members just without the right to vote it 's not that far off . 
  interesting !, 
  i belive you forgot about norway - which would be interesting since some in the uk are contemplating the `` norwegian model '' . 
  norway is atleast a member of schengen and eea . 
  perhaps more ? 
  i 'm a norwegian and enjoyed this when travelling to germany in march . 
  i love you , neelie kroes !, 
  thank you !, 
  interesting !, 
  ok good to know . 
  i have been looking at debian linux . 
  this was really useful . 
  thank you !, 
  i have been looking at debian linux today . 
  i 'm glad to hear . 
   so any boycott will very likely hit the wrong people . 
  so does al boycots i belive . 
  like the large boycot of south africa because of apartheid . 
  i 'm sure darker skinned people suffered too . 
  still i belive it was the right thing they did . 
  and i do n't think microsoft , google , amazon will suffer much from me personally stopping to buy us . 
  i do it for me . 
  trying not to support bullies . 
  even when they do occasional good things they are still bullies . 
  but we are straying - i wanted to know of alternative products made in europe . 
  which is interesting in it 's own right . 
  too complicated . 
  i have no idea where android , microsoft , tesla , mcdonalds etc are located inside the us . 
  and while i know many in the us think trump & co are retarded they still elected him . 
  thanks i will do . 
  and i will still eat burgers when i fancy it . 
  yes i like and use many american products myself . 
  i just prefer sending my money elsewhere until they start behaving like decent people . 
  they as in the us government . 
  i know many people in the us are good people . 
  never heard of ubuntu touch . 
  but googled ( siq ) and it 's unfortunately shut down : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ubuntu_touch, 
  excellent - now we are getting somewhere . 
  missing those usb-c ports though . 
  thank you . 
  but i want a colour screen . 
  i do n't feel good giving my money to bullies . 
  and it 's just for me . 
  i will not stop you enjoying us products . 
  it just does not feel right for me personally . 
  archos looks good but they seem to be running android . 
  medion keeps redirecting me to a tech-service page . 
  i will definately look at jolla phones when i break the glass of my current phone . 
  probably wo n't be that long ... do you use jolla ? 
  does it have an app store or similar ? 
  any major apps you are missing ? 
  their phones look good !, 
  are bq phones running their own os ? 
  or android ? 
  i could not find info on ther website . 
  i already have a chinese phone running android . 
  it 's android i would like to ditch - not the phone itself . 
  but i will definately look at bq when i break the glass of my current phone !, 
  yes and i will . 
  they make decent tech and electric cars . 
  the nissan note looks good . 
  thank you - jolla is news for me . 
  i did not know nokia were still around - it was my lame attemt of a joke . 
  netflix - i know that it will be hard to find a good alternative . 
  reddit - i tend to forget my passwords and create a new account .

4000 signatures . 
  i think you have to be 18 years old . 
  can confirm ... 
  pretty much every norwegian also feel rich when going to any other country , while feeling poor at home . 
  after living in fl and ca for almost 3 years , this sounds legit . 
  although none of those stereotypes are really that negative . 
  i doubt you could find that manye europeans who can name and place all the us states on a map really . 
  same shit , but it is more convenient as the us in one country . 
  also , i like guns and hate commies as well . 
  the difference of left and right on the political scale of the us compared to the european is very scewed though . 
  haven \u00b4 t seen a check in 15 years ... 
  plastic all the way . 
  i gre up in norway , stayed for 3 years in the us . 
  also , norway is not a member and i am not a fan of the eu . 
  frankly i feel more american than european . 
  does it say european in your passport ? 
  great . 
  a new eurostasi military force . 
  i feel safer already ... 
  i \u00b4 d rather see the uk dissolved . 
  kamel\u00e5s\u00e5 ... 
  temp-jobs , aka almost-unemployed ... 
  i 'm curious if there has been any realting to roma in norway . 
  the norwegian governments solution to everything seem to be throwing money on the issues , not realizing the unwillingness of the rome to comply with social norms . 
  in practice , yes . 
  in principle , no . 
  22nd of july commemoration , meaning , the election has started . 
  expect to see a lot of politicians who try to divert the attention as to how bad for the country the right wing is going to be . 
  do you guys in romania hear a lot about your fellow countrymen who goes of to more wealthy countries to beg ( gypsies ) ? 
  not trying to start a flame war on the issue , i 'm just wondering wether it is getting any attention . 
  i would recommend you to buy som norwegian childrens books online . 
  seriously . 
  i did this with spanish . 
  where are you going ? 
  ok , i suppose i would have recognized them when you put it in front of me that clearly , but then i \u00b4 m not from romania and i think i would have mistaken some for being indian ( which they kind of are ) . 
  point taken , but do we ( you ) really wan na see the eu as the new ( old , lol ) usa ? 
  with a few at the top ? 
  i really hate typing this , and i probably wouldn \u00b4 t a month ago , but many small droplets make a big river as they say . 
  no matter the details really . 
  we all see the trends world wide . 
  less freedom , more government , more restrictions everywhere you look . 
  if romas would like to attend school , get an education and move away from that `` culture '' of theirs , no one can see that they are roma based on skin colour alone , so the claim of racism is absurd . 
  they are trying to wait out the whole situation , untill all palestinians have been forced away over time . 
  the jews see their history as spanning 5000 years . 
  another 100-150 does n't mean crap . 
  upvoted , and pretty much exactly how i feel . 
  i have nothing but distrust towards politicians in our ruling parties ( coalition ) . 
  i think we will see in our lifetime a federal eu with a narrow circle of friends among the elites . 
  then that 1 % is 100 eur , pretty much on the cent . 
  i \u00b4 d rather spend that on two sixpacks of overpriced norwegian beer . 
  financial statistics reveal solid budget surpluses existed in 1960-73 for the greek general government , but since then only budget deficits were recorded . 
  in 1974-80 the general government had an era with moderate and acceptable budget deficits ( below 3 % of gdp ) . 
  unfortunately this was followed by a long period with very high and unsustainable budget deficits in 1981-2014 ( above 3 % of gdp ) . 
  so ... 75 % voted yes , but the answer is no . 
  what was the point of voting ? 
  when did the national debt start growing to unacceptable levels ? 
  when did greece enter the eu ? 
  * cough * cheap loans from the eu from the get-go * cough * . 
  sure , the financial crisis triggered the whole ordeal , but a house of cards is already fragile , so you can \u00b4 t really blame the wind , you blame the construction . 
  i didn \u00b4 t wan na go to that party anyway , 
  close ramstein , the most important transit hub for the american military in europe . 
  for those of you who say `` hey , what about nato , you can \u00b4 t just do that ! '' . 
  i think we have established by now how the americans see europe . 
  yeah , i don \u00b4 t pay 36 % tax for it to be given away to a far off country . 
  if i wanted that , i \u00b4 d do it myself , and i do , a few times a year to the red cross etc. 
  bailouts , aka pissing you pants to keep warm . 
  sure i would lend to my friends , but i would not lend to the guy 4 blocks away that i have never spoken to . . 
  not at all really . 
  we are not in the eu , and i don \u00b4 t speak german , french , dutch , italian , spanish or any other language than norwegian ( and arguably swedish and danish ) and english . 
  giving away our national product , so the greek can get out of a mess they created themselves . 
  why ? 
  giving away national sovereignty to brussels , when we are more than capable of sorting out our own shit ? 
  i consider myself more swedish than european , and certainly more * nordic * . 
  this , but change icelandic with norwegian  * brofist *, 
  so what ? 
  i don \u00b4 t know who the enemy is anymore :(, 
  these days ? 
  what is the deal on protecting superstition in modern times ? 
  at least old pagan custom/mythology has some fun aspects to them . 
  don \u00b4 t come here . 
  way too expensive ... 
  what do you mean ? 
  pagan customs are as a whole much cooler than christianity , like the pestilence it is ... 
  not us . 
  not yet ... i \u00b4 m expecting it in the future though ... 
  we had that in the 70s and 80s as well , when every able bodied male had an ag3-rifle in their bedroom closet . 
  nowadays we have a ban on pistol grips on hunting rifles and shotguns , as if that makes a difference except on looks . 
  they put down a ban on .50 caliber handguns a few years ago because if could fire through the bullet-proof vests of the police . 
  however , a .44 magnum or .460 does that as well , and they are still legal . 
  i just want the law to make sense . 
  high purchasing power , but gun laws are too tight . 
  and this is how it should be . 
  simply because that is what the people of switzerland wants . 
  would you rather have a bureaucrat deciding it for you ? 
  conscripts are expensive , but i \u00b4 d argue that they make you a better , more mature person once you are done . 
  things like you said , first aid , how to properly dress for different climates , gun safety , ethics and dicipline can \u00b4 t , in my opinion , be measured in money , but will reward the country as a whole over time . 
  i disagree . 
  opinion during ww1 was to arm the public , which meant mandatory shooting in school . 
  this is the reason what there are a krag j\u00f8rgensen guttekarabin in every third gun locker among gun owners in norway . 
  with conscription we get an average of people from every walks of life , while with a professional standing army we would attract many rambos and gun-fanatics .

  the top comment 's reply says so , anyway . 
  does n't sound that ridiculous that they did n't have roads now that i see where it is, 
  `` do n't matter '' and `` do n't matter to everyday life of some individuals '' are very different . 
  you could go through your whole life just by getting through school with a passing grade , and then doing a job which is just menial tasks , so very little is actually relevant to daily life . 
  you do n't have to know the names of ukraine or russia to understand the situation either , but it gives some pretty important information . 
  maybe the biggest news story in the world the last few weeks have been about ukraine and it 's borders/placement , so it says something about americans watching the news and stuff . 
  youth unemployment in sweden is quite high actually . 
  and let 's not pretend roma people * want * jobs . 
  thanks !, 
  does everyone here know russian or is there another reason a translation has n't been posted yet ? 
  iirc it came from a newspaper called the world or something similar , and was n't actually called so because it was a world championship , but i think they should change it now though . 
  i downvoted because of `` the people are the same race and share the same history and culture . 
  '' , you should n't express things like that as facts , when they are not . 
  you can just admit you meant `` white/aryan '' , it 's okay . 
  why ? 
  if i copy wikipedia here and say `` and that is my opinion '' , will you read it ? 
  there were smaller kings having smaller lands , then they united more land until one king had norway , and one had sweden , they then waged war ( or other political stuff ) without one taking the other ( or they did , and then they split up again ) , and until norway finally conquers sweden we will remain separate . 
   the people are the same race and share the same history and culture . 
  human races are completely made up , we are all the same race . 
  and we do n't share * the * same history and culture , but we have a lot in common . 
  it would really be easier if you just read through the two wikipedia articles , you will probably figure out why . 
  you do n't get the obligatory neighbour-points from sweden ? 
   except you invited hundreds of thousands of refugees into europe without consensus . 
  into their own sovereign territory . 
  would you be satisfied if we split up germany and gave control to other countries ? 
  i heard that worked great last time . 
  good thing you came and made sure we could n't have at least one thread without bringing in the refugees . 
   i do n't even class them as human . 
  classifying a human as non-human is textbook racism . 
  if a biological human can be non-human then there must be races to the human species , and since it 's proved there 's only one race believing there are several is racist . 
  racism is n't always the simple stuff like `` black people are bad '' . 
  then you should also lock up anyone who steals , and keep them locked until they can prove that they are rehabilitated . 
   unless you can show me some very compelling evidence that said person has be rehabilitated you 're better off keeping them in jail . 
  i think you 've got it backwards , it 's not `` guilty until proven innocent '' . 
  that was 70 years ago . 
  lots of people are given help instead of being put in jail now , because they commited crimes while their brain chemistry was out of order . 
   but where did i mention anything about his race ? 
    i do n't even class them as human . 
  he is a biological human , you classified him as a non-human . 
  by doing that you claim there are layers or races of humans , which is racist . 
  and by classing some biological humans as non-human he created races of human , and it was therefore racist . 
  racism is n't just the kindergarden level `` black people are bad '' . 
  classing some biological humans as non-human is textbook racism . 
  do you also go around mocking defense lawyers ? 
  several of the usual passengers are probably criminals too , so they should really stop permanently . 
  80 million citizens . 
  source ? 
  where * are * we ? 
  of the 12 million refugees , 8 million are still in syria . 
  and i do n't recall anyone but the military staying in destroyed cities in ww2 , the rebuilding happened after the war when people came back . 
  20 is soldiers are at your door , they have guns , you have a shovel , do you stay to defend your house and protect the people inside , or do you flee out the back door with your family ? 
  you must be fucking retarded if you think staying in syria is a good idea for anyone but high-ranking military officials . 
  i 'm willing to bet you ca n't even place syria on a map , let alone know who 's fighting each other . 
  germans understand english , these guys probably do n't understand german . 
   even those not in danger are now going to come here . 
  you lack understanding and empathy with refugees . 
  people do not want to leave their home country where they have spent their whole life , only for the possible oppurtunity of a wage raise , especially not when trying to reach that oppurtunity has already killed a few thousand people this year . 
  they want a safe place to stay . 
  and in this current world rich equals safe . 
  since they are `` safe '' there you could say everyone who flees for more than 100km away from active is militants are just `` economic refugees '' . 
  the same ottoman empire that you split up and divided up countries from ? 
  good thing you clarified that the fascist football clubs do n't welcome refugees , i was confused . 
  no shit people on the left of politics act like they 're on the left . 
  when 40 % of people vote for a party here i do n't go telling everyone `` they 're just voting for them because they politically align with them , they do not represent the view of all citizens '' . 
   because we all agreed to and then decided to write it down toghether the un is not an entity outside the realm of earth , it is a collection of countries . 
  belgium could exit the un and not uphold any of its agreements if they wanted to . 
  russia is already doing that , giving away free land in remote siberia to anyone who promises to live there . 
  the problem is nobody 's living there for a reason . 
  the community center let them speak there on the condition that it was sexually segregated . 
  listening to politicians in a private house is no right , that example is in no way `` submitting to migrant 's wants '' yeah , it speaks to that they think diversity and immigration are strengths . 
  they wo n't admit it , because that 's not why they 're doing it . 
  if they were politicans without morals/values they would just change to the most popular party , or have the most popular opinions , not import people who will potentionally vote for them in 4-7 years . 
  foreigners legally living somewhere in that country for 5 years can soon vote in local elections , that you 're sensationalising it speaks for itself . 
  would you say the politicians against immigration are just having that stance because it would give the other party more votes ? 
  then you could make the exact reasoning about anti-immigration parties . 
  they 're just doing it not to lose votes , they do n't care about what 's good for their own society . 
  do you have an internal memo or something where you can prove that the reason for their stance on immigration is because immigrants tend to vote for them ? 
  going to need proof of that , proof of intent specifically . 
  yes , these people refuse to recognice german values and culture and should be expelled from society unless they adapt .

  do you honestly think some politicians want more immigration because immigrants tend to vote for the party they 're in , and not because allowing those immigrants in happens to coincide with their political views ?

  northern norwegians have a reputation for being relatively warm and friendly .

  also , what do you mean by lying ? 
  defamation ( libel/slander ) is illegal pretty much everywhere , but the definition of what exactly counts as it is n't set in stone . 
  holocaust denial is mostly a matter of opinion , skepticism and ignorance . 
  even when there is absolute proof that a statement made by a holocaust denier is false you ca n't always prove malicious intent . 
  basically , you ca n't really prove that they are lying with malicious intent and at the same time harming the reputation of an individual , business , product , group , government , religion , or nation . 
  that 's why laws specifically about denying the holocaust were made . 
  they were n't already covered by previous laws in the country in question , so they made new ones . 
  holocaust denial is legal in the vast majority of the world . 
  why should the laws of some european countries and israel apply to an american website ? 
  let them have their views and their subreddit to contain them . 
  i do n't think simply having an unpopular opinion should be illegal , no matter how absurd or hateful . 
  one thing the us does right , in my opinion , is free speech . 
  it 's a standard i hope my own country and the rest of the world would strive towards . 
  and before anyone replies with `` reddit is a private website , free speech does n't apply to them !, 
  '' , i know that . 
  reddit has been rather adamant about not removing things that are hateful and at the same time clearly legal in the united states , so i think it 's safe to say that your suggestion will probably be denied or ignored . 
  good meme :\\ ^ \\ ), 
  what the fuck did you just fucking say about me , you little cyka ? 
  it definitely should be legal ( and it is already in norway ) , in my opinion . 
  people should have the right to voice their opinions no matter how controversial and unpopular they may be , as long as they are n't threatening or actually inciting violence etc. 
  i think the american model of free speech is something all countries should strive toward . 
  for tax purposes .

  hey man , i 'm not disagreeing with you regarding whether or not there should be equal physical requirements . 
  at least i disproved two of your three assumptions , i guess . 
  norway , denmark , finland , estonia , switzerland , austria , belarus , greece , moldova , ukraine , and russia are the only european countries with some kind of conscription . 
  edit : cyprus too, 
  i do know that the period is equally long for both genders , and as far as hair length goes it really does depend on which part of the military you are in , but it is recommended to keep it short anyway . 
  in the end nobody can force you to cut your hair short ( you have to wear a hair net if you have too long hair regardless of gender if you do n't want to cut it ) . 
  when it comes to physical requirements , again it does depend on where in the military you 're trying to get into , and the requirements are basically that you 're in good shape . 
  for example , a requirement is being able to run 3000m in 15 minutes for females and 14 minutes for males . 
  you might think this is unfair , but percentage-wise women have more trouble beating their requirement than men . 
  norway has male and female conscription . 
  in fact , it 's the only european and nato country that has it . 
  you have literally the same jokes as us , just reversed .

  what this subreddit needs is some moderation . 
  let 's face it , the problem is that it 's small enough where a concerted effort by just a small group of people can change the entire look of it . 
  if the moderators are content to let this slowly turn into r/ministormfront , then by all means . 
  but i tend to think that it 's worth saving . 
  i like the majority of content on it , and every now and then we 'll have some incredibly refreshing discussions . 
  but every time i see posts that are blatantly racist on the front page my urge to browse / r/europe diminishes . 
  90 % of the time if you check the other posts of the people in question ( like the one the op talks about ) , you 'll notice a pattern of racism . 
  many do n't even attempt to hide it . 
  and this is where you explain why they 're wrong and what is correct , or your post is pointless and will be downvoted . 
  it 's making me less and less likely to read the subreddit . 
  which is a shame , since it does have some good content quite often . 
  somehow , the fact that a white supremacist psychopath murdered over seventy people , most of them teenagers , most of them white , has led you to the conclusion that * he had a point * . 
  you do n't have a clue . 
  a `` whole '' * 13 * percent of the population has immigrant background , and over half of those are from europe . 
  norway is one of the most homogeneous countries in europe . 
  but i would n't expect you to base your twisted and dangerous delusions on actual facts . 
  i 'm actually disgusted with myself for even taking the time to correct you . 
  go read a book . 
  heres the op 's last contribution to this subreddit : http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/10xcza/when_white_flight_is_no_longer_possible_due/  i started to think what would happen after the non-white immigrants have nowhere to go anymore . 
  i presume there will be blood on streets after ethnic tensions flame up . 
  maybe as early as 2020 countries like britain and france will be in de facto civil war if things continue like this . 
  you should try to make your blatant fascism less blatant . 
  also , piss off . 
  the fact that this reached the front page of / r/europe is shocking . 
  subreddits usually turn bad when they get too big , but i think this one is probably too small at this point . 
  which is why , if you look back through history , afghanistan has always been independent , right ? 
  well , no . 
  it has been invaded and conquered plenty of times . 
  alexander the great did it . 
  you say he could n't hold it , but he did hold it . 
  until he died , at which point it split from his empire , as did every other piece of his conquests . 
  and then it was claimed by one of his generals , seleucus . 
  later it was part of the murayan empire , parthian empire , sassanid empire , etc. 
  it 's also missing some norwegian ones . 
  obviously there are breweries to the north as well . 
  the irony is that the reason we did so well is that when we found the oil and gas we knew we * didnt * have a clue how to exploit it , so we hired people who did , instead of selling the fields themselves for a quick buck . 
  pretty cool video . 
  i wish it had started a bit earlier , though . 
  from the fall of the western roman empire , perhaps . 
  as an added bonus , we 'd have gotten to see all the viking conquests . 
  i think it took quite a few liberties with the holy roman empire though , particularly the early one . 
  it was never a country in the way that france or england or poland were countries . 
  that is shown better in the later parts of it , where it shows the fracturing . 
  but really , it was always more or less like that . 
  you could say that about almost any country at almost any point in history , really . 
  the ottomans made their success happen . 
  not surprising , really , since this is made by some eu affiliation . 
  still , we 're pretty much like sweden , except more mountains and a little bit more north . 
  your username references stupid questions . 
  your question was stupid . 
  it 's not that complicated . 
  this is britain . 
  it could be anywhere . 
  i wonder if they realize how transparent they are . 
  this wo n't do anything to convince anyone but those who are already convinced . 
  have we really reached this point ? 
  a * fjordman * article on the front page of r/europe ? 
  he 's a fascist and a xenophobe . 
  he 's also one of anders behring breivik 's greatest inspirations , and has argued for ethnic cleansing . 
  shocking . 
  first of all , denmark did n't * colonize * norway . 
  there were n't really any actual danes here . 
  secondly , bokm\u00e5l is hardly `` basically danish '' . 
  it 's definitely influenced by it , but considering it 's almost the same as the `` not basically danish '' language , the difference was n't that big to begin with . 
  there 's been a real influx of this kind of submission to / r/europe lately , which have gotten to the front page . 
  i hope we 're not going to turn into that kind of subreddit , that would be very sad . 
  we might be small enough for * some people * to hijack it . 
  was that survey on vg.no or dagbladet.no ? 
  it 's a well known phenomenon that those polls are almost always biased in favour of the right-wing position ( which in this case would be the resignation of the prime minister ) . 
  if so , the number is probably even higher . 
  if it was an actual survey , ignore me . 
  like i said , the norwegian royal family comes from 1905 , when we literally invited a danish prince to be our king . 
  and for me , the fact that some had to `` fight '' for it does n't change anything . 
  after all , we 're not more sympathetic to dictators just because they had to arrange a military coup to get there . 
  there are three cities in england that are larger than oslo . 
  london , birmingham and leeds . 
  so it 's not really that tiny . 
  this is a main point for someone , and it 's one i can definitely see some merit in . 
  but for me , the inherent unjustness of an unelected monarchy outweighs those concerns . 
  i 'm not saying it would be * easy * . 
  i 'm just saying it would be preferable , and i have no doubts we would make it work after a short uncertain period . 
  the flip-side of your argument is , what if we are n't so lucky ? 
  we 've been fairly lucky now , and you could probably argue that our current crown prince will do an okay job , but we can never be sure . 
  should we wait until we get a bad one , and then have a very public forced dissolution of the monarchy ? 
  personally , i think it would be better if this was well planned and organized . 
  i think the current crown prince could probably be persuaded to step down on his own , if that 's what he thinks the people want ( which a majority probably does n't right now ) . 
  i see your point , but i think that would just compound the problem that other people have mentioned about that person not being neutral . 
  we might say we want someone objective and neutral now , but when it comes to voting for someone there * would * be a campaign , and most people would rather have someone sympathetic to their world view in charge for life than risk having someone antagonistic . 
  sure , you could say that then you could just `` vote him out '' , but then you essentially have a normal democratically elected head of state anyway . 
  i suppose i could see a head of state office that does n't have term limits . 
  it should be feasible particularly considering the currently most important office , the prime minister , does n't even have any term limits . 
  we had one guy as prime minister for over 17 years . 
  he was doing such a good job , why would we arbitrarily decide he could n't have the job any longer ? 
  i 'm a fairly left-wing norwegian , so using the `` other people are rich without doing anything '' argument does n't work . 
  as far as i see it , this is just closing up another loop-hole . 
  this is one * less * undeserved superwealthy family , and one that is more undeserved than the rest . 
  i respect that opinion , but it 's not one i share .

  there 's plenty implied . 
  the important word is `` implied '' which is kind of irreconcilable with `` literally '' . 
   7 % of our gdp is lost on it every year so we can safely say that it is untenable thanks . 
  please do n't drag numbers out of your ass like that to try to give your prejudice a patina of political respectability . 
  calculating the expense and generation of values to a country by ethnic groups are inherently impossible , and if you were to invent the statistical methods to do this , 7 % would be an insane number . 
  you 're saying swedish immigration costs more than the * entire public health service * ? 
  nobody can take that seriously . 
    real politicians get power by offering better solutions  how amazing then that people who say `` let 's cut the intake '' grow their voterbase then . 
  no , it 's not amazing . 
  racism and divide-and-conquer works . 
  and you 're a useful idiot to them . 
    not by pitting groups against each other . 
   which implying the opposition and it 's voters are literal nazis does n't at all of course . 
  well , fucking obviously not . 
  it 's a criticism of a political ideology and that 's well within the confines of democracy . 
  you know , democracy , that concept right-wing people pretend to like so they can paint muslims as a threat to it ? 
   i love how you cop the holier-than-thou attitude when your anti-immigration party are in your actual ruling government right now as well . 
  what about the way i 've been arguing would make you think i 'd ever vote for the breivik party ? 
   my decision has no bearing on other peoples decision or more importantly the actual election yes , but ... well , how to put this : you 're not special . 
  an election is n't a person coming to your house and asking you how you 'd prefer the country was run . 
  it 's a statistical process to ascertain who has the consent of the people to govern . 
  that is a macro-scale operation , not an individual-scale one . 
   in fact the evidence is that voting is harmful . 
  politicians vie for your vote by making outrageous promises , voting encourages that and they try to outdo each other with their retarded populism . 
  and you know why that works ? 
  because retarded populists vote like no other demographic group . 
  nothing gets people to the ballot box like dunning-kruger . 
  meanwhile , you 're saying you 're not buying into the populism , but you 're not voting . 
  so when you 're saying :  count me out . 
  you 're doing that to yourself . 
  and you 're letting the populists who you claim to dislike , vote for you . 
  `` literally a vote for hitler '' - because if you ca n't attack what people are saying , always go for what you 'd like to * pretend * they 're saying . 
  what a fantastic strategy . 
  the claim that there is `` untenable mass immigration '' is fairly meaningless . 
  there is immigration . 
  there has always been emigration and immigration . 
  people with initiative and drive go where opportunities are , and if people are heading your way that 's actually a fairly good sign . 
  the idea of people of different ethnicities washing over europe like a tsunami is a paranoid delusion with no small similarity to the propaganda of the nazis . 
  real politicians get power by offering better solutions , not by pitting groups against each other . 
  divide and conquer is a parasitic strategy , which nobody but the power-mongers win out on . 
  a single individual vote is unlikely to turn a representative seat . 
  but that is irrelevant . 
  a society consists of nothing but lots of individuals . 
  and when individuals at large decide their vote does n't matter , people who think differently begin to take over . 
  they have no higher motivations or greater knowledge than you , but they vote and so they have the power . 
  when you cast your vote , you contribute your marginal influence to an election . 
  that 's all you 've got , but on a macro scale it 's vastly preferable to zero influence . 
  and what aspect ( s ) of the social , moral and political collapse of our entire continent resulting in the deaths of millions of innocent people do you believe is * not * supposed to frighten ? 
  l'chaim , asshole . 
  i should think it 's a fairly obvious and mathematically uncontroversial statement that without multiple ones , there would be no million . 
  i wonder if part of the reason why the number for norway is so low because our climate tends to make us insulate our housing . 
  i lived next to a big shunting yard growing up . 
  the whole night was filled with screeching train brakes . 
  when we switched to double-glazed windows , it took months before i was able to sleep with them closed . 
   few countries can boast about the luxuries norway has . 
  a small , relatively homogeneous country supplemented by vast oil wealth is n't the best comparison to use in terms of pay . 
  the importance of oil to the strength of the norwegian economy is overstated . 
  we had n't paid off the debts we incurred to exploit the resources until 1983 - we were hardly a developing country before that . 
  besides , an oil-fuelled economy can be tremendously difficult to control , or prepare for the inevitable end of oil reserves . 
  our economic strengths primarily come from social democracy and strong national unions which give established democratic negotiation structures between capital and labour , with the state as mediators ; the `` three-party cooperation '' . 
  the really telling word there is `` cooperation '' ; laws have stringent definitions of what constitutes a legal strike - it allows the unions to retain their chief leverage , while ensuring capitalists could trust that their investments would n't suddenly stop giving dividends because of a wildcat strike . 
  krone for krone , our greater participation of women in the workplace generates more wealth than our oil . 
  these are the results of strong governmental participation in helping people lead a fulfilling life - great investment in high-quality public education , and paid maternal leave and subsidized kindergarten which helps families by enabling both members of the family to have full-time jobs . 
  and it also includes a social safety net which means that no citizen ( barring a heroin habit ) will ever find themselves having to live in the streets , and no child grows up with any opportunity robbed from them by their parents ' circumstances . 
   only switzerland has triple the us minimum wage . 
  hell germany does n't even have one . 
  most countries with the highest minimum wages in reality , have no single all-encompassing minimum wage set by law . 
  in its place , vitally , there are other , stronger , legal protections for labour - which are far healthier both for workers and for the whole economy . 
  the nordic model includes a three-party negotiation between the chamber of commerce and the national union based on the `` battlefront model '' ; wages in export-oriented sectors lag wages in domestic sectors . 
  it keeps exports competitive , and ensures that wages are set by negotiations informed by the economic situation . 
  there is no minimum wage job in norway , but you 're going to have a hard time finding a legal job paying an adult less than $ 25 . 
  even correcting for purchasing power , that 's a living wage in a way that $ 7 ai n't . 
   that city used to be the mecca of hippies , and is now filled with burned out drug addicts . 
  in addition , it still has this lore as a liberal utopia for some reason , and teen runaways and various transients congregate in san francisco . 
  i spoke to a homeless shelter and they said it was due to the climate . 
  neither portland nor san francisco gets cold enough to freeze off limbs , so people end up gravitating towards those places . 
  but what 's your point , they deserve to be homeless because they 're hippies ? 
   and the locals i talked to seemed fine with all the transients and bums in their city there are two different things one can `` be fine '' or take issue with . 
  one is the economic conditions and lack of safety net which leads to people being forced to live on the street . 
  the other problem is that this despondency is visible . 
  unfortunately , in my city of oslo , the homelessness among immigrants from eastern europe primarily confronted as a visibility problem . 
  which side of this are you objecting to ? 
  upon further research i realize i 've used the term `` pandemic '' imprecisely , because that seems to describe geographical distribution and not concentration . 
  so , sorry about that . 
  but still , ** of course a full percent is a totally unacceptable proportion ** of children to be malnutritioned in a rich nation . 
  pasadena and san francisco . 
  the local grocery store in pasadena had like five people living behind it . 
  outside my hostel in sf it was like a fucking shanty town . 
   where europeans get the idea that there is systemic , `` extreme poverty '' in the us a mystery to me . 
  i visited the us when i was about 15 and did some spelunking . 
  the scale of homelessness was horrifying . 
  i ca n't find another word for it . 
  and although they were never in extreme poverty , my working-class family in the us have to struggle for what i can take for granted in norway , and * should * be able to take for granted - health care , high-quality education and a guaranteed minimum of dignity . 
  i mean - these are children having their opportunities in life stifled simply because their parents do n't have the money to get them a good education . 
  it is fundamentally immoral , and so incredibly wasteful of human capital , the most vital asset any nation has . 
  my visit to the united states is a big part of what got me thinking about politics and eventually ended up as a social democrat . 
  btw , i do n't want to come off as whiney eurotrash here . 
  i love the united states , i worship the principles it was founded on , i have never found a more gregarious , funny , charming bunch of people than in the us . 
  but the way that country ruthlessly stacks the odds against its weakest is inhumane . 
   our income equality is not `` ridiculous . '',

  think of it as a marketing consultant . 
  pretty much on par with avoiding product names that are offensive in different languages . 
  sounds lkke modern day italian politics . 
  do as the guy says or things grid to a halt , no matter who is actually elected to power ... 
  norwegian polticians are hell bent on being the `` teachers favorite '' on international matters . 
  not surprising , as that lands them positions of prestige later on ... 
  i think it mostly learns by what is found online in multiple languages , so i am not that surprised about the technical angle of the translations . 
  seems my memory of the image was more faded than i expected . 
  btw , this is fdr . 
  and most likely consider themselves british . 
  i find myself reminded that before ww2 gendered clothing did n't really happen until somewhere around school age . 
  i think there is a famous example of this related to a us president . 
  the earliest photo of him is as a toddler , dressed in what may best be described as a genderless white robe ( tho for most today it will come across as feminine ) . 
  the duration has a interesting history . 
  i think the uk one was at the outset around 20 years , but it focused squarely at the economic side . 
  authors and such had very little say in how their creations were used outside of the economic gains . 
  the long duration comes from france , where they as much considered the authors social standing . 
  thus making a long duration that allowed a author to nix the use of his creation in any way he did n't like ( like for instance glorifying a politician he did n't support ) . 
  the french take on the issue is the one that gained traction around europe even before the bern convention that unified copyright across europe ( and eventually the world ) . 
  one funny tidbit btw , usa did n't sign on to the bern convention until the 1980s . 
  and i suspect said signing coincide with the us government taking a more aggressive stance regarding enforcing us ip rights abroad . 
  but by doing so it becomes pretty much ubiquitous . 
  i think the issue is more moral and slippery slope than technical . 
  drm , while seeming like a money grab by big media , can down the line turn into a government-corporate censorship scheme . 
  various entities both in north america and europe have tried to used intellectual property laws as censorship already . 
  and we all to often see videos vanish from youtube over some ip claim , videos that are more than dancing babies with a radio in the background . 
  and it is in a sense the perfect vehicle for this , as most will ignore the topic of ip unless they hear about someone getting slapped by a lawsuit for a absurd amount of damages for putting a file on a server . 
  in other words , for most it is seen as a dry and boring legalese between large corporations . 
  would you consider it censorship if a book was withdrawn from circulation for ip reasons ? 
  even if the book was politically controversial ? 
  skjold almost did n't happen . 
  it took years before a contract for more than the original proof of concept materialized . 
  i wonder if only the experience of contracting frigates in spain ( it was a mess ) got the ball rolling again . 
  dunno , seems your leaders will do just about anything to keep the black stuff flowing into usa . 
  and with good reason , as the gas pump price seems quite capable of making or breaking a presidency . 
  honestly , i more expect american carriers to suddenly show up off the coast to `` defend american interests '' if ever there is a real supply drop from the middle east . 
  the russians have no interest in coming after us as we ca n't out-sell them on the european market anyways . 
  that would be the professional side of the norwegian military . 
  it is however just a small part of the whole . 
  a future that may never happen , as at least two generations of politicians have been going on about `` the future '' ... 
  this while municipalities are doing accounting loop the loops to make their budgets line up . 
  stuff like closing down local schools and sending kids by half-hour to hour by buss each day , because transport costs come out of the budget of the administrative tier between them and the national government . 
  more like when a lucky government has a visit from a iraqi . 
  and while we may have dodged the worst of it , the economy is still borderline dutch disease . 
  and sadly , the worry is largely misplaced . 
  the conditions for the weimar inflation was very specific . 
  national debt ( war reparations ) denominated in foreign currency , a devastated industry with little to no export capacity . 
  end result was that to pay the debt , money was printed , exchanged for foreign currency , exchange rate drops like a rock , next installment requires even more printing to get the same amount of foreign currency . 
  it has reached the point where `` photo or it did n't happen '' is a worthless demand . 
  even video is likely to go the same direction eventually ... 
  great enterprises ? 
  now why does that sound so familiar ... oh yes ... https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_power_of_nightmares in particular the interpretation of leo strauss ' thinking that underpins the neo-conservatives . 
  reminds me of some claims from the 94 winter olympics , where foreign athletes were surprised to be cheered on by norwegians . 
   also some of the depleted gas reservoirs are used for storage : buy cheap gas in the summer , pump it back in the underground reservoir , and get it to the consumers in the winter . 
  this is just as important as the pipelines themselves . 
  there was one hell of a racket some years back when norwegian hydro plants had to crank up the price during winter because it had rained less than expected during autumn . 
  this because they had run the reserves low exporting power during the summer ( ac and whatsnot down south ) . 
  the particular language may be obsolete , but the primary value will be a basic understand of code logic ( if the education is done right ) . 
  this in comparison to how most courses in office suits , or similar , are pretty much rote memorization of where the various menu options are . 
  resulting in people being fish out of water if they need to switch tools . 
  and code logic can show up in the strangest of places these days ( most high end software tools allow some degree of scripting for instance ) . 
  and i hazard a guess that a lot of time and teeth gnashing comes from leaders not understanding how to frame a task in a way that is translatable to code . 
  seems to be a connection between economic performance and sense of `` belonging '' . 
  would drawing parallels to the us situation before the civil war be too much ? 
  cider alongside beer in the store shelves , beyond that i ca n't think of any ... 
  a very important distinction . 
  investors are in for the long run , 5-10 + years . 
  but present day finance is overrun with day trader mentality . 
  hell , high frequency trading is the pinnacle of short turnaround arbitrage . 
  heh , norway in second place . 
  and even so a south korean company sold of its holdings here and implied norwegians were lazy . 
  work smart hours , not long hours ... 
  depends on how willing the company is about letting a potential new competitor onto the market ... 
  from one extreme to another ? 
  given that another nation seems hell bent on recrating the slow trainwreck that was the late roman empire , thats optimism ... 
  looks like it . 
  lovely response from the titan int . 
  ceo ... 
  yep , but very little of the bank created money goes to that these days . 
  huh ? 
  banks pretty much create the money they lend out by an accounting notation ... 
  pretty much the same in norway as well . 
  household debt and house prices have moved in virtual lock step since the early 90s ( a increase of nearly 400 % last i checked ) , while the cost to build have remained in line with wage increases . 
  i find that very few `` free marketers '' are really that . 
  they are just after cheaper goods and services elsewhere , but protections for their own slice of the economy . 
  or one for 2001-2007 and one for 2007-2012 . 
  ugh , i really have a off day when it comes to reading comprehension ... 
  while there may be a correlation , the question still remains if it is the gdp or the debt that leads ... 
  never mind , caffeine deficiency ... 
  indeed . 
  most stock trading happens on the secondary market , and the company that issued said stock rarely see anything of the profits made there . 
  century of self ? 
  there is the other wsy round as well . 
  watch what went down when gorbachev tried to reform ussr . 
  all of a sudden he was under house arrest by hardliners within the government . 
  i 'll take that over superficially charming any days ... 
  europe 's old couple out for a stroll ... 
   norway - n\u00f8gne \u00d8 dark horizon first edition , 99.95 til ... 
  not sure if the constitution ever covered foreigners ... 
  like i needed any more reasons not to visit ...

they will leave voluntarily if smug leftists like you get your will anyway . 
  i dont save comments or take notes . 
  point is , this sub is far from being a / pol / clone . 
  libya turned out great compared to syria . 
  assad is not an option . 
  this sub has pretty diverse opinions . 
  rabid left wingers will get downvoted , but so will radical right wingers as well . 
  many countries have very different dialects that can be hard for people from different parts of the country to understand . 
  anyway , i get it , germany and austra are two different countries . 
  it 's not good . 
  assad 's a piece of shit dictator . 
  he 's allied with hezbollah and iran . 
  russia also attacks fsa more than it attacks isis . 
  russia also vetoed the no fly zone over syria that could have ended the war years ago ... fuck russia . 
  is n't austrian very close to bavarian ? 
  germans surely undestood what their austrian leader said during his 12 year reign . 
  they only dislike we because it tries to push their failed multi-culti experiment on them . 
  latvia and estonia both have large russian minorities . 
  russia is definitely a threat to these countries . 
  since when is anglo racially offensive ? 
  yeah , that 's true . 
  i guess its a bit like scandinavian countries . 
  having more than 0 children is basically a crime in germany . 
  they all desperately want their own people to die out because of the six gorillion . 
  `` conservative '', 
  you used to be part of germany for a while . 
  you also speak german . 
  less immigration might come of it , and thats a good thing imo . 
  i 'm pretty sure thousands of immigrants sexually assaulting women egged those attacks on . 
  not politicians . 
  i still think the risk of getting beaten up because you have dark skin is pretty low in western europe . 
  being anti-immigration rarely means you go around beating up any dark skinned person you see . 
  please dont talk about europe like it 's a singular homogenous blob . 
  i doubt that had much of an impact . 
  refueling a nuclear reactor is a complicated and expensive task . 
  i doubt the price of uranium ore matters much , considering they can go 20 years or so without refueling . 
  it 's definitely a problem but it doesnt prove you right . 
  what do you wan na do about this anyway ? 
  dismantle the eu ? 
  i agree with his point . 
  i do n't agree with his condescending attitude and naive worldview . 
  got any evidence for this happening ? 
  how exactly does germany leech business ? 
  the uk was barely hit at all after the 1940 blitz . 
  the damage done was close to nothing compared to what germany received . 
  the damage done in 1940 was probably repaired before the war ended . 
  that lack of competition should have benefitted the uk the most . 
  your industry was intact . 
  germany had to rebuild their country like all its neighbors . 
  how exactly did post war germany benefit from destruction of industry in neighboring countries ? 
  their own industry received massive damage as well , not the mention the division of the country . 
  i dont think the difference in natural resources between germany and the uk is that big either . 
   it has proven to be unable to resist murdering its neighbors for the past like 1500 years . 
  with the exception of the brief american administered interregnum of the late 20th/early 21st century . 
  thats real easy for you to say as you have an entire continent for yourself with no real opposition other than slave owners and a few natives . 
  please go elsewhere with your american exceptionalist bullshit . 
  the uk also got way more marshall funding than germany ... almost three times more if i recall correctly . 
  germany was also destroyed to a much larger extent than the uk . 
  add the loss of 7.3 million people and being torn in half for 45 years . 
  not to mention all their best engineers and scientists . 
  you 're just butthurt because you cant compete with german ingenuity , 
  did mommy deny you milk today ? 
  because brown people are the new oppressed victims now . 
  pin reality , what really kicked off the reconstruction was the end of the horrible policies from the occupants . 
  deutsch . 
  why did you say that anyway ? 
  they were only starving because you destroyed it . 
  just a small detail to remember . 
  also , the marshall plan was essentially insignificant . 
  maybe not for the uk , but it did n't matter much for germany . 
  what 's a duetsch ? 
  beats italian pizza 10/10 times every time . 
  you think most men would be ok with that ? 
  especially men from the middle east ? 
  i really do n't think so . 
  women in the middle east have very low labour force participation . 
  those would n't be legitimate arguments . 
  a legitimitate argument would be that abortion is taking a human life . 
  but it clearly was n't functioning ... 
  they were having a civil war . 
  just like assads regime . 
  it 's not functional or stabile if civil wars happen . 
  there are legitimate arguments against abortions . 
  a few nutcases do n't discredit all people opposed to abortion . 
  i do n't think `` it happens anyway '' is a good argument to make something legal . 
  i forgot the / s. 
  good post though , people in this thread should read these stats . 
  you said they dont care about improving conditions for pregnant women . 
  i assumed you meant things like healthcare and financial support . 
  i think you were saying that because prolife conservatives do n't want to give much support to single mothers with children born out of wedlock they care only about controlling the womans body and not the child . 
  being against government welfare and high taxes does n't mean you think it 's ok to kill people ( pro lifers consider abortion murder ) . 
  no religion comes close to islams violent fundamentalism . 
  most religions are bad , but there is a distinction to be made . 
   controlling womens ' uteruses are you talking about abortion ? 
  anti-abortionists put the right for the fetus to live above the womans right to bodily autonomy . 
  it 's not about `` controlling uteruses '' . 
  99.99 % of muslims are freedom loving liberals . 
  get out of here with your islamophobia . 
  do you have any evidence it was pre planned ? 
  also , if places were revolts failed were invaded how come nato did n't invade libya or syria ?

  duck is '' * and * '' in the scandinavian languages , apparently it 's '' * eend * '' in dutch . 
  sk\u00e5l means `` saucer '' today [ in norwegian ] ; and people used to drink their tea/coffee using the * saucer * !, 
  now , that 's a serious burn . 
  too bad they lost their longest word '' * rindfleischetikettierungsueberwachungsaufgabenuebertragungsgesetz * '' or law delegating beef label monitoring . 
  now , it 's just '' * donaudampfschifffahrtsgesellschaftskapitaenswitwe * '' meaning widow of a danube steamboat company captain . 
  i suppose you guys have the same words ? 
  - for ( for/to ) - f\u00f3r ( went [ away ] ) - f\u00f2r ( furrow ) - f\u00f4r ( fodder ), 
  damn , i was looking for that one , could n't find it . 
  i 'll steal and translate it , okay ? 
  in some norwegian dialects you can build minimalist sentences : '' \u00e6 e i a \u00e6 \u00e5 '' - i 'm in place-called-a , me too '' \u00e5 \u00e6 e s\u00e5 gla i d\u00e6 '' - and i 'm so fond of you '' \u00e6 e tr\u00f8nder \u00e6 '' - i 'm a person from tr\u00f8ndelag, 
  yeah , fair enough , he did rent . 
  he was an older man though and married etc. 
  when i think about it was the hotel 's restaurant . 
  romania 's new tourist slogan ? 
   you could moor your own boat close by . 
  sold . 
  i 'll buy one , 
  i remember talking with a waiter at some restaurant about the cost of living . 
  i was amazed at the low wages , the cost of commuting alone is pretty steep , right ? 
  was n't there something about the police cracking down on free riders a few years back ? 
  i 've seen some really nice apartments in the city center though . 
   a former farm ... after selling the agricultural land ... and rebuilt it myself sounds like a great deal !, 
  okay , i see , thanks . 
  it does n't look too different from the generic tower blocks from the 50-70s in my opinion . 
  those balconies are common here on both high-rises and apartment blocks . 
  oh , i 've been thinking about visiting romania  my company has outsourced some work to a partner there . 
  my parents went there on holiday once , before i was born , during the ceau\u0219escu era . 
  they said it was weird , but nice . 
  how does it compare with gdansk ? 
  i hear polish people in the border area are buying property in germany rather than poland due to the prices . 
   do you live in oslo ? 
  i can imagine it 's very pricey there . 
  oslo is very pricey . 
  it 's ranked among the most expensive cities in the world . 
  there are a number of reasons ; high construction costs due to salaries and technical requirements , local regulation against high-rises , limited expansion due to protected forest zone , commuter traffic problems , 72.000 students at various colleges , european and extra-european immigration . 
  other cities in norway can be equally expensive , especially in the `` oil capital '' of stavanger . 
  our second city , bergen , is squeezed in between mountains and fjords . 
  outside of oslo however you can get pretty nice houses for $ 300k : - [ horten ] ( http://finncdn.no/mmo/2015/8/vertical-2/14/5/628/963/95_610629242_xl.jpg ) ( [ ad ] ( http://www.finn.no/finn/realestate/homes/object?finnkode=62896395&amp;searchclickthrough=true ) ) - [ hof ] ( http://finncdn.no/mmo/2015/8/vertical-2/14/2/629/910/42_944818617_xl.jpg ) ( [ ad ] ( http://www.finn.no/finn/realestate/homes/object?finnkode=62991042&amp;searchclickthrough=true ) ) - [ vestfossen ] ( http://finncdn.no/mmo/2015/8/vertical-2/15/1/599/233/31_1126313755_xl.jpg ) ( [ ad ] ( http://www.finn.no/finn/realestate/homes/object?finnkode=62991042&amp;searchclickthrough=true ) ), 
  hmm , i should look for a holiday property ... 
   scandinavians left scandinavia because it was so cold and dark nah , we just paid for a one-way ticket for the poorest and landless people to go away  we like the cold and dark . 
  yeah , i get that , but it 's not just that . 
  we have different preferences and building styles . 
  hmm , then again maybe i just do n't like cities in general . 
  those are some pretty neat properties . 
  i think we 've firmly established that all major cities anywhere are expensive , but major tourist destinations like prague even more so , 
  now , i really get why brits emigrate to nz/au . 
  the properties were just fine , but by comparison with flats in and around london ? 
  at least it had a sauna !, 
  also , could it possibly be more uniformly nordic in its design ?!, 
  probably just * one * member of parliament ? 
  what 's neat about that building in your opinion ? 
  needs some work though . 
  i 'm surprised it 's that expensive , but they were nice looking places . 
  yeah , but outside of oslo there 's much more for that price , i 'll copy my reply here : outside of oslo you can get pretty nice houses for that : - [ horten ] ( http://finncdn.no/mmo/2015/8/vertical-2/14/5/628/963/95_610629242_xl.jpg ) ( [ ad ] ( http://www.finn.no/finn/realestate/homes/object?finnkode=62896395&amp;searchclickthrough=true ) ) - [ hof ] ( http://finncdn.no/mmo/2015/8/vertical-2/14/2/629/910/42_944818617_xl.jpg ) ( [ ad ] ( http://www.finn.no/finn/realestate/homes/object?finnkode=62991042&amp;searchclickthrough=true ) ) - [ vestfossen ] ( http://finncdn.no/mmo/2015/8/vertical-2/15/1/599/233/31_1126313755_xl.jpg ) ( [ ad ] ( http://www.finn.no/finn/realestate/homes/object?finnkode=62991042&amp;searchclickthrough=true ) ), 
   they have 40y of mortgage . 
  most people in my country have mortgages , but we 've introduced laws so you must have at least 15 % in cash . 
  young people ca n't buy anything without help from their parents or savings . 
  it 's that cheap still ? 
  it 's a very nice city and area . 
  at first it was really depressing to browse , but i found [ one ] ( http://www.daft.ie/sales/6-camac-view-kilmainham-lane-kilmainham-dublin/1057808/ ) or [ two ] ( http://www.daft.ie/sales/218-castleforbes-sq-block-e-ifsc-dublin/1054813/ ) okay apartments . 
  i 've been to dublin a few times , it 's a nice city , but it seems so murky . 
  frankly , i do n't like the cramped and depressing look of irish and british houses , but i 'm born in fjord country so i 'm used to open spaces and white picket fences . 
   you 'd be surprised how often people confuse the two . 
  is it mostly a problem when talking with brits , europeans or people in general ? 
  outside of oslo you can get pretty nice houses for that : - [ horten ] ( http://finncdn.no/mmo/2015/8/vertical-2/14/5/628/963/95_610629242_xl.jpg ) ( [ ad ] ( http://www.finn.no/finn/realestate/homes/object?finnkode=62896395&amp;searchclickthrough=true ) ) - [ hof ] ( http://finncdn.no/mmo/2015/8/vertical-2/14/2/629/910/42_944818617_xl.jpg ) ( [ ad ] ( http://www.finn.no/finn/realestate/homes/object?finnkode=62991042&amp;searchclickthrough=true ) ) - [ vestfossen ] ( http://finncdn.no/mmo/2015/8/vertical-2/15/1/599/233/31_1126313755_xl.jpg ) ( [ ad ] ( http://www.finn.no/finn/realestate/homes/object?finnkode=62991042&amp;searchclickthrough=true ) ), 
   the boycotting of jews returns to europe hyperbole much ? 
  as a long-time fan of m , his music is religious or at least inspired by it . 
  his songs include `` happy hanukkah '' , `` jerusalem '' , `` king without a crown '' ... 
  yes , very sneaky , but also legal i suspect . 
  the fact that we have that kind of distance between the people and its `` representatives '' in this technological age is baffling !, 
  if the swiss can manage with a direct democracy , i do n't see why the rest of us ca n't . 
   we might annoy the greeks sometimes . 
  for nostalgia 's sake . 
  haha , so honest and true . 
  the greeks do it as well i guess ? 
  the nordic council is even older and still exists . 
  we have a passport union , a former currency union , an attempted defense pact , etc. 
  we would be around the world 's 10th largest economy combined . 
  the idea to reunite has been raised in scandinavian media . 
  actually it was tried before that with [ the nordic council ] ( http://www.wikiwand.com/en/nordisk_vision ) . 
  we did achieve some coherence , but we ended up split over nato and russia during the cold war . 
  we have an existing passport union and had a working currency union already !, 
  we could still make it a work today , we 're all still members and have expanded to the baltics . 
  we would be something like the world 's 10th largest economy i believe . 
  the suggestion to reinvigorate it has been raised in public media lately . 
   it got you all to stop fighting . 
  it 's so important to remember this , it 's why we gave the nobel peace prize to the eu !, 
  yes , that 's the eu in a nutshell . 
  it does n't get enough power to do anything , and all of the members continue arguing . 
  it 's like the us without a real federal government , the states have all the power . 
  there are so many valid arguments for the existing members to keep the status quo : - the power balance , turkey would be a significant player - the income inequality , european unemployment and labor markets - the borders with iraq and syria ( illegal immigration and conflicts ) . 
  turkey 's already a major route . 
  i believe that 's a very valid point . 
  you 're talking about referendums * while * you were a member though ? 
   we speak english ... and * spanish * you 're in for a surprise !, 
  interestingly , `` hull '' means hole in norwegian ... 
   bah , we fired the polish workers it 's not actually a joke . .  my lil ' rumpeslikker !, 
  i wonder if you know the exact meaning ? 
  `` brown-nosing '' , does n't really fit with this context . 
  well , unless you 're an asshole ?

  * shhh . . not so loud !, 
  seems like staying outside the eu even improves your baby-making-skills !, 
  who would have guessed . . 
  we are even good at making babies . 
  the blue map looks friendlier . . 
  of course . 
  of course . 
  what is so bad ? 
  ( i know there is a lot of corruption and bad driving . . but that is about it . . ), 
  what country is that ? 
  i live on the southern tip of norway - that is also where lots of people go on holiday . 
  still not considered southern europe . 
  do they see it the same way ? 
  i hate it when someone is not showing their flare . . how on earth am i supposed to know what you mean without it ? 
  ( stomps my foot on the ground and shakes my fist in the air ) , 
   that means lot s of people end up working off the books because that 's what the employer wants . 
  over here that would make the employer end up it a lot of trouble ... 
  i find it interesting that you feel better off in the us . 
  i guess that means it 's really bad in italy at the moment . . 
  i 'm used to unions having lots of power , so both working conditions and salaries are for the most part good . 
  and any company mistreating their employees will quickly end up in the newspapers , and get lots of bad publicity . 
  so it seems . 
  are things changing now though ? 
  or is the government willing to receive new wave of immigrants ? 
  really ? 
  here it 's very common . 
  many students work part time throughout their studies . 
  the ones that do n't usually have a summer job every summer . 
   also lots of people are working off the books . 
  here that is rare , especially if it 's a full-time job . 
  so you are from the south as well then . . 
  i will have to pay more attention then i guess . 
  in most cases norwegian is required . 
  but you can find a few jobs in the oil industry where english is sufficient . 
   a system forged by a mentality in which meritocracy does not exist what do you mean by that ? 
   what is expensive is everything else , like public transportation ( my father spends for me 170 euros every month ) , food ( at least 10 euros every day if you want to drink water , 5 per day if you can live without drinking all day like i do ) , books ( this year 2nd/3rd hand books costed my father 400 euros and a place to sleep and have a shower ( and not to study because too small/noisy ) costs about 150 euros/month if shared with 4 people . 
  your transportation is in fact more expensive than most students here pay . 
  some stats i found say that a student in norway spend 8 $ per day on food . 
  rent is cheaper there though . 
  most students in norway work at least some on the side when studying , and the rest is covered by student loans . 
  some are helped by their parents , but lack of money is rarely a reason for not studying , as everybody get student loans . 
  greece is definitely [ european ] ( http://www.worldatlas.com/img/areamap/99be850226b20c6a0eea486d1a61b391.gif ) . . 
  and they do n't produce similar cheese ? 
  someone could make lots of money here starting to produce finish cheese in russia ... 
   and people are just moodier and less sociable in winter . 
  that is true . 
  norwegians definitely become more introvert in the winter , and more outgoing in the summer . . 
  it 's here . 
  i 've observed several fights already . 
  also interesting to see in which nations it had little or no effect . 
  says the person not even identifying where they are from ... 
  definitely [ asia ] ( http://www.nationsonline.org/maps/countries_europe_map.jpg ) . 
  exactly . 
  if you ca n't go to the beach anyways ( because of the 50cm of snow covering it ) you can just as well work or study . 
   that said , most friends go on to study something useful , and then continue to be productive members of norwegian society ;-p . we do n't mind . . , 
  depends on where you live . 
  up here 35 % of people age 20-24 are studying . 
  [ source ] ( https://www.ssb.no/utdanning/statistikker/utuvh ), 
  that 's a pity . 
  education is rarely wasted . 
  and considering how many italians still live at home at that age you would think the parents had some influence on that ? 
  or maybe that is the problem , that them still living at home makes it less urgent to study or get a job ? 
  would be interesting to see more detailed stats on this in italy . . 
   studying often costs too much for the family and not everyone is born to study engineering . 
  that answered my original question . 
  up here education is free , so there is really no excuse not to study . 
  if engineering is not your thing you can always study something else instead . 
  true , but your english needs to still be very good . 
  i 've met spanish people in norway that neither speaks norwegian , nor english . 
  then your chance of getting a job is close to zero . . 
  but ff it 's easy , why are more than 20 % of them not working ( neither studying ) ? 
  i believe estonia would might have been considered north if it was n't for the fact that you were under russia for a while . 
  but if it 's a consultation you definitely have the nicest capital of europe . 
  no no no , this is wrong . 
  we see norway , iceland , sweden , finland and denmark as north . 
  every time . 
  ( what is the line going from the uk to africa i wonder . . ? ), 
  i actually never see russia as europe , so i can relate . . 
  i have n't even seen a single russian in this sub . . 
  we do n't see that divide at all . . we feel sometimes more related to denmark than sweden . 
  ( might have to do with language , and the fact that half of us spend the summer in denmark ) . 
  but danes are probably considered slightly more approachable than the colder norwegians ( although we are always super friendly once you get to know us . .  ), 
  interesting that you consider denmark as `` south '' . 
  i strongly doubt most scandinavians view finland as eastern europe . . 
  sure . 
  but you need to bring lots of money to be able to live here while looking for work and learning the language . . 
  i doubt the 20-24 year old 's in question are able to do that without assistance . 
  to get norway to agree to do this though would be a challenge . 
  sweden and germany on the other hand . . 
  i would move east a bit more west , and make finland purely north . 
  otherwise - i completely agree . 
  well done . 
  i like that the north is blue . . 
  seems fitting , as it was 16 degrees celsius when we got up this morning - indoors . 
  do n't worry , the rest of us northerners view you as a purely northern country . 
  i 've never seen finland as eastern europe . 
  you are definitely north . 
  but i can see why someone all the way on the west-side might make that mistake though . . 
  i 'm surprised about italy , as it means that fewer people there in that age group are studying . 
  is it because education is expensive there ?

  i was thinking that a suicide rate could rise when quality of life increases in a way that prevents other deaths . 
  as in , people do n't die from accidents or war before they are able to commit suicide . 
  pakistan is even higher on that list than turkey . 
  maybe gender roles and secular/european culture have less to do with this than you are thinking ? 
  [ wikipedia list of countries by suicide rate ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_suicide_rate ) turkey has a higher rate overall than greece or italy or uk .

  i went to sundbyberg on business a few months ago and walked downtown only to find a group of people around a store and police questioning people .

  because they are quoting the police ? 
  how disturbingly prophetic for today . 
  the first source says they did look at women , also about 20 % . 
  it also says that the percentage of non-westerner convictions has risen in the past few years . 
  but it does n't say what the crimes were or their frequency , recidivism , etc. 
  unless i read it wrong . 
  that 's a good point . 
  going by the `` ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure '' idea , i think you can safely extrapolate disproportionate punishment to disproportionate prevention . 
  the question becomes to what extent , and i do n't have a good answer to that . 
  i suppose it would come out of experience . 
  i do n't think it 's circular ; it is a similar reasoning to hate crime laws . 
  i see what you mean , but i 'd argue that since the intent creates a disproportionately different effect , psychologically , and socially , between an accident and a wilful crime , it requires a disproportionate response rather than one just based on the absolute number of casualties . 
  i think that is the approach the law usually takes anyway . 
  there are many reasons behind it , but killing people is the desired result . 
  they could issue threats , warnings , sabotage , vandalism , thievery , burglary , non-lethal violence , rapes , etc. , all of which cause fear and change in behaviour . 
  hell , if they were just religious they could threaten fire and brimstone in the afterlife for infidels and do nothing else actively . 
  the fact is they want to kill , out of hate or revenge or stupidity or self-pity or religious direction . 
  somebody in saudi arabia probably profits , i guess . 
  i 'm pretty sure terrorism exists because terrorists want to kill people . 
  cars do n't want to kill people .

  no , women have a problem with womanterpreting everything as misogyny .

  yes , that is what i was implying , that real refugees are relieved and grateful to be alive - they are not shopping around for a ` better life ' .

  the sort of `` life imitates art '' style of postmodernism sounds more similar to the sort of hegelian idealism that feuerbach and marx opposed . 
  materialism vs. idealism . 
  then again , consistency does n't seem to be a feature of postmodernism , a postmodernist can probably call themself whatever they want . 
  i know what you mean , but `` cultural marxism '' is such a bullshit term , though .

  it 's `` tri '' in my dialect to , but i must admit i often say `` tre '' , even though i 'm sure the person i 'm speaking to would understand . 
  it 's almost impossible for me to imagine that people do not understand `` tri '' and `` adle '' with context and everything . 
  makes me a little embarrassed , but i 'm sure it 's true . 
  correct !, 
  i 'm from ringebu . 
  the difference between the ringebu dialect and the neighboring one to the south - \u00d8yer - is 1st person plural , which is `` vi '' there . 
  the difference to the north ( s\u00f8r-fron ) is the masculine 3rd person singular , which there would be h\u00e6nn ( though this form is somewhat used where i 'm from too ) . 
  where are you from , and what words did people find difficult ? 
   does your language have recognizable dialects ? 
  yes . 
  the country is divided into four main dialectal areas ( eastern , western , tr\u00f8ndersk , northern ) , and each of the areas consist of numerous different dialects , often changing every few kms . 
  i can most often pin-point someone down to + - 10 km in the area i 'm from . 
   are they still used widely or kind of declining ? 
  like any other place the dialects are getting more similar , but dialect use is encouraged in literally any setting and people are generally proud of their dialects . 
   how large can be the difference between the standard language and local dialects ? 
  understanding other dialects should n't be difficult for a native speaker who wants to understand , but this is largely because everyone is disposed to other dialects a lot . 
   do you speak a special regional variety of your country 's language ?

  i remember the morning obama was elected , back in 2008 . 
  my mother cried because she was so happy . 
  nowadays she can barely stand watching the news . 
  well , that settles it . 
    but consider the term `` standard \u00f8stnorsk ''  which does n't exist weird , given https://no.wikipedia.org/wiki/standard_%c3%b8stnorsk . 
  really interesting for a language spoken in such a vast area . 
  in many parts of norway you can literally hear which village or town a person is from , and i suspect it is the same in several other european countries . 
  i used to prefer whatever made the taste milder , i.e. , anything with milk etc. 
  in it . 
  but after i starting drinking daily , i drink it black , like i believe most other daily drinkers here . 
  i see . 
  i chose to start studying instead of going to the military when i was done with videreg\u00e5ende . 
  probably would have chose differently today . 
  i agree . 
  there are no pronunciation rules for norwegian , and dialect use is heavily encouraged in nearly all situations ( the only exception i can think of is nrk 's news ? 
  you plan to study at ntnu ? 
  sure , i know that . 
  but consider the term `` standard \u00f8stnorsk '' and the fact that such a dialect is used by one or two million people , and it makes sense at least to mention it . 
  we seldom talk about accents in norwegian , we talk about dialects . 
  if there is a standard one it is the one known from the oslo area , which is very similar to written bokm\u00e5l . 
  i agree with the liberals ( venstre ) when it comes to quite a few issues , but as long as they will continue supporting progress ( fremskrittspartiet ) and the conservatives ( h\u00f8yre ) , voting for them is out of the question . 
  so i 'm not sure , maybe labour ( arbeiderpartiet ) ? 
  everything north of trondheim is east of arendal .

   the expectation is to get them out of poverty and ensure they have a sustenance .

  sure , you can give people money and make it look good on paper , but that does n't necessarily mean it 's sustainable long term . 
  well , it would n't be the case if mainstream parties properly addressed people 's concerns about immigration , rather than giving vague answers and then proceed not to change anything about the immigration policies at all . 
  why federalism ? 
  the idea strikes me as a political dogma from the 20s , especially since writing such as the `` ventotene manifesto '' and `` praktischer idealismus '' somehow still has its relevancy , and if the end goal of federalism is as described in either piece of writing , i ca n't say that i 'm fond of the idea . 
  i 'm generally pro-eu , pro-integration , pro-common armed forces , and a single market , but i think the goal of the eu should be freedom of self-determination for the nations within , rather than hyper-egalitarianism . 
  i 'm saying that i prefer cultural homogeneity and stability rather than multiculturalism , not that we should n't help refugees . 
  yes , of course ^ ^ / s, 
  y' know , i really do n't agree with bannon , and i detest the guy based on what i 've read about him , but i would n't want to self-determinate norway into an overly multicultural society just as a `` fuck you '' either . 
   polls for hillary were right : she did win the popular vote , but she did n't win them in the right states ( and state-by-state i think the only surprise was pennsylvania , the rest were either called right or ended within the margin of error ) do n't you think polling and statistics companies operating within the us take the electoral college into account ? . 
  as far as i know , the methodology of the polling companies is to survey different constituencies in different states and use projected amount of delegates as the basis for their prediction rather than using the popular vote as a measurement . 
  that 's why it was a shock for many of the pollsters that trump actually won . 
   `` it is isolation that would destroy us , it would lead us towards degenerating in inbreeding , '' the finance minister argued . 
  `` for us , muslims in germany are an enrichment of our openness and our diversity . 
  look at the third generation of turks , especially the women . 
  that is an enormous innovation potential . '' i think the rhetoric is quite odd , even within the context . 
   sch\u00e4uble had made a remark in june that if europe were to isolate itself , this would cause europe to degenerate into inbreeding . 
  right , the sentinelese have lived on an island for thousands of years with a population in the hundreds , yet they 've somehow managed to survive , but europe , with a vast array of different ethnicities would degenerate into inbreeding ? 
  really makes you think ... 
  i ca n't wait until someone finds a naturally occurring nepalese flag or the flag of mozambique for that matter . 
   saying fuck israhell they should be thrown in the sea it 's antisemitic . 
  that does n't really strike me as anti-semitic . 
  there are lots of people who hate israel for different reasons without being anti-semitic , leftists in norway tend to hate the country of israel and claim that it 's an illegal occupation etc. 
  but i doubt anyone of them hates judaism . 
  anti-semitism is when you hate a jew just because he 's jewish . 
  all the nordics are doing fairly well , ^ ^ ^ ^ then ^ ^ ^ ^ there ^ ^ ^ ^ is ^ ^ ^ ^ iceland . 
   this is the exact rhetoric that i was talking about . 
  why do you think the us was trying to make france a puppet state ? 
  i doubt that 's the case , but since the creation of nato , it has mostly been used to do america 's bidding and as a tool to enhance their jingoism , whether just or unjust . 
  what did europe gain from `` the war on terror '' or the bombing of libya ? 
  oh yeah , an elevated terror threat and a refugee crisis amongst other things . 
  eh , jakubinmarian notoriously has flawed statistics . 
  if you 're remotely interested in correct data you should check [ oecd ] ( http://www.oecd.org/health/obesity-update-2014.pdf ) instead . 
   people can genuinely believe a lot of things that have nothing to do with the objective reality , especially so in such post-factual , emotional times . 
  that applies to both sides of the political spectum . 
  the objective reality is that immigration will change the political landscapes of europe one way or another and if you think differently you 're the post-factual one . 
  after all , most people tend to vote in their self-interest or in the interests of their group , and if the current trends in migration do n't change , there will be a time where said groups * will * reach critical mass , and people would be in for a rude , exsistential awakening . 
  i do n't really see that happening though , since people will increasingly vote far-right parties if the current political establisment does n't properly adress the concerns about immigration , and far-right parties are n't known for liking the eu very much , so not only is the question exsistental , it 's also a question about the integrity of the eu and wether it shoud dismantle itself or not . 
  brexit and trump were the symptoms , and if nothing changes , more is to come , believe me . 
   he was a symbol back in the days and quite important person in commie part of the world . 
  goes to show what a twisted ideology it is . 
  forcing conscientious objectors , homosexuals , religious people , and anyone deemed `` anti-socials '' by the government into labor camps and notoriously suppressing people 's freedom of expression as well as executing political and suspected political dissidents while denying people of basic human rights ? 
  and yet he 's hailed as a `` great revolutionary '' by leftists in the west , who at the same time claims to be the champions of democracy and freedom of expression . 
  that said , i 'm not implying that the batista-regime were any better , but castro still was a shitty leader . 
  what ? 
  i 'm not saying that they 're not pushing an agenda ; of course they are , but what they 're doing is not illegal . 
  essentially they 're only utilizing the freedom of expression we 're fortunate enough to have . 
  but if you know something about the shady inner workings of the journalistic underworld i do n't , please , do tell . 
  it 's not like breitbart would be the only foreign paper with an agenda in france , take huffpo for instance , they 'll probably vehemently advocate against a le pen presidency , and i 've yet to hear people cry about that and that they 're allowed to have a voice in the discussion . 
  edit : and it 's not like the american executives of breitbart will proofread whatever the journalists decide to write . 
  what they will do is to hire french writers and journalists that have similar views and a similar vision to that of the magazine and give them an arena to express themselves on . 
  edgy . 
  high-fructose clorinated corn syrup sawdust chicken cheese, 
   you mean , the us put the rubble back together . 
  the us planned , financed , and supplied the power-war reconstruction in europe and japan . 
  it was american expertise that converted war-torn countries into successful , capitalist economies . 
  access to the us market and us financing was responsible for most of immediate postwar growth in europe and japan . 
  while that is true ( and believe me , i 'm happy it panned out the way it did ) , you 're fooling yourself if you think the us did what they did for altruistic reasons . 
  it was a power grab , no doubt about that and a way for the us to solidify their position in the world at the time . 
  consequently , wwii was the event that altered the american foreign policy from isolationism to interventionism . 
  and while the us is not perfect , i 'll agree with the sentiment that what the us did in japan and europe probably was the best course of action , after all , we 've had an unprecedented period of peace and and progress , much thanks to the framework the us facilitated post-wwii . 
  however , that does not mean that the us should n't be subjected to critique where it 's due . 
  i 'd say that metal festivals have a more seasoned and slightly older crowd compared to your average edm/pop festival , and a metal festival definitely feels more close-knit , at least in my experience .

   the idea that a `` wave of immigrants '' will engulf your country at any moment is just tabloid fear mongering propaganda . 
  i do n't recall saying , nor implying that i have such a fear . 
  if a `` wave of immigration '' engulfs my country , so be it , but i 'd rather prefer it not to happen . 
  depends on how you view trade honestly , what the guy you responded to said is n't the reason though . 
  if you view human labor as a commodity ( i.e goods and services ) , free trade ca n't exist without freedom of movement as it would restrict workers from offering their services to potential employers and the other way around , essentially it would restrict the market . 
  if you do n't , free trade can exist without free movement as long as people have the ability to offer their products to potential buyers in a competitive market setting . 
  i 'm prone to agreeing with the latter as unrestricted immigration tend to lead to more negatives than positives . 
  why not both ? 
   the misery and chaos of the world outside the eu is brought to us via internet , tv and the refugees on a daily basis , yet european nationalists are incapable of understanding the obvious . 
  nationalists dislike the eu exactly * because * many of them feel like they 're moving the chaos of the outside world into their nation-states . 
  also , the eu , as a unified nation , really could n't do much to resolve any military conflict anyways except for sending angry letters and voting in the un security council to send peacekeeping forces . 
  overarching interventionism went out of style after ww2 . 
  this might be a hard pill to swallow but if we were to suddenly distribute wealth evenly it would cause calamity rather than making people rich . 
  the inflation caused by liquidating tons of assets would alone make people not-so-rich anymore right away , furthermore , i do n't think most people are capable of handling large amounts of money responsibly .

  with the refugee crisis and the terrorist attacks as of late people definitely has become more wary of muslims and immigration has become a bigger part of the political discourse . 
  i fall on the side of the spectrum where i think limiting immigration is good and i do n't really mind the overton window moving rightwards on that matter in particular , but there are people out there who use the the terrorist attacks as a justification to judge muslims as a group and not as individuals , which i think is bad . 
  nothing beats well made indian food for me . 
   biological arguments are stupid . 
  right , biology permeates and determinate the behaviors of every living creature , but somehow we 're the exception to the rule ? 
  sure , arguments such as `` women should stay at home because x '' are stupid , but biology can be used to explain the disparity between men and women in fields such as engineering or nursing and those arguments does have some merit in my opinion . 
  and we take biological arguments for granted when it come so to physically taxing labour .

  i study in a city fairly close to the swedish border and as a consequence , i 've been crossing the border whenever i need to buy anything . 
  including , but not limited to alcohol , groceries , clothing , dental care , glasses , kitchenware/cutlery etc. 
  and i 've probably saved thousands of euros over the course of my studies doing so . 
  furthermore , swedish grocery stores have about 3x the selection compared to their norwegian counterpart and at this point , whenever i do my shopping in norway it feels like i 'm being ripped off .

  there are different flavors of internationalism . 
  and right now eu is seen as the latter of my examples by both left and right . 
  left wingers have , on the other hand , been about the former kind of internationalism . 
  i think the difference is about border vs blood . 
  left wingers define nationality by border . 
  right wingers by blood . 
  there is a difference between `` lets try to learn to live with our differences and cooperate '' and `` bow down for your international masters ! '',

  the difference , and likely why him and breivik got such different treatment , is the amount of planning that went into it all . 
  breivik did n't just up and knife some random apers . 
  he constructed and detonated a bomb against the government , and bought weapons specifically for the shooting he was going to perform . 
  that suggest premeditation way beyond a emotional outburst . 
  high concentration of potential targets in a enclosed space : busses , trains , airplanes . 
  beyond that i do n't think there is anything deeper than mentally unstable people lashing out . 
  it used to be that the line rent was a non-issue as the local supplier had a monopoly . 
  but with the creation of a national grid , any supplier could sell to any user nationally . 
  but the local lines are still the property of the local supplier . 
  and so the line rent entry was created to cover maintenance ( and provide an alternate profit source ) . 
  and here i thought norway was alone in this . 
  hoover 's fbi ? 
  brain fried . 
  ca n't form coherent response . 
  they may well have . 
  there have been various big market swings right before major political uphevals , as if someone was trading on foreknowledge . 
  as we can see with the across the board introduction of national healthcare systems . 
  `` dc said no , so there never was any wiretapping '' . 
  this is a carpet thinking it is a lion ... 
  no longer ? 
  pretty much been that way since the 60s ... 
  communist , capitalist , same shit . 
  because the boys on top are all authoritarians . 
   ca n't claim to be on the side of free speech while monitoring almost everything !!, 
  you are free to say it , but do not be surprised if you get arrested for saying it ... 
  he pretty much lived and died by his blackberry during his campaign . 
  afterwards the nsa through a hissy fit about it not being secure enough , and produced what looked like a modified palm treo . 
  modified in that a extra button would switch it into a secure mode used for government communications . 
  the software patent issue is pretty much a us thing . 
  it started with a production process that was in part controlled by a computer program to maintain the proper temperature . 
  from there it has snowballed into all kind of processes that can be done or maintained via software . 
  in comparison , the bruhaha between apple and samsung in germany was about trade dress . 
  usually trademarks deal with company and product names . 
  but with trade dress this moves on to design elements . 
  lines , curves , how users go about doing stuff . 
  there seems to be a couple of black sheep/crows right below the drones ... 
  the right most column is the interesting one . 
  while we have the highest price , we are second only to luxemburg in how many liters we can afford on a average wage . 
  thing is that for the untrained eye a ram cache and a memory leak is one and the same ( lot of ram assigned to the same process ) . 
  a year or so back mozilla radically altered how firefox handles assigned but not in use ram . 
  before it used to hold on to it until told by the os to give free it up , now it more aggressively frees it up when no longer in use . 
  strangely those conditions should in theory have turned norway blue as well . 
  the verge did n't go into detail , but i suspect we are looking at something similar to the nasa system . 
  meaning a plasma arc melting the metal filament in a vacuum . 
  i hate the monkey part of my brain right now . 
  sorry , its been years and i did n't really look into the details . 
  best i can recall was that there was serious issues with sorting trafficking victims from legal prostitutes for some reason . 
  i guess it is somewhat similar to exploitative contracts in the building industry , but cranked to 11 as the girls are forced to work rather there on shitty contracts . 
  sorry , brain fart . 
  the actual traffickers . 
  sure , you can grab the pimps . 
  but much like with drug , you really want the people supplying the `` products '' . 
  the extra problem is that the girls may have every incentive to lie . 
  even if they are not strictly doing anything illegal , they may not be where they are legally allowed to be . 
  but to be sent back may be for them a even worse faith . 
  and you ca n't really allow them to stay , as that may lead to others claiming to be victims just to have a chance at staying . 
  revive growth my foot . 
  revive `` lend lend lend '' more like it ... 
  likely makes the job of finding the suppliers a pain . 
  seem to recall a documentary claiming the same about the netherlands . 
  figures why someone that can be argued to be the richest norwegian has taken up residence there ... 
  given what the big us banks do with commodities futures , i 'm not sure i would want to let that beast have a go at housing ... http://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2013/07/how-goldman-made-5-billion-by-manipulating-aluminum-inventories-and-copper-is-up-next.html one example , and i suspect the article has links to more such . 
  shit 's been building up across western europe since polticians in general adopted neolib economics and deregulated various markets , housing included . 
  the idea : competition would bring prices down , availability up , and save the government a pretty bundle . 
  actual outcome : a mortgage bubble of epic proportions . 
  one that everyone is trying to avoid pricking , as it will effectively deadlock the national economy . 
  what a nations population used to be called . 
  now they go by `` consumer '' ...

  people did n't care about the consequenses for breaking the union , and most people ( on both sides ) anticipated war lots of people here were severly disapointed there was n't a war , actually, 
  we pronounce it like : hahvai, 
  1905 the reckless pursuit of freedom is sort of inspiring though the most interesting is probably the civil war era, 
  i get a perception that many of those questions involve the americans wording in a stupid way , that even seems like they know is stupid , and that they already somewhat know the answer to their questions , but they ask anyway on the other hand , the downvoting trend that baffles me is that any question about travel advice seems to get downvoted, 
  nope, 
  i do n't , but my mother has travelled there many times and spoken a bit about it apparantly the sami do n't hold ( all of the ) similar cultural values , though that 's not neccesarily a bad thing . 
  like , one example is that norwegians tend to hold pride in having a well-kept house , while the sami kinda do n't give a shit about that there is much tension between the norwegians up there and the sami it seems . 
  alcoholism and violence at least used to be pretty prevalent among the sami apparantly , but like , not organised towards norwegians or anything . 
  and apparantly most of the norwegians that live near samis are actually very racist towards them . 
  `` you ca n't trust those people '' and so forth . 
  but a thing to note is that forceful `` assimilation '' , norwegification and erasure of culture , and i think even some meassure of eugenics programmes , was official public policy i think a fair bit into the 1980 's also just one thing i 'd like to note is that reindeer herding is not a traditional sami way of life . 
  their traditional lifestyle was to hunt wild reindeer , but in the face of `` colonisation '' , they had to change their ways of life, 
  yes we do also , japan at least are doing better than us , so your zinger is stupid, 
  surely the basques were n't subject to eugenics programs, 
  a more apt comparison for the sami are the native americans, 
  fuck our exports, 
  we should leave like yesterday, 
  yea  also , why would you choose such a thing over marriage ? 
  marriage is just that plus an expensive ceremony, 
  fuck no, 
  the local city square is called `` the turf '' officially , not just colloquially [ sic ], 
  it 's all rip-offs of foreign stuff , unfourtunately, 
  solidox and colgate are the only two brands i 've ever seen, 
  it came from people , like any other language that there is n't any other language that 's very similar to it , does n't mean there 's anything special to its origin, 
  my least favourite thing is the highrise construction my most favourite thing is that almost all my family and friends are here ( not very special , but there it is ), 
  it 'd probably someplace only maybe 5 or 10 % of the population would know about perhaps even less, 
  we do n't have any special relations with ghana , india or america lol, 
  i do n't think it 's impossible , i jusy think it would be bad, 
  i do n't think these kinds of divisions were discussed much in school personal view : http://i.imgur.com/emwm1tn.png http://i.imgur.com/1ev0pvs.png, 
  kinda , yea but it 's more about the culture and whatnot . 
  individual americans are n't at fault for that , and i 'm okay with most of them, 
  southerners outnumber the northerners like 10 or 20 to 1 northerners swear a lot the `` aboriginal '' sami are in the north , but they 're pretty distinct from the norwegians there northerners are more socialist it seems , the communists held far more offices there , and far longer too, 
  stupid term imo to answer the question i do n't think people care much ( also notably a lot of students attend `` high schools '' rather than universities lol ) in my university i 've seen a few people like wear shirts related to student organisations for certain institutes , but nothing for the university itself, 
  i 'm pretty sure america is the only country in the world where this is something people care about, 
  the laws are much stricter than what is usually reality like , you can be criminally prosecuted to call someone a `` whore '' , but most of the time people just let that slip without pressing charges ( even when people feel genuinely hurt ), 
  spain, 
  taco, 
  i 've never assessed trustworthiness of anyone it 's not something i care about or ever is relevant to me, 
  unions are bad do n't form any, 
  in my opinion , studying abroad for anyone has never been a good investment for the future, 
  mine, 
  most contemporary european culture is hostile to social democracy already so living in europe is probably more likely to make people abandon social democracy , and not embrace it, 
  there are countries where people rather would live in apartments than houses ? 
  well you know eurasia is actually a continent , so yea, 
  thanks !, 
  i mean anyone can , but sometimes it 's out of the blue the issue is n't about who 's allowed to do it , but just who even bothers, 
  asking how i 'm doing when you 're not actually interested, 
  proper forest areal, 
  what 's uht ? 
  the problem with modern republics is that they usually feel the need to give vast executive powers to an office held by one individual . 
  the president is pretty much an elected king . 
  the kind of irony is that if the king is a king , he is sort of shamed into not using these , tbqf , undemocratic powers , but if he is called a president instead , he will feel justified in using them . 
  i saw some days ago a video from before the election in britain . 
  jeremy corbyn was `` grilled '' by some tv guy about the labour party 's manifesto . 
  he complained there was nothing about abolishing the monarchy , and one of corbyn 's retorts was that the manifesto was filled with things that matters . 
  and that 's the key the conflict about monarchy vs. republicanism without changing the rest of society just does n't matter, 
  our happiness to welfare ratio is somewhat low, 
  i looked it up , and american citizens are n't allowed to renounce their citizenship unless they have ( or get ) citzenship in another country, 
  i do n't particularily like it . 
  i think all foreign state citizens should go to the same process to aquire citizenship however i 'm open to loosening that process up a bit . 
  currently you have to live here for many years before you get citizenship, 
  the president is officially the # 2 highest position in the country , after the king the king is head of the executive branch , and the president head of the legislative , so i do n't think they meet that often lol, 
  germannic people came to the southern part of scandinavia while the northern part was still unpopulated and covered in glaciers . 
  however , the sami came from the east , and settled in the northern part before the germannic people visited there so like , saying `` scandinavia '' does n't really help , because the different part was settled at different times does that make sense ? 
  i 'm not sure i explained very well, 
  there are only a very few scattered areas where they 're the majority of the population sami independence is about as feasable , probably less , as native american independance, 
  the president is kind of amusing in that he exist, 
  right now nothing tbh , i 've had three very bad semesters in a row i 'm kinda scared i might have to redo some courses ( even some i 've passed ) and just thinking about it makes me want to die, 
  i was n't talking about you also the melody of your nat song is a lot younger, 
  how old is old ? 
  most national songs are less than 200 years old, 
  do n't think i 've actually met any turks i 've met a number of arabs and pakistanis , but no turks to my recollection, 
  not everything liberal is neoliberal , but the eu is, 
  italian from experience and hearsay i think italian `` catering '' is better than greek also , venice is like a historically preserved city , while athens is mostly a modern and unpleasant city , not really worth visiting, 
  for most politicians i disagree with the things they explicitly say , so whether or not they live up to what they say is usually not something i care about, 
  norway does n't even build houses like denmark , or have similar climate or similar stances on topics like the relationship of welfare to the individual as denmark , and danish and norwegian is almost mutually unintelligeble edit : also , i have actually been to schleswig-holstein . 
  it might be a little bit like denmark , but it 's not at all like norway, 
  then you need to work on your reading comprehension, 
  too hot during the summer it used to be too cold during the winter , but global warming changed that during the past 3 years or so, 
  neoliberalism that has stolen the hearts of millions through deception, 
  very , i suppose i hate it, 
  walking out in an orderly fashion in case of fire, 
  i know i have relatives in sweden , and i know of at least one specific swedish great-great-great-grandfather ( i believe it was ) , but i feel it 's stupid to not just say i 'm all norwegian, 
  i 'd say the settlements of iceland , greenland and amerika was migrations rather than colonisation , but it 's kinda iffy i guess i was thinking more of the colonisation process after 1500 or so, 
  we are n't really thought about those note , that roald amundsen 's expedition to the south pole , which we are thaught about , actually went across what would become your antarctic territory , and not ours edit : also just to be clear , with `` nothing '' i was saying not that we did n't have colonies , but that we ar n't taught about them . 
  we had colonies in the caribean , and outposts in ghana and india, 
  nothing, 
  mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm, 
  but of course you do, 
  no , but a county 's borders are where they are , so what places counts within and what 's outside is n't something unclear, 
  except norway is actually a country , it 's not arbitrary at all, 
  right-wingers do , yes, 
  mine is , but i do n't know about other young people in this country note though that in greece it 's way way worse than in america, 
  choson, 
  and i am telling you that you do n't, 
  `` europe '' does n't even make sense as a geographical thing neither does asia , if you see where i 'm going, 
  there is no such thing as `` scandinavian feel '', 
   basically the southwest southeast, 
  is brass music like a big part of serbian culture lol or, 
  none comes to mind besides universities , but they 're kinda tupid,

  it does n't apply for every party , but a large portion of them are pretty far to the left/centre on economic and social issues, 
  he 'll probably have more political effect by being an outsider constantly pulling the rest of the parties towards the right . 
  i 'm by no mean an expert on the dutch political system , buy i ca n't really see him and pvv ending up in government unless he either gets an extremely high result or if he tones down some of the rhetoric . 
  it 's not like wilder 's conviction is going to give him less support . 
  it plays very well into his idea of being persecuted for saying things `` everyone is thinking '' . 
   car bomb attack targeting police forces sounds more likely to be pkk than isis then ? 
  i feel really sorry for the turks . 
  being stuck between terrorists and erdogan , not a good place to be . 
  tsipras has an advantage since he does n't wear a tie . 
  he can just grab erdogan by the tie and pull , instant win . 
  and this is why the stupid relocation quotas wo n't work . 
  they 'll just use the borderless schengen area to move around to countries such as germany and sweden . 
  they might not qualify for any social support there , but they 'll work and live illegally . 
  i 'm sorry to see romanians being exploited in such a way . 
  here , see my other [ comment ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5heg05/war_in_reurope/dazr58m/ ) in this thread . 
  is this really not common knowledge in sweden ? 
  sure . 
  it 's referenced in [ this ] ( http://www.scotsman.com/news/world/sweden-s-role-in-nazi-defeat-of-norway-is-laid-bare-1-2339351 ) article , as well as in the [ wikipedia article ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sweden_during_world_war_ii#occupation_of_denmark_and_norway ) . 
  there 's also the book `` blodsporet '' by espen eiburn which uses declassified documents to retell what happened . 
  also there is a newly published book `` det svenske sviket '' - `` the swedish betrayal '' that documents the swedish actions during the war , both in early during the invasion and later when norway was liberated . 
  is this not common knowledge in sweden ? 
  the german navy was decimated during the sea battles , and lost almost 50 % of its destroyers during the two battles , but the german land forces fared better , though the suffered some setbacks as supplies started running low . 
  the pullback at narvik was very unpopular and heavily debated at the time , but newly declassified material shows that the british navy though it would be impossible to hold the beach head if sweden would still allow german troops to travel through neutral sweden . 
  sweden were good buddies later . 
  they housed and helped train a large number of young norwegian men in exile . 
  wikipedia has a small [ article ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/norwegian_police_troops_in_sweden_during_world_war_ii ) on it . 
  the same troops were used during the liberation of norway once the war ended . 
  the trains also carried heavy weapons , artillery , aa and some light tanks . 
  the allied forces were backed into a corner and low on ammo after having been forced to retreat for 800 kilometers in horrible weather . 
  the german aa also made any attempt at providing airdrops of ammo and forces impossible . 
  the forces at narvik were the last remnants of the norwegian army after it got destroyed during the initial invasion . 
  sweden allowed three trains with 40 sealed carriages carrying 20 soldiers each to enter norway via sweden . 
  this allowed germans to mobilise and defeat the allies in the battle of narvik , effectively killing the last attempt at retaking norway by norwegian and british troops . 
  let 's not forget that you allowed the germans to use swedish telegraph lines , which you tapped . 
  you had all information about the coming invasion , and yet no one gave us a heads up . 
  r/norway remains neutral as always , but sincerely hopes the r/sweden this time refrains from letting germany use its railways to invade us . 
  europe will remain even if the eu , ez or whatever collapses . 
  a unified europe on the other hand might just die . 
   ideally we would have recognised the structural issues with the euro when the crisis began economists pointed out the inherent flaws long before the euro was ever implemented . 
  yet the politicians with their endless hubris decided to give it a go . 
  another week and another bank close to collapsing . 
  to think that we 've been dealing with this ever since the financial crisis ... 
  i know wilders did n't actually get killed for his belief . 
  my point is that his supporters will see this as an unfair sentence and that the establishment is working against him on the basis of his beliefs . 
  sentencing wilders will only make him a martyr in his supporters eyes . 
  you guys have n't tried nukes in a while and apparently trump keeps asking his advisors why you ca n't use them , i guess that 's the next step ? 
  nah , just bomb them harder / s, 
  the saga goes on !, 
  nope , we 're buying 52 ( ! ), 
  of them . 
  turns out they 're very expensive and now we 're postponing more or less all other investments in the armed forces , with the expection of four or five new p8 poseidon surveillance planes . 
  at this rate we 're going to replace our aging artillery from the 50s sometime in the 2030s ... ps : do n't tell russia !, 
   but then certain countries lost their collective minds for a year and here we are , complaining about how of course it 's the eu and evil germany that fucks over greece now matter how shitty that move was , they should 've all seen it coming . 
  this is a lesson to a lot of countries , including greece that handing over sovereignty to the eu can bite you in the ass . 
  the relocation quotas wo n't work anyways , as the freedom of movement just means that those relocated to ee will find their way to germany and sweden within days , as we 've already seen with the few ones that have agreed to be settled in ee . 
  what a good thing that greece gave up some sovereignty so that they could be forced to register and take the migrants then !, 
  do you want greece to stop registering people ? 
  cuz that 's going to happen . 
  no worries , i 've already purchased an extra can of spam , now all that remains is to buy some [ beer ] ( https://i.imgur.com/pi4aokr.jpg ), 
  we 're in the schengen so we 'd have to implement it as well . 
  what really annoys me is that we discuss exactly the same measures as the commission is currently pursuing after the brevik attacks , but the parliament rejected them since they 'd be ineffective and would only affect law-abiding citizens . 
  now we might end up implementing the same things our elected politicians voted no to . 
  what a farce . 
  i assume you 're talking about brevik ? 
  in that case : we had the discussion in norway about banning semi-automatic firearms after the attack , but all major parties agreed that a : it would affect law-abiding citizens to a large degree , and b : that terrorists still would be able to get and use weapons if they want to . 
  look at nice , they used a truck to mow down civilians . 
  they use bombs , or knives , or axes or whatever . 
  we can keep banning and regulating stuff , but it wo n't stop them . 
  the only real way of reducing terrorism is by improving our intelligence agencies . 
  brevik was on the radar due to him buying chemicals that could be used to make bombs , but not enough red flags were raised for the anti-terror service to look into him . 
  we saw the same in france and belgium , many of the terrorists had been or were under surveillance or monitoring due to extreme views or troubling statements . 
   i 'm not in favor of this ban , but making national laws is obviously a waste of time as long as you are in the common market and schengen area . 
  what we really need is better check of and control over cross-border flow of illegal weapons , both inside the schengen area and outside . 
  i will not have my hobby taken away because some badly integrated french and belgian muslims think it 's a good idea to shoot civilians to appease their sky-deity . 
  the commision is free to propose such a thing , but i do n't expect them to since it concerns the sacred cow of totally free movement of everything including illegal firearms . 
  2.2 trillion euro , and yet the inflation rate is at 0.6 % and the rates are negative . 
  says a lot about how fucked up the euro has been since 2008/2009, 
  good luck trying to get the commission to understand that . 
  they 're either stupid , or they 're trying to use the recent terrorists attacks as an excuse to slowly disarm the general population through salami tactics . 
  this time they 're going for semi-automatic guns . 
  guess what happens when a new terrorist attack happens and the directive did n't stop it ? 
  the commission will propose yet another ban on another type of firearm , saying that the previous directive did n't go far enough . 
  give this a few cycles and suddenly you 'll not be allowed to buy pocket knifes without a permit . 
   dude when you are caught saying something illogical , it 's better not to double down on it . 
  how the hell is that illogical ? 
  we 're stuck in a limbo-like situation where no side has enough power to force or do anything rational , instead both parties blame the other for not doing enough . 
   who used that language ? 
  it is pretty funny calling it `` forced '' and talking about the ussr when the eu is unable to force anything . 
  but i already pointed this out and you seem to find schr\u00f6dinger 's union a perfectly valid concept . 
  the mandatory forced relocation scheme was forced through via a qmv , to the great dissatisfaction of the v4 . 
  doing something against someone 's will is forcing . 
  the whole relocation scheme fell under the umbrella term of showing `` solidarity '' to the border states . 
  in other words , forced solidarity . 
  the eu is simultaneously a tyrant who pushes nations around and a useless bureaucratic organization who ca n't do shit . 
  the real problem is that the eu has too little and too much power at the same time . 
  it has too little power to implement/force solutions , but it has taken away too much power from nations so that the nations ' hands are tied . 
   you liken the eu to the ussr . 
  i really do n't know what the eu did to you but i hope one day you will get over it . 
  i 'm not likening the eu itself to the ussr , i 'm just pointing out the stupidity of `` forced solidarity '' . 
  the eu does that sort of things all the time , redefining language in a way i 'd only expect from 1984 or ussr .

  living on welfare will in pretty much any country leave you with less money than working . 
  in addition to that you have the social aspect . 
  if you live on welfare you get a lower self worth and a feeling that you are not contributing . 
  in addition it will also make it harder to find a job , especially if you have been living on welfare for a significant amount of time . 
  people i know that live or has been living on welfare says that while it sounds great to just get money from the state for doing nothing , it really wears you down in the long run because you do n't feel like you do anything productive . 
  living on welfare is even more damaging . 
  i 've seen it first hand . 
  how is being on welfare preferable to employment ? 
  i do n't see how you can claim that we are running out of jobs when unemployment is on the decline . 
  as far as i see it there is just a difference in demand between sectors . 
  for example is nursing or trades guaranteed to get you a job instantly in norway . 
  the goal should be to offer proper education for those sectors that are increasing employment . 
  pretty sure the eu would stop that pretty quick . 
  do n't hold back , gives us a good dressing down at how much better your upbringing is , how much harder working you are , and maybe a few euphemisms about having `` the right heritage '' . 
  that 's not what i am saying . 
  it 's just that i disagree with the notion of welfare being preferable to employment . 
  you 're from romania and i am very surprised that this is how you see things . 
  especially considering how fast romania has been growing and how willing you are to move to find employment . 
   ahh , the just world fallacy . 
  you 're a conservative . 
  i do vote conservative . 
  however that does n't mean i am opposed to welfare per se . 
  the difference is that i do believe it is a last resort and should only be given to those in need . 
  if you have the opportunity and health to work i believe you should . 
  as i mention earlier there is more to work than just income . 
  for many people it 's the only social contact they get . 
   that is an unnecessary comment . 
  it 's not really . 
  culture is important and there is a difference between regions . 
  the u.s and northern europe was build with the thought of protestant work ethic . 
  productivity is in general higher in the north . 
   i too believe in the importance of work . 
  of meaningful work , of owned worked , and of sustainable work . 
  with little to say in favour of mini-jobs , workfare and coal subsidies , other than `` they might do for now , and just for now '' . 
  i disagree that those kind of jobs are not meaningful . 
  it helps people retrain and is in many cases the way into permanent employment . 
  if you do a good job at a work placement you gain opportunities that you would otherwise not get . 
   and that is all that `` maximum employment '' ideology can do , waste your time , waste your talent , even waste resources on promoting cheap labour to the detriment of innovation and automation . 
  again i disagree . 
  if you have talent you will most likely get good employment pretty quickly . 
  even if you do not find your dream job right away a temporary job could lead to it in the future . 
  that sucky job in retail could lead you to a high paying job in the company hq . 
  you just got to see opportunities . 
  healthcare is screaming for workers at the moment . 
   why ? 
  i 'm being serious , why ? 
  because having any work is better than sitting on welfare . 
  working is not only about getting money , but it also helps with social life and general self worth . 
  i have seen people living on welfare and it 's so sad seeing how it slowly wears them down because they are bored and feel like they are not contributing . 
  after some time on welfare you will also have a harder time getting employment later on as you have a gap in your resume . 
  not to mention welfare does in general leave you with less money to spend , even compared to a low paying job . 
   we 've sort of accepted that higher unemployment is better than trying to shove physics graduates into coffee making part-time for tips . 
  i guess that 's a north-south devide in action . 
  a high unemployment is in general not accepted in northern europe . 
  one is expected to contribute if you are able . 
  i know an engineer that worked as a pizza delivery driver before he got a job in the oil sector . 
  any employment is better than no employment . 
  how do you think we can sustain a large welfare state in the nordics in the first place ? 
  by working and contributing to it . 
  but if your mentality is common many places further south in europe it really is n't surprising how the north is richer . 
  now if only the unemployment rate would match the u.s. 
   edit : is there any reason why there are so many poles in iceland and norway ? 
  depends what kind of meat . 
  you can get ground beef for like 25kr which is just a little over what i pay in poland for the same amount . 
  yes it 's an important distinction . 
  being a foreign student in switzerland must be tough . 
  pretty much how i feel as a norwegian in poland . 
  if you work there it really should n't be a problem as the swiss wages are the highest in europe . 
  it 's the same for norway . 
  for foreigners it 's expensive , but when you live there it 's not . 
  spending is one thing , combat power and capabilities are another . 
   i am to young to appreciate the magnitude of the ( not so ) cold war . 
  yes it really was a different time . 
  i grew up in northern norway and it was always interesting to hear my parents talk about how much activity there was there back then . 
  all along the coast there is military facilities that used to be fully staffed with people , but are now just rotting away . 
  it 's sad but fascinating at the same time . 
   having an standing army that is large enough to be a pain in the ass to deal with seems like the optimal deterrence for escalations . 
  i agree and for norway that should n't really be that hard . 
  the terrain makes a land invasion difficult and with the right equipment and manpower it should be possible to hold of quite a large military power for some time . 
   i is sad to hear that the proverbial ship is rotting because nobody wants to pay for the painting . 
  it is sad . 
  it must be said that i do think the situation is better now than it was . 
  still not optimal however . 
   do you have any insights into why the goverment spenidng on millitary has decreased so much ? 
  there has n't been a push from the public to increase spending . 
  a few years ago the threat level did n't seem very high . 
  after the whole ukraine affair the public have been more eager to increase military spending again . 
  during the cold war norway consistently spent 3 % of gdp or more . 
  once the soviet union fell the military was downsized for peacetime operations , like in most of europe . 
   norway did participate in the war in afghanistan ( 2001 -- 2014 ) i guess that could be an explanation for why stoltenberg got his seat in nato . 
  we have participated in many operations abroad and the military is therefore organized in such a way . 
  now the focus have been turned more towards national security , sadly the current state of the military is not in any way satisfactory for this purpose . 
  an example of this is our brand new frigates that we have recieved during the last few years ( 2004-2011 ) . 
  of the five we recieved , only one of them was fully operative in 2013 . 
  the rest is barely manned and some of them are even used for spare parts . 
  it 's sadly not uncommon as investments are paid for over the same budget as the daily operations . 
  that means that if the budget does n't get increased enough to cover the investment , the operative budget takes a hit . 
  so you basically imply that we should be totally reliant on the us 's goodwill to defend us ? 
  it 's more surprising that stoltenberg got the position in the first place as his government reduced spending quite dramatically ( [ 2005-2013 ] ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/norway/military-expenditure-percent-of-gdp-wb-data.html ) ) . 
  as for the german occupation , the government has n't learned anything .

  give her a break . 
  and how did that end last time , exactly ? 
  `` the eurovision war '' would be a great title , though .

  i 'm rooting for finland and switzerland this year . 
  though my opinion seems somewhat unpopular among the rest of the fans . 
  they 're very bulgarian . 
  as is the sk\u00e5ne dialect from danish . 
  i find that dialect fun to listen to : you 've got the skarre-r and potato-throat ( norwegians joke about the fact that danes are just speaking norwegian , but with a potato stuck in their throat ) from danish mixed with the still somewhat nasal sounds ( although , as / u/pinkar _ i_motvind pointed out , that is mostly specific to stockholm and the area around there ) and other typical swedish traits in other places . 
  actually , that can describe some norwegian dialects , too . 
  i 'm not really sure what i meant . 
  i was tired when i wrote that .

  or kuwait . . or the christian part of lebanon . 
  i do n't understand why people care so much about a title on a paper . 
  it 's how you act as a parent that matters . 
  the fact that the form does not literally state father , will not make that father any less good of a father . 
  this is a giant non-issue , we need to tackle the real issues in europe . 
  oh i hope the eu slaps us with a big trout on those custom barriers . . or atleast a big salmon . 
  nato is possible because there is not friction between european nations that might spark a war . 
  there is no friction between europeans nations that might spark a war because their economies are integrated through the eu, 
  nato is possible because there is not friction between european nations that might spark a war . 
  there is no friction between europeans nations that might spark a war because their economies are integrated through the eu . 
  donate the money to the erasmus-project ? 
  it is a very clear and positive aspect of european integration and it is risiking funding cuts . 
  if only as a symbolic act . 
  the timing is political , the choice is not . 
  the secretary-general of the council of europe should accept it . 
  hint : it 's the same person who awards the prize . 
  not to mention the soft power that the eu uses to influence the so called eurosphere . 
  this prize has been long overdue . 
  for the last 20 years people have been complaining that the eu has been snobbed each year . 
  i thought it would have to wait to after jagland stepped down , but now is a good a time as any . 
  the history of europe is written by war and treaties . 
  why did treaties suddenly start to be honored ? 
  because of the integration of european economies . 
  germany could not go to war with france , because it would hurt its own economic interest , but also since german and french arms industries have suppliers in each others countries . 
  their industries would have to re-align . 
  this is not a controversial choice , stop taking your eurosceptiscm into this . 
  this is not about the uk and its relation to europe . 
  save that for that discussion . 
  arranged is not always forced . 
  i guess this is a distinction she makes . 
  i know this coalition goverment consists of nothing but incompetent ministers who got their job based on internal party politics and not merit , but less us not jump the gun to quick and dimiss her . 
  she has ample time to fuck up before this coalition is thrown out of office in a year . 
  why should he compromise his talent and aspirations , because his own politicans messed up ? 
  that sounds almost communist , like he is the slave of the greek collective . 
  i think it 's a good thing for greece as well . 
  just see how many highly educated turks who are returning to the booming tirkush economy after spending time in the us and western europe . 
  it 's gon na be a sausage fest, 
  yes , there are christian art , but i was pointing to how people often lump everything that was invented or created in the muslim world as islamic . 
  but we would never call the art of leonardo da vinci for christian inventions or art . 
  sure , european orientalists do this lumping as well , what would you expect . 
  but it is as common in the muslim world as well . 
  even in a secular nation like turkey , there is the islamic technology museum http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roi5stodvrg , showcasing things like siege machines and sextants , and those were not invented by imams . 
  it 's funny right . 
  islamic art . 
  we do n't call our historic art for christian , even if it was deeply connected with the church . 
  this must say something about how strongly the peoples of the islamic faith identify with their religion . 
  if they attributte every great piece of art and knowledge they have created as being created by islam , and not by man , they lose faith and understand of the creative powers of mankind . 
  all their aspirations and hope will be put into their religion , which can not delivery them anything of progress . 
  and they as a society will remain stagnant . 
  little englanders . . 
  here helle , you ca n't manage denmark for shit , have a go at europe, 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fethullah_g\u00fclen he sounds fairly reasonable all things considered . 
  better than salafist influence in the region, 
  i think germany should reconsider selling their subs to egypt , not for the benefit of israel , but for the benefit of the region as a whole . 
  egypt is in a transitional phase , who knows who is in power in a year or five . 
  but war is big business . 
  they let the dutch and uk state bail them out . 
  bailage was done . 
  the european federation would be my pick . 
  united kingdoms and formerly kingdoms of europe united republics and future republics of europe . 
  the possibilities are endless . 
  different nations should contribute to battle groups which in turn operates under european command and each state/nation should have their national guard . 
  i.e the nordic countries could combine their fleet into something like `` the nordic naval group '' , much like http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nordic_battle_group , which would have it 's core competancy in operating and defending the northern parts of europe , but could also be integrated into other battle groups by a joint command . 
  europe is also piggybacking on this very overspenditure of the american military . 
  if we want the us to take a less prominent role in the world militarliy , this means that europe has to step up its game operationally , this can be done by nations spending more money or by dealing with this on a higher level in the european union . 
  europe ca n't rest on nato for ever , it needs to have a solid backbone of itself . 
  downvotes , really ... 
  this is why i hate this conflict really , most people do n't see its multidimensional and try to reduce it to a very simple black and white conflict . 
  also it is blown out proporsitions , more people have died in syria the last couple of months than in the entire israeli-arab conflict for the last 20 years . 
  show me one boycott that has worked . 
  every time someone in norway tries to start one , it ends up with increasing the import from israel , because other groups increase their buying of israeli goods in response . 
  norway has more crazy christians than crazy commies and facists . 
  nothing , except that some on the settlements are really controversial , even in israel . 
  i think you would be suprised to see how many immigrants who have fled for economic purposes , who try to continue living based on the disfunctional culture from where they came from , without ever understanding that there might be a link between this culture and their previous countries economic shortcomings . 
  mathematical average . 
  mongolia - sweden , another outliner . . sweden took something like 80.000 refugees from iraq during the war . 
  mostly assyrians . 
  in norway , the goverment runs 99 % of the airports in the country thorugh a govermental company called avinor . 
  avinor basically sucks money out of the airports that have alot of traffic , to subsidize rural airports . 
  this is all well and good , but when a private company wanted to build a new airport on an old military airport some 50min outside of oslo , the government did all in its power to stop this as it would disrupt the way it 's structured now , even though oslo gardemoen , the main airport , is nearing max capacity . 
  i think this is an extremely backward approach and principally wrong . 
  so did the eu with its bolkestein-directive . 
  postal delivery in norway is basically operated by one company , the governmentally owned bring ( see a pattern here ? ) . 
  bring has grown by expanding into the swedish market and taking shares away from the swedish postal service . 
  competition is good right ? 
  no , while the norwegian government wants to earn money in the swedish market , they do not want any other countries to compete against their bring . 
  luckily there is the postal-directive which the norwegian government is fighting right now , but in the end , it will succumb . 
  the eu is so big and encompasses so many different cultures and economies , that it 's values and rule have to be universal , principally sound and rational . 
  since they are being taken at such a high level , they have to be this way , because they can not take into consideration of every special need of every country . 
  many norwegians would very much like that , to sit on the proverbial mountain and gaze at their navels . 
  drumming up every possible perverse system they can think of , so they can hide from the unavoidable globalization . 
  throwing money from a pile of oil money , rather than fixing things , basically constructing a museum which will last as long as the money lasts . 
  the eu is not perfect , but it 's a continuously improving system that i feel has brought prosperity to the continent and will so in the next decades . 
  this crisis will only make the eu stronger . 
  i am norwegian and i do n't feel the exact opposite . 
  i ca n't count how many times european directives have stopped out politicans from doing something stupid , and we are not even members . 
  it 's about principles . 
  most people do n't find it fair when someone takes 3/4 of what they earn , and it does not matter if you are rich or poor . 
  that is the reason for the rich to react . 
  sure the rich should be taxed more , but progressivly more ?

  it has/had that meaning in norwegian as well , but we 've since added yet * another * meaning to it as well  when a situation becomes more complicated or costly than previously expected , you may have to reluctantly accept a few camels in order to achieve your goals . 
  it 's frequently used in a political context . 
  for example when a government or party has to accept * major * changes to a policy in order to get their bill passed . 
  they may even be * unpalatable * changes , but compromise is the nordic way . 
   the masses of homeless people begging for money .

   i just can not imagine how it is possible to do nothing . 
  it 's probably due to economic circumstances for many . 
  it costs money to study in some countries and the job market may be bleak . 
  in some southern countries many work off the books , which means their stats look even worse .

  [ obligatory ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b3kbuqhhkx0 ), 
  i think you 're misreading this ? 
  i 'm not describing norway , i 'm describing what happens when oil is booming - and takes a country 's economy for a ride . 
  a ride that frequently goes up and down . 
  beer and porn are clearly great exports :d i think norwegians know you best for praha , so there 's that . 
  i have a few czech friends here , they tell some interesting tales about life in czechia . 
   granted when it comes to more than tenth of your economy it will take some effort , and probably pain yes , only 1 % of workers work in the oil & gas industry now . 
  while the industries that supplied those oil companies now focus on their other markets ( ship building , other engineering works , exports , etc ) . 
  it was easier for some of them since they used large pools of foreign workers that worked on short term contracts ( polish ship yard workers for example ) . 
  i would say it 's quite small , especially by comparison with the nations you mentioned . 
  people on the internet seem to think norway is all about oil . 
  that 's strange , it was n't very popular in norway , but it 's quite popular in the us . 
  you really do n't know enough about this . 
  the oil industry drains the market for people and increases salaries , which is not good for a country as a whole . 
  oil/gas exports increases the value of your currency , which destroys businesses that rely on exporting goods . 
  that 's `` dutch disease '' in a nutshell , you would be wise to avoid it . 
  in 2016 the oil & gas industry accounted for 12 % of norway 's gdp . 
  we 're pretty diverse already . 
  we have lots of natural gas in norway as well . 
  no , you 're not seeing the full picture . 
  this is management on all levels . 
  just like legally you can be guilty of failure to act . 
  in this case the cost to nature and humans is far greater than the benefits . 
  we have lots of fishing and tourism to protect . 
  those industries are significant to norway and will last forever , but not if we damage the environment ( by polluting the sea or destroying the landscapes with installations ) . 
  of course they can , it 's was only a hundred years ago that finland was allowed a `` break '' . 
  i 'm sure russia wants to get back together again soon !, 
  it 's probably all of the above .

   i personally like the right to bear arms in the us why ? 
  i have lived here almost 20 years and have not a single time in all those years had any need for a gun . 
  you have lived in europe ? 
  wow , really ? 
  i suppose you then also would know that europe is not a country so your comparison is shit . 
  i 'd rather live in the us than many other places . 
  how many other countries have you lived and worked in for comparisons ? 
  i have lived and worked in 6 different countries , currently in the us . 
  the us is great if you are white , have a great education and a high paying job with little to no debt and are healthy . 
  if you do not fit into this category , the us is a shitty country and most other civilized countries are preferable to live in .

  another one who extrapolates the us garbage system onto the rest of the world .

  sorry i have to ask but this is crap . 
  in civilized countries under civil law and not common law , enormous settlements are not seen for many reasons . 
  we do not want the us retarded judicial system , it 's that simple . 
  your system sucks . 
   should n't you have a chance to get redress from your own national courts ?

   edit : can somebody explain why this comment of mine is being downvoted ? 
  because it is insanity for an american to sue a foreign company for her own stupidity and inside the us where no us courts have jurisdiction over an austrian company . 
  she should have sued in austria , not the us . 
  imagine , this dumb cow , visiting iceland and breaking her foot in an ice crevice , returns home and then sues you in a us court because it was on your property and you are found guilty by a court in a land you have never visited and have to pay a us $ 20 million settlement ?

   keep in mind that all that she has won is the right to sue a us court can ** not ** give her the right to sue ** in usa ** a ** foreign ** company . 
  us courts have jurisdiction over what happens inside us territory and austria is not by a long shot , an american territory so the us has no jurisdiction and can not sue the austrian railways for anything .

  i wrote :  it is ridiculous of course . 
  more a jab at our swedish brothers . 
  lol no , rather that immigrants are happily integrated in norway but in sweden , not so much ... 
  it is ridiculous of course . 
  more a jab at our swedish brothers . 
    traditional dish is lye-treated codfish . 
    we eat cooked salted codfish , but it 's seems to be the same when i searched the wiki page [ 1 ] . 
  also we have so many ways to eat codfish . 
  and it is not swedish but norwegian . 
  not surprising portugal use a lot of the food , we sell you a lot of [ klippfisk ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/klippfisk ) , who does n't love a good [ bacalhau ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bacalhau ) ? 
  i have n't followed the debacle closely but as a loose guideline , i would say : 1 . 
  politicians ? 
  no problem , they are public figures and should stand by what they are saying . 
  a normal medel svenson ( regular joe ) - not so much , no matter how racist they are . 
  a modicum of privacy has to go along with freedom of speech . 
  once they go from speech to action , the picture changes . 
  there is no reason why immigration and its problems/benefits should not be discussed seriously in public but that also should mean all the overt racist slur needs to stop for a serious discussion to take place . 
  yeah or more accurate , the difference in sound and pronunciation of `` ch '' , `` sch '' and `` g '' just like `` de muis is in de doos '' teaches the difference in pronunciation of `` muis '' and `` doos '', 
  yes , i have worked and lived in 6 countries , currently in the us and yes , learning and using the language is a definite plus . 
  so , yes , does n't matter from where you come . 
  i guess it is to learn the sounds . 
  i learned the following one :  achtentachtig kacheltjes in een gracht in scheveningen if you are dutch you will know which sounds it is trying to teach you . 
   if you are n't able to practice it , you will forget it in an instant i learned dutch back in the 70 's . 
  i can speak it but i 'm much more comfortable with reading than speaking dutch . 
  a few weeks in the netherlands would change that undoubtedly . 
  well , the [ danish language is weired !, 
  ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-moy8vuebk ), 
  you move to a country with a language you do not know . 
  you do no effort to learn the language . 
  the jobs you will get are shitty jobs paying nothing and you have no future . 
  it should be mandatory for every immigrant to learn the language . 
  and as an immigrant to a new country , why would you not want to learn the language ? 
  i agree 100 % with a demand to pass a language test before you are afforded residency and citizenship . 
  if immigrants are not willing to comply , they are free to move wherever they want and are accepted . 
  nobody is forcing them to stay in the netherlands .

  to be honest , it 's so flat it 's not difficult to be blown away !, 
  i 'm not up to speed on the ukrainian-moldovan-georgian relationship . 
  can someone more knowledgeable explain why this important ? 
  i 'm happy they are pro-europe but what direct impact can they have on their countries relations to europe and russia ? 
    even though they talk funny . 
   that i can agree with . 
  that is funny coming from a finn !,

   underestimate the importance of the us dollar and banking system there you go talking about the us dollar as if it was controlled by the us gov ' t or banks . 
  i can buy dollars on the open market from anyone , no american control or regulation whatsoever . 
  the us banking system is a critical component in the global economy . 
  as i said in earlier comments , it 's not the only market in the world and some banks do n't go there for various reasons . 
   very shrewd/very bad at maths to think its a good idea to launder oil for dollars it 's * risky * business , but with high rewards !, 
  that 's exactly why some do it . 
  cleary , they need to avoid us exposure , but the us does n't control the world , so there will be places where they can do their business . 
  it does when it 's reported , criminal in nature and proven in court . 
  the [ swedish ] article mentions another similar offender that was arrested [ for harassing two homosexual muslim men ] and may be denied and deported . 
  yes , but mostly he 's full of himself . 
  oh , yeah , one of the greatest sources of muslim hatred , israeli actions , is entirely irrelevant ... 
  [ friesland ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/ca/frisian_flag.svg/640px-frisian_flag.svg.png ) is probably opposed . 
  - `` the seven red seeblatts ( or pompebl\u00eaden , as they are called in frisian ) are a reference to the frisian `` sea countries '' in the middle ages : independent regions along the coast from alkmaar to the weser who were ** allied against the vikings ** . '', 
  however , recently [ they created this unofficial flag for the `` all frisian '' culture ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1b/all_frisian_flag_scandinavial_model.svg/500px-all_frisian_flag_scandinavial_model.svg.png ) , maybe they do want to join us now ? 
  yes , yes , you guys are * missing the point * . 
  i know they 're related , that 's why i used it as an example !, 
  it 's not the same language today . 
  which is the point of the discussion above . 
  i 'm afraid i left that point without much context and should have elaborated . 
  i was rather thinking about the whole package ; not just the ethnic groups i referred to . 
   why are jews not european ? 
  as a person of ashkenazi background , i would say it depends on more than * just * the person 's ethnic background . 
  israelis in general are not europeans , mostly because they are culturally distinct from us . 
  many have strong ties to europe , but that does n't make them `` european '' , any more than the americans are . 
  - not all israeli jews are european ethnic . 
  there are several major jewish groups including the mizrahi and sephardim . 
  the political culture and religious nature of israeli society is far from typically european . 
  the `` siege '' mentality is hard to understand . 
  can you imagine the unique role of the haredim in a european society ? 
  the american influence on politics is quite clear , for good reasons obviously what with the american emigrants and support . 
   brits do n't consider themselves european `` schr\u00f6dinger 's brit '', 
  hmm , associated with and involved with european organizations/groups does n't make the country itself very european . 
  the population is clearly not , arabs , jews etc. 
  works better in norwegian where it 's the `` smell '' , 
  that 's lebanon . 
  are you sure , those fancy melons are expensive . 
   yeah , kinda . 
  yeah , there we go with that kind of accuracy again , hehe  it 's the `` kinda '' i 'm complaining about . 
  they 're related , sure , but they 're obviously not mere dialects today . 
  they are different languages . 
   98 % of the words are the exact same words that is not actually true or at least imprecise . 
  we share many words , but many have now changed meaning or become archaic . 
  in practice their usage and syntax is often completely different from ours . 
  a simple and common response , a mere sentence , would be quite distinct in either language . 
  i worked a number of years for a danish company here in norway . 
  all of my coworkers were danish , or from jutland ( joke ) . 
  i currently work in a mixed-scandinavian , int ' l corporation . 
  the danes can obviously understand much of what we write , but the * accuracy * is not high or perfect . 
  the same goes for norwegians and danish . 
   just pronounced a bit differently . 
  just a bit you say ?!!!, 
  i 'll leave this since we 're talking about written norms ( bokm\u00e5l ) . 
  there 's a reason some danes think we speak swedish at first [ or do n't understand at all ] . 
   anyone who says they do n't understand the other countries languages either lie . . or lacks patience oh , my what a claim to make . 
  have you ever been to denmark ? 
  it 's rarely a problem , to one 's face , that is * until * it becomes apparent both parties ** did n't ** understand the message completely or nuances of it . 
  to claim our languages are identical [ or near ] is a well-intentioned but misguided effort . 
  it strikes me that we , norwegians , still want to feel close to denmark . 
  it just is n't accurate to say it 's this close today . 
  possibly , 100 years ago and certainly 200 years ago it was . 
  languages change and evolve over time . 
  my danish inlaw lived here decades , but it took him a long while to pick up all the norwegian variations . 
   bokm\u00e5l is basically just danish that `` basically '' is * stretched * so far ... 
  i guess dutch is basically just german . 
   we are too lazy to take them haha , okay , that 's what my czech friends said as well . 
  they live here now and do n't want to go back . 
   our motto is `` pohoda '' = contentment . 
  til . 
  interesting !, 
  i was rather wondering why * that * is . 
  how are they `` biased '' though ? 
  the link you referred to cited academic circles rejecting the religious and their politics for fear that it would interfere with their professional work . 
  '' * ... [ they are ] open to discriminating against fundamentalists , evangelicals and to a lesser extent republicans . 
  * '' and '' * yancey also argues that the label of republican or christian may * ** not ** * be enough to trigger bias . 
  * '' rejecting creationists that wish to promote pseudo-science is n't wrong if you 're hiring scientists and teachers . 
  the west has very little in common in terms of politics ; our societies and political atmospheres are too different . 
  some patterns may be similar in the sense that gender , income and education have an effect . 
  i wish you both all the best !, 
  i hear bad things about the rural population from czechs that come from the countryside or prague . 
  is there a good reason for their complaints about the lack of opportunities and lifestyle ? 
  it 's great that you 're making something of yourself !, 
  you 're probably more motivated than most and will probably achieve more because of it . 
  interestingly , you currently fit the profile of [ my comment about denmark 's rotten banana . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3dqg70/percentage_of_people_at_risk_of_poverty_or_social/ct7oywc ), 
  i wonder why though , i would imagine other parts of the country with greater problems . 
  it 's just that the stats are n't available on lower levels ( nuts level 1 is used for larger states ) . 
  in the us . 
  that does n't make it valid for the world . 
   scrap the whole thing and start over . 
  in my opinion your points are not very good . 
  they seem built on a lack of historical and political background . 
  where 's the realism ? 
  do you imagine the us scrapping the federal gov ' t to fix it ? 
  the us had a civil war [ to keep the union ] , it took wwi and wwii to create europe 's . 
  people would * never * vote for a federal europe ; it would be like asking the us to vote on admitting mexico as the 51 . 
   how else on earth do you plan to achieve ever closer union ? 
  time . 
  as i said in my other comment ; it 's quite strange that you would attack the eu for being slow to consolidate - when your own federal state was built much the same way . 
  a lose union of nation states . 
  trade and mutual prosperity is the key .

  i do n't think alaska would turn into the new afghanistan , to put it like that . 
  i do n't know why you think that , but i 'm fairly sure you 're misreading it . 
  `` woman '' and `` man '' are very commonly used in english when one refers to the entire gender , which is particularly evident in the writings of philosophers and thinkers . 
  similarly , `` man '' is often used when referring to mankind as a whole . 
  if he had said `` woman and man should live in harmony '' he would n't have meant that any specific woman or man should live in harmony , or that every individual woman should live in harmony with every individual man , but that the genders as a whole should live in harmony . 
  what an incredibly fucked up response . 
  orthoxerox does not represent russia . 
  he does not represent russia 's conflict with the west or former soviet states . 
  if he represents russia and all its past and present crimes , does that mean you represent all the bad things your country has undoubtedly done in its history ? 
  what a load of rubbish . 
  i know americans like to pretend their guns are keeping them free from governments , domestic and foreign , but let 's be honest here and admit that hunting rifles in alaska would have essentially zero effect on russia 's ability to invade the state . 
  he 's talking about women as a gender . 
  if * women * - the group , not every individual woman - take part in the labor force on equal terms to men , then a society is socialized and women and men are equal . 
  okay , but then you 're also going to have to give the term `` cultural marxism '' to 8 hour work day , sick benefits , unemployment benefits , maternity leave , etc. 
  it 's not all about homosexuality and abortion . 
  jesus christ , would you listen to yourself ? 
  hey , i 'm all for a union between norway and sweden . 
  was wales involved ? 
  i ca n't remember the last time it was dark . 
   does n't that seem like a good thing for a country though ? 
  why would you want your country 's laws to be made by people that have never even lived there ? 
  our system is n't perfect but it 's alright . 
  sure , but that line of reasoning extends logically further than i suspect you would be comfortable with . 
  why would people in scotland , wales and northern ireland have their laws made by people that have ( largely ) never lived there ? 
  maybe it could be taken even further . 
  why would people in manchester and liverpool want their laws to be made in london ? 
  and you * are * already accepting laws and following directives made by the eu . 
  it even sounds vaguely scandinavian . 
  heh , i did a game like that , but i got bored right around baghdad and never finished it .

  hey hey hey ... 
  let 's be fair , now . 
  there was only a minor thirteen centuries gap between the fall of the western roman empire and the next time italy was unified . 
  by the time year 3000 comes around i 'm sure the uk is well on its way to debating implementing the euro . 
  you may say that , but that would be completely on the basis of your on bias . 
  the article , the quotes in it and the youtube video linked certainly do not support that interpretation . 
  considering half the population of the us believes in creationism , i 'd say it has spread already . 
  strange time to make that argument , considering there were apparently * actual * fascists around the corner in this instance . 
  but i guess you could n't let it remain unsaid . 
  a lot of elderly norwegians move to spain when they retire , either permanently or part of the year . 
  a lot of them live in entirely norwegian communities . 
  a lot of them vote for the biggest anti-immigration party in norway .

  harstad , bit shy of 69 degrees north .

  this comment in / r/ukrainianconflict regarding the death of civilians and the harming of children makes me think i 'm right :  i 'm not sorry for their death . 
  all true ukrainians have already withdrawn from the city . 
  well , technically norway is one of the easternmost countries in europe . 
  we 're just happy to be included somewhere . 
  you 're 6th . 
  i have never heard that before , but `` brygge '' means something like dock in norwegian , so that actually sounds likely . 
  the domination by denmark and sweden only really started after the black death , which hit us pretty hard and essentially wiped out or nobility . 
  we were pretty cool in the viking age , though . 
  wikipedia is pretty good for `` should look into it '' subjects . 
  i know i 've looked up belgium a few times , since it 's got an interesting history ( and also i 've had family living in the netherlands , so i 've visited belgium ) .

  scooter . 
  we knew there was oil somewhere in 1963 , but we did n't actually find ( or start bringing it up ? ), 
  before 1969 . 
  interestingly , the figures for the 70s do n't really have norway really improving much in the `` ranking '' . 
  i guess the oil effect was a little bit slow in really showing . 
  i guess i 'm just a fan of the nordic model . 
  i do concede that the only reason we are so far ahead ( relatively ) of the other nordic countries is almost solely the oil and gas . 
  but then sweden had other resources from the 1800s , so it 's only fair :p also , we were the junior partner in a personal union under both of them , so i just consider it our severance package . 
  edit : i could n't find figures for the 1950s . 
  i would speculate that in the early 50s we were n't terribly well off , since it 's only a few years removed from german occupation . 
  i do n't think it 's stretching it at all . 
  according to the figures of the world bank ( which may not be complete , but still give a good indication ) , this was norway 's situation gdp per capita in the 1960s : - 1960 : 9th - 1961 : 10th - 1962 : 11th - 1963 : 12th - 1964 : 12th - 1965 : 11th - 1966 : 12th - 1967 : 12th - 1968 : 12th - 1969 : 12th it 's not comparable to today , obviously , when we 're consistently in the top 3-4 , but it 's a damn sight closer than the common perception that norway was poor or even just average . 
  i guess it depends on how many countries you think can be in front of you before you 're not one of the wealthiest countries in the world . 
  i mean , the lists for the past few years have had countries like denmark , sweden , netherlands , canada , etc around 10th-12th at one point or another , and i 'd definitely call them among the world 's wealthiest countries . 
  considering norway also had one of the very highest life expectancy rates in the entire world in the 1960s , and as your source says very low unemployment , i do n't think it 's really unfair to call it one of the wealthiest countries in the world . 
  perhaps `` best off '' countries in the world would have been more precise , though . 
  fun fact : norway was one of the wealthiest countries in the world before discovering oil . 
  fun fact : we are now wealthier , because oil is really rather expensive . 
  we 'll buy the entire restaurant with our magnificent nordic economies .

  the fact of the matter is that our economy is n't just not regressing , it 's growing . 
  yes , it * is * growing slower than the past few years - during which it fared even better than we imagined just a decade or two ago - and yes , there are some serious challenges ahead - biggest of all being the fact that we ** have ** to diversify our economy - but * come on * .

  hah , i 'm afraid to say your italian winters sound eerily similar to the ones i 've experienced here in skyrim . 
  this year there 's even barely been any slush , just rain . 
  * hiking my sides, 
  eh , i find the winter to be a beautiful time of the year . 
  it 's beautiful in a sort of quiet , snow-white , moody and thought-evoking way , but still beautiful - there 's just something special about walking in crispy , white snow with cold winter air in your nose and quiet all around . 
  and then there 's the yuletide celebration slapped in the middle of it , which helps light things up ( literally and metaphorically ) . 
  i might not be the best person to judge seeing as i 'm depressed regardless of season , though .

nordic : never shalt thou wear thy shoes insideth . 
  minus 4 points just for the fact 1 eurocent-coins exist . 
  our polar bears are just in svalbard . 
  having them roam around on the mainland would suck ... 
  same in norway . 
  we use that more as a positive/sarcastic remark . 
  in norwegian we use * onkel * and * tante * , as in english , but the swedish farbror ( fatherbrother ) is very convenient also . 
  wish we used it , 
  * clings to * is a better wording i suppose . 
  english is my third language ... 
  well , i like scotland , wales and ireland more than england . 
  great allies during ww2 , but that is about it . 
  englishmen are as arrogant as the french , if not more so . 
  even as their empire has shrivelled and died . 
  cuisine is pretty much crap , and that is from a norwegian . 
  forcefully keeps imperial measurements and left hand driving , just to make sure all guests have a bad time and a general fuck you to the rest of the world . 
  we \u00b4 re special !, 
  the brexit shitshow pretty much underlined the english attitude , and i \u00b4 m gon na have a great time watching the process unfold . 
  let the downvotes begin !, 
  frenchman confirmed . 
  nowhere it seems like ... 
  me and a couple of others run / r/frenchforeignlegion . 
  it was an awesome experience and paved way for my current career . 
  why did you pick your username ? 
  we don \u00b4 t want the eu to benefit from our oil . 
  we \u00b4 d be net contributors to that house of cards . 
  i suppose they are one of the reasons , as the `` against '' side has been growing a lot since -13 . 
  other than that , giving away power from the national government does not sit well with people . 
  also fishing quotas , farming subsidies , gun ownership , the little representation we would get with only 5 million people . 
  we would be net contributors with our oil revenues while getting little of value in return in comparison to the trade agreement we already have . 
  also , brexit shows the eu is kind of like heroin , once on it , getting off is difficult . 
  previously , it was close to 50/50 for/against , now it is 70 % against . 
  ahh , the time when moose would roam denmark . 
  you brits win the thread . 
  let me just point out that in most eu nations you are free to own guns . 
  it just require some paperwork and registration . 
  in the american `` free states '' the paper trail ends after the background check . 
  both ars , kalashnikovs and what have you are allowed . 
  some nations are stricter than other , like the uk ( but they don \u00b4 t count , do they ? ) . 
  some nations have banned military calibers , while others have magazine restrictions , or a specific ban of military-style rifles in hunting . 
  our politicians refuse to recognise the threat and raise military spending accordingly . 
  in this day and age we should be able to raise hell on our own . 
  direct democracy , \u00e1 la switzerland . 
  at graspop ( metal festival in belgium ) back , some 10 years , i spoke to a few after last band was finished playing . 
  skinhead , nazi-band shirt , old norse tattoos , the lot . 
  me , my friend walked back to the hostel with these guys singing ensiferum-songs horribly as we were all drunk as shit . 
  then we went to our separate rooms , went to sleep and i never saw them again . 
   it is an order of magnitude better than in any other country in this world . 
  agreed . 
  it treats its citizens like adults , unlike representative democracies . 
  the media here often write about the * democratic crisis * ( brexit , trump ) of the west , but imo it is just the result of not having a proper democracy in the first place . 
  i saw a drive-through church in fl . 
  that is a thing ? 
  once i though all pick-ups had 4-wd , because that would make sense as a work/load truck , but it turns out that is rare .

  i recommend leather shoes . 
  bye-bye to stinky feet . 
  then you should shower and get a fresh pair of socks . 
  we require everyone to have a security clearance . 
  i \u00b4 m pro-mandatory service , but only on a national level . 
  it makes for great trust between civilians and military over time , it teaches a lot of good things one don \u00b4 t learn in school , but nevertheless should know , like first-aid , dressing properly according to climate , handling stress , respectful behaviour as well as a specialised skill . 
  i do , and will continue to serve my nation , but never the eu . 
  going into someones house with your shoes on ... 
  the king is a pretty chill dude . 
  he likes to drive his nice audi himself , with his body guards in the back . 
  i \u00b4 ve had the pleasure of speaking to him once when he visited the base where i work . 
  he will crack a joke with a straight face just for fun , which is cool but a little confusing . 
  even though he is by default the highest ranking officer in the armed forces , he is pretty laid back with the ceremonial stuff . 
  plenty of nice stories from the kings guards as well . 
  krag and j\u00f8rgensen ? 
  met an american once . 
  he was into black metal , and had learned a lot . 
  pinnekj\u00f8tt , steamed and salted sheep with rutabaga and potatoes . 
  traditional west coast . 
  ribbe , pork with sauerkraut , vegies , sauce and potatoes . 
  more of a south eastern thing . 
  torsk , codfish with bacon and extras . 
  northern parts . 
  indeed you should not . 
  but they need to change their flag before i can fully embrace them . 
  eu wants to ban semi-automatic sports firearms . 
  they did not bother with an impact assessment , and they are using nefarious methods to get this to pass . 
  this is the first and a major step for complete disarmament of the population , in a time when we should rather arm ourselves . 
  i believe you saw an object you could not identify . 
  seen several . 
  as for flying saucers , well ... as for nwo , i \u00b4 m more concerned with the eu . 
  these days they want to ban semi-automatic firearms . 
  taking the first aim for disarmament of the population . 
  sounds like it could be turkey . 
  norwegian , french and english at fluent levels . 
  amen . 
  sweden , denmark , iceland , finland , in that order . 
  i thought the schindler museum in krakow was pretty underwhelming . 
  in norway ; most attractions in oslo is pretty boring . 
  aim for the scenery on the west coast instead . 
  norwegian , and i suppose scandinavian languages in general are pretty stripped of formalities , titles and unnecessary politeness . 
  at least compared to french , english and german . 
  `` you '' , or `` first name '' are pretty standard . 
  in the military you go by rank or surname .

  if you tell a scandinavian ( or northern european ) to do something they will just say ok and come back in a day with the problem fixed in addition to saying they found x things that we need to improve . 
  went to dtu in denmark for a year as well , pretty similar university system as in norway, 
  shipping , fishing , fish farming , aluminium * . 
  and we 're decent at high tech , plus we have more hydroelectric power than we use .

  we might be at the top of the boom , but its likely to be a long and slow decline ahead of us . 
  as the article states the main issue is that the oil industry has driven up cost for every other industry . 
  if there is a slow decline there is n't any reason why we could n't adjust . 
  of course there would have to change some things , but we were an industrial nation before the oil and we 've been one during the oil . 
  its not like we 're dubai or something . 
  norway was n't really that poor in the 1900s ( at least not after wwi ) , thats just a myth , we were pretty comparable to any other western european state . 
  before that we were pretty poor though ( though thats also debatable , we had better food security than a lot of other countries because of the north sea ) . 
  its a section thats something like 400 pages long in book number six in the series . 
  he goes into stuff about hitlers childhood and stuff . 
  he makes some comparisons to his own life , partly how they both had a terrible relationship to an alcoholic and authoritarian father . 
  hans problemer med \u00e5 knytte seg til andre mennesker , hans kvinneopph\u00f8yning og kvinneangst , hans kyskhet , hans renhetslengsel '' semi-googletranslated :  `` hitlers youth was similar to my own , his distance love , his desperate desire to be something big , to raise himself from himself , his mother 's love , his hate for his father , his use of art as an i-annihilation and the place major emotions . 
  his problems relate to other people , his elevation and anxiety of women , his chastity , his longing for purity ''  `` when i see him on film , he evokes the same in me as my father once did , also there is a similarity . 
  he represented the bourgeois public in much the i know , it 's the indignant voice that says you do not measure . 
  he also represents the exceedance of the same bourgeois public , the young boy who sleep late in the morning and will not have a real job , but who will write or paint , because he is something more and better than the others . '', 
  as said in the other comment he compares himself to hitler . 
  and also just to be a controversial bastard . 
  which he is . 
  i think part of the idea was also to choose a title that is quite clearly an autobiography , but not a normal autobiography . 
  and yes that is what mein kampf is called in norwegian, 
  ian banks is an amazing author . 
  really love his sci-fi stuff as well ( written as ian m. banks for some reason ) . 
  ** norway ** markens gr\u00f8de ( growth of the soil ) ( 1917 ) by knut hamsun . 
  a stoic man moves into the wilderness of norhern norway and builds his own farm and family . 
  it follows his whole life from this point . 
  gives some insight into the nordic mindset ( at least historically ) and conflict between traditional farming live and industrialization . 
  for something more modern . 
  min kamp ( my struggle ) by karl ove knausg\u00e5rd . 
  a pretty insanely detailed autobiography that is extremely well written imo . 
  the reason for it in bergen is that the language was `` simplified '' during the hansa-period . 
  lots of hansa influence in the western norwegian dialects . 
  speaking for norwegian it just comes natural , and it can vary in different dialects as well , 
  and euro 92 . 
  well [ kirkenes ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kirkenes#history ) is pretty much boned then . 
   russia meanwhile called for norway to clamp down on expressions of religious intolerance and and criticised the country 's child welfare system . 
  they also recommended that norway improve its correctional facilities for those ** applying for asylum status ** they are just being nice thinking of all the russians fleeing from political oppression in russia . 
  yeah that is true to a certain extent . 
  its also an area where the countries differ a bit , sweden and denmark are more centralized than norway ( and iceland i think ) . 
  some say its because of a combination of geography ( distances and topography in norway is extreme ) and history ( being unpopularly ruled from copenhagen for so long ) . 
  the countries are also small enough that you have a sort of `` semi-local '' relationship to national politicians . 
  one interesting side note is that politicians and people in the `` upper class '' almost invariably speak in their own local dialect rather than in some standard or refined norwegian . 
  i 've read that thats not very common elsewhere . 
  there is n't really any reason it should change . 
  our political system prevents anything too radical from happening , politics just shift left or right by a little bit . 
  i think it would take a huge external crisis to break the stability . 
  does n't seem very likely at the moment , but who knows ? 
  and norwegians . 
  and swedes , though not so much in englands case, 
  denmark ii : the hashening, 
   scandinavians do n't eat traditional scandinavian food . 
  they eat the same globalized diet as the rest of you , but with some added traditional elements , such as rye , oats , and lots of fish . 
  and at least we know how to make bread . 
  and some of the traditional stuff is great , 
  sure , crews are already smaller than they used to be , no more manual flipping of valves and the like . 
  all i 'm saying is that `` drone-like '' ship behaviour is pretty unrealistic as it stands today . 
  you also need maintenance of the machinery , cargo systems , fire prevention etc etc. 
  ships will have decent sized crews for a long time . 
  another thing is that ships are n't as mass produced as say automobiles , they are more like factories and there is always a lot variation between them which makes them really hard to standardize and automate . 
  sounds like a cool project , though it sounds like you did n't get it :(, 
  high taxes , state sponsored education , high perception of equality and trust in structures built over time in a society with small distances in the social hierarchy . 
  norway never had much of one anyway . 
  i work in the same town and know a lot of people working for rr marine in \u00c5lesund . 
  that is a very optimistic article to say the least . 
  one thing is captainless , i think we might get there in some time . 
  crewless on the other hand is pretty far off if you ask me . 
  everything is possible of course , but what i 'm saying is that this is n't something thats really close in time . 
  if we manage to automate something like this there wo n't be many jobs left that ca n't be automated . 
  i 'm pretty sure outsiders would have a hard time telling us apart . 
  there are differences of course , but probably more similarities . 
   boat captains etc automated boats as a ship automation engineer i 'm just going to say : not even close in the next 30-40 years . 
  maybe some simple ferries at most . 
  mostly lawns with flowers , but quite commonly some fruit trees ( apples , pears , plums etc ) and berry bushes ( raspberry , redcurrant , even strawberry ) as well . 
  when i was a kid we also tried to have vegetables for a while , but the roe deer kept eating it :( . 
  funny thing is , every time i come to the us it feels like i 've walked into a tv-show . 
  it feels weirdly familiar , yet different . 
  in norway its more like this ( very cool video ) : http://vimeo.com/7470397 newer cars and not as much confederate flags and stuff . 
  if anything its those lazy oslovians that are funded by the rest of us hard working , oil pumping norwegians . 
  * shakes both fists in a southernly direction *, 
  i 'm a casual kind of guy . 
  to be fair to me i only meant that a foreign army could probably occupy finnmark for years without meeting a single person ( 75 000 people in an area bigger than denmark ) . 
  then the mosqituos would take care of them . 
  are you guys annexing finnmark ? 
  because if you are i do n't think a lot of people would notice . 
  well the swedes have taken some chunks out of norway before . 
  sneaky bastards have been lulling us into a false sense of security with their hundred years of neutrality . 
  if i 've learned anything from euiv its to never trust a swede . 
  samis mostly live on the border to russia :| . 
  norway is obviously skewed by oil income , but i 've had a lot of experience working abroad through my work and i think we would still be pretty high up on the list without it . 
  the times i 've been in spain and brazil it seemed like everyone was at work all day without getting much done , really frustrating and a stupid use of peoples time . 
  i 'm sensing some kind of joke that i 'm not getting . 
  the biggest minority in norway are sami ( around 40 000 ) . 
  we have a dark history of oppression when it comes to them , but these days it is n't bad at all . 
  though there is some casual racism and stereotyping going on sometimes . 
  ah , the poor mans iceland . 
  we 'll take it . 
  sweden , norway and iceland were included .

and iceland . 
  they were not even remotely fascist . 
  if you learn about the italian fascism , it was n't that bad until they joined forces with germany . 
  mussolini never liked hitler , if only italy had joined forces against nazi germany ... jews and homosexuals were tolerated , and were even members of the party , until hitler forced italy to take action against the jews . 
  sorry for the rant , but reading an interesting book on italy : http://www.dn.se/dnbok/bokrecensioner/goran-hagg-mussolini-en-studie-i-makt/, 
  he did n't even write it , he dictated . 
  well . 
  stop apologizing for rapes . 
  statistics from usa show that black men almost exclusively raped white females . 
  extremely few white men raped black women . 
  i 'm curious about the stats for oslo , but i doubt asian men went around and raping other muslim women . 
  it should also be labeled as hate crimes . 
  http://www.p4.no/story.aspx?id=272134 this is a good example of the view many third world immigrants have on women . 
  we see how well that has worked for england recently . 
  hiding by `` i did n't want to be portrayed as racist '' is the new version of `` i only followed orders '' . 
  norwegian kids might be a minority in oslo schools by 2021 . 
  how is that not a problem ? 
  we 're already struggling enough with integration as it is . 
   stop trying to make muslim invasion a thing , because it is n't !, 
  really ? 
  hate on jews , women and homosexuals are on the rise at least here because of muslims . 
  it would have been much better if they had their enlightenment period , but islam never did . 
  [ norway is on board !, 
  ] ( http://hafrsfjordvikingene.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/vikinger-02.jpg ), 
  the un 's defines political displacement as genocide . 
  this creates problems for norwegian youth , and high immigration drives the prices of housing up . 
  all in all , immigration is a net loss for norway in the long run according to government findings . 
   an end to the never ending wars europe has suffered since ancient ages . 
  are you really that naive ? 
  we are seeing seeds of balkanization all over our continent . 
  even the leaders of great britain , france and germany has admitted that the multicultural dream has failed . 
  the leaders here in scandinavia have failed to admit it , but i guess they are caught within their own system . 
   racism where ? 
  it 's not racist to want to maintain your population without exchanging your countrymen with immigrants . 
  this is even part of the humans rights . 
  often , the same people who push for immigration are the same ones who advocate that tibet should be left for tibetan people , palestina for palestinians etc. 
   maybe we would n't have problems with fascist/racist parties all over europe if we 'd be a country full of immigrants . 
  great logic there . 
  ever heard of balkanization ? 
  it 's not similar . 
  op posted satire , your image is the real deal , 
   nationalism is evil . 
  thinking your nation/culture is better that 's not nationalism . 
  100 % identity , 0 % hate . 
  it 's perfectly natural to be proud of cultural , scientific of whatever accomplishments of your people , even if you had no part in it . 
  it 's not stupid to be proud of your grandfather getting a university degree as the first in your family , for example . 
  it 's part of your identity and roots . 
  but germans are in a kind of special situation as it 's just recently you seem to have been allowed to show any pride . 
  it shows under football matches with the waving of the german flag . 
   no , it 's not . 
  patriotism is just the american word for nationalism . 
  no , patriotism is supporting the state . 
  nation means ethnic group , not state . 
  a nation can have a state ( national state ) . 
  some nations do not have states , like the kurds . 
  sadly the terms are often misunderstood , but prior to the french revolution this was not so . 
  ethnic britons are now aminority in london . 
  is that doing fine ? 
  in norway , my generation ( i 'm 23 ) will receive worse pensions than our parents and grandparents . 
  they could look forward to a high economic growth which we can only dream about . 
  each immigrant coming here costs norway 4,1 million nok , that 's 500 000 euro per immigrant . 
  with future costs in pensions , welfare etc.we have already promised away our entire oil fund . 
  in norway , there is a high degree of eastern european immigrant in jobs like carpenters , construction , painters , plumbers and similar . 
  norwegian youth are fleeing these fields , as they see there is no future in it . 
  the work-immigration leads to something called social dumping , there has been many cases in the media about polish workers being treated badly . 
  but often , the same work-immigrants finished work is sub-standard . 
   i just wonder what kind of practical reason anyone would have for removing the foreskin . 
  there are some cases where the foreskin is too tight and you will get painful erections and perhaps problem with peeing . 
   we see what you mean , the problem is you do n't see , or do n't want to see further , what is causing the problem and what are the solutions . 
  * excuse you * , i know about deeper , underlying reasons . 
  at least try to do a better strawman argument . 
  the solutions from both the leftists and rightists has not bore any fruit whatsoever . 
  europe ca n't take all the birth surplus from the third world . 
  what is so hard to understand ? 
   how about that norwegian guy that made a massacre a couple of years ago ? 
  did he immigrate ? 
  i do n't see the point you are trying to make . 
  this is about immigrants and asylum seekers . 
  they are over-represented in crimes like rape , murder , theft and robbery . 
  it 's logical that these numbers of incidents would be reduced if we were stricter . 
  many of the foreigners come from areas with a lot of war , violence etc. 
  i fail to see how anyone ca n't see this , except if they deny it on purpose . 
   you can not stop a crazy man . 
  we could reduce the immigration to reduce the number of incidents . 
  yeah , it 's not like asylum seekers in norway are over-represented in drug sales , rapes , robberies etc. 
  94 % of the asylum seekers who got protection in 2012 does not have a identity we can be sure of . 
  in 2010 the numbers were 92 % . 
  we only go on a `` likely '' identity . 
  one up-and-coming politicians for the labour party was revelead to have lied on his application . 
  he had gotten several family members into the country . 
  94 % of the asylum seekers who got protection in 2012 does not have a identity we can be sure of . 
  in 2010 the numers were 92 % . 
  we only go on a `` likely '' identity . 
  many asylum seekers destroying their id 's etc. 
  then what do we use to throw trash ? 
  in norway we pay for plastic bags at the store . 
  we re-use them to bag trash . 
  the asylum centre where the murderer from this event lived opened in august . 
  it did n't take long . 
   beyond that i do n't think there is anything deeper than mentally unstable people lashing out .

  no , my point is that this is an isolated incident that was quickly dealt with by local law enforcement . 
  that 's all this is , yet people are trying to make it into something more than it is . 
  the video is n't indicative of anything at all to anyone with a shred of integrity , and is only used by racist shits to further their racist beliefs . 
  you can see it so easily when someone asks for context on the video , and are provided nothing but lies and non-answers . 
  because the truth is n't really that scary . 
  so please , stop being part of the fearmongers . 
  you mean that * one time * a bunch of muslims rioted inside a refugee camp after some dude trampled a qu ` ran and was n't killed or anything , and then the police came and settled everything down ? 
  [ you must be terrified of canadians . 
  since all the racist shits are hard at work spinning this as much as they can , let me give you some actual information on the video : it 's from a refugee camp in hungary . 
  some dude trampled a qu ` ran and the muslims got upset , starting a riot . 
  the riot took place in the refugee camp . 
  police arrived and calmed shit the fuck down . 
  the racist cunts of / r/europe , like / u/grutte _ alk , want to pawn this off as some common and serious issue that is threatening all of europe . 
  meanwhile , a bunch of canadians rioted in 2011 after a hockey game , killing 1 person and injuring around 140 . 
  you look like a man !, 
  that 's not how you manipulate public opinion . 
  direct statements of racism and such are not very helpful at persuading people . 
  instead , they use tactics like those seen in this thread . 
  a perfect example is [ this comment ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3drhrn/illegal_immigrants_flood_debrecen_hungary/ct832ma ) :  why the fuck are n't we controlling this better ? 
  it provides a reasonable basis ( this behavior is not good ) , frames it as if it is a serious and pressing issue , and serves as a springboard for further comments presupposing the same . 
  pretty much every comment is of this nature , tipping the conversation in the direction of racist opinions and attitudes . 
  why are n't we controlling a spontaneous riot in a refugee camp better ? 
  well , they already did . 
  this is n't some ongoing event , this was a sudden riot sparked off by some dumbass taking someone 's qu ` ran and trampling on it , and it was all shut the fuck down by the police . 
  it is under control . 
  really , your comment sounds like it 's staged to create a specific narrative . 
  ca n't all you fuckers just dust off the nazi flags and start digging mass graves already ? 
  it 's getting tiresome reading the same racist garbage on / r/europe every day . 
  it was a refugee camp . 
  somebody trampled on the qu ` ran . 
  a lot of muslim refugees got antsy . 
  police shut it all down . 
  end of story . 
  meanwhile , you shits are trying to make this out to be some sort of muslim mob invading a city center to seize control of it . 
  yeah , those fucking jews . 
  wait , i might be 80 years late . 
  no , but it just so happens that i 'm not comparing that . 
  i 'm comparing parental ability to effectively , and in a healthy manner , police the actions and behavior of their children . 
  yeah , why ca n't my 8-year-old buy some beer a pack of cigarettes at the store ? 
  it should be the parents ' responsibility , right, 
  that 's a pretty decent adjacency bonus . 
   georgia wont do nothing so they will do something ? 
  why ca n't you just leave them alone ? 
  they 're a constant source of amusement over at / r/enoughlibertarianspam , and this is interfering with that . 
  well , if you 'd read the comment i replied to , you 'd be in possession of this glorious thing called ` context ' . 
  i did n't know belgium was in romania . 
  thanks for enlightening me . 
  please do n't dilute the meaning of ` fascist ' with your retardation . 
  oh man , this is just such a huge pile of bullshit . 
  not only are welfare recipients such a tiny percentage that they have little effect on elections , but welfare recipients rarely even vote . 
  the reason why people on welfare can often be resistant to taking a job is that working does n't actually earn them money , it just replaces their welfare with earned income . 
  this means that someone working 30 % does n't earn more money , they just get less welfare , to the sum that their total income remains the same , ** and often even less ** . 
  that 's what we call a perverse incentive . 
  polish people always buy beer and white bread in stores . 
  just beer and white bread . 
  you do n't have arguments , you simply have misapprehensions as horrid as the one i mentioned in my previous comment . 
  not to mention , i 've already answered them . 
  well , it is quite evident that it is pointless discussing this with you . 
  if you do n't understand that there is a difference between ** an individual act ** and ** an aggregate outcome ** then there really is no hope for you . 
  elections must be mind boggling to you . 
  you 're arguing against facts , i 'm afraid . 
  it 's a battle you will surely lose . 
  there is a reason why subs decline in quality as they increase in popularity . 
  it 's not because people are dumb . 
  as i said in another comment :  it 's why subs deteriorate in quality as they grow . 
  it 's why unmoderated public servers in any game are generally shit . 
  it 's why littering is an issue . 
  people are unable to understand the aggregate effect of their actions , they are more likely to make exceptions for their own behavior , anonymity makes them less likely to follow the rules , and their often casual relationship to something makes them unfamiliar with rules and intentions to begin with . 
  if you believe the potential for manipulation exists , either by mod filtering , by news sources shaping the narrative , or whatever , then you must also inherently believe that people are n't able to recognize bad content on their own . 
  your entire argument rests on a contradiction that borders on absurdity . 
  you are manufacturing your own narrative , completely derailed from reality , in which the users have perfect knowledge of all things , and have no biases but for the truth . 
  the difference is that a mod team actually communicates before making a decision , so they do n't depend on their individual opinions . 
  they are checked by other people who may hold different opinions , and are more rigorous in their filtering as a consequence . 
   is n't an aggregation a group of individuals ? 
  the effect of an individual act and an aggregate outcome is not the same . 
  you consistently make the mistake of talking about individuals when discussing aggregation . 
  basically , what you 're saying is that i ca n't count on you to filter content on / r/europe . 
  you 're not really building a case for userbase-filtering here . 
  it is exactly this issue that leads to user filtering being worse than mod filtering . 
  the users do n't get together and discuss the merits of various news sources , they just upvote and downvote based on their individual opinions . 
  with a small mod group , you have actual interaction , discussion , and the inability to just downvote things you do n't agree with . 
   can you address my first question ? 
  how can you possibly filter content without implementing bias ? 
  i ca n't remember making such a claim . 
  i was only talking about selective bias in terms of filtering in or out specific narratives , as was the context of my comment . 
  what i want is bias in terms of quality content . 
   you realize that those are n't their real names , right ? 
  thanks , captain obvious . 
  this does not make them unaccountable . 
   for example ? 
  why would this inherently be true ? 
  perhaps if that group was qualified and had some sort of oversight , but placing this task in the hands of a group of unknown and unqualified individuals with unknown biases is just asking for trouble . 
  because one group has an objective , while the other does not . 
  you 'd be surprised by how competence increases simply by giving someone a task . 
  again , the quality of filtering by users is well-attested as being complete and utter shit . 
  even horribly biased filtering by a small group is better than the refuse cobbled together by a chaotic mass of people . 
  however , the mods literally hold all the power possible in this sub already . 
  if they are intent on manipulating the content of the sub in a specific manner , there is nothing we could do now to stop it that we could n't do if they applied a reliability tag system . 
  no , tagging domains based on reliability is specifically ** not ** having `` 10 people [ ... ] chose what we should read or not ( * sic * ) '' . 
   wo n't some people downvote based on the unriable source tag ?

  family planners were amazed to discover that only a year or two after contraceptives had appeared in cities , illiterate women were using them in remote villages . 
  the pattern of swift , uninterrupted decline is now taken as the norm : the un uses it to project a worldwide convergence towards the replacement rate of fertility ( 2.1 , the rate at which a population stabilises in the long term ) . 
   but convergence is not happening in africa . 
  in a few countries , including niger and uganda , the fall in fertility has barely begun . 
  where it has started , the decline is usually slower than it was in asia . 
  east asian fertility fell by more than half in the 20 years to 1985 . 
  in cameroon fertility has fallen only one point ( from 5.7 to 4.7 ) in the past 20 years . 
  and in eight african countries , including ghana and kenya , the decline has stalled -- that is , after falling for a while , the rate got stuck at about five . 
  fertility stalls are not unknown elsewhere : argentina 's fertility remained at three for decades ; south korea and costa rica also experienced hiccups . 
  but no continent has experienced so many stalls , or so early in the process of decline , as africa .

  they build more with the profits from the smuggling . 
  boat builders in libya are making a killing atm ... 
  one of the things that makes it more mysterious is that no ( credible ) norwegian soldier has tried to take responsibility . 
  i mean , he was besieging a norwegian fort at the time , shooting him down would have meant massive respect and probably rewards for the shooter . 
  but no one came forth . 
  so what , then ... 
  i read [ a book ] ( http://www.amazon.co.uk/napoleon-wellington-the-long-duel/dp/1842127403 ) about this . 
  the brits won due to this one easy trick , which the french hates : they were standing on top of a hill , actually slightly behind the top . 
  when the french artillery fired , they simply lay down flat on the ground , which allowed the bullets to bounce over them with small casualties . 
  napoleon had n't realized that , even though wellington had used the same trick in spain - presumably because he was more busy on more important fronts , and partially because napoleon was not so flexible tactically - he used one winning strategy instead of a myriad small ones . 
  anyways , the smoke and dust from the cannonballs made it hard to gauge the actual casualties inflicted on the british formations , so napoleon did n't notice that they were much less damaged than they `` ought '' to be , if not for that simple trick ... 
  i mean , what do they take us for ? 
  * racists ? 
  this is like ... child service controversy.txt . 
  here 's the recipe : - ask parents why their kids were removed - when parents give dumbshit answer , take it as gospel , no source criticism necessary - refuse to cover the child service spokesman contradicting the parents answer ( they are mandated by law to say nothing except `` we ca n't comment , but it is n't like that '' ) profit !, 
  yes , profit . 
  tabloids live off outrageous headlines . 
  it 's easier to be an illegal immigrant in the uk than in france , supposedly . 
  something with needing a national identity card to get work , or something . 
  believe me , that 's * not * a unique occurence . 
  same happened in norway , even while the housing was accompanied with extensive education . 
  used to have a deal that gaddaffi would stop and process refugees , until we overthrew him . 
  yet another reason why that action was retarded ... 
  better than the current poland-indonesian they have . 
  have you guys found an icelandic non-corrupted word for `` youtube '' ? 
  have you ever seen or experienced or heard about a situation in which you go through temporary stress or hardship , in order to achieve a long term gain ? 
   i 've never understood this argument me neither , until i understood one thing : most people ca n't think one step ahead . 
  your logic is dependent upon two steps ( population ca n't increase forever , therefore ... ) , hence it is too complex for most people . 
  very few people , least of all high school graduates , have a firm understanding of even their own subcontinents history . 
  adding another perspective before you 've even understood the first one wo n't help anyone . 
   you 're making it sound like ` leftists ' are shipping in immigrants to make the white race go extinct . 
  leftists are the main pro-immigration group . 
  i do n't think they are doing it based on any plan , rather a set of ideologies , rationalization , hipsterism and small lies aka pc culture . 
   never mind that 0-6 year olds in a single city is a pretty small and skewed sample size for the entire population it gives a good measure of how things are gon na be in the future . 
  i mean , there was nothing happening 6 years ago that made people breed like mad , so in 6 years the next 0-6 cohort is gon na be as large as this one ( at least ) , and then the next one , and the next one ... 
  in other words , the future for antwerp is 72 % non-belgian . 
  unless the non-belgian rates of reproduction remains higher than that of the natives , in which case it 's gon na be more . 
  it 's weird really , we always heard we were gon na be benefitting from immigration , but as it is it looks like `` we '' wo n't even be left in the cities to benefit from it . 
   what makes the other 28 % belgian ? 
  history , culture ...  with them or without them the land will still be here in 50 years and the things wo n't change significantly . 
  well * the land * will be there yes , but right now i 'm talking about * the people * . 
  that said , explosive population growth will not be kind to the land either . 
  and so far , environmentalism is something invented and pushed by westerners . 
  when culturally western people disappear , who knows what will happen to it . 
  edit : that said i 'd like you to answer the question . 
  is it fair to say `` enough '' if , say , 80 % of a countries population is from a foreign culture ? 
  and if that culture is drastically different from the local one ? 
  leftists , is there a point where we should say `` enough '' ? 
  if so , where ? 
  80 % of the population is foreign ? 
  if no , what 's the end game ? 
  extreme immigration forever ? 
  10-15 years back it was different , very different , with some parts tending to be missing . 
  the kerchers have spent lots of time trying to smear an obviously innocent person .

  property rights protection is an essential feature of capitalism . 
  capitalism typically includes private property rights . 
  russia has [ very bad property rights protection ] ( http://internationalpropertyrightsindex.org/countries?f=ipri&amp;o=asc ) [ economic freedom index also rates it very low  ( http://www.heritage.org/index/country/russia#open-markets last ) note how corruption makes all investments unstable . 
  uhm ... what ? 
  we 're talking about logistics . 
  dense populations makes logistics easier , and infrastructure projects more profitable . 
  also , goods have to travel shorter and you can more often have benefits of scale . 
  homogenous population got jack shit to do with it . 
   i 'm sorry but by that logic what exactly do you think his logic was ? 
  maybe , after this stint in politics is finished , he can retire and become a pop star in germany \u00e0 la david hasselhoff . 
  i really do n't believe that chinese cost figure . 
  blame forced labour all you like but i imagine making a tank requires lots of * skilled * labour and capital , and is n't all that labour intensive . 
   yeah , this is how the left operates in the netherlands . 
  in norway the same . 
  atm tho the justice minister is kicking out `` asylum children '' to massive controversy . 
  see , when a family comes here and then gets rejected , it takes a while if they are to exhaust all of their many appeals opportunities . 
  in the meanwhile , their children are allowed to go to kindergarten , school etc. 
  after 4-5 years the children feel at home , particularly the small ones who may not remember any other home . 
  however according to law they are to be kicked out . 
  so then we get massive leftist and press agitation , `` little charlotte ( 7 ) just wants to stay with her friends '' and `` little mohammed ( 13 ) wants to go back to norway '' ( from jordan ) . 
  the result of this agitation was that the entire family was allowed to stay on an obviously unsubstantiated asylum application . 
  now however a new justice minister has stepped up the pace of deportations , there has been whining but he has persisted so far . 
  i hope he wo n't relent , but the media pressure is there and there 's talks of a motion of no confidence . 
  you are n't helping anyone , least of all your own side ... 
  please go away . 
   but when i see the vitriol , uninformed hatred and sheer bigotry being peddled how many such examples can you find in this thread ... ? 
  i suspect your definition of hatred , vitriol and bigotry is rather broad . 
  there 's the trolling tard below , but other than that i ca n't see any . 
   no one is forcing anyone to make it permanent , asylum can be temporary and when they get children , what then ? 
  kick out the children too ? 
  probably illegal under the law , and most certainly the left will mobilize * everything * against such a move , and they 'll end up staying permanently . 
  and what if the conflict drags on ? 
  or they claim they will be tortured if they return ( and most places in the world carries some risk of torture ) ?

  the unemployment is centered around the western parts of norway , while the rest is doing fine . 
  we 'll do fine , but we 'll need to diversify our economy .

  imagine sitting across the table of that carrot colored man trying to negotiate any sort of deal when you 've written him off as a total flop . 
  if trump wins , it 's going to get very awkward for all the politicians across europe who has publicly described him as some sort of retarded , bigoted world destroying monster . 
   that 's a good analysis . 
  thank you . 
  it 's based on my knowledge of the current political climate in italy and the eu . 
  i 'll admit i probably now less about the first than most italians , so please correct me if i 'm wrong on any point . 
   more like constitutional reform ( the nature of the senate , in particular ) i 've edited my post to better reflect the fact that it 's about more than just electoral reform . 
  i get why italians , and other southern europeans are angry . 
  they 've really been given the short end of the stick with the current economical and fiscal framework . 
  they 're mad that they 're constantly getting berated for not living up to the maximum deficits rule , whilst germany constantly runs over its allowed surplus without any consequences . 
  italy has also been struggling with the influx of migrants over the last 5 years , without the eu doing much to help other than insisting that dublin must be upheld . 
  i think his new found will to criticize germany and northern europe has been triggered by two things ; the brexit vote has pushed the uk out of it 's pivotal role and opened a vacuum that italy plans to fill . 
  when/if the uk leaves italy will be left with more influence than they previously had . 
  i also think that the upcoming referendum as well as the growth of the five star movement has made life more difficult for renzi domestically . 
  the referendum has partly evolved into a national vote of confidence in renzi 's government , even though it 's strictly only about the electoral/constitutional reform . 
  renzi needs to show strength domestically if he is to win the referendum , especially since it has also become about his political future . 
  we 'll have to see if he still keeps it up after the referendum . 
  if db is hiding information from the public and shareholders , odds are that they 're hiding the same information from regulators and thus the ones in charge of stress tests . 
  stress tests are usually based on publicly available information , and those doing the stress tests asks for any more information and data they need to fill in the blanks . 
  db did poorly at the last stress test , and that was probably conducted with cooked books , imagine how bad they 'd get rated based on actual data . 
  stress tests also have their limits . 
  they 're based on simulations inspired by real life events , especially the 2008/9 financial crash . 
  a major component of the tests is to test a banks ability to weather a large amount of non-performing loans . 
  i doubt that the stress tests devised after the last financial crash take into account all other sources of systemic instability . 
  in the case of a db collapse , it 's very hard to figure out how it would spread across the banking sector in europe . 
  other banks are `` on the hook '' for at least parts of the derivatives , but derivatives are by nature difficult to value properly , and they have often been sold multiple times and been baked/packed into other banking products sold to customers all over the world . 
  db is truly a bank that is rotten to its core . 
  i have lost track of the number of times they have been fined for breaking the law , unethical business practice or just lying to customers or regulators . 
  it would not surprise me if they 're cooking the books to fix their already massive capital shortfall . 
  db 's collapse would lead make the lehman brother 's collapse look like child 's play in comparison . 
  the total amount of db derivatives and their combined values are mind-boggling . 
  derivatives are complicated papers , and it 's difficult to estimate their total worth and how other banks are exposed to the fallout of a db collapse . 
  give us a little heads up please , we 'd still like jemtland and herjedalen back . 
  interesting development if it 's true . 
  stratfor has been writing about the internal power struggles in russian politics over the last few years , and putin has reportedly become more and more worried/paranoid about high ranking officers using fsb to sow dissent in the ranks and even attempts to unseat putin . 
  he has already removed several important figures from his internal circle . 
  do n't worry , he 'll fall back into line as soon as the referendum has been held . 
  then he 'll act all confused as to why people loathe politicians when they realize he played them with his bait and switch . 
  going by the latest numbers available , afd is doing pretty much as expected . 
  polls pegged them at 13-15 % , the newest numbers from ard and zdf place them at 13 , almost 14 % . 
  yet another happy day in the eu family !, 
  but how will parents now learn what food they can feed their children / a, 
  it 's been very interesting to see how the internal fractures within the eu has grown and become more visible over the last year . 
  i expect it to get worse as the brexit negotiations finally kick off . 
  france seems to go for a very though deal , while germany lead by merkel seems to want a more pragmatic approach to ensure that german exports do n't suffer . 
  knowing the eu they 're going to do the opposite of what the uk asked for . 
  it seems that whenever they 're facing a problem the solution is always to double down on whatever did n't work in the first place . 
  alcohol problem you say ? 
  juncker likes to view it as having an alcohol solution / s, 
  so , this guy as the next pope , donald trump and le pen become presidents ; we 're retaking constantinople !, 
  brb , got ta fetch my horned viking helmet and ready my longboat . 
  the eu ends if either france or germany pulls out . 
  france pulling out would leave funding hole and make the german dominance over the block even worse . 
  merkel is overextended already , and winning another term is going to be hell if france backs out . 
  not to mention that a le pen win would happen whilst the brexit ( pre ) negotiations are ongoing . 
  the fallout of the yugoslavian wars were relativity mild . 
  the states that emerged were pretty stable and europe funneled a lot of money into the area to rebuild what was lost . 
  i 'm not saying that everything was rebuilt and that there currently are no problems . 
  the area is still plagued with minefields . 
  i do n't see the same happening in syria and afghanistan . 
  no stable states will emerge from this mess and the infrastructure will lay in ruins for decades to come . 
  the me and north-africa has seen little economic growth due to a multitude of issues , spanning from poor resources , a horrible mind-set which severely limits their potential as well as tribalism which makes corruption widespread and difficult to combat . 
   are your municipalities totally incompetent ? 
  yes , some of them truly are . 
  they 're largely run by `` ordinary '' people and not career politicians . 
  a lot of municipalities are struggling with poor economy as a result of poor fiscal management . 
  the have a funding hole and then a letter from the state drops in their mailbox stating that they get x number of kroner pr person pr year for 5 years and they see it as free money . 
  it 's only later that their mistake sinks in . 
  we 're creating a new underclass defined by religious and ethnic lines . 
  there 's no way that could end badly / s, 
  would you look at that , turns out the refugees are creating jobs !, 
  we had the same deal in norway were municipalities were delighted to receive migrants as they 're given financial support per head for 5 years . 
  they thought the had discovered some sort of money printing press !, 
  imagine getting paid to host people . 
  they quickly became disappointing as they realized that once the fem year grant ends they 've only taken on large number of people of which the majority will never be employed and will only siphon money out of municipal budgets . 
  not really a problem though , as by that time another party has taken office , and now you get the joy of being in opposition and can criticize them for your bad management . 
   early optimism that the wave of migrants could boost economic growth and help ease a skills shortage in germany [ ... ] is evaporating . 
  i could 've told you that 18 months ago . 
  what morons . 
  she could 've swaped places with her backup , but she would still be required to part-take in some proceedings , read up on documents sent out by the municipality council and so on . 
  it would also leave the party without a real backup for that mandate . 
  well , it 's not really conscription . 
  she was informed by letter that she was signed up for election by a political party and that she had a certain time limit to withdraw . 
  had she read the letter instead of throwing it away she could 've easily corrected the mistake . 
  parties very rarely sign people up for election by error , they 're not interested in having someone represent them which are unwilling to do so . 
  the reason the law is pretty strict when it comes to replacing someone who has been elected is to ensure that parties do n't use bait-and-switch tactics were they put someone up for election , get lots of votes and then later replace the person with someone no-one voted for . 
  last municipal election a woman ended up getting elected without even realizing she was on the ballot . 
  turns out that there were two women with the same name in the municipality and one of the political parties managed to sign the wrong person up for election . 
  even though she received a letter in the mail informing her that she was up for election she threw it out without reading it , thinking it was junk mail . 
  the last i heard she was trying to get out of it , but the law was pretty clear that once you 're elected you 're in . 
  she applied to be replaced by a backup representative but the media stopped reporting on it so i have no idea how it turned out .

  they are n't gon na follow the laws , and there will always be crazies . 
  as for the low gun crime levels , i believe it 's because europe has homogenous societies with few poor people that are generally taken well care of . 
  besides , look at america , gun deaths are mostly done with illegal guns in gang shootouts , and suicides . 
  while europe has generally high suicide rates , we have few gangs , so i do n't really think it would be a problem .

  i for one welcome our new serbian overlords,

  just see the disastrous response from the authorities during the terror attack in 2011 . 
  sadly most of this increase is because of investments that are paid for over the normal military budget . 
  so while the spending goes up in numbers , we still have a barely functioning military because the money for the daily operations gets cut . 
  we do have lots of fancy new equipment , but we ca n't afford to operate it . 
  the new defence plan basically involves downsizing an already miniature military by closing even more bases and units . 
  it 's frankly embarrasing and it 's rediculous to see how the politicians claim that it will increase combat capabilities . 
  that 's true .

  free floating currencies are the norm especially in the west , so it 's not up to the government to devalue it . 
  it happens according to the demand for the currency in the market . 
  allthough the central bank can to some degree control this , it is still a seperate entity from the government . 
  also devaluation is preferable to having a too strong currency which hurts employment and growth , something we see some countries in the eurozone struggling with . 
  one thing is to make the warhead , another thing is to develop the delivery system . 
  that can be quite hard to develop . 
  it 's the same here in norway . 
  but i believe we have actually done a relatively good job at keeping some rural population . 
  for example is the difference between northern sweden and northern norway pretty striking . 
  it has to be said that there is plenty of resources along the coast that helps in that regard . 
  that may have been , but if they did n't go through that phase it is no doubt they would have been better off than they are now . 
  social democracy is capitalism . 
  me as a norwegian is free to start a business , invest on the stock market and earn money of my capital . 
  it 's even encouraged by my government . 
  as opposed to the glorious socialism that left romania poor in the first place . 
  they may have some good industries , but no way does belgium have nearly the same amount of exports as the u.k. and italy . 
  [ something that the cia world factbook confirms ] ( https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2078rank.html ) . 
  wonder how much of that is goods in transit through for example antwerp . 
  the eu is n't even a federation yet the cap and cfp is a thing . 
  you obviously live in the middle of europe where you all have a lot of the same needs and desires . 
  for us that live on the outskirts of europe we do n't feel like the once size fits all package works for our struggles and problems . 
  i do n't trust people from further down on the continent to deal with fisheries policies or arctic matters as they are simply not qualified for the job . 
  agriculture is another matter where we simply do n't want industry farms filled with antibiotic usage like countries such as germany is very fond of . 
  i agree with you . 
  however that means that these principles need to to be respected and followed . 
  for some reason i sadly do n't believe this would be the case . 
   it would still be your government , but you would share it with people from other countries and that is where the problem arise . 
  i do n't believe me or norwegians in general share the same values and attitudes as someone from greece or france for example . 
  the only countries that are somewhat close is denmark and sweden but even between those countries there is plenty to disagree with . 
  for example immigration in sweden 's case or excessive taxation in denmark 's case ,, 
  i stand corrected in the case of mali , however i still believe that europe has n't been the saint we try to make ourselves look like . 
  we do n't really have any reason to go and bomb foreign countries like we have been , even if the u.s is leading the mission or not . 
  the point being that europe is less religious than the u.s ? 
  cause that may be the case for some european countries , but far from all . 
  you ca n't really generalize europe though . 
  there is plenty of countries here too that are influenced by religion . 
  including poland where i currently live . 
  libya and mali is good examples of where european countries were more than eager to bomb . 
  how will a united europe change any of that ? 
  the french love to intervene in their previous colonies , should we stop them ? 
   i disagree . 
  in the last 50 or so years , the only `` expansionist '' agenda europe has had was about projecting soft power . 
  ah yes , like bombing the middle east to pieces . 
  why give up sovereignity when i already have all that in addition to national sovereignity already ? 
  how would that help if people are not loyal to the government ? 
  i know that me as a norwegian would never agree to being governed by any other body than the norwegian government . 
  if you are a skilled immigrant healthcare and college costs is n't an issue though . 
  that 's pretty much how it is in norway . 
  not illegal , but you have to pay huge tolls . 
  a good summary . 
  however the tax of 78 % is on profits , not revenue . 
  this may seem very high , but the oil companies agree to it because the state covers 78 % of the exploration and drilling costs . 
  i totally agree . 
  sadly this policy is supported by the majority as most people are clueless . 
  i know a few people that experienced it at my university back home . 
  it does n't take much for them to search you . 
  [ we already own $ 14,9 million of greek debt ] ( https://www.nbim.no/en/the-fund/holdings/ ) . 
  i think that is enough for now !, 
  there is always a risk with investments , but i would assume that most of these assets are pretty secure . 
  the government does n't have to balance the budget for the debt to gdp ratio to remain constant or decline . 
  as long as gdp growth is larger than the deficit you do n't add debt . 
  norway is in a net creditor position , this means that other countries owe us more than we owe them . 
  so if we look at our net debt you will get a very nice number . 
  [ in 2014 our net debt was -244,23 % of gdp ] ( https://www.google.com/publicdata/explore?ds=k3s92bru78li6_&amp;hl=en&amp;dl=en#!ctype=l&amp;strail=false&amp;bcs=d&amp;nselm=h&amp;met_y=ggxwdn_ngdp&amp;scale_y=lin&amp;ind_y=false&amp;rdim=world&amp;idim=world:earth&amp;idim=country:no&amp;ifdim=world&amp;hl=en_us&amp;dl=en&amp;ind=false ) . 
   when i say worst tourists i 'm literally going by polling . 
  you 're going by anecdotal evidence . 
  polling can be biased . 
  if the respondents do n't like americans they will naturally put them as the worst tourists . 
  americans can be ignorant about the cultural norms and the country they are visiting , but in my experience they are rarely rude or make a lot of mess . 
  now compare it to brits and scandinavians on drinking holidays in the mediterranean where they do n't give a fuck about anything and just create a mess . 
   i see the us refered to the ` greatest country in the world ' all the time on reddit . 
  i do n't know what subreddits you visit , but my impression is that it 's the opposite . 
  pretty much any thread involving america is filled with comments about how bad the u.s is etc. 
  maybe you missed the sarcasm . 
  sounds reasonable . 
  in norway you will get your home searched by the police even if they are just suspecting you of smoking . 
   and i think it 's undebatable that there are a lot of shitholes in rural america that are n't all that different to a third world country . 
  you will find bad areas in any country . 
  i honestly do n't know any concrete areas you are referring to that can literally be compared to a third world country . 
  i know plenty of places in eastern europe that would qualify in a heartbeat though . 
  the u.s is very popular in ireland and eastern europe . 
  also in scandinavia where people do n't always agree with their politics , but do n't have anything against americans as people . 
  as for tourists they are far from the worst . 
  they are some of the nicest tourists out there . 
   i do n't ever see any other nation referring to its self as ` the greatest country in the world i can assure you that there is people in every country that think theirs is the best in the world . 
  when it comes to arrogance i think many europeans , especially on this sub has americans beat . 
  this comment chain just proves it . 
  you do n't need a corporate tax rate of 0 % for it to be favorable to companies . 
  for funding welfare the corporate tax rate does n't really mean that much anyways since it 's not a large source of revenue . 
  that 's true . 
  it should be possible to find a solution for that as well .

  i certainly expect no mercy if my country fails to pay its debt in the future . 
  i doubt any greek creditors would be less demanding . 
  greece is already ruined , in every possible way ; by past and current generations , by the previous governments , by the current government , and by the eu/ez/ecb and imf . 
   ok , you clearly have no idea of what is going on ... bah , the arguments of a man who 's run out of arguments . 
   the people have nothing to do with these loans , they did not take , agree or want them and they did not benefit from them either now , that 's a common argument written by someone with no idea how things work . 
  i 'm a man of the law , i care deeply about it . 
  the gov ' t of any country acts on behalf of its people . 
  i can understand arguments about dictators ' debts , but not money lent recently !, 
  the eu should probably accept some reductions based on ability . 
   and now we have to cut back even more ? 
  yes . 
   there is nothing to cut back on !, 
  there is plenty to do still . 
  it 's not always about reducing the budget , but also about market legislation and selling off assets . 
   while the big bucks stay out of harms way yes , naturally , that 's the way things work . 
  ca n't say i blame you for that sentiment though . 
  the world is unfair and no protest in greece [ or elsewhere ] will change that . 
   why the people are so pissed they 're pissed because they do n't like it . 
  that does n't mean they have good [ legal or moral ] reasons for rejecting deals and debts . 
   greece did not slap in the face every popular `` oxi '' protest is exactly that , in my view . 
  the political leadership of greece can never ever expect their population to support any debt payments . 
  the masses are like irresponsible children in any and every country . 
  the people have their own simple view of the world ; `` it 's your fault for borrowing us money , we should n't have to pay it back , etc '' . 
  no greek government will ever become credible with that kind of attitude , and as such they should never be allowed to lend again . 
  now , * that * would truly destroy greece !, 
   but what we seemingly cant do , is what is required to solve the issue ... 
  they 're playing hardball in europe , it will be solved by a debt reduction and hard reforms in greece . 
  both side will suffer deeply , but of course the greek people will suffer the most . 
  that 's just natural . 
   you lended money to someone who can not repay and now you are suprised ? 
  no , it 's a question of honesty . 
  if i let you borrow to feed your family , i expect you to honor that intention by attempting and agreeing to pay it back . 
  trying . 
  the greeks are refusing . 
   help ? 
  in the form of more loans that they can never repay ? 
  that 's not helping , it 's kicking a dog while it 's down . 
  yes , help that keeps their government paying salaries etc. 
  i 'd love to hear how you would solve that . 
  the money they desperately need to keep their banks and savings afloat . 
  that 's our money doing that . 
   help would be to repay them what they did to us after ww2 , uh , germany is not the only lender . 
  europe and the world are . 
  my country also gave greece loans , we do n't owe them shit . 
  the real slap in the face is not repaying what you needed to feed your family yesterday . 
  we did n't have to lend them anything . 
   the government there yeah , but that was my point , only in that one piece of libya . 
  as you know there is n't just one government in libya . 
   last news was that everybody but the tripoli based group was on board with the peace deal . 
  yeah , i do n't believe that will last . 
  it will fall apart since there is so little that keeps them bonded together ( no nation ) , so much that divides them ( tribalism ) , and the greedy can keep what they control for their own . 
   breaking the country up if they want to stick together they 'll find a way . 
  i just think it 's more likely they 'll want to keep [ more than ] their fair share of the resources . 
  there will be losers .

  however , today they do n't control more than their own little zone . 
  the fighting is regional and tribal . 
  these groups simply profit from the human trafficking . 
  i do n't believe they see this in the macro perspective , it 's about financing their own groups . 
   there are peace talks too , these are completely unlikely to succeed in my opinion . 
  there are too many groups who are mutually exclusive and want more for their own . 
  the resources will not be equally split . 
  libya * was * three countries and i believe it will be again .

  rural versus urban etc. 
  the ratio of smuggled versus legal is probably much higher in the border regions [ or less wealthy regions ] . 
   maybe it 's because in poland they banned smoking or because they smoke smuggled cigarettes from belarus/russia .

   in exchange for their natural resources , we would provide education , health , infrastructure , utilities etc. 
  are you china ?

   fix libya . 
  as soon as libya is fixed , it can start patrolling its coasts again , and we can return all boats we find to the shores of libya .

  maybe we could fix one of the three libyan regions . 
   the refugees : the refugees are n't coming to europe to destroy us .

   no bank is going to risk a large scale investigation and possible disbarment from the us for a little country like iran , what you do n't seem to want to admit is that not everyone cares about the us market . 
  every big multi-national obviously does , but not every company or bank is that .

the border between europe and asia is at the ural mountains in russia , which means a large part of russia 's territory is in asia , and a smaller part is in europe .

  the author was a proponent of scandinavian unionism and the song was written in honor of all nordic countries , but with specific focus on sweden and norway since they were in a personal ( royal ) union at the time . 
  unfortunately the union was a lot more popular in sweden than in norway , and the song did not retain popularity in norway after the dissolution of the union . 
  it 's still a very beautiful anthem .

  several muslim congregations ( including the largest one ) are threatening to leave islamic council norway because of this . 
  a prohibition against `` completely covering the face '' in schools and universities are underway ( i think there 's a majority in parliament for it ) . 
  point is , this is n't just blindly accepted , even among muslims in norway . 
  this is my experience in norway as well . 
  the state run monopoly stores have great selection , skilled staff , low mark-ups ( even on high-end items ) and generally nice stores . 
  the only real disadvantages are limited opening hours , and poor shop coverage in rural areas . 
  of course , high alcohol taxes also feel bad , but those are n't directly related to the system limiting sales to state run stores . 
  my french is n't super , but i think you 're quoting different numbers from op . 
  table 1 in the pdf refers to the percentage * of people * who drink wine or beer , not the percentage of their alcohol consumption that each kind of drink represents . 
  if you instead look at figure 2 , you 'll see the number of glasses per week . 
  the number of glasses are roughly comparable for beer and wine , and given that wine has a much higher alcohol concentration you 'll find that it is n't far off from op 's numbers . 
   southern dude ... 
  the chart says you do drink beer ( 10 % - 20 % of total consumption ) , you just drink a lot more wine . 
  it 's more that almost everyone drink coffee regularly , i think . 
  10 kg a year is only equal to about 2 cups a day . 
  but every person who does n't drink coffee at all would pull down the average significantly . 
  so mexican coffee drinkers probably drink in comparable amounts to northern europeans , it 's just that * everyone * drinks coffee here , to the point where i get weird looks if i decline a cup in social situations . 
  iceland clearly was n't included in op 's chart . 
  it does n't mean that iceland drinks less coffee than all the countries on the list , just that whoever made the list did n't bother to include iceland . 
  as you pointed out , iceland would 've been in the top , had it been included . 
  / u/mvlad88 / u/kingofmonaco / u/exiledasher check iplameinreallife 's link for data on bosnia and mexico . 
  i know several people who drink 8 cups a day . 
  it 's above the national average , of course , but it 's not an abnormal amount for regular coffee drinkers . 
  the national average is lowered considerably by the demographics that drink no coffee at all , which means the coffee drinkers have to make it up in order to get to the ~ 2 cups a day equivalent average . 
  this only works in cups where the top is wider than the bottom , and not straight cylindrical cups . 
  the vodka will dilute the colour of the drink and make it absorb less light , but it will also increase the height drink that you have to see through . 
  for cylindrical cups the effects cancel each other out . 
  [ beer lambert law on wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/beer%e2%80%93lambert_law ), 
  thanks , i was really wondering why poland was so comfortable with this . 
  poland has a larger acceptance than germany and all other central european and eastern european countries in the poll . 
  not exactly what i 'd expect from the traditional , religious and conservative poland . 
  a pleasant suprise i 'd say . 
  yes it is , animism , spiritualism , ancestor worship etc. 
  are all religions . 
  religion , as a term , is wider than just theist worship . 
  it would n't suprise me if there 's something similar in most of the western world , really . 
  heathen does not equal pagan ( worshipping other gods ) . 
  heathen just means you do n't follow an abrahamic religion , which means heathen includes pagans , as well as atheists . 
  i think the numbers for `` i do n't believe there is any sort of spirit , god or life force . '', 
  is more interesting than `` i believe there is a god . 
  '' , because a lack of belief in a `` god '' does n't really mean a lot if you still believe in some kind of `` spirit '' . 
  you might not identify as christian/muslim / * other * , but believing in spirits and life forces is still a religious stance .

  do we count russia ? 
  it 's a european country , and it does have more railway than germany , it 's just that a lot of that railway is in asia . 
  what happened ? 
  privatization followed by downsizing , or something else ? 
  that map does n't show length of railway networks , but relative density of railway per area . 
  the maps shows km of rail per 1000 square km of area . 
  norway , which has the lowest density , still has a fair length of railway because the area is large . 
  at about 4000 km the norwegian rail system is longer in total length than that of belgium ( about 3600 km ) and not too far off that of switzerland ( about 5300 km ) , but it 's spread out over a much bigger area , so the density number ends up very low . 
  rail network density is still an interesting number , but calling it `` longest railway '' is very misleading .

  couple of points about the entry on norway . 
  the letters \u00c5 \u00c6 \u00d8 are usually presented in the order \u00c6 \u00d8 \u00c5 by norwegians , because that 's the order in which they appear in the norwegian alphabet , at the end , after z. norwegian often uses the local names for foreign locations , if the local language uses the latin alphabet ; and when we do we use the diacritic marks of that language . 
  so cologne is usually marked as k\u00f6ln on norwegian maps and in norwegian encyclopedias . 
  i do n't know if this too niche for \u00f6 to be added to the norwegian entry , but it 's available on norwegian keyboards . 
  the \u00c5 is only about a hundred years old , before which it was written aa , which is still how many names are written , among others the heir to the norwegian throne , his royal highness haakon magnus .

  americanism in a nutshell : affirm my superiority over you assuming you do n't care about it no matter how important it is , set my own country as your lord and saviour , state that we are the origin of you and end up with contempt and denial . 
  nice display . 
  do you live in europe ? 
  how can you judge how europeans feel about this then ? 
  do you really think we `` eat up '' the nsa ? 
  you 're so wrong . 
  does a word like nsa echo anything to you ? 
  i do n't think girls show their bras to everybody in the streets though . 
  your last sentence is quite funny , considering you come from the us . 
  freedom is as important to anglo-saxons as to other european cultures . 
  i see that british never miss an opportunity to dismiss the french ... 
  cute , especially given that french people tend not to give a fuck about their channel neighbours . 
  keep going , it 's definitely the right way . 
  it 's hilarious how many british , and especially the telegraph , bash france free lu and for no reason , and like to think they do the same . 
  `` pernicious anglo-saxons '' , there 's no one who says that here . 
  is that real ? 
  usa close to utopia ? 
  hell i do n't think so . 
  why so quick anger ? 
  he was talking about guillaume le conqu\u00e9rant , duke of normandy who , in 1066 , took over the throne of england . 
  not the hundred-years war ( that was still own by the french in the end , despite several military failures ), 
  it has happened many times in the last 1000 years . 
  we are chill guys . 
  then enlighten us with your almighty knowledge and infinite wisdom . 
  i did n't deny this , and i actually really appreciate this , but saying that they will be on france 's level is overestimating the growth of poland . 
  i 've been saying that poland has a bright future for years ( when i lived in katowice in fact ) , but there is still a large margin . 
  the demography for example is an element to be kept in mind . 
  as / u/seefor said , there is a 27 million people difference between those 2 countries , and poland has a low demographic growth just as other european countries . 
  i completely agree with your point , and i think that building a wall is a tremendously stupid decision . 
  but then , which solution is available ? 
  developed countries are not able to make changes in all those countries who suffer from this type of issues , therefore what is available ? 
  it is so goddamn easy to claim that `` the world is a shitty place '' . 
  indeed , there are many countries in which living conditions are terrible and the governments are oppressive . 
  some people lived in such country , some do n't . 
  on the other hand , there are countries where living is indeed much `` easier '' , thanks to social measures , healthcare , democracy and such . 
  but these countries also face issues . 
  do you believe they should accept to host all those harassed people ? 
  it is simply not possible . 
  here , unlike what several people in this thread seem to think , it 's not about what one thinks , it 's about how you lead a state . 
  now please , stop acting as if you were the great defender of human rights , it 's easy not to mind the complexity of a state 's policy and say that less lucky people are to be accepted without condition . 
  your whole rethoric makes no sense . 
  do you find it normal that some dudes illegally enter a country and then ask for all the advantages this country has to offer ? 
  france already has some problems with housing , unemployment , there is a reason why immigration is regulated . 
  i 've been living in france for 5 years , and i 've never encountered any immigrant like this one . 
  do many ask it the same way as these ones or is it an isolated case ? 
  and americans seem to hate french people due to clich\u00e9s . 
  what are we waiting for !, 
  he 's not mocking the fact that they are looking for human rights , he only points at the absurdity of what those immigrants say . 
  have you read what he wrote or you just picked up the part you needed ? 
  all those articles about how awesome is the uk lately ... that 's a display of british pride or what, 
  therefore 2nd biggest economy in eu ? 
  that would be one hell of a growth, 
  just saying , there is actually a somewhat `` big '' neo-nazi movement in poland . 
  ( not to insult our fellow poles , i 'm half polish ), 
  i would 've never guessed i would one day feel sad because of a publicity about a bus ... 
  but seriously , how do they expect to convince people like that ? 
  communication mistake ... 
  i do n't think that a combined army of the whole eu is doable , unless the european federation comes to be . 
  but more cooperation between countries and rising defense budgets should take place , because they have to face what 's going on and show that they are reactive . 
  i 'm actually for the entrance of norway in the eu . 
  if eastern european countries unite to face the huge threat represents for them ( including actually norway and finland ) , i dare to hope that western europe would not leave them be . 
  even though france and germany really do n't want their relations with russia to worsen , they must take side with countries belonging to the eu and nato . 
  it 's not what i meant . 
  the usa seems much readier to prevent putin from acting , due to their ( obviously ) strong military , long-time rivalry and the threat russia means for american influence ( and likely other reasons ) . 
  i do n't mean that the us is willing to trigger a war . 
  no one wants that . 
  that is terrible ... has there been any demonstration or petition ( or something like that ) to force the us to withdraw from sardinia ? 
  european federation seems the best of a name . 
  federate states of europe sounds too american , as well as use . 
  it 's not completely worthless , because after all in case of a major-scale war they would act , however they are absolutely untrustworthy in their behaviour , and will always follow their own interests no matter of the rest . 
  i fully agree with you . 
  they are just imperialists who are willing to keep control on everything happening . 
  however , i think european countries should invest more in defense , and in the protection of eastern states .

  you 're free to catch fish as long as you adhere to the rules/treaty , though you 're not free to exploit seabed-based resources such as crab . 
  for some inexplicable reason , the eu started to give out quota for crabs , even though they knew that would be in violation of the treaties and agreements between the eu and norway . 
  if they 'd instead talk to us about it , we might have been able to work it out , though the eu instead opted for giving out quotas that were not theirs to give out . 
  if there 's one thing we talk a hard line stance on , it 's illegal fishing . 
  there 's not gon na be more eu vessels fishing in our waters unless we increase the eu quota . 
  that 's probably not going to happen unless the eu stops being [ total asshats ] ( https://thebarentsobserver.com/en/industry-and-energy/2017/01/norway-takes-tough-line-against-eu-svalbard-waters ) when it comes to fishing crabs in our waters . 
  there 's not that much fishing in uk waters by norwegian fishermen . 
  in fact , our own territorial waters provide most of the fish , and we do n't have to share it equally with other eu nations as we 're exempt from the cfp due to our eea agreement . 
  our fish stocks are recovering from the over-fishing prior to the 2000s , though illegal/undocumented fishing by russian vessels are making it difficult to fully implement national regulations on the stocks . 
  a good rule of thumb is to shot the guys yelling `` allahu akbar '' , those are the right guys to shot at 9/10 times . 
  leave the rest alone . 
  well , we bombed the last one out of existence , so we might as well try to get a new one . 
  what a fucking shit show . 
  no wonder , they 're both excellent summer vacation destinations / s, 
  golden boy is starting to look less and less shiny by the day . 
  direct election would also favour bigger countries , you 'd probably end up with a french or german president . 
  it 's very difficult to use direct election as long as the member countries vary so wildly in size . 
  [ grab your chairs people ] ( http://www.reactiongifs.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/thisgonbgud.gif ),

  golden boy is bashing his head against the wall already . 
  i think the first requirement to join is having a cross in your flag, 
  we 've seen both finland and sweden turn towards a more nato-friendly stance lately , when facing a increasingly erratic russia . 
  i 'm sure we could resurrect the proposed [ scandinavian defence union ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/scandinavian_defence_union ) . 
  our forces regularly train together , and a mutual defensive pact against russian aggression would be pretty easy to defend from a political point of view . 
  as to the eu ; yes , it 's one of the major fault lines . 
  we were already on a path towards a nordic union before the eu got in the way . 
  just look at all the cross border agreements/treaties we signed in the 50s and 60s . 
  we had our own mini-schengen with fom and everything way before the eu came along . 
  in the event of a collapse in the eu , we could very quickly move to resurrect the nordic union and get some serious momentum going . 
  i still think we can deepen the nordic cooperation with the eu in the equation and without jumping directly into a `` one country '' scenario . 
  a good place to start would be a nordic defense union , which our prime mister has started to [ lobby for recently ] ( https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-05-29/merkel-s-european-wake-up-call-is-being-answered-in-the-nordics ) . 
  we can also do even more with regards to renewable energy and social issues . 
  the potential is definitely there , it 's just a matter of getting everyone to the table . 
  the eu moves too slowly , and the wide geographical and political span makes it difficult to pass policies that are a perfect fit to the nordic needs . 
  it 's the czech republic ; the police is not gon na shoot a white guy with a gun in the event of a terrorist attack . 
  politically incorrect , i know . 
   there most definitely is a correlation between guns and gun related crime yeah , just like there 's a correlation between cars and car-related deaths . 
  the question is not whether or not guns can be used for crime , it 's whether or not guns increase or decrease the overall level of crime, 
  they need to word it that way to get around the new firearms directive . 
  it has provisions allowing reserve armies to get access to and own firearms that `` normal '' citizens wo n't have access to . 
  by adding a constitutional right/possibility of using private firearms for protection of the state , you 're on paper being made into a militia/reserve military personnel . 
  it 's a way of exploiting the legal loophole to make sure that you actually keep the rights you already have . 
  well , we 're not that politically divided . 
  we 're pretty in tune when it comes to most issues , immigration is probably the one area where the gap between our countries is the biggest ; sweden being the odd one . 
  i hope that we can keep building on the structures we already have within the nordic council , a nordic union/federation would have a population of about 26 million people and be the twelfth largest ( about the size of south korea ) economy in the world . 
  they 've done nothing wrong here . 
  they tried to have the eu wide rules changed , failed to do so , then used one of the legal exemptions granted by the firearms regulation via the constitutional amendment . 
  they 've played ball , and all according to the rules . 
  someone should as the commission to update their website . 
  something tells me they wo n't update that particular page . 
  if the czechs want such an amendment , i see no problem with it . 
  it 's not like they have rampant gun crime to begin with . 
  had n't the eu firearms directive changes been so shit to begin with this would n't have happened . 
   the last time you turned us into danes yeah , sorry about that . 
  turns out our negotiators were pretty shit . 
  i can guarantee you it would n't happen again . 
  give him a couple of more minutes , moving goal posts is a tedious process . 
  i 'm sure he 'll come up with a definition that makes him right . 
  another building block added to the nordic union . 
  you 're very welcome back into the fold if you want to . 
  we prefer to do math on big numbers by comparing it to the oil fund . 
  google 's fine is about 1/400th of an oil fund . 
  sounds cheap . 
  sure , why not . 
  they 're fair game . 
  eu states have backed initial steps for the european commission to negotiate the legal future of the nord stream 2 gas pipeline with russia . 
  `` the mandate was given '' , anna-kaisa itkonen , an eu commission spokeswoman , told euobserver on tuesday ( 27 june ) . 
  pablo micallef , a spokesman for the maltese eu presidency , said `` some 13 '' member states endorsed the plan when eu energy ministers met for informal talks in brussels on monday . 
  maros sefcovic , the eu energy commissioner , who drafted the proposal , told the reuters news agency : `` i 'm definitely optimistic about getting the [ formal ] mandate , but i know this is just the beginning of the debate . '', 
  the danish energy minister , lars christian lilleholt , who was among the 13 eu backers , said : `` i 'm very satisfied . 
  it was the best thing that could have come out of the meeting '' . 
  from 2020 , nord stream 2 is to concentrate 70 percent of russian gas supplies to europe in one route to germany under the baltic sea . 
  but its critics , which include the nordic states , the baltic countries , poland , and the us , say it would harm eu energy security and undermine ukraine , a western ally , by making ukrainian transit pipelines obsolete . 
  eu laws itkonen said the commission wanted to talk to russia on whether the offshore part of nord stream 2 should be covered by the eu 's so-called third energy package . 
  that eu law would oblige russian state firm gazprom to open up its nord stream 2 monopoly to eu competitors - a demand which derailed a previous russian project , the south stream pipeline under the black sea to bulgaria . 
  but itkonen said `` it is not about a [ commission ] veto , it is not about the future of the pipeline , not about the commission approving it or not '' . 
  she said the commission-russia talks would be designed to give `` legal certainty '' on nord stream 2 and that they would be `` nothing spectacular or extraordinary '' because eu officials had held similar talks with `` third countries '' on other projects . 
  the incoming estonian eu presidency is expected to convene a working group to take things forward . 
  the mandate will then have to be formally approved by a `` reinforced qualified majority '' vote by member states , a higher than usual threshold of 72 percent of eu countries representing 65 percent of its population . 
  regulation monopoly the nord stream 2 regulatory framework is currently being negotiated between germany and russia . 
  german , austrian , french , and anglo-dutch firms - uniper , wintershall , omv , engie , and shell - are to take part in the project , with germany and austria keen to press ahead . 
  neither the german nor the austrian minister took the floor on monday , eu sources told reuters , but germany and austria recently attacked the us over its threat to impose sanctions on nord stream 2 investors . 
  `` we decide who supplies us with energy and how they do it '' , the german and austrian foreign ministers said in a joint statement on 15 june . 
  pavlo klimkin , the ukrainian foreign minister , told reuters in paris on monday that nord stream 2 `` would have disastrous consequences for the energy security of the european union and would make the eu dependent on one source . '', 
  `` maybe some companies will benefit for the time being , but in the long-run it will lead nowhere '' , he said . 
  he added that there was no progress on getting russia to cease hostilities in east ukraine . 
  `` how can you trust russia in setting up a unique source of gas supply ? '' , he said , referring to eu and us concerns over russia 's aggressive behaviour toward neighbouring states . 
  it would not surprise me if the current us administration decides to play tit for tat . 
  thanks , that made it real clear to me . 
  let 's wait and see what happens to her if the progress party fails to make it into government again later this year . 
  the party consists of tw.o , about equally sized wings , one is the small state , libertarian wing , the other is the national conservative , `` reverse the migrant flow '' wing . 
  jensen is a part of the first wing , and her replacement may very well come from the other wing . 
  yeah , if you were to follow the rules , but as is always the case with the eu ; rules are flexible , and exceptions are granted willy-nilly if the right country asks . 
  do n't forget our crazy , white , uber-christian guy . 
  then again , he was a reaction to muslim immigration , so you could agree that without that , it would n't have happened ; not fair , but you could . 
  yet another case of not applying the rules . 
  how about they change the rules if they have to keep granting permission to skirt around them all the time . 
  they 're obviously not fit for function if it 's a case of granting exemptions over and over again . 
  looks like someone poured a casserole over some pasta they pulled out from the back of the fridge .

  the us has a great influence in pop-culture . 
  since we are unbeaten in football against brazil , that is not a good choice either . 
  well , i 'm 1/8th russian so in many ways , russian perhaps even though that influence stems back over a hundred year , before the revolution . 
  we are more influenced by the surrounding countries than some far away country . 
   biggest news might be that it snowed in parts of the country ... wow - has never happened before !, 
  amazing !, 
  but it would have been news had it snowed where i am now , florida .

  south is richer also due to tourism , which is strange in some ways as turkey has a lot of tourism and the south of turkey is a very beautiful area well worth visiting . 
  ikea - but they are difficult to assemble !, 
  or maybe it 's due to more honest reporting also ? 
  that is always a step toward better times , acknowledging the problem and then trying to do something about it . 
  it 's been a long time since i visited romania , it was during the cold war and it was a big shock in many ways coming from hungary to romania even during those days . 
  the difference between the countries behind the curtain were great , romania was one of those who suffered the worst but still , as a country , romania has a lot to offer , esp in the area of tourism and should be able to , with a decent government , to lift itself out of poverty over time . 
  well . . 
  lets be honest . 
  romanians have not exactly had an easy life in the 20th century under ceau\u0219escu and the soviets so i am not surprised it takes time to change . 
  it will change for romania , i 'm sure about that given time . 
   we should be looking for 1gbps in all the major areas by that time if we 're to compete in the emerging high bandwidth economy .

  well , i do n't know the address , i just want to know where they have coverage but the company can not tell me this so i have to sit and manually enter hundreds of addresses in order to try to find where their service is .

  europe needs two eu 's - one for the northern countries and one for the southern countries .

  looks great but falls apart when used !, 
  i got mine for free in the military ( or next to free , think the actual cost was around 10 euros ) . 
  ok , the maldives it is then !,

  the problem is not that the eu is not changing , it changes all the time . 
  sadly , instead of focusing on their rotting and weak foundation , they chose to at yet another floor to the building , so that we all can marvel the greatness of the project . 
  a collapse of the eu would without a doubt cause significant harm , and that 's why it 's important that it starts changing for the better right now , and do n't postpone until they 're forced to act . 
  sadly , that seems to be the only way the eu works , a crisis is only acted upon when it becomes impossible to ignore it . 
  by that time i fear that the eu has lost so much credibility that saving the remains will not the viable anymore . 
  a want a united europe , either as a federal state or as a collection of states that respect one another and accommodates their needs . 
  a structure that allows us to act on the world stage with great effect and belief that we can speak for overselves . 
  i do n't want an eu that increasingly is the sum of politicians and unelected officials cooking up something behind closed doors and is unable to admit shortcomings . 
   leaving schengen however is really not that big of a deal , let alone for a country that joined late 2008 and probably still has most of the infrastructure in place . 
  it 's definitely smaller in scope , but it also entails picking apart to entities that are intertwined . 
  it 's like a pair of siamese twins sharing pinky toe . 
  leaving the eu is like spliting siamese twins which share almost all vital organs and functions . 
  a clean break is difficult , and one of them will probably get hurt in the process . 
  they 're free the set taxes to whatever they like , as long as no single company is given preferential treatment . 
  they can either lobby to change that , or leave the union . 
  they did sign up to the treaties , with all perks and drawbacks they entail . 
  i 'm no big fan of the eu , and would like the see it changed dramatically or just be removed , but in this case i 'm in total agreement with the commission . 
  you ca n't have a working capitalism based economy when big companies are given so big perks that competitors have no way to compete . 
  i do n't care how good or cheap your products are , a 12.5 % taxrate vs 0.005 % is in no way fair . 
  it has not . 
  the eu is not opposed to low taxes , they are however against companies being given preferential treatment . 
  the problem is not that apple paid so little , but that they got their own personal tax rate not accessible to other companies . 
  people get just as emotional about schengen and the eea as they get about the eu and the euro . 
  i do n't understand their emotional connection to entirely unnatural , politician engineered institutions . 
  some people talk about the eu and its institutions as if they 're here to stay for another millenia . 
  newsflash ; they 're not . 
  europe is limping along with a series of political structures that work okayish at their best , and are outright damaging at their worst . 
  we 're currently seeing the rise of eu-sceptical parties across europe , and yet the response of the eu leaders is to prescribe more of what people are upset about . 
  if you 're worried about the eu , you 're told that you simply do n't understand it , that you 're stupid , ignorant and egotistical . 
  no one in senior ranking eu positions , possible tusk excluded , seem to understand the plights of european citizens . 
  they fail to see how their project is not building more understanding and respect among eu members , but is in fact creating massive tensions along the west and the east and north and south . 
  i honestly believe that the eu will render itself less significant in the time to come , either by handing more power back in a controlled manner , or by simply disintegrating over time . 
  it 's sad , because i like parts of the ideas behind the eu , but the way its implemented is slowly rotting away its support . 
  i love how the people who keep saying `` if you do n't like the eu/schengen/eea / whatever , leave ! '', 
  go absolutely mental when a country actually leaves . 
  then leaving suddenly becomes a doomsday scenario with hell and eternal damanation upon those who leave . 
  it 's just like a cult , everyone who breaks out is the devil personified and must pay . 
  yep , we 're not in the eu though , so it appears that that particular law/regulation is outside the scope of the treaties and deals we signed . 
  what , is ham haram or something ? 
  scandinavian countries , perhaps excluding denmark , have long hunting and sports shooting traditions .

  by restricting the rights of law-abiding citizens the terrorists will somehow , almost magically , be deprived of access to weapons , even though they rarely go through the hoops of acquiring one legally . 
  i understand her need and wish to be vague , seeing that there 's a long period of negotiation ahead , but i still feel that `` brexit means brexit '' is a bit of a silly statement . 
  it 's vague enough that everyone can interpret it as they wish , and probably be pleased if they voted leave , but it 's also so vague that she can claim to have delivered almost regardless of what kind of deal she gets . 
   * people suggesting staying the eu but with slightly different terms  * people who want eea membership and free movement these to basically boil down to the uk leaving the single market and accepting some kind of free-trade deal , unless the eu is willing to compromise on free movement of people . 
  the cornerstone of the leave campaign message was reduced migration , with full control , and to win back sovereignty . 
  joining eea and accepting freedom of movement would go directly against that , and would only lay the foundation for further political instability down the line . 
  the rise of ukip put enough pressure on cameron to promise a referendum . 
  ukip may have lost its most important figure when farage left , but if the uk does n't fully leave the eu , i expect it or other similar movements to gain even more traction . 
  a50 was put in place to silence the critics saying that an eu membership was a one way street , and that countries that joined have given up sovereignty permanently . 
  a50 is the bare minimum they had to put in the treaty to be able to say that one can leave after becoming a member . 
  sure , it seems like she has backbone and is intent to carry through what the british people voted for . 
  i 'd still like to know exactly how she defines brexit ? 
  saying brexit means brexit is a useless tautology . 
  in that case , ask the commission to pull the plug on further negotiations , they used to a have unanimous support , that no longer exists . 
   what do you do with people who get rejected ? 
  we try to either deport them back to their country of origin , or to a country where they 're legally allowed to live . 
  in some cases we pay for them to go home , with a one time finciancal support og approx 2200 euros . 
  making them leave voluntarily is much cheaper than to charter a plane to kabul and fill it with migrants and police officers . 
   is russia taking them back ? 
  some , those with a permanent or time limited right to stay in russia . 
  russia refuses taking back those that transited using vacation or study visas , claiming they 're not entitled to enter russia again , as they violated the terms of their visas . 
  it does n't really matter anymore , since the border with russia has been sealed off for those without schengen visas , which basically no syrians or other migrants/refugees have . 
  those that came via russia is currently getting their applications assessed , a large portion of those who came via russia are iraqis , pakistanis and afghan . 
  currently less than 5 % of pakistanis and iraqis are given asylum and almost everyone who is denied asylum is sent back . 
  the police 's foreign service , which carries out the deportations , have been allocated a unlimited budget for deportations , and they expect to carry out at least 9000 deportations this year . 
  we expect about 3000-5000 asylum seekers this year , so we 're likley going to send more out than we get in . 
  when you cosign a loan you also take on the legal responsibility for it . 
  i 'm not sure that same legal guarantee exists within the eu funding framework , legal experts have to look into it . 
  we really should 've actually planned for what happens when a member leaves , instead of only having a50 . 
  if the uk manages to run away from the bill , they 're not to blame , a bad treaty is to be blamed . 
  the police has been given authority to rule that the application is to be found non-conforming with our international obligations . 
  they do n't rule on the application itself , just that the person in question should have applied in the country they came from and is denied access to the kingdom on account of not having a schengen visa . 
  the practice may very well be illegal , but the current plan is to keep the contingency in place until either the un , eu or another international body kicks up a fuss . 
  the police do n't currently use the new law , but it will be put into practice if the flow suddenly increases . 
  they 've also changed to law so that anyone who claims asylum and is likely to be denied can be detained by the police until the application is processed , those denied will have a week to appeal and will then be deported . 
  keeping them locked up ensure they do n't run away once the application is denied . 
  no , i do n't . 
  you keep making this into the uk benefiting from eu prosjects just like everyone else , and sonehow they should still keep paying ? 
  this . 
  the uk has always espoused a reduced eu budget , and had they won that battle , the current funding hole would be much less severe, 
  as i 've said , if the uk gains benefits beyond everyone outside the eu , i expect them to pay for it , if not they should not be made to pay . 
  i 'm just pointing out that galileo can be used by anyone with a receiver , whether or not their country payed in   galileo is open and can be used by individuals in countries that never contributed any money ,  i do n't want to get vengeful . 
  they should still have access . 
  so what 's the problem ? 
  the uk pays the last bill for that period when they leave , and they retain access just like any other country . 
  galileo is open and can be used by individuals in countries that never contributed any money , just like the american gps . 
  i 'm fine with uk being denied limited functions on galileo if they stop funding it . 
  not if they do n't get any use out of them . 
  if they have to continue funding the projects , i expect them to get some sort of concession . 
  a50 makes it possible to withdraw , the lawmakers should probably have written texts that gave some direction as to how future obligations are to be covered . 
  it 's fair that the uk pays for anything they make use of , and nothing else . 
  it 's not the uk 's fault that the treaties do n't address specifics .

it 's not . 
  most people just does n't know what it means .

  oh it 's only a third of muslims that are radical , i guess that 's ok then ... 
  the migrant crisis has only just begun . 
  it can , but it wo n't , sinse so many are already starving . 
  do you really think hunger wo n't be an issue when there will be 4 billion people in africa ? 
  more people will die in the mediterranean . 
  when stories like these spread it will make every refugee want to go to germany .

  then no . 
  you do n't think it 's even problematic that a big portion of muslims do n't support things like free speech and freedom of religion ? 
  these are the cornerstones of western civilisation . 
  but what meaning ? 
  well there 's seem to be clash between a sizable portion of muslims religious belief and western democratic values . 
  poll of british muslims : http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk/6309983.stm  36 % of 16 to 24-year-olds believe if a muslim converts to another religion they should be punished by death , compared with 19 % of over-55s, 
  what are you trying to say ? 
  do you consider the opinion of muslims being harder to integrate unwarranted ? 
  do you consider this a hate thread ? 
  finally someone makes this point . 
  we have no right to mock sweden for staying neutral during ww2 . 
  does it really ? 
  is this the general opinion on the nordic languages ? 
  have you considered that the one religion which have isis on their side is not he one true religion ? 
  why do you think god or allah made isis in his own religion and not others ?

  buddhists are tecnically atheists , mate . 
  yeah i have watched some debates and trump seems to be the only one that do n't want to fight assad 's regime in syria ( a russian ally ) , but only wants to focus on isis . 
  or `` would prefer trump to lead the states over hillary '' to be even more pedantic .

  with that being said , i think russia 's song was n't very good either . 
  how can this system possibly be any worse than the previous one ?

  only in the last 5 years i have noticed a visual change in the architecture landscape . 
  when i grew up most of norway looked like the 70s ( in the 90s ) with commie blocks etc. 
  now large parts of norway , most cities and even roads are clean , `` polished '' and beautiful .

  but as you say , `` average rich nordic country that accidentally became extra wealthy somewhere in the last century . '', 
  seems to be totally fitting for this development . 
  while norway have always been rich , lately we 've been dubai-rich and that has finally started showing in the landscape as well . 
  you could n't breathe the wealth ten years ago , but now you can in every single county of norway . 
  also i 've only visited one part of switzerland ( ticino ) , not even containing one of the larger cities so i could be wrong in saying that switzerland as a whole has that vibe to it , but ticino does at least . 
  if i 'm wrong then they fit the class i consider norway and denmark part of . 
  with us being one of the least densely populated countries in the world ( 14 pr km2 ) there should be a lot of places like that . 
  none,

  probably a very unpopular opinion , but nevertheless my opinion from my experience that i know i share with many norwegians . 
  i do n't know if this is a thing in other countries , but in norway we call countries u-land and i-land meaning utviklingsland ( development countries ) and industriland ( industry countries ) . 
  u land is the lesser and i-land is modern , developed etc. 
  so u-land generally includes african countries for example . 
  coming from norway to a foreign country , * almost * any country in the world feels like a u-land compared to norway . 
  the only exception i can think of would be denmark . 
  now i have n't been to all the countries , but i 've been to nearly all of europe and north-america and to me scandinavia as a whole is several steps ahead . 
  even switzerland has that u feel to it . 
  i 'm not saying germany , uk etc are like somalia . 
  but if there were more classes than `` u '' and `` i '' , something above `` i '' then we would fit in there while the rest of the modern , western world would fit the description i-land . 
  now this is purely subjectiv and something many norwegians agree on but also a thing that 's not at all spoken about because it 's an unpopular meaning . 
  if you look at the past 17 [ human development indexes ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/human_development_index ) you 'll see that norway is mostly in a league of it 's own with not even number two being close so there is some hard facts to back this up too . 
  so yes , [ it 's extremely taboo to say in norway ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/law_of_jante ) but i feel that i live in a better country . 
  ** regarding the oil money ** i see many people here crediting norways success to . 
  we 've been among the top countries in female rights , gay rights , progressive laws , `` democracy '' , gdp per capita and several others for the last 200 years since the union with denmark seized and we stopped waging war and started building our country while the rest of europe continued fighting eachother and themselves . 
  the oil money have n't been used directly either since 2001 . 
  so to say it 's thanks to the oil is just wrong , look at the rest of the nordics with similar history , similar culture and similar constitutions - all have succeded with or without oil . 
  edit : typos, 
  even earlier too , at least in norways case . 
  same goes for social security , `` democracy '' , progressive laws etc. 
  statistically we 've been among the top countries since the 1800s .

  there is small a western separatism in norway , it 's far fetched but i believe most western norwegians would like it if it ever became a serious matter . 
  the main argument is that almost all of norways money is made in western norway and should stay in western norway . 
  also there are some minor cultural differences too . 
  but this has never been taken serious and it 's not a real separatist movement like in scotland or catalonia .

  after that they have pretty much faded away again , unfortunately . 
  sure was fun to watch . 
  it 's not building roads that 's the problem , but maintaining them . 
  low temperatures makes roads crack and most of norway has temperatures below 0 for half a year during the night which means that every night for about 6 months the ground freezes and cracks . 
  most of norway freezes during winter , which also is far longer in norway than countries further south . 
  because of this instability weather-wise we have to use winter tires for half the year which is n't exactly healthy for roads . 
  add on top of this a shit ton of rain and snow , a mountain to drive around , through or over every now and again it 's pretty understandable that roads are shit here . 
  the only way money could solve this is by inventing some asphalt that does n't crack in low temperatures and can withstand our weather .

  also most other ski-related sports are pretty big . 
  luckily the new highway ( rogfast ) will have 110 most parts between kristiansand and trondheim . 
  and east of kristiansand there already is 110 km/h ( i think ) so hopefully 90km/h will soon be a thing og the past . 
  you try building roads in a country as mountainous as norway with winters at -30 and summers at +25 degrees . 
  keeping 90 km/h on the highway , you can easily cruise along in 100 or 110 without anyone batting an eye . 
  ( highways in the west have a 90 km/h limit ) .

  the black market ? 
  there are jobs that are exempt from taxation , but i do n't think they 'd be included . 
  this conversation gave me a knot in my neurons . 
  in norway we pay 6 cents per kwh today . 
  this is because 99 % of our electricity is hydro , which is very cheap . 
  however , it 's somewhat variable . 
  if our water reserves dries up in the summer , we will have to import some of the power . 
  but it 's basically ridiculously cheap anyway . 
  i imagine there 'd be a stigma for eating it exclusively all the damn time , as you should . 
  oh yes , it 's tasty . 
  if it was n't for the stigma , that 's all i 'd eat ever . 
  but i can agree that it 's pretty heavy . 
  however i only eat a lot when i have time to prepare a proper breakfast . 
  two slices of bread is enough usually . 
  and i 'm sure there are a lot of diverse types of breakfast in norway due to cultural differences . 
  this is possibly a rural western-norwegian thing . 
  i eat bread too , but it has to be dark . 
  scrambled eggs , or sliced cooked eggs with mayonnaise ; salty meats , like m\u00f4r / m\u00f8r , which is a smoked and cured sausage , or fenal\u00e5r which is popular now around christmas ( and delicious ! ), 
  - it is from slow-cured lambs leg ; cheese , brown and white ; salmon ; a glass of milk . 
  this is a breakfast guaranteed to make me happy , it is * not * every breakfast . 
  i 'm hungry now . 
   ice-cubes are perfectly acceptable in whiskey . 
  do whatever you want to do , but do n't tell that to a whisky-connoiseur . 
  after travelling and couchsurfing in europe - there 's much disgusting breakfast to be eaten . 
  pre-sliced white bread with jam or chocolate crap on them , and a glass of sugary orange juice . 
  it makes for a horrible start of the day . 
  personally , i find it really weird . 
  breakfast is the best meal . 
  must be eaten properly .

  incredible . 
  i know it 's bad to speculate , i just wanted to point out that the roads in norway truly are staggeringly bad and narrow at points . 
  i assume the logistics work so well partly because the infrastructure obviously would be strengthened where they are most important for logistics ? 
  also , roads are only part of the scale , perhaps ship traffic in norway also compensates for the difficult geography ? 
  i ca n't find more detailed information on my phone unfortunately and i know jack shit about the science of logistics . 
  i 'm guessing mostly because the roads in scandinavia are really horrible . 
  at least norway , i have n't checked out every nook and cranny of sweden but getting from a to b in norway is a nightmare and i 'm convinced the trucks that are driving on norwegian roads are actually magic trucks . 
  you can also take a look up the hillsides ( if it shows on these pictures , i 'm not so sure ) , which shows very squared patches of pine trees . 
  i believe this is due to farmers planting them thickly on their patch of land after they stopped farming there . 
  there was also a huge planting initiative post wwii to make the country more self-sufficient . 
  in many places on the west coast you can see pines that are the same size and planted conscientiously in a consecutive order . 
  i like to think that it 's because of the fact that it was military men who were set out to plant them . 
  well , how about those glaciers . 
  military has taken over , source : the military ? 
  come on edit : seems like it was only a part of the military too , 
  use good tomatoes ? 
  hah , in scandinavia we only eat tomatoes that are beige and taste like wet paper .

  how selfless of them , caring about the environment and everything !, 
  sounds like your examples are way out of context , and your slope is also very slippery . 
  however , the right to bear arms thing is a more legitimate argument , because it becomes a discussion of philosophical rather than purely criminological/psychological matters . 
  however , i personally do not at all hold the right to bear arms highly . 
  if only the world was more like / r/askscience . 
  no speculation or anecdotal evidence allowed . 
  that 's the things i find most frustrating about certain such popular attitudes .

  it 's fucking beautiful and i 'm even a bit sick if fjords . 
  also , male circumcision might not involve chopping the head of the penis off , but you do n't have to remove the clitoris for it to be qualified as female * genital mutilation * either . 
  so basically , the statement is both ignorant * and * fucked up . 
  i know of this . 
  however , it 's a poor substitute seeing that the glans is already hardened and the nerve endings are gone . 
  the function of the foreskin wo n't come back . 
  it will be mostly cosmetic . 
  it 's not the same . 
  parents are necessary . 
  also , the child has a right to parental responsibility , and parents can be seen as `` providers of parental responsibility '' . 
  doctors , or psychologists or other trained professionals * do * decide if the child benefits from parental responsibility . 
  also , even if it were relevant , then just because something inevitably violates the right of self-ownership does n't mean that everything else should . 
  a circumcision is irreversible and should be a choice the child makes when it is old enough . 
  after all , it 's the child 's body . 
  so no it 's not best to leave the parents alone . 
  besides , the parents ca n't just decide what 's necessary . 
  that 's up to the doctors . 
  no , cutting hair and nails is both necessary and reversible . 
  an early abortion ( please excuse the bad wording ) is aborting a fetus which is biologically dependent on the mother . 
  this is the most common view . 
  however , the arbitrary line of 12th week ( for example ) is used . 
  but medical necessity still allow them later . 
  it 's all about the right to self-ownership . 
  that 's what allows early abortions and disallows circumcision . 
  thus , there is no contradiction . 
  smile and nod , smile and nod ...

  the integration of their economies and supply lines . 
  the growth of poland as an economy and leader for the eastern block . 
  the shift eastwards with the opening up of ukraine and belarus and potentially a western looking russian regime . 
  germany also shifting eastwards if/when the uk leaves the eu . 
  germany being the european country who is most keen on having a pragmatic relationship with putins russia . 
  also germany and poland just may be culturally more compatable than most people think . 
  eastern germany once being the part of slavic heartland and half of poland being under various german empires ( lets not mention that last one ) . 
  poland will not be as conservative as it is now when the new generation grows up and the old kicks the bucket . 
  i did not of course mean `` tomorrow '' literally , i am thinking decades . 
  tomorrow it is germany and poland, 
  while i do n't think the eu regulations is that choking for the uk economy . 
  but ut would be cool if uk would be willing to be a test bed for economic ideas . 
  i am not being facetious here . 
  it would really benefit our undertanding of economy . 
  what would happen if corperate tax was 10 % and so on ? 
  also these people are more religious , which means they are more likely to vote akp . 
  they would also vote akp because it was the party that gave them citizenship . 
  also they would flock to the big cities , where his party is weaker . 
  all in all a smart move if you are a sociopath politican . 
  no internal borders means you have to really watch your external borders . 
  the eu needs to get its act together fast . 
  it is not really understandable that people keep eating too much food until they get fat , have low life quality and die early . 
  still it happens all the time and because of that it is understandable why there are fat people all over the place . 
  they might have been treated well as elite soldiers . 
  but kidnapping children from parents seems like a bad practicve anyway , even if they ended up living a better life than they would in a village in serbia ? 
  how would you like if someone rich from qatar came and took your son ? 
  how would you argue if someone said it was ok , because they were treated well in qatar ? 
  it can and it is in my book . 
  but still it was an empire and a lot of turkish politicians just ca n't seem to fathom that living under the fear of ottoman invasion for 500 years might make some people sceptical of turkey . 
  i am not saying that it is rational for say austrians or hungarians to be sceptical of modern day turkey . 
  but is pretty understandable that those sentiments exists considering human mentality and previous history . 
  well there is no doubt that the european greater powers did that . 
  ditto with the arab tribes . 
  but there had to be nationalistic/tribal sentiments there to begin with which they could build up under . 
  i guess where turkish nationalists and others differ ( including myself ) , is whether serbs and arabs had any right to independence from the empire . 
  just like a lot of british could not see how anyone would not want to be a part of their empire . 
  what do you mean by `` christian minority '' here ? 
  christians living in anatolia ( like greeks and armenians ) or christian colonial populations like serbs etc ? 
  or both ? 
  well it seems that turkey sometimes forgets that it was a colonial power which had a quarter of europe under its boot and half of europe living in fear , for hundreds of years . 
  and the fact that they controlled the mediterranean sea with both its imperial fleet and pirates protected by it , who made raids as far as iceland and ireland . 
  take out the audio-jack from your computer/phone and put it back in halfway . 
  this will position the output of the left channel on the reader of the right channel . 
  fantastic place , but too barren to be called `` paradise '' . 
  what about kafelonia ? 
  i do n't think it was so obvious that noone would try to take ownership/leadership of the process . 
  no nation joined the ussr voluntairly , not even russia . 
  it was decided by civil war . 
  guess i should have been more specific . 
  i meant having influence in the eu parliament . 
  we sit at the table when discussing new propsals etc. 
  there are plenty of norwegians bureaucrats in brussels . 
  because norway pay for access to the single market , adheres to the single market rules , we are a de-facto member of eu without representation in the eu parliament . 
  which means it is a choice between the illusion of independence vs having influence in the eu . 
  most people would rather live in the illusion . 
  not according to this : http://infacts.org/norwegians-pay-same-brits-eu-access/, 
  i do n't think the uk-leavers is going for what us norwegians have . 
  they do not wish to be a part of the single market , they just want a basic free trade agreement . 
  they just do n't wan na send any money out of the country . 
  let 's hope nobody tells them that they finance 5 % of the un . 
  so we do n't have to read about the unxit . 
  most likely https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/anatolian_rock, 
  because they are the most vulnerable segment of our society . 
  well , there is not alot of radiohead there to begin with . 
  oh this man child again . . 
  common market ! = free trade or am i missing something ? 
  it is something more , it is institutions like esa ? 
  i do n't think the uk will be denied a free trade agreement , but rather by not being part of the common market it can not plead to eu instituions and vice versa , those institutions can not be used against the uk . 
  so british telecom could be denied buying a romanian carrier . 
  i think this is the real strength of the european union , not some half assed free trade agreement . 
  but the internal integration of economic production . 
  i do n't think the average norwegian voter knows that we are a de-facto member of the eu . 
  if the uk decides to leave and brussels would stop being a scapegoat , would the nationalists then create an internal scapegoat ? 
  immigrants perhaps ? 
  i am saying this is a reason for staying , but it would be interesting to see . 
  not sure if trolling or not ... 
  the boom is there , but the scale masks it . 
  the scale is streched out to fit englands line . 
  remember england going from 10m to 20m , is the same growth as scottland going from 2m to 4m . 
  but it does seem like england has a stronger boom also adjusted for relative population sizes . 
  i guess that is immigration at work . 
  both from aboard and within the uk . 
  the police caught the man carrying the box in the immigrant district . 
  if it was indeed a bomb , we do not know where he was taking it . 
  i am thinking it is one of two things . 
  overzealous cops after stockholm or that they had this guy under surveillance and ` accidentally ' caught him when he left his flat with a box . 
  she was speaking to a group of turkish students in sweden . 
  she was asked how immigrants best could integrate into swedish culture and what swedish culture was in the first place . 
  digging some more , i see that she continued the statement with saying that democracy , tolerance and women 's rights were important aspects of swedish culture , but she would rather see them as common culture/values of all swedes , regardless of their ethnicity and not a part of the native culture . 
  they do n't think all cultures are equal . 
  take mona sahlin , former leader of the social democrats who said this : `` i think that 's what makes many swedes jealous of immigrant groups . 
  you have a culture , an identity , a history , something that brings you together . 
  and what do we have ? 
  we have midsummer 's eve and such silly things . '', 
  - mona sahlin in a speech to the turkish youth organization euroturk , march , 2002 . 
  what about the syrians that erdogan will ( according to himself ) give citizenship to ? 
  europe is already the ussr , have you learned nothing during the brexit referendum ? 
  in general muslims also have a stronger ingroup/outgroup mentality . 
  her name by birth is melissa colakovic and she was a participant in the norwegian version of the `` top model '' tv-show . 
  you know people have been properly brain washed when they feel that they have to change their name .

  for example all the songs on the lastest katy perry album is produced by swedes . 
  in that case i 'll mention [ norway 's `` stargate '' ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/stargate_\\ ( production_team \\ ) ) : - 1999 : `` s club party '' ( s club 7 ) - 1999 : `` always come back to your love '' ( samantha mumba ) - 1999 : `` two in a million '' ( s club 7 ) - 2000 : `` day & night '' ( billie piper ) - 2000 : `` mama - who da man ?

  interestingly , [ yesterday and today we agree ( d ) on two things . 
  no dispute from me either ; just pointing out facts for the other readers , 
  naturally most people live in the big cities everywhere . 
  the number of people who drive long distances in norway/sweden are greater than in denmark . 
  we maintain a strong rural policy , so people continue to live all over the country here . 
  another difference and factor is terrain ; denmark is almost flat , here we have mountains . 
  it takes 7-9 hrs to drive from my home city to oslo by car , but just 45 mins by air . 
   norway , sweden , and denmark do n't differ much by urbanisation rate the numbers do n't quite agree , there is some difference : - denmark 86.9 % - sweden 85 % - norway 79 % those percentage points between ~ 87 % and 79 % matter . 
   if you live in a city , you can ride a bike ; no matter how much hinterland there is that 's probably true for many cities , it 's a bit more difficult during winter here . 
  copenhagen is not like troms\u00f8 or ume\u00e5 . 
   i guess it 's because of bicycles . 
  sure , you do n't need cars as much , but you 're comparing apples and oranges . 
  your * whole * country could fit inside one of our largest counties ( finnmark  denmark ) . 
  sweden is even larger than norway again . 
   he certainly wrote it in swedish is n't it 's more likely to be in old norse ? 
  the language that was spoken by inhabitants of scandinavia during the viking age . 
  it was mentioned in the video that he had it translated ( futhark ) . 
  most runestones were created around 950-1100 , and at the time old norse was the dominant [ language ( s ) in our region ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a2/old_norse%2c_ca_900.png/1024px-old_norse%2c_ca_900.png ) ( red and orange ), 
  [ map of sunshine hours in europe ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f8/europe_sunshine_hours_map.png ), 
  i 'm afraid wikipedia does n't cover the topic very well . 
  i would even claim it 's misleading to some degree . 
   h\u00f8yre seems to lean left with feminism and egalitarianism hehe , there is very little `` feminism '' as such , it 's just utilizing our resources optimally ( men and women ) . 
  we 've made investements in their education , society should maximize the return ( roi ) . 
  it 's a global trend ; women have overtaken men in many countries in higher education ( in % numbers ) . 
  another example includes providing cheap kindergartens for all children in the country . 
  it makes it easier for married and single citizens to work full time , while our gdp and productivity increases . 
  it 's not feminism , it 's economics . 
   the fremskrittspartiet is anti-immigration that 's just not correct , unfair and very misleading . 
  they 're far from pro-immigration , but there is * no * immigration policy in norway . 
  outside of marriage and asylum there is no access [ from outside the eu/eea ] . 
  the party is ** not ** hostile to immigrants , but it does make demands that new residents and refugees * integrate * fully ( learning the language , our culture and laws ) . 
  in the past they had a * fringe * of members with less than `` open '' minds , they were kicked out of the party decades ago . 
  do n't make the mistake of comparing frp with jobbik ( hungary ) . 
  yes , it 's a strange party , but it 's clearly a populist/protest party . 
  a result of our abundant wealth and lack of problems ? 
   the party also has some connections with the american tea party movement those connections are about as solid as salt in water . 
  norway is so far left of the us in general that we might as well be `` communists '' . 
  h\u00f8yre is a member of the [ international democrat union ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/international_democrat_union ) along with the us republican party . 
  we have little in common in practise . 
   identical to all other '' conservative '' parties in europe ? 
  i 'm sorry , but you really do n't know norway at all . 
  as a member of said party in norway , i 'd love to hear how we resemble `` neo-con '' parties in europe . 
  politics in social-democratic scandinavia do n't even remotely resemble your country 's . 
  here 's an example of how progressive my party actually is : [ video ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ioe3dewje0q#t=88 ) or [ text ] ( http://stopspending.org/ansgar-gabrielsen-the-father-of-the-women39s-quota-comes-from-norway/ ), 
  your lack of knowledge of norway in particular is highly amusing !, 
  `` oligarchs '' in norway , hahaha !, 
  read a book . 
  the grants in question are handed out * only * because the eu ** requires ** us to pay for market access !, 
  you sound like a complete fool claiming norway 's buying influence in hungary . 
  listen , it * fails * to qualify as imperialism because it in no way extends norway 's power and influence in hungary . 
  - hungarian organizations working for hungary 's society is not giving norway anything at all !, 
  it 's building hungary for hungarians . 
  there is no political bias or political parties involved in the eea grants . 
  there is no `` left wing '' focus as you claim . 
  when will you * get * that central fact ? 
  norway is currently ruled by conservative right-wing coalition government . 
   correct me if i 'm wrong but is n't that a form of imperialism ? 
  okay , i 'll correct you . 
  - imperialism : '' * a policy of extending a country 's power and influence through colonization , use of military force , or other means * . '', 
  which of these do you believe norway 's funding of hungarian civil society falls under ? 
  we 're not `` importing '' anything , or exporting , these are ** hungarian ** people 's organizations in hungary . 
  they exist , so we give them money . 
  it 's on the government 's public website in norwegian and english . 
  it 's old news to me ... 
  what 's `` cash '' ? 
  i found some round , flat pieces of metal once . 
  they did n't fit in my card wallet . 
  no , as it 's not a trade barrier for non-danish companies ? 
  the eu citizen visiting denmark does n't have any rights to pay in his currency or cards . 
  oh , it 's a descendant . 
  thanks !, 
  month and week seems like latin , what does zile come from ? 
  it 's heartbreaking to read !, 
  good point . 
  have you been to scandinavia ? 
  we 're the very definition of silent in public . 
  or maybe something about population density as well ? 
  i moved to a village . 
  now , i ca n't see anything outside at night , except for the moon and stars .

  even my lamps do n't reach very far . 
  it 's a bit unnerving at first . 
  the only respite is when the fjord below is lit up by the fullmoon . 
  you must read more romanian history now !, 
  hungary is also very relevant . 
  it 's such a * simple * insult , it 's almost insulting . 
  i honestly do n't know , [ the new border is basically a 50/50 down-the-middle split ] ( http://en.ria.ru/images/16061/27/160612757.jpg ) . 
  it does n't quite fit with the map , but i thought sochi fit `` putinburg '' better . 
   georgia is also pretty popular from what i 've heard . 
  [ that war back in 2008 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008_georgia%e2%80%93russia_crisis ) made things worse . 
  the russians [ banned imports of wine from georgia ] ( http://en.ria.ru/business/20131216/185616873/georgia-doubles-wine-exports-as-russian-market-reopens.html ) , just to hit them where it hurts .

  sochi was a beach resort even during soviet times . 
  that 's not in crimea , it 's probably [ novorossiysk ] ( http://i.imgur.com/hnifwip.png ) , krasnodar krai , russia .

there was a bunch of things saddam could have done to call off the sanctions as well . 
  that does not make it any better to in essence starve children as a pressure point .

  considering the moroccan royal palace was build in 1864 , i doubt he can give you an answer . 
  i repeatedly see americans claim they have no responsibility for the actions of their government . 
  and i wonder how long are they going to continue claiming to be a democracy , while simultaneously claiming the people have no influence on politics . 
  both the russian and the american people are responsible for their governments actions . 
  it 's as simple as that . 
  the same is true for every democracy . 
  yeah , thank god you keep to only invading your neighbor countries and stealing their land . 
  phew . 
  the same way the us would i guess . 
  by utilizing the dozens of military bases the us operates in arab states in the gulf area . 
  remember iran and the gulf states are n't exactly on friendly terms . 
  this has been known since nukes were invented . 
  why do you think israel raced to get nukes after the arab wars . 
  why did pakistan build nukes so fast after india got them . 
  why do you think iran wants nukes . 
  even americans must agree that is to deter israeli and american invasion . 
  just too bad the danish scrapped all their submarines . 
  they probably could not even stop a well organized group of fishing trawlers as it is today . 
  nato 's maritime defense is in a sad state in europe . 
  what a shameless clickbait headline . 
  british ships will of course continue to rescue anyone in need they come over , as they are obliged to do . 
  our prime minister has so far refused , so we 'll have to see what happens . 
  you seem to think that everyone who opposes free borders are racist . 
  are you reflecting your own issues ? 
  let me put the spotlight on some ** real ** issues with schengen instead of your made up ones . 
  * free flow of criminals . 
  here in norway , we have arrested - and deported the same persons [ over and over ] ( http://www.aftenposten.no/nyheter/iriks/blir-domt-og-utvist_-men-kommer-tilbake-til-norge-7128362.html ) . 
  you ca n't blacklist a passport you ca n't check . 
  the reaction ? 
  harsh jail time for repeat offense . 
  the problem now is the jails are full . 
  and you still ca n't control the criminals . 
  * free flow of jihadists . 
  3000 jihadis have traveled trough the borderless wonder of western europe , both to and from the middle east . 
  what does it help to take their passport , when the only passport control they need to cross is the swiss cheese also known as turkey ? 
  but yeah , please , do call me a racist for questioning the system . 
  personally i have no objection to showing my valid passport if i were to travel abroad . 
  and fyi , the word surrender would be entirely proper in this instance . 
  you surrender your sovereignty if you can not control your own borders . 
  nothing `` military '' about it . 
  words have different meanings your know . 
  we actually do , it 's called [ spr\u00e5kr\u00e5det ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/language_council_of_norway ) . 
  in cases of new words , words with several different spellings or translated words , they can act as a guidance on how words should be written in both norwegian and new norwegian . 
  it might seem foreign to a native english speaker , but remember our language have to adopt quite a few foreign words all the time , most of them from english . 
  just some technical examples are `` internet '' , `` streaming '' , tablet '' , `` touch screen '' . 
  all of these kinds of words needs to either be translated or just used as they are . 
  spr\u00e5kr\u00e5det will investigate what is most commonly used , and advice . 
  children [ can die ] ( http://www.aftenposten.no/nyheter/iriks/gutt-dode-etter-omskjaring-i-oslo-6827154.html ) from the procedure . 
  many , many others are left with complications who can range from deformations to in some cases [ penis amputation ] ( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmc3963353/ ) . 
  you are taking a calculated risk that your child wo n't have a permanently damaged sexual organ or other complications . 
  and there is no medical reason in the vast majority of the cases . 
  hell , even if only one child dies from the procedure , that speaks volumes , unless someone can produce a case where a small child died from not having his foreskin removed . 
  the fact that they have no evidence is bullshit . 
  every surgical operation has risks . 
  every single one . 
  whether it is from human error , from infection or some other reason . 
  only treating patients with a valid medical reason would be the only way to minimize this risk . 
  islamophobia , antisemittism . . always with the religion . 
  this is not a question of religion . 
  it 's a question about child welfare . 
   the bbc 's head of statistics anthony reuben said prostitution , drugs and tobacco smuggling were not included in national income before 2002 when they should have been , under accounting rules . 
   in contrast , prostitution was included in germany 's own national accounts and given eu budget contributions are based on national income , this partly explains why the uk has been underpaying and germany overpaying , he added . 
  this is bullshit on a whole new level . 
  prostitution is legal in germany . 
  they pay taxes , and they pay vat . 
  what income does the uk government have from illegal drug or tobacco smuggling ? 
  there are ukrainian militias , that fight on the side of ukrainian government . 
  and this wording is carefully crafted to give an impression that they are the ones who shot it down , not the separatists . 
  it does n't matter to him that he sounds like a raving lunatic to the rest of the world , as long as many russians believe him . 
  he 's just securing his own power via uniting the people against a common enemy . 
  made up or not . 
  it 's an ancient tactic , because it works . 
  it 's actually the same tactic america used to rally the people against communists in the 50 's and up . 
  there was suddenly no limit on communist spies in america that you had to watch out for , 
  it 's kind of wondrous how supportive the west were when we sent people to kill in syria , and how condemning we are when they end up killing the wrong people . 
  `` ah , you 're only going on vacation to kill syrian soldiers you say ? 
  rightio , on your way you are !, 
  but do n't kill anyone else ! '', 
  no , that is the total number of first generation immigrants with either asylum or refugee status . 
  i 'm sorry if i was confusing . 
  when have i said anything even remotely close to what you are saying ? 
  you get it after all !, 
  ( except to think they have problems getting to egypt . 
  after all , the boats to europe go from north africa ) . 
  and now you might ask . 
  why does not sweden , instead of spending millions of kronor on each refugee they take into sweden , instead spend the equal amount of money on securing housing , jobs and the future of 10 or 20 fold that where they are ? 
  why do they let asylum seekers literally kill each other chasing a dream in sweden , only to let a few lucky people win the whole jackpot ? 
  what is the logic in letting the stable arab countries foot the whole bill of the refugee problem , while sweden pats itself on the back for being kind ( to the 5-10 % of the refugees they could have secured for the same money , minus the dead ones on the bottom of the ocean ) . 
  thanks for completely missing the point , so i can explain it for everyone . 
  it 's not a question of dying in syria versus living in sweden . 
  it 's a question about living in jordan , libya , egypt or many other countries , versus traveling to sweden . 
  nobody takes a direct flight from syria to sweden , barely missing some terrorists trying to kill them . 
  we are talking about people who have already fled . 
  they most likely are in north africa or neighboring arab countries . 
  people who can move to libya , then buy passports and make their way to europe with boats , and ultimately to their final destinations . 
  these operations are just a small band aid on a gaping wound .

  it can get abmnormally cold in one area of the world in a specific stretch of time while the world still has an upward trend in average temperature . 
  oh right , so turkey is culturally closer to japan than it is to greece ?

  it 's not a logical argument of `` the populace think women should basically be the property of their husband '' therefore `` no women on the streets '' . 
  it was a way of highlighting that if those countries the comment i replied to somehow were shining beacons of gender equality in the muslim world that they were not really doing all that great in the first place . 
  the percentages show the muslim majority countries mentioned have overwhelmingly regressive attitudes towards women . 
  the relevance is clear to me . 
  perhaps i would n't be criticizing islam as much if these kinds of articles were n't popping up on my front page as much recently . 
  oh , jordan and indonesia where 70 % + of muslims think sharia should be official law ? 
  turkey , where 65 % completely or mostly agree that women must always obey their husband , or indonesia where the figure is 93 % among muslims , and jordan where it 's 80 % . 
  something tells me that these sorts of attitudes towards women drives the public space to become such a sausage fest . 
  oh yeah , fn and nsdap totally have the same platform ... 
  if you read what the bar represents , it says `` position among top sites '' in each country . 
  if a country had no bar it would be the most popular site in the country , while a larger bar means it 's less popular . 
  as someone from northern norway ( further north than the northernmost point on iceland ) i ca n't say i 've ever encountered such an attitude . 
  maybe there 's less stigma around mental illness which leads more people to seek help ? 
  look at south korea on that list : it has the lowest usage of antidepressants of the countries mentioned , yet it has the second highest suicide rate in the world ( 28.9 per 100 000 ) . 
  and poland and lithuania . 
  scandinavian countries seem to be on pretty much the same level as the rest of western europe . 
  alt right is a white nationalist movement . 
  i 'm 4 km from the city center , though , so i assume location is the reason . 
  ( electricity is included in my rent as well which is nice ), 
  ah i missed that the map was in euros and not dollars . 
  that would be 550 euros then , and obviously i pay in nok . 
  damn oslo is expensive , i pay 590 dollars a month for a 30 m ^ 2 apartment in trondheim . 
  something something glass houses, 
  i think you 're misunderstanding the map . 
  is belgium a celtic country and russia a germanic country ? 
  no , the map displays the language family of the original word for the country name . 
  i suppose they were concerned about the situation of the russian minority in kirkenes . 
  [ hey , maybe you should consider becoming a furry ? 
  seems to be more accepted there .

  me too thanks, 
  oh ok i guess i do n't want my government to further those values then, 
   africa will not be as rich as europe in next 100 years , probably never . 
  yep  most people dont leave the poorest countries , but most migrants come from countries like mexico or china , much richer than most african countries . 
  if you really dont wan na migrants from africa , if they get richer , more people will leave . 
  i think it 's helpful to separate what influences someone to migrate into two parts . 
  firstly there 's the general satisfaction you feel where you live which is influenced by things like poverty , war , conflict , opression etc. 
  this is the baseline `` how much my life objectively sucks '' metric , and is something which with improvement would make more people content living where they live . 
  secondly there 's of course the pull factor of there being somewhere which is vastly better to live , wherein comparing your life to what it could be there subjectively would make it seem a lot worse . 
  this is the sort of pressure you 're describing , and here is where it 's important to disincentivize mass migration with measures such as stopping illegal boats and sending them back to african shores . 
  if it becomes less of a likely possibility for someone to migrate from africa to europe people will eventually stop trying in the numbers they are . 
  however , and this is the important part i was trying to get at , the first `` baseline measurement '' should be improved anyway because if it gets too low people are going to feel the sort of immense desperation which would cause them to risk their lives for a better life . 
  basically , restricting migration through `` stick measures '' would have a good effect but adding a `` carrot '' would make it better . 
   but the aid is really big problem , africa will not develop by throwing money on them , you are making the issue even worse , making unsustainable circle . 
  this for sure is true for a lot of things , including for instance things like swamping the continent with products made elsewhere , severely hapering the development of local industry , or an excessive amount of food aid crippling local agriculture . 
  there is good aid though : things like programs to teach use of contraceptives and general sex-ed , programs to fight easily cured diseases and vaccine programs , projects helping build up infrastructure , projects funding education systems etc. 
  of course such aid is not without its faults , with much of the money inevitably ending up in the hands of corrupt officials , but it is in europe 's best interest to see africa develop and become more peaceful and prosperous even though we might not see the positive change immediately . 
  wow thanks for the invaluable insight . 
  you sure changed my mind with that comment . 
   additionally , i 'd like to remind you to please be a good person and donate to african aid organizations uh that seems like a good idea if you do n't want to be flooded with migrants ... 
  if africa is less shitty less people will want to leave . 
  france just seems to hate everyone , huh ? 
  at least you ca n't steal our fish : ^ ), 
  well first of all we 're not in the eu . 
  [ polls of the question `` would you like norway to be part of the eu ? '', 
  hover around 70 % for `` no '' and 20 % `` yes '' . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/norway%e2%80%93european_union_relations#opinion_polling ), 
  i thought denmark was a kinda eurosceptic country . 
  yea or the scandinavian mountain range, 
  they are sending them all over the country , but guess what : they tend to end up moving to the areas with more people they have more in common with , which makes perfect sense . 
  you ca n't really force citizens , immigrants or not , to stay in one spot and not move where they want to live . 
  it 's interesting how different comment sections of different articles can be . 
  / r/europe seems like the biggest example of these huge swings . 
  speak for yourself , southerner . 
  no u, 
  ahh , they 're the ones that built those polish death camps right ? 
  no , this is hamburg . 
   now hold up we, 
  are they doing better because or despite the refugees ?

  this is confusing ... 
  why are you replying to yourself ? 
  who said anything about tradition ? 
  i swear to god , catalonia . 
  it 's * decorative * . 
  thanks . 
  tradition or not , i still think they would be better without the strap ... 
  but ... 
  why ? 
  i 'm guessing a regular plastic fidget spinner is around 10 grams . 
  that would add up to a total of 3.5 million fidget spinners . 
  millions of spinners will perish ... 
  i do n't see the issue in killing whales when we have such strict quotas and only hunt minke whale , which has a large population which whaling actually keeps stable . 
  if you 're against killing animals that get to be free and happy in the wild their entire life until the day they 're killed i would expect you to be opposed to factory farming of , let 's say pigs . 
  i was at a dinner with a swedish guy present and we came to the topic of 17th of may , the norwegian national day , and he said if he were to go out and wave the swedish flag the way norwegians do he would probably be viewed as a racist . 
  if any swedes can let me know , does waving the flag in he streets have a similar connotation as doing so with the st. george 's cross in england where it 's heavily used as a symbol by racists ? 
  map was from 2011 ... not very representative . 
  i would not have expected a pole to say this . 
  i commend your consistency . 
  i think there are two very distinct problems here .

  i vaguely remember an article a while ago where someone drove at least 100 over the limit , but it was in the middle of the night and no cars anywhere so he did n't lose his license ( would 've been prison in other circumstances ) . 
  i could n't find the article but i 'll keep looking and edit it in if i find it . 
  not blinking wo n't get you arrested , but it fucking should . 
  other than that they will in most cases let you go with a warning if the crime is not too severe , which is pretty cool . 
  in my experience there barely is any traffic laws in large parts of italy . 
  i 've always wondered if the police suddenly started caring , would italians respect their authority ? 
  most people find it disgusting . 
  always fun to see someone buy the wrong type and start gagging when they notice . 
  sounds sketchy , what the eu should do is to spread the institutions all over the eu . 
  not centralized in benelux like they are now . 
  they recently implemented this in norway to stop what 's happened in the us before it happens . 
  i think this would help for eu integration as well . 
  because they are electable and can be controlled . 
  janteloven , goes for all of scandinavia . 
  i once said hi to a guy worth a couple billion euros , that was pretty cool . 
  he made them through investments , i think . 
  binge-watching house of cards . 
  we got new bills in may , have yet to see one as i never use cash . 
  most people prefer card or mobile pay in norway . 
  i prefer black coffee , and so does the vast majority of norway , i think that goes for the nordics as well ( i 've read ) . 
  i think nrk anything is under regulations . 
  25 % has to be nynorsk , some of it sami and the rest bokm\u00e5l / dialect . 
  yeah , it might be the closest thing to standard . 
  but i just wanted to point out that we do n't have one as we have a very special situation in terms of dialects and written language . 
  there is n't a standard one . 
  south-east/oslo : snobs , bitchy dialect . 
  east of arendal and north of trondheim . 
  well then i disagree , you may feel that way about some norwegians on reddit . 
  but irl you are very wrong . 
  seems like you have misunderstood some classic scandinavian banter . 
  also reddit is n't representative for how it is to * live * in those countries . 
  which was the question . 
  i 'm pretty good at different accents in american english . 
  other than that i can separate irish , scottish and several types of british . 
  and some swedish dialects . 
  [ :') ] ( https://giphy.com/gifs/mvp-ngj902avlgswq/fullscreen ), 
  from the top of * my * head : sedona , grand canyon , niagara falls , death valley , yellowstone , rocky mountains and maybe florida keys fit in there ? 
  i think the majority knows of grand canyon , yellowstone , niagara falls and the rocky mountains . 
  haha , you 're correct !, 
  i 'm from a rural place as well . 
  but uni at 40k ? 
  ntnu i assume ? 
  from western norway , live in southern . 
  barneskolen ( 1-7th grade ) - ca 500 ungdomsskolen ( 8-10th ) - ca 200 videreg\u00e5ende ( 1-3 ( 10-13 ) ) - ca 1500 university - ca 15 000, 
  i feel it 's true in norway . 
  but i live in the part of norway with the highest percentage blondes though . 
  student , rent a house at 250 m2 with some friends . 
  meters , not centimeters . 
  i feel bad for his coworkers . 
  yeah , but when your friends have a fucking sound/catchphrase and gesture to react to everything that happens and desire kool aid without ever having tasted it , then it gets pretty annoying and therefore i envy you if your friends are n't that americanized . 
  not even real predators want to live in denmark . 
  ^ ^ ^ obligatory ^ ^ ^ banter, 
  huh , i find that it 's especially my female friends . 
  most notably is that head shake and finger manouver . 
  if you ca n't see them do that then you 've struck gold on those girls . 
  do n't know your age , but in my circle with 18-26 year olds it 's very common among my black friends . 
  would n't expect older to act that way . 
  but i assume younger too act like that . 
  maybe you do n't know many black people or are a bit older ? 
  i 'm friends with a bunch of black guys and almost all of them do this . 
  our polar bears do n't live side by side with brown bears and are seemingly thriving on svalbard . 
  i do n't think any polar bears share habitat with other types of bears , but i could be wrong . 
  yup, 
  i 've heard that during one of the unions we were pretty powerful . 
  i do n't know which union but i guess it 's the dano-norwegian one . 
  our fleet was supposedly among the biggest in the world . 
  i dont ' t mind us not being a super power , let 's us focus more on our selves and not be busy with foreign affairs like the us . 
  old eastern norwegians . 
  look up jens stoltenberg on youtube and i will guarantee that you cringe . 
  did n't know people were allowed to drink or drive in north korea . 
  not mainland norway , but our biggest island have loads of them . 
  most ways , if you look up king bach i think he calls himself on youtube etc. 
  the way he and his friends act in sketches pretty much sums it up . 
  we call weever fjesing , had to do some googling to find the english name . 
  also you have boar , we chased our boars into sweden a long time ago and our boar today are migrating back from sweden and live in both norway and sweden . 
  and i forgot lynx , we have them too . 
  on my mothers side on and off since the 17th century . 
  on my fathers * at least * since the viking age , so about 1200 + years ago . 
  talking `` black '' . 
  for some reason many black people in norway have adopted american ghetto slang and black stereotypes . 
  this has only happened after social media and especially vine . 
  what ? 
  would you mind explaining ? 
  ~ ~ norway ~ ~, 
  never actually lived in sweden so i ca n't really compare , but from my experience visiting sweden it 's pretty much the same . 
  whoops , fixed it now . 
  thx . 
  lovely , well respected , part of the community and someone you can trust to keep you safe . 
  beside bringing back the kalmar union or some sort of scandinavian union there is a movement that want our pre kalmar land back ( greenland , faroe islands , iceland ) . 
  as for people , a famous norwegian billionaire not that long a ago spoke on a scandinavian union and how it would benefit us . 
  i get called in once a year , so probably once a year . 
  i think it 's very common in rural areas of norway/sweden/finland . 
  where i 'm from we call it niseks = 96 as in 96 % . 
  i would even go as far as to claim it 's part of my regions culture . 
  it 's widely non-existent . 
  it 's not that bad though , when i tasted it i finished the bottle . 
  would n't take it over water/sprite/beer / cola etc though . 
  ticino i do n't know much about switzerland , but i 'm amazed it manages to stay a country with cantons like ticino basically being italy . 
  also the cantons , the whole governmental situation , the languages etc. 
  the more i think of it the further away switzerland feels to the nordics .

  you forgot , `` pick one country to live in other than your own/what 's your favourite country except your own '', 
  two and a half months . 
  soldiers : seeing how there are many they are varied . 
  some are assholes , some are people with no other option , some do it because they think it 'd their duty . 
  military itself : sometimes it 's hard to feel like we are all the good guys when we are allied with you . 
  are you helping people to learn english ? 
  if so that might be why you do n't see many of us . 
  they tend to be younger people that enjoy cars and driving around aimlessly . 
  shitty car mods are not unusual neither is loud music of the house genre . 
  e-numbers identify food additives that have been shown to be safe and officially approved for use in food across the eu . 
  could be worse , could also be full of danes . 
  i was taught be but i change the way i speak very easily so depends on what i have heard most recently . 
  weird having to explain why i have german accented english just because i talk to germans that speak english all day long . 
  most do n't believe me because they have heard me with irish , american and whatever other accent i had in me that day . 
  say yippee kai yay instead of pip pip cheerio . 
  that will piss them off . 
  i 've gotten some of that hate mail too . 
  because no matter what your thoughts on the government it is one . 
  compare the us to all countries and it probably wo n't rank among the 50 % that need help . 
  actual help . 
  these questions are getting stupid . 
  if things actually get bad then we will see but just like the person that asked if we would grant asylum to americans because of trump . 
  no , because you are a first world country and compared to almost any other county not in a bad situation at all . 
  if there was a list of countries in need of help the us would be low on it along with all other first world countries . 
  both our countries are guilty of fucking over the situation in other countries more and diverting money from fixing that to soothe your hurt election feelings makes us all look like entitled bastards . 
  i 'm going to take a wild guess and pick copyright as one reason of probably many . 
  if not the show itself then the music used in it or some other thing . 
  no one wants to spend extra money on licensing music for use with a larger audience if it 's not going to be watched by that larger audience . 
  three , it 's something about thr sound that messed with my mouth . 
  country of origin only i think . 
  could n't find anything on ssb.no but it 's early and i 'm on my phone so in sure i could have fucked up somewhere . 
  a more gun loving culture but with a swiss approach . 
  yes , they are called navere . 
  the institution that control welfare payouts and help find jobs is called nav do the name for them derived from that . 
  no worries , we do n't think highly enough of swedish opinions to have any feeling about them . 
  after ww2 one party gained a majority so big they could do a lot of things like create a lot of changes that benefits us to this day . 
  i would say that is a contender for golden age . 
  i never use cash . 
  nettby and blink were two large ones before but they closed down after facebook became a thing . 
  think i heard he deleted it because he was embarrassed afterwards . 
  getting safer and not uncommon but not having bike lanes all over probably stops lots from biking so there could be more . 
  i do n't want more until bike lanes though . 
  european , not really . 
  like someone mentioned though it depends on who i talk to at times . 
  ok , never carry cash myself so i 'm curious how often others do . 
  is cash still used a lot in germany ? 
  you can take up a loan and give me that money if you want . 
  i know you would n't expect such an unselfish act from people on the internet but i always felt you should help out if you can . 
  ignore and move on . 
  things more worried about traveling questions as i do n't want them to become the norm . 
  so far they are n't even remotely the norm , but i 've seen it happen to another sub so i 'm not a big fan of them . 
  there are none , tallest building we have is 117meters and it needs to be taller than 150 to be called a skyscraper . 
  some have applied to build but none have been allowed so far . 
  i prefer it to summer so i guess i 'm just a special kind of person . 
  and on computer at least it comes with a ruler thing to measure with . 
  it gives off a `` i want to come to your country to escape a situation ( which is n't all that bad in the grand scheme ) . 
  i 'm not going to make an effort to integrate at all though , you adjust to me in your own country . '', 
  vibe . 
  immigration is a two way street of acceptance , not learning the language is like setting up a one way only sign on that street . 
  would we end up in the eu of we did ? 
  english only which is why language changing based of ip makes me angry as all hell . 
  how about letting me just use what i want ? 
  no track settings in browser usually kills this though thank god . 
  the top , stem is the place to hold it . 
  i am a freak in local banana peeling circles though . 
  no , i feel dirty going in just to fetch something i forgot when wearing shoes . 
  he does n't want to anger the hyphen americans, 
  also fineland , findland . . something like that . 
  where do people do that ? 
  never done it myself but i do n't fly all that much . 
  i do n't think we do . 
  erna solberg made 185 000 $ in 2015 . 
  the tax papers for 2016 is n't out so that 's the most recent i could find . 
  oh , and her fortune was 236 000 $ . 
  it goes where i want , the price is n't stupid and no bad rep. 
  vampires ? 
  screens , tires and my mother 's cookbook and americans online, 
  just as much as the rest of us . 
  i tried to look for rules regarding it ( not super well though so might have missed something ) and i could only find the rule `` if it has n't been ten years since last time you did it '' but even that rule has exceptions . 
  i know there are laws against what you can change it to which is what i thought the question was about . 
  you ca n't get it changed just because you want to ? 
  sounds like how germans used to be when i was younger . 
  comes to english forums and chats and refuse to speak english ending up in them getting their own areas just so the rest do n't have to deal with them . 
  thai and philippines women has a `` marries men from small towns that ca n't find wife for some reason so they can get to norway '' . 
  a mail order bride ish like rep i guess . 
  he is an odd one . 
  sometimes he posts good questions other times you ca n't tell if he is trolling or not . 
  obama was the same though . 
  never heard of him before he was elected and it 's the same with loads of candidates in the primaries . 
  it 's a type of blowjob . 
  one where you are humming while sucking . 
  how is vaping in turkey though ? 
  yeah , i scratch my allergy hives until they bleed sometimes . 
  makes my legs look great . 
  luckily the tape seems to have worked though so i hope you find something that works for you too . 
  in their case it was finger less gloves , but latex loves would work too i recon . 
  it 's mostly just there to remind you not to scratch after all . 
  i do it myself when i get allergic breakouts but in my case it 's a small bit of tape . 
  whenever i scratch it 's `` oh right , not supposed to do that '' where as normally i would just have scratched idly at it . 
  gloves ?

  taken out of the procreation pool ) resulting in people looking outside their population group for mates , leading to influx of healthy genetic material and that you should really kiss their ass as they make sure your kids are genetically healthy . 
  they should be your heroes !, 
  what would you say then ? 
  why ? 
  how does it affect you personally ? 
   go see what kind of reactions you get when you say `` i do n't like them gay parades '' my reply will then always be the same : do n't go to one and do n't watch it . 
  how difficult is that ? 
  but i will never allow you to oppress them just because * you * do n't like them !, 
  if you are a straight man , allowing gays to marry will not affect you one iota . 
  it will have a great positive effect on the gays however that they are allowed to marry . 
  even more inexplicable are the cries from the family crowd , that is exactly what the gays want to be , a family , legally recognized as one . 
  why is it so difficult to afford other groups the same legal rights you yourself have ? 
  is it [ `` the `` last place aversion '' paradox ] ( http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=occupy-wall-street-psychology ) raring its ugly head ?

  if you become more passive-aggressive butthurt now , i would think your name is obama . 
   people begging has n't existed in oslo ? 
  say what now ? 
  i lived in oslo for 20 years , of course there was begging but not in the amount seen . 
  i do n't * blame * anybody - i am just saying it is not acceptable . 
  this time it happened to be lithuania - should we not mention it because of that fact or ? 
  in general , i am a big fan of the baltic states , they have all done so many `` right '' things after the break up of the soviet union and i just want them to continue down that path . 
  oh an in case you wonder , i upvoted your comment . 
  and that is exactly why i see what i see . 
  my family also had one of norway 's worst fascists and torturer , [ henry rinnan ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/henry_oliver_rinnan ) , the leader of [ sonderabteilung lola ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sonderabteilung_lola ) and my mum was a nazi whore it turns out , had a child with a german soldier btw . 
  yes , my family has suffered from fascism so do n't give me that bullshit . 
  your nation is heading straight toward fascism and you love it !, 
  somebody got to stand up against us fascism and who better than a country with a deep traumatic past in regards to fascism ? 
  go germany !, 
  it 's part of the schengen agreement and have a say in this . 
  not that i blame the opposition , the roma problem is starting to increase in norway . 
  all of a sudden having heaps of poor people begging and stealing and living in abject slum , something that has never existed even in the capital , makes the people take notice and become upset . 
  it is not norway 's job to feed and house these groups of people .

  aftenposten is norway 's oldest and largest conservative newspaper , in general , it is seen as a tool for the conservative party . 
  on the content ... must see the numbers first . 
  on the comments ?

  this is correct !,

  you can run windows nt programs under os/2 . 
   it 's going to cost companies a lot of money to up and change architectures .

  it depends on what they are doing , for most companies , there is actual saving involved rather than cost . 
   this is n't exclusively an issue with microsoft and unfortunately they are obliged to comply with fisa rulings .

  the last windows version i had on any machine , was windows 95 and i can tell you , i have not missed ms products one single day !, 
  i have never been a fan of neither ms nor apple but then again , i have followed these companies from the start onward . 
  i loved os/2 from ibm , was part of their beta testing team and it was light years ahead of windows but alas , ibm never got it to become a seller and i 'm sure it would have had spyware today anyway so ...

  hey bud ( a ) , are we pest ( ering ) you ? 
   why do n't people just homebrew ? 
  norway do that a lot !,

  scenery is beautiful though . 
  found out our fuel price is made out of 60 % tax ... 
  even though we have the highest fuel prices in europe ( and probably the world ) we only use a little over 2 % of our income on it . 
  kind of wierd then how in norway it is the right wing parties who want to join the eu and the left opposes it . 
  eu is a capitalist dream . 
  the debt would still be in euros , and their new currency would be weak as fuck . 
   i 'm not sure why so many norwegians tend to think that frp 's only goals are immigration-based . 
  you know what , i totally agree . 
  people i know who voted frp does it because of lower taxes , better roads and so on . 
  very few does it because of immigration . 
   but its stance on economy , government involvement etc. 
  does and in what way does frp have a far-right stance on these issues ? 
  they are huge supporters of state financed welfare . 
  they even want to start up major state owned companies to build roads for example . 
  this just shows that many people have no clue . 
  frp is actually to the left of many labour parties in europe . 
  the social-democrats in denmark have many similar policies as the new conservative government . 
  sd and frp ca n't be compared . 
  frp was a party with origins in lower taxes and a smaller government , not anti-immigration like most far right parties in europe . 
  calling frp `` far right '' is just wrong . 
  labour in australia is much thougher on immigration than frp . 
  are they a far-right party because of it ? 
  the norwegian political spectrum is so small that the new conservative government gets called socialists abroad . 
  norway : - the progress party and the conservatives are going to form a minority government . 
  - our new government says that they will make professional boxing and segways legal . 
  also each municipality can decide if snowmobiles should be allowed to be used or not . 
  - ylvis - the fox is blowing up worldwide . 
  8th place on billboard and first in many countries . 
  13c in northern norway on the coast !, 
  no snow in sight , 
  not really . 
  all international connections like nato , eea and schengen will still be as before . 
  just like we avoided in norway then . 
  but since it was the left who was in power people went crazy saying we were stupid to vote them out . 
  and employ people in the public sector ... 
  considering these are money that could have been spent on improving public services and infrastructure , it 's a lot of money in the drain . 
  it 's the same in norway . 
  at the same time our state owned wine monopoly complains about loosing revenue . 
  i totally agree . 
  i do n't even know why labour is polling like 30 % after they have shown time after time that they do n't take responsibility . 
  one of the biggest tasks a state has is to protect its citizens , and they failed this task by far . 
  even after getting several warnings ahead that the security was n't acceptable at all . 
  eveytime they get confronted with something that does n't work they allways respond with either : `` it is n't as bad as it seems '' or `` no government has used so much money on this field '' . 
  why the fuck ca n't they just say `` i recognize the problem and i will make sure it gets fixed . '', 
  i also blame the opposition for not having balls after the 22 . 
  july report came out . 
  they should have voted to allocate the government in the parlament once it got known how bad it was . 
  even if they would get downvoted it would have showed that they cared . 
  the reason why labour keeps getting many votes is because of the large amount of people on welfare and public sector jobs . 
  we all know that if we reduce welfare benefits you will not win the election , even though it is needed if we want to have a welfare state in the future . 
  to put it simply , we are to dependent on the state . 
  the police effort that day was a discrace and should be more of a reason to vote them out of office . 
  they vary a lot on the polls . 
  last election they got 22,9 % but now it looks like they will get around 15-18 % . 
  in the end i can mention that breivik actually left the party because it did n't fit his extremist views . 
  the party does not support him or his actions at all . 
  well the taxi stunt turned out to be fake . 
  the `` passengers '' were paid to appear in the commercial . 
   i personally do not understand why the conservatives are gaining this much traction . 
  there are several reason for this . 
  first of all the sitting coalition has not actually talked about their own politics in their election campaign . 
  they have only talked about what things will go wrong if they are not in power . 
  now this card has been used for so long and still has n't worked . 
  they seem desperate to not loose power . 
  they also come across as arrogant , something we norwegians hate . 
  another thing is that they seem to have some political paralysis . 
  one year after the crushing report after 22 . 
  july the police say that nothing has changed . 
  they even admit that if it would have happened again they would not be better prepared . 
  also people see how the quality of public services does n't reflect a rich country that norway is . 
  the roads are bad , the hospitals are n't as good as they should be and the schools are old and worn down just to name a few things . 
  i am going to vote conservative myself this election just like a lot of people i know . 
  things may not change , but it 's worth a try . 
  one thing is for certain , keeping the sitting government is n't going to improve these things . 
  in the end i think that labour should be in opposition because they are simply so worn out and lack new ideas . 
   holy hell !!!!!, 
  what about if i just shopped at the cheapest markets ? 
  like fish markets and such ? 
  unless you are in oslo markets are hard to find . 
  but they say that it 's pretty cheap in immgrant owned shops . 
  fish markets is n't really common either . 
  be aware that the famous fish market in bergen is a rip-off . 
  the best advice i could give you is to stockpile on food in sweden , you can save up to 50 % . 
  by the way the estimate was including transport and accommodation . 
   this makes me sad :( i mean sure the fjords are worth seeing , but really , how much of a culture can you absorb without interacting with natives ? 
  that is the whole reason we travel !, 
  talk with different people , absorb the scenery , eat the food ... not even places like bergen or oslo ? 
  :( i want to be totally immersed in a culture if i 'm going to use my only 2 weeks vacation to go !!!, 
  if you do want to come in contact with natives i would arrange it beforehand . 
  just hanging out with randoms on the street would seem strange . 
  if you want to speak with random norwegians , bars and other places where alcohol is served is your best bet . 
  also in my experience you are going to have a harder time getting contact with natives in the large cities . 
  i come from the northern part of the country and we are in my experience much more open to strangers . 
   like no fooling this is not a myth ? 
  you got any ` murican friends ? 
  do they do alright with the lovely viking ladies ? 
  i 'd be lying if i said i have n't fantasized about some beautiful norwegian babes feeling my muscles in a bar  i think this is common everywhere . 
  the reason is because your more `` exotic '' . 
  also we have been fed so much american culture that seing the real thing is fascination to some . 
   fucking saved .

nationalism is only the symptom . 
  the regressive left is the sickness . 
  they are deconstructing national identity , the most fundamental many humans relate to . 
  nationalism is only the blowback , a call to preserve national identity . 
  because the rest of europe is much more susceptible to corruption . 
  the lowest common denominator is the problem . 
  the only solution for us is if we get to define the political organisation ourselves . 
  there is a reason the word ombudsman comes from scandinavia . 
  i love europe and europeans though . 
  we truly are the greatest continent in the solar system . 
  maybe he is talking about the ataturk post-ottoman days . 
   the rise of the far right can partly be attributed to leftists sticking their heads in the sand let 's be honest here , it 's the the biggest reason . 
  a lot of norwegians voted in our current government on a single issue , immigration ( fyi , i could not decide and did not vote at all ) . 
  and we all knew they would only bring oligarchic policies to the table , that is , less taxes for the rich and worse-everything for everyone else . 
  without the lefts insane immigration policies the far-right would be laughable . 
  i also think the rise of the far-right is the only reason the left is starting to close the borders and send back a lot of economic migrants these days . 
  i 've said this a long time , a leftist party with a conservative immigration agenda would be insanely popular now with the current economic climate . 
  that people in almost every nation has to choose between national seppuku combined with socialism or national-preservation combined with oligarchy is the real mystery . 
  and yeah , i like to talk black and white and generalize a bit to get my point across , 
  indeed , but the result is basically the same . 
  the death of a culture . 
  we have enough humans on this planet so that is n't the biggest worry to be honest ( in a scenario of outright genocide vs a dissolution of a nation ) . 
  culture defines our thoughts and actions , while genetics do not . 
  that 's why in many minds , anti-nationalism is scarier than nationalism . 
  one seeks to destroy culture , while the other seeks to preserve it . 
  i see the dutch bid and raise with a brand new nordic union with a super-monarch king of kings from slesvig-holstein if the territory is handed over to us . 
  your super king will have the privilege of addressing his populace in a new years eve speech . 
  he will also have the privilege of making formal complaints to his sub-monarchs whenever they act unruly . 
   the fact is that while hitler was gathering german lands and he united germany , austria , the sudetenland , and memel without a single drop of blood . 
  if hitler stopped at that , he would be remembered in his country 's history as a politician of the highest order . 
  probably correct ... without the genocides of course . 
  it 's not heinous like raping a baby . 
  but it 's heinous in the sense that the one you cheat on will likely suffer mentally for years because of your actions , or rather inaction in the example you give when a person do n't want to be with someone and yet ca n't bother to leave . 
  cheating can be way worse than physical violence for the well being of the victim . 
  i agree we can only commit to an extent . 
  asking for honoring a completely normal commitment is not exactly pushing it . 
   that betrayal thing is a leftover from medieval religious brainwashing . 
  uhh . 
  it increases the chances of std for your partner . 
  it increases the chance for violence or manipulation for all partners . 
  secondly , we commit and have partners because we want full support , not half-assed `` icouldjustleaveyouforsomeoneelse '' kind of support . 
  cheating is morally wrong because you break the commitment and promise for full support . 
  it has nothing to do with religious brainwashing . 
  do you have any sources on that ? 
  did the english , french or spanish specifically state their goal to populate america with as diverse populations as possible ? 
  oh it does n't really affect me . 
  tell that to the kurds . 
  the mistake was not dividing further by clear nation-state lines . 
  how much suffering would be prevented with a kurdistan , assyria and many others . 
  and turkey should have never existed , it legitimizes the invasion of turkic peoples in anatolia and established them as the majority over a large country with historically much more diverse populations . 
  well , all governments of nation states should be . 
  sadly europe is pressing for multiculture instead , which disintegrates the very concept of `` nation '' https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nation  a nation is a large group or collective of people with common characteristics attributed to them - including language , traditions , mores ( customs ) , habitus ( habits ) , and ethnicity . 
   etc. 
  eventually 10 people are standing on the tram stop with exactly 2 m spaces , because they want to be polite and keep an appropriate distance chosen by the first two introverts . 
  they 're not even introverts . 
  the second person thinks , oh , there 's a person there . 
  since there is so much space i 'll stand a couple of meters away so the first person can keep personal space . 
   i 'm gay that 's cheating . 
  are you saying you make friends with strangers on public transport ? 
  i ca n't even remotely fathom how weird it would be to try to get contact information from a stranger after a meager 5-30 minute of boring small-talk . 
  the only time i got any joy out of talking to strangers on public transport was on a greyhound from la to las vegas with a old rich dude who could hold a conversation by himself . 
  i was still not remotely interested in getting his contact number or whatever . 
  i was thinking eggs benedict cucumbersnatch, 
  no country can survive with sub replacement fertility rates over time . 
  if most women in germany is having 0-1 children , the few that have 3 + is literally saving the country from dying out and should be celebrated . 
  entitled ? 
  i ca n't imagine viewing my post in such a manner . 
  it 's written as if i am a tourist in that case , but the same goes for my own culture and country . 
  fuck do i hate american `` white vs black '' thinking . 
  i dont want to meet poles or germans either when im in england . 
  new world people never seem to get this . 
  i want to meet english people with english traditions . 
  skin is irrelevant here , the english culture is what 's dying . 
  instead of fish n chips we get even more kebab . 
  no , read up the term fascist again . 
  few here advocate for dictatorship . 
  actually the state exists already to protect the nation . 
  that 's a nation state ... 
  in your silly little world we can not have any laws because they exist to preserve a nation . 
  ^ #justregressivethings, 
  you already said you do n't care if native germans die out . 
  even becoming a minority would be a fatal blow to german culture and therefore the german language and eventually economy and all else would lead to a civilization spiral of death for germany . 
  i 'm curious , have any `` communist '' or `` socialist '' governments ever implement full public ownership of the means of production ? 
  i 'd imagine since these countries often have been poor that corruption have been rampant . 
   article 4 freedom of faith and conscience ( 1 ) freedom of faith and of conscience , and freedom to profess a religious or philosophical creed , shall be inviolable . 
  the nazi symbols ban already violates this and basically voids it altogether in most peoples minds . 
  if you ban hateful ideologies you might aswell ban islamist symbols also . 
  or iranian ones . 
  we had a law proposal here in norway that we could ban funding of religious houses from countries without freedom of religion . 
  seems completely reasonable , justified , equal and all that good shit . 
  yeah now it 's 4 times more expensive and pays twice as much . 
  hey ... we might be giving them a mountain on their birthday . 
  what are you giving , lithuania ? 
  i agree denmark probably has more very good arable land . 
  but food can also come from fish , kelp and there certainly is plants that will grow together fine in historical rocky pine forest land . 
  norway was as of 2014 the second largest seafood exporter in the world . 
  what i mean is each of the scandinavian countries could probably if needed support a population at least 5x the current size . 
  i heard denmark produces enough food alone to feed 50 million people . 
  i 'd think sweden could do the same . 
  norway too .

  but norway is n't in the european union . 
  there are a couple well known ones in norway . 
  as in , i just know of two people who have been in the media . 
  they 're considered batshit crazy . 
  one of them , a women , was thrown out of her house a couple of years ago because she did n't pay her mortgage or something . 
  she called her house `` niceland '' and claimed it was a sovereign nation . 
  hm , i 've never heard `` england '' used to refer to gb/uk, 
  look at the flair !, 
  i 'd say most norwegians have a healthy amount of nationalism . 
  every constitutional day ( may 17 ) most people celebrate and a lot of people celebrate in the streets . 
  i might check out the final , but not the semi . 
  yeah , lower secondary school in norway is mandatory , three years , from age 13-16 . 
  the one i talked about above , upper secondary school , is also three years ( or two years plus two years of internship for vocational studies ) , from 16-19 , and is optional ( but you need it if you want to take higher education ) . 
  i think your chances of finding someone who knows about both the norwegian and czech educational systems might be pretty slim , unfortunately . 
  i know very little about it , at least , but i can answer specific questions about the norwegian system , as i said . 
  but in general i think education is held in high esteem in czechia . 
  were n't they among the first countries to introduce mandatory education ? 
  secondary education is probably seen as something you basically just do ? 
  i 'm just guessing here , i 've never even been to czechia , but it 's probably cultural . 
  ( might also be a difference in definition , czechia is in the eu unlike norway ), 
  what 's your question exactly ? 
  why those two countries ? 
  i know nothing about the czech republic or its educational system , but in norway people attend upper secondary school ( `` videreg\u00e5ende skole '' ) mostly to prepare for higher education . 
  vocational education is less attractive than in other countries ( perhaps including czechia ? ) . 
  even vocational secondary school has a lot of theory now , to the chagrin of less theoretical pupils . 
  in some parts of the country jobs have traditionally been in petroleum ( engineering , requires higher education ) , farming ( requires no formal education , including secondary ) , and fishing ( ditto ) . 
  many people with secondary education in the cities take higher education , to completion or not . 
  a lot of more vocational jobs are covered by swedes , poles and other immigrants . 
  troll and [ nisser ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/nisse_%28folklore%29 ), 
  in norway we call the czech republic `` tsjekkia '', 
  you 'd be the 19th since troms and finnmark are merging now . 
  probably more to come too . 
  are n't you more like slavs ? 
  started drinking properly and regularly at 15 or 16 . 
  i mostly had older friends who were 18 who bought it for me for their parties . 
  felt neither too early nor too late ( of course i drank with these older friends to whom drinking was no big deal , so it felt natural ) . 
  once in a while we drank some moonshine they 'd procured , though , which was a bit unnecessary in hindsight . 
  ( age limit for strong liquor is 20 , beer/cider/wine is 18 ), 
  they 're not language purists , they 're racists . 
  why is it revolting ? 
  what 's the issue with it ? 
  english is also a frankenstein-esque creation , btw . 
  it 's a german language with a lot of influence from romance languages . 
  revolting . 
  still water , usually tap water ( which is great here ) . 
  but sparkling water is also popular in the form of farris , a national treasure . 
  we explicitly call it farris , though . 
  oslo , norway . 
  there are traces of stone age settlements that are 10 400 years old . 
  there has been a city in the area since around year 1000 ad and it 's apparently northern europe 's second largest middle age city . 
  haha . 
  all righty then !, 
  we do n't say `` s\u00f8ta '' either . 
  the norwegian phrase would be `` s\u00f8te bror '' , we 're just affectionately writing in mock swedish . 
  sweden . 
  all our jokes are about swedes , we quarrel with swedes in all sports ( the important thing is n't to win , it 's to beat sweden ) , etc. 
   in america we do not have religious political parties due to our laws . 
  well , both your parties consist of religious people , so i 'm not sure what the difference is . 
  the republicans more so . 
  candidates for office talk about religion all the time . 
  officials say `` god bless america '' and pray for victims of natural catastrophes and terror . 
  most european countries have one christian party ; the us has two . 
  i 'm curious to know what laws you 're talking about . 
  the constitution says that the government ca n't favor any religion . 
  religious organizations ca n't be tax-exempt if they endorse political candidates . 
  and if laws exist that ban `` religious political parties '' ( whatever that is ) , what do they do ? 
  say that political parties ca n't use the names of religions in their name ? 
  who was your last non-christian president ? 
  jefferson , perhaps ? 
  apparently four presidents have not sworn in on a bible , so i guess there might be more , but usually it 'd be considered political suicide to be an atheist . 
  not so in the majority of europe , where religion is strictly kept out of any political party except for the religious parties . 
   the only `` christian issue '' we have here in america i can think of are abortion and contraceptive rights . 
  well , when you 're a christian , most issues are christian issues . 
  social conservatism is more or less christian moral values wrapped in politics . 
  * israel * education ( creationism , sex ed ) * euthanasia * surrogacy * drugs ( legalizing marijuana , the war on drugs ) * lgbt issues ( even if the religious in the us have given up on gay marriage , social conservatism is strong , cf. 
  the trans person toilet issue ) * foreign aid ( in europe , christian parties usually give a lot of foreign aid and are positive to refugees ; in the us , the fight against `` godless communists '' in the cold war made judeo-christian values much more politically important , and aid to non-judeo-christians less important ) http://www.bu.edu/cas/magazine/fall15/america/, 
   what are the christian parties that i hear about in europe ? 
  yeah , there are lots of christian parties in europe . 
  see : * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/christian_democracy * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_people%27s_party * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/centrist_democrat_international  are these parties actually solely christians focusing on christian issues and ideas ? 
  not at all . 
  in norway we have the [ christian democratic party ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/christian_democratic_party_ ( norway \\ ) ) . 
  they had the prime minister between 1997 and 2000 , and have been part of other coalitions ( and are currently a support party for the coalition government , although not a part of it ) , so they have long experience with governance . 
  internationally i guess ours is pretty left-leaning for a christian party ; they 're centrist , with conservative vies on social issues and leftist views on economic issues : * they think it 's ok for gay people to enter civil unions , but not to marry and adopt kids * they 're neutral on gay clergy , calling it an issue for the church ( norway had a state church until january 1st this year ) * they support accessibility to contraception as a way of lowering abortion rates , and they do think abortion is ok in cases of rape or when the mother 's life is at risk * they passed strict biotechnology laws last time they were in power, 
  can i only choose between the two ??? 
  oh , i guess that 's how it is in the us . 
  a million different frozen pepperoni pizzas to choose from at walmart , just two viable political parties . 
  democrat then . 
  what 's graduate school exactly ? 
  its own school for people who have bachelors ? 
  i do n't understand your question . 
  in my country we have universities , which offer bachelor grades , master grades and phds . 
  there 's no separate school for stuff above bachelor grade . 
  admittance to university is done on background of your upper secondary school ( or high school ) grades . 
  some programmes also require you to have taken specific courses in secondary school , like computer science which usually requires you to have taken advanced math . 
  badly edit : [ it would seem i was right ] ( https://www.facebook.com/theguardian/videos/1692462444114149/ ), 
  hey , come on , do n't be like that . 
  norway , sweden and denmark pretty much speak the same language already , norway has been in unions with both denmark and sweden fairly recently , etc. 
  we 'll probably warm up to you , but we 're already like siblings over here and you 're more like a cousin . 
  heeeeey , 
  sure , happens often here in norway too .

  wow such environment / s the worst part of this , however , is the precedent . 
  norwegian public stock ownership has up until now been run very technocratically , with the state telling the technocrats `` we want a long-term return with low risk , fix it pls '' and then leaving the specifics up to the technocrats ; this has been a smashing success . 
  this may open the floodgates for using our oil money for shit populist stunts , like this one . 
   immigration and emigration are as much a part of european history as wars and kings . 
  these immigrations and emigrations were often * very * painful for the existing population , and eroded their identity , sometimes eroding their very people . 
  an irish person would be insane not to oppose viking involvement in his country . 
  today it is less painful , but this argument that migration happened in the past , hence it 's just cool , and the myth that migrations are painless , must end . 
  the germans in spain and thailand are n't changing their citizenship , and they are n't withdrawing funds from the local budget , or taking jobs ; in fact they pay for everything themselves ( well , via the german budget if they 're old ... ) and provide both jobs and income to the population living there . 
  oh and they 're old , so they wo n't really leave any demographic imprint . 
  the nonwestern immigration to the west is pretty much the polar opposite . 
  if they are serious about reducing environmental footprint , no they should n't . 
  also , if these new people withdraw more money and resources from society than they provide , they will deepen the economic problems , not solve them . 
  incidentally this is mostly the case ... 
  i was n't quite clear on what rabobi was referring to here ... 
  but if we are going to bomb the boats * before * people get into them , well , that 's impossible . 
  a refugee boat is indistinguishable from a fishing vessel until refugees are actually in it , and bombing the local populations hard earned boats will be * extremely * unpopular not to say immoral . 
   honestly i 'm not sure what the results of the bombing the boats approach is going to be if it get used what would happen is first , mass murder then , crossings would immediately stop that said , i hope i 'm not alone in thinking mass murder is n't really ok , even if it secures our borders . 
  scandinavians are n't prettier than others , they really look quite ordinary compared to ... well ... other europeans . 
  the only difference is a higher incidence of blue eyes and blonde hair , but the latter is getting increasingly irrelevant now that hair colouring is so widespread . 
  a % tax each year on everything you own . 
  money , stocks etc. 
  but houses are sort of excluded . 
  norway has a tax system which disincentivizes saving and incentivizes investment in property ; combined with booming property taxes , it leads to people living in very expensive , highly indebted houses . 
  disincentives to saving : a wealth tax of around 1 % ( i believe ? ), 
  as well as paying tax ( 28 % ? ), 
  on the capital gains on interest . 
  on the other hand , if you buy a house , then you will * not pay property taxes on the house * - well , that 's not 100 % true , but the house only counts as a fraction of it 's real value , on the wealth taxation meter . 
  oh , and the interest you pay , you do n't have to pay taxes on . 
  so if i pay 10x in interest , then i do n't have to pay taxes on that 10x . 
  there are also not many places with property tax , that is set locally . 
  i 'm right leaning personally , but i wish the state would set a national property tax of at least 1 % . 
  so , we have an almost symmetrical set of disincentives to saving , and incentives to spending . 
  well that program was spectacularly unsuccessful , as their deficit spending numbers attests to . 
  as such , they did not employ austerity , though they may have talked about it . 
  i hope you 're not under the illusion that the uk employed austerity during the crisis , or now for that matter , silly american . 
  they had massive deficit spending now and then . 
  that is not austerity . 
  wait , he did n't use ppp ? 
  that 's downright fraudulent . 
  per capita , ppp is the only relevant statistic . 
   i find it interesting how many european countries did not look at the french example a bit more closely to avoid commiting the same mistakes . 
  this is like ... immigration policy in a nutshell . 
  two dozen countries making the same mistakes right after each others . 
  empiricism , and learning from other countries mistakes is just not something you do . 
  i 'll be watching something more harmonious , like meatspin , tubgirl or lemonparty , thank you . 
  what 's with the rooster ? 
  is n't the traditional thing a bear ? 
  and what is 522 error ? 
  how reliable is that site ? 
  i agree that the war against libya was horrible , but it is n't the * cause * of these immigrants . 
  almost all of these immigrants , except for a few hundred , are from these 7 countries : gambia , senegal , somalia , syria , mali , eritrea , nigeria . 
  source http://politiken.dk/udland/ece2653847/statistik-baadfolket-stammer-fra-blot-7-lande/ which again refers to iom ( though not directly to the paper , annoyingly enough ), 
  with france , uk , and most of eastern europe ( right ? ), 
  strongly opposed , there 's no way it 's gon na pass , right ? 
   why do tourists drive slower ? 
   they are unused to driving on mountain roads . 
  ah , that would make more sense . 
  though ... 
  i 'm not quite certain we are going to make that much sense . 
  past experience would speak against it . 
   `` these problems of great migrations are much like those of the rural exodus . 
  people are leaving the countryside to the cities driven by poverty , the same way people leave poor countries to go to rich countries , simply because their situation is untenable , '' the nigerien leader said . 
  l o l , even the africans admit the ` migrants ' are economically driven , not by any need for asylum . 
   several shelters are to open in niger in an attempt to curb illegal migration to europe , the french interior minister has said . 
  yea because shelters are gon na stop economic immigrants . 
  jesus christ , the african countries have more reality-based policies than we have . 
  yeah you 've never had to deal with them huh ? 
  and the crying libtards does n't help , with their endless newspaper barrage of `` anele ( 7 ) is a begger girl who only wants a place to camp , evil people kick her out '' which sabotages the effort . 
  oh and of course , they can always move 1 km down road , then up , then back ... 
  i never said it was north korea , that 's a stupid strawman from your side . 
  but their culture * is * conformist as fuck , there is no denying it . 
   they 'd need a permit for that , and it 's highly unlikely that the local council would approve a random caravan park in the middle of a suburb . 
  it 's highly unlikely that the travellers would give a shit about that , if they are anything like gypsies, 
  no dissent allowed . 
  swedes have a conformist and centralized culture , in which correct opinions are being decided in stockholm . 
  speaking out against the dominating narrative is frowned upon - you * just do n't do * that . 
  hence , most of the stuff you see is going to reflect upper class stockholm values . 
  it 's a stupid silencing technique . 
  for some reason people think / r/bad [ topic ] 's are authorities on anything , so people quote those places when they want to say you 're wrong . 
  admittedly , many wwii experiences were like that . 
  but post-war immigration from asia and africa , which is what these asylum seekers are ... 
  it 's a tad weird is n't it , to see so many of them on european streets , if they were supposed to return after the war ended ? 
   hoping to repatriate them is unrealistic imo . 
  and ahistorical . 
  i do n't know of any refugee group in modern history , which has returned to their country of origin . 
  if they exist we 're talking single digit percentages . 
  in other words : history is a cruel , heartless bitch , and anyone who expects mercy from it is a fool . 
  we had an ethics revolution in the west . 
  the modern liberal code of ethics is 100 % unique in history . 
  and here you are , assuming that a far off place is going to become exactly like us , in the future ... 
  when we even have large problems convincing * those that are already here * to adopt our mindset . 
  talk about being naive . 
   otherwise the general idea behind asylum is to repatriate refugees as soon as war/dictatorship/whatever is over . 
  lol , no . 
  this has happened like , three times in the history of asylum immigration ? 
  even if that * was * the principle , you ca n't kick out the children ( of which they have many ) and most places give citizenship status quickly ... 
  why look to the future , when we can look to the present and past ? 
  history and the present is full of arabs and middle easterners trying to violently suppress other religions and ethnic groups . 
  if we had emigrated and set up churches , we 'd get fucking suicide bombed - see , christian in the middle east . 
  and what rights does refugees have in turkey or lebanon ?

  having an abortion is safer than not having an abortion , because having an abortion means that you have a shorter pregnancy , and a smaller fetus to deal with . 
  so it 's safer the earlier it 's done . 
  sure , responsible potential parents should adopt rather than reproduce . 
  there is a significant difference between having the option of and being offered counseling , on top of being able to explore the information that 's available on your own , vs. someone requiring that you have go through something before you 're allowed to make your decision . 
  especially considering what they 're trying to do in many states in the us , and that they 're even requiring that doctors [ misinform their patients ] ( https://thinkprogress.org/doctors-challenge-unscientific-abortion-laws-that-force-them-to-practice-bad-medicine-9a6dabaccad1 ) . 
  if we 're looking to inform people , first of all we should be making sure that sex education is as thorough as possible . 
  everyone should know about this well ahead of getting into the situation . 
  beyond that , we have to do everything we can to avoid anti-abortionists being the ones who decide what should be mandatory , because they 're not interested in what 's best for the patient . 
  and if we 're setting up things up to be as informative as possible , it should be unnecessary to make it mandatory for the patient , because it would be something that they would welcome if they needed it . 
  do you think it 's responsible to have kids be born to parents who are n't able or willing to take care of them ? 
   i 'm asking because afaik abortion is quite an operation , invasive and risky in itself . 
  much less so than labor and going through the entire pregnancy . 
  should we make it mandatory for all pregnant women to be counseled about having an abortion ? 
  have to make sure they consider their options , but not teach them about it properly in school for whatever reason . 
  not sure why it would be swept under the rug . 
  migration is one of the core reasons why we need mass vaccination and herd immunity . 
  that 's how diseases spread ( the ones that spread from human to human ) ; someone with the disease moves to a different location and interacts with a different group of people . 
  the lower the vaccination rates of your part of the world , the more vulnerable you 'll be to outbreaks caused by migration . 
   do n't get me wrong , anyone should be free to refuse modern medicine should they choose to , but that does not apply to their kids . 
  or everyone else 's kids . 
  if you 're not vaccinated , you 're an attack vector . 
  some people ca n't get vaccinated or do n't develop an immunity ( or they become immunocompromised ) , and especially for their sake we should make sure that as many people as possible are vaccinated . 
  i 'd say that a questioning `` uh '' is pretty close , at least for a norwegian \u00f8 . 
  i suspect there 's some confirmation bias behind these statements . 
  because people seem to say that about every nationality or ethnic group . 
  in any group large enough , i 'd expect there to be some very attractive people . 
  and maybe those are the ones you take note of , if you 're not used to being around them all the time . 
  or if you only see them at certain tourist locations . 
  severe stress is a risk factor for miscarriage and stillbirth . 
  as in , being enemies all other days of the year . 
  the purge being the designated day of the year for a free-for-all killing spree . 
  so it 's like a reverse purge ? 
  with mutated latinos ? 
  not picking the eu is n't that quick . 
   the roster is generally full of volunteers though , so the people who do n't want to be there do n't actually have to . 
  this is what gets me . 
  why not just call everyone in for the session/evaluation process , and then let the ones who are interested sign up there ? 
  i do n't see why service has to be mandatory when so many people do n't serve . 
  it might seem like it 's effectively voluntary , but that does n't mean no one 's caught up in something they did n't want because of the current system . 
  yeah , the significance of this is that it 's about what people choose for themselves , rather than what they impose on others . 
  `` and i 'm going to spend my time and energy fighting against gay rights to show everyone how not gay i am '' . 
  yes , let 's create magical scenarios where torture saves the world to justify torturing prisoners who have not been charged with anything or had any sort of due process . 
  and are locked up for months , so the ticking time bomb excuse is n't there . 
  although if there was a bomb about to go off , and you somehow had ended up with the actual person responsible without doing any of the necessary work to establish that that was the case , then that would be the ideal scenario for them to wait out the torture and get their way . 
  torture is both inferior to other means of investigation and interrogation , and engaging in torture is a statement that you do n't care about reducing human suffering , as you deliberately cause it . 
  so what 's the point of it ? 
   parents torture their children all the time and most people do n't find it a problem . 
  the government doing it is n't much different . 
  parents who abuse their children is a problem the norwegian government gets vilified for dealing with , so maybe you 're right . 
  maybe other countries do n't care about when people with all the power deliberately cause harm to people with no power . 
  except when someone tries to stop them from doing it . 
  it 's according to your own constitution . 
   the index counts states that use torture as undemocratic , even though it has nothing to do with democracy . 
  cruel and unusual punishment has a lot to do with democracy . 
  if you 're not respecting human rights , you 're not respecting citizens . 
   any rational moral thinking person would agree that torture can be used in rare circumstances . 
  it can not be used with any legitimate purpose in any circumstance . 
  you can use it , if all you care about is inflicting pain , and ultimately do n't care about justice in any way whatsoever . 
  i 'm happy for the eu and eurozone to thrive , but we do n't need to be in it to benefit from it , and we can avoid some of the conflicts and drama being on the outside . 
  england 's the most densely populated country in europe , apart from the city-states . 
  my answer would 've been different at different stages of the program . 
  he had peaked long before he left , and did n't seem into it anymore . 
  alternatively , with people deciding it 's important to provide food aid but not to provide the means to sustainable population growth . 
  and even sending out missionaries telling people it 's wrong to control their reproduction , wrong to have sex without the intention of producing children , to the point where you should n't take precautions against spreading stis if it prevents reproduction . 
  if there 's a problem with this , it 's that the trend is n't spreading to every part of the world . 
  7.4 billion is about 7.3 billion more than we absolutely need , and probably several billion beyond the number of humans where it would be possible for everyone to be able to live comfortably . 
  so they can see sexyorangutansinpinktututs.com, 
  unless you look at it as scandinavia . 
  any warmer than that , and it 's just ridiculous . 
  i ultimately had to get ac for my house . 
  possibly because it 's not built for much but being constantly heated by wood stoves , but it 's not possible to function above 25 with short nights and no chance of the house being cooled down before it starts up again . 
  when our cats do it we call it their tv . 
  probably not much else going on . 
  it 's the canada of eurasia . 
  lib dems are n't in government anymore . 
  because all their comedians emigrate ? 
  6 \u00b0 c temperature change happening in a few centuries can be as severe as a massive meteor impact . 
  20,000 years ago we were 4 \u00b0 c colder , and it took thousands of years from there to leave the ice age and go into our current interglacial period . 
  near total as in a mass extinction event . 
  one that 's affecting the oceans as much as land and the atmosphere . 
  life will go on , but it will be different . 
  extinct species ca n't be returned . 
  problem is we 're already at a point where near total destruction is inevitable , if we do n't make deliberate efforts to avoid it . 
  i 'd be fine with going after the major corporations like exxon who have actively worked to prevent those efforts from happening . 
  seize assets to help pay for projects like clean energy production and carbon sequestration . 
  so we need to make sure we do n't destroy our own civilization , as it 's unlikely another one will arise later . 
  they wo n't even have the easy access to oil , for hundreds of millions of years . 
   `` if twitter forces me to see these things , then they 'll have to see them too , '' the artist said in the video , posted on monday . 
  does it ? 
  i 've only seen one tweet this week , and i would n't have if i had n't looked it up . 
  you could try moving to scotland and wait a few years . 
  almost there . 
  two olsenbandens  any other cold war era comedy crime crew, 
  looks like there are some unclaimed islands . 
  potato whale . 
   i do n't think he could have done so , politically what does that really mean for a president who does n't even have to deal with a midterm anymore ? 
   only real benefit of political ads i can see , is if you 're in a country where the view of certain parties is suppressed somehow . 
  which probably means only certain parties would be allowed to advertise anyway . 
  maybe sexbots will have more of an impact . 
   but they say that the data stayed within sweden and that witness protection folks do n't need to worry .

  we should have a joint european defence, 
  i am from norway , so i will use the norwegian system as an example . 
  the politicians get their knowledge from the departments they lead . 
  for example , the financial minister get knowledge from the department of finance . 
  these departments have one job ; to know as much as possible about their respective fields . 
  when the politicians are elected to power they pledge to serve norway in the best interest of the people . 
  if they do not , you have two ways of removing them form power : 1 . 
  you wait for the next election and vote for another candidate/party . 
  the parlament eniciates a vote of no confidence . 
  haha , nice, 
  nice . 
  keep on going , this is a great idea !, 
  btw : maybe you could implement `` green texting '' , like they have over at 4chan ? 
  it would be fun :3, 
  this is why most democratic countries do not have direct democrasy . 
  you can \u00b4 t expect the general population to know everything about international macro-economics , political relationships , social development ect ... we have politicians and departments of goverment for a reason, 
  personaly i find it a little hard to see were comments begin and end , and the primitive design can scare off newcomers . 
  you sould use colors or something to more easily seperate comments and users from each other and make the site more modern/minimalistic/simple than reddit . 
  pfft , ever googled `` norway '' ? 
  it makes switzerland look poor, 
  tips to make a improved european `` version '' of reddit : - prettier overall design - simplified comment section - integration with google translate ( like presseurop ), 
  well , this site won \u00b4 t start at the same size as reddit is today . 
  like any other website it will grow over time , making the costs increase gradually . 
  the owner could use this time to gather money . 
  the reason i , personaly , as a european , would use this site is since it \u00b4 s based in europe . 
  even if it \u00b4 s just a clone of reddit , i would use it . 
  i am tired of using american products ... it \u00b4 s nothing against you americans , it \u00b4 s just that i feel it \u00b4 s time to desentrialize the internet . 
  this is a great idea !, 
  we need more european innovation !, 
  if you make this i will gladly use it , 
  what is wrong with this video ? 
  it may over exaggerat a little but it stays true in its core ; the south spent too much for too long , therefore was irresponsible and sould change its economic policies to become more viable and trustworthy, 
  epp group, 
  what do you guys think about this ? 
  this is the result of a naive immigration policy, 
  it \u00b4 s the goal of the epp which currently holds the presidency . 
  http://www.epp.eu/policy-areas#europe http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_people's_party, 
  the current commission \u00b4 s ultimate goal is to turn the eu into a federation . 
  thats the goal of the epp atleast . 
  because the european commission is incompetent . 
  they focus on retarded stuff as lowering vacum-noise for eviromental reasons and banning olive oil , in the middle of a financial crisis . 
  what they sould focus on is the massive unemployment , the failed austerity measures and the creation of a true economic union ( to strengthen the euro ) . 
  in other words ; the european commission is is focusing on the wrong problems , usualy problems that are in the jurisdiction of nation-states ( this is why britten is pissed-off ) , instead of real european-level problems . 
  yeah right , mr. zero per cent gdp-growth . 
  well , `` der spiegel international '' is pretty legit, 
  i wish that my country norway would join the eu, 
  an european federation would be the best for europe . 
  it would make us more competitive against the usa and china , and it would make the eu a more stable union . 
  but before we go all state-like we need to prioritise a banking union and fiscal union to stabilise and secure the credibility of the euro . 
  norway \u00b4 s massive oil-fund, 
  i do n't like it, 
  well , it \u00b4 s not very surprising that 8 out of 10 are european countries . 
  europe is after all a pretty sweet place to live . 
  in norway we have too much respect for each other to use massmurder in political elections , so it was never brought up . 
  well , i \u00b4 m a norwegian and i \u00b4 m pretty happy so i guess the study is accurate, 
  europe seems to become more connected even thought there is a financial-crises . 
  i like this, 
  coop, 
  i would like a european federation, 
  ever heard of multicom ? 
  it is a investment fund created by the norwegian government . 
  norway has a 700 billion dollar fund . 
  the largest fund in the world, 
  you also get +2 gb if you download the jottacloud app . 
  i personally have 12gb, 
  norway dose not have a spy-program . 
  we have a data collection program though , but for the government to get information from that program they need to get a court order from a public court . 
  jottacloud uses servers based in norway . 
  it \u00b4 s pretty safe, 
  we sould do this in eurpe too . 
  close off the mediterranean and aegean sea . 
  unified eu military controled by a democratically elected president accountable to the parliament . 
  cannes , or center of oslo and sell it of for profit . 
  why the distrust of norway and sweden ? 
  the eu should trade crimea for kalingrad, 
  amen, 
  haha , nice !, 
  glorious !, 
  i see russia as being russia . 
  it 's not european nor asian, 
  what do you mean ? 
  forever, 
  norway is not neutral . 
  we are a member of nato and a loyal ally of the eu . 
  we have imposed sanctions on russia just like you .

  storo = huge orgasm . . ok wtf . 
  they have taken some liberties here, 
  i think you are overestimating how much people care about the eea, 
  there are several reasons : 1 . 
  we are not in the eu because most norwegians do n't really care .

how does that change what merkel is saying ? 
  i 'm pretty anti-feminist , but i wholeheartedly support what they did here . 
  this is the type of feminism i will gladly get behind . 
   i thoguht your claim was that 100 % of the assult rapes were done by immigrants ? 
  well , technically , the claim is not mine . 
  i 'm citing an official statistic published by the norwegian police . 
  i understand that you 're taking the apologist stance , but then perhaps you do n't know what it 's like to live here . 
  in the summers of 2012 , and 2013 especially , oslo suffered what was called a `` rape-wave '' . 
  it got to a point where police were forced to deploy a large amount additional forces , particularly in the weekends , and the city council had to illuminate large areas that were otherwise dark at night to combat the assaults . 
  the extreme majority , if not all of these rapes , were committed by foreigners . 
  there is also the anecdotal route , which i can personally vouch for , where i know several women who have fallen victim to these crimes . 
  if not them , i have friends of friends with similar tales . 
  in every single instance , the rape was committed by a foreigner . 
  if you think i somehow believe that norwegians can not commit these types of crimes , you are wrong . 
  the claim is that foreigners are over-represented , which they are by a milestone . 
  additionally , we are talking are assault rapes . 
  spousal rape , domestic rape and drunken rape is another matter entirely . 
   thanks for your downvote !, 
  never did , but okay . 
  as far as i can remember from the 2014 report ( it might have been 2013 , not sure ) , the police reported that all assault rapes committed had been committed by those with a non-western background . 
  ca n't tell you much about the 2011 statistic . 
  i 'm not sure what you are even trying to prove . 
  the claim is that non-western immigrants are overrepresented in rape statistics , and that claim remains true . 
  same thing in norway . 
  in 2014 , ** 100 % ** of all assault rapes were perpetrated by immigrants . 
  this statistic came directly from the norwegian police , too . 
  you are absolutely right . 
  however , in order to resolve this , we also have to understand how it began . 
  sweden is beginning to suffer the same fate as the us . 
  calls for tolerance , equality and inclusion have tipped the scale into intolerance , inequality and exclusion . 
  sweden is the country in europe which suffers the greatest loss of intellectual integrity due to this new wave of liberal extremism which renders any difficult moral question impossible to answer without being branded a hate-mongering bigot . 
  another result of this is `` equality kindergartens '' , a new phenomenon exclusive to sweden , where children are not allowed to say `` he '' or `` she '' , because it is seen as oppressive and sexist . 
  if you 're a fan of / r/tumblrinaction , save up for a holiday in sweden , because it 's slowly starting to turn into its real life equivalent . 
  then you 're ignoring [ roseng\u00e5rd ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/roseng%c3%a5rd ) and other areas , particularly those in malm\u00f6 . 
  the article does blow things out of proportion , but it is not blatantly false . 
  i 'm not swedish , but as a norwegian i can share one perspective . 
  as it is right now , sweden has become somewhat of a laughing stock to other scandinavians . 
  if i had a penny for every time i 've heard * `` well , at least we 're not sweden '' * , i 'd be a rich man . 
  its also important to note that this is a new opinion . 
  while norwegians and swedes have always made fun of each other , it has always been in a brotherly tone . 
  lately , that tone has been more rooted in pity and mockery . 
  from an outsider 's perspective , many of us believe that sweden has been completely consumed by political correctness . 
  the article points out that the media is not allowed to point out any characteristics of suspects that might reveal ethnicity or country of origin . 
  this is not only completely true , but there are also examples of the media deliberately portraying muslim suspects as ethnic swedes . 
  when merely stating something factual about a suspect can be perceived as institutional racism , something is clearly wrong . 
  the sweden democrats , the only party in sweden which questions the current state of immigration in sweden , have literally been attacked in the streets and branded as nazis . 
  while the sweden democrats are clearly not an ideal political party anywhere , the censorship and suppression they have to endure is an indication of a society which is slowly losing its grasp on freedom of speech and freedom of thought . 
  that 's really racist sweden be careful you might get b\u00e4nnade . 
  sure . 
  sure sweden , * that 's * what they 're talking about . 
  enjoy your / r/europe ban !, 
  ** quiet !, 
  7000 hookers and 30.000 grams of high-grade marijuana and you 've got yourself a deal . 
  shh , it 's okay , the americans are sleeping . 
  a transgender , polyamorous , transracial muslim with multiple sclerosis who identifies as male-bodied anime boy . 
  i do n't know . 
  i do n't claim to know . 
  but i can certainly recognize a terrible idea when i see one . 
  it 's a religious prophecy . 
  they believe that once the world collapses into full-scale religious war , a great battle will take place [ somewhere in iraq or syria , ca n't remember where , ca n't be arsed to google ] . 
  this will then bring on the end of days . 
   when it must be them who are afraid of our reaction and response . 
  who is * them * ? 
  excellent false dichotomy . 
  you get a medal . 
  except that outside of the schoolyard lurk street gangs , waiting for angry youth to recruit . 
  not only that , they happen to be an ethnic gang , and the guy you just punched back is of that ethnicity . 
  in fact , they were really hoping that you 'd punch him , so that not only him , but all of his friends will join . 
  and so you punch , knowing this will happen , and then your neighborhood gets terrorized and you stand there staring at the sky , wondering how life can be this strange . 
  let me also point out just how disastrously flawed your entire analogy is . 
  who are you supposed to ` bloody up ' ? 
  they turk whose been running the shop down the street for the past two decades ? 
  a random taxi driver ? 
  the first ` shitskin ' you see on the street ? 
  or perhaps , since they 're muslim , they must be transcendentally linked through some connected consciousness which makes them all guilty by association . 
  better just punch a random fellow on the street then . 
  that 'll knock the islamism right out of him . 
  that 'll make him head down to his local mosque , where bombs are being produced and terror plans laid out , and go * hm , you know what guys , perhaps this whole terrorism thing was a bit of a mistake * . 
  right , / r/thepioneer99 ? 
  right ? 
  * once you fight back and bloody them up they quit * . 
  yeah , because that ever worked . 
  have you ever picked up a history book ? 
  looked through one ? 
  but sure , go * bloody them up * . 
  go move the isis chess-pieces . 
  be the pawn . 
  so , let 's say we respond with ` force ' . 
  what exactly does that mean ? 
  * we ca n't be a punching bag . 
  * what does that imply ? 
  punching back ? 
  on what ? 
  on who ? 
  that 'll certainly go over well in this day and age . 
  or perhaps you 're talking about deportations ; mass deportations . 
  what do you think will be the result of that ? 
  do you think every foreigner is going to go * oh well , we enjoyed the fish and chips while it lasted * and just leave ? 
  isis ' entire agenda , their long term strategy , is to create a cataclysmic divide between ethnic europeans and muslims , to the point where europe breaks into large scale civil war . 
  this is not some speculation ; you can find this easily in their manifestos .
