  one , free market ( but really one , not like today when some services are available only in chosen countries etc. ), 
  and simple tax rules ( precise levels to be set by nations/lower adm. structures ) , one currency , common foreign affairs . 
  energy union , military alliance . 
  we are europeans after all and should cooperate . 
  more direct or liquid democracy and decentralization , 4 . 
  name : `` european union '' . 
  why change ? 
  it 'd be fine if it were n't for all that communists . 
  it ruins the effect . 
  were n't there other occasions ? 
  when you want to name polygon or other stuff it gets into one word , 
  well , polish is in fact very logical compared to the rest of languages , when it comes to numbers . 
  we have words for number 0-10 and for powers of 10s , and bind them together in descending order . 
  so it 's 999-gon . 
  between 3 and 4 . 
  imo it would be best to turn national states in something like switzerland cantons ( strong decentralization and liquid/direct democracy , free market ) , but maybe without neutrality in foreign affairs , and with guaranting nations right to secede or opt out from some parts of the union . 
  on the other hand , almost all slavic people can communicate with each other without learning any foreign language . 
  there 's even an artifical language called [ slovianski ] ( http://steen.free.fr/interslavic/ ) , that can be understood by any slav with no problems . 
  btw . 
  you were talking about rusyn or what dialect ? 
  it does n't work if you are talking with an imperialist trying to rebuild the russian empire . 
   strong economic sanctions will hurt europe 's economy almost as much as russia 's . 
  eu 's trade with russia is ~ 10 % of all eu trade and ~ 50 % of all russian trade ( mostly natural resources ) . 
  if we achieve energy union or will somehow become independent energetically from russia we could easily make economic pressure on them . 
   imho we need a more productive , a diplomatic approach to solve this crisis . 
  if not economic sanctions , then what ? 
  same in poland . 
  imo , in eu elections votes should go on european parties instead of national . 
  now it looks like a parody of national parliamentary elections . 
  the problem is , they are the biggest left-wing party in poland and have almost 10 % of seats in parliament . 
  so , do n't be surprised with high support for right-wing here :d, 
  today headlines : `` germans were sponsoring pm 's party '' - says europa + candidate . 
  earlier for example : `` i do n't give a shit about crimea nor politics . 
  if you too , vote for me '' ; `` gotham has batman , poland has hartman . 
  the best candidate in cracow '' ; `` i always have as much support in elections as waist circumference . 
  now i 'm even fatter . 
  i will win '', 
  i bet it would be the same if it were n't for `` europa + your move '' 's ridiculous campaign . 
  other parties initially acted as it were national elections , but now even them seem to loose interest . 
  imo , that 's because poles ( or polish media ) seem to be not interested in european politics at all . 
  things like ` net neutrality ' and such are rarely mentioned in mass media . 
  turkic language , history , 95 % of the population are muslims , strong persian influence , cultural heritage has strong ties with muslim world . 
  seems it 's culture is a mix of west and east . 
  i 'd say there 's more east of it , but it is really difficult to put a clear border between civilisations really . 
  anyway , if i 'd have to say where europe ends and asia begins i would include azerbaijan in asia . 
  btw . 
  soviets influenced culture of conquered conutries , but did n't destroy it . 
  georgia and armenia are culturally european . 
  very distinct from asian azarbaijan . 
  our history books also focus on all those wars and such , but it 's squabbling between eastern european realms ( germany , poland , czech , hungary , muscovy , lithuania , turkey , ** kievan rus ** ) . 
  ukrainian culture is definetely european , and appearance in western history courses has nothing to do with it . 
  how often austria is mentioned in portugal history books ? 
  fun fact 2 : [ flag of bohemia and old flag of czechoslovakia ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b1/flag_of_bohemia.svg/220px-flag_of_bohemia.svg.png ) . 
  [ flag of poland ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/1/12/flag_of_poland.svg/240px-flag_of_poland.svg.png ) . 
  and there would be gigantic german empire ? 
  no thanks . 
  no wwii , weaker soviet union , but also continued kulturkampf , no liberation of central european nations , no developing of democracy and integration in europe . 
  also , i doubt french and russian together would n't be able to challenge germany , especially because germany would be made in large part from not-german territories , whose inhabitants did n't like their rulers . 
  to me it looks like an opposite . 
  what 's wrong with old couple going through the street , children with ice-cream , man enjoying coffee , and plenty of pretty girls ? 
  there are a few photos from dirty places , a few photos of romas , but imo they are well balanced by other pictures . 
  thanks !, 
  the biggest issue imo is that the current way it works is a. complicated b. undemocratic . 
  there is plenty of institutions that correlate with each other in some ways but try to find a european who would know how . 
  the only way he can influence european politics more directly than in local elections of head of state is to vote in ep elections , which are some weird copy of local elections ( no party in poland is actually talking what they will do in ep , president of the 2nd biggest proposes debate about ... healthcare - sic ) , it 's very difficult to find out what the parties do when they are in ep , and people are not infromed what is going on there ( no word about net neutrality in polish media ) , instead ads of european funds ( i do n't see what 's it purpose ) are everywhere . 
  how can more integration be expected if people are discouraged to participate in european affairs ? 
  btw . 
  what fraction in ep is most liberal/libertarian/democratic ? 
  i do n't know and it 's not so easy to find out . 
  and even if i find out it may probably have no candidates in my country . 
  sad . 
  usually only about 2 % of workers are paid minimum wage , i do n't know why it is so important for left-wing . 
  `` workers ' dignity is back '' - what has minimum wage to do with workers dignity ? 
  gas does n't contribute more to global warming , it is made from coal ( gives co2 when burns ) and hydrogen ( gives water when burns ) , while coal is made from , guess what , coal only . 
  [ economic development ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/economic_development ) in statistics i provided you there is shown level of economic freedom . 
  gdp , hdi and history of these countries are easily findable in the internet . 
  read about chile , estonia , botswana . 
  i give you examples of capitalism in work , rather than discussing theoritically . 
  well , click on the [ interactive heat map ] ( http://www.heritage.org/index/heatmap ) and tell me , would you choose to live in a red or green contry ? 
  belarus flag is best !, 
  sorry , [ link ] ( http://www.heritage.org/index ) . 
   are you going to complete that sentence ? 
  capitalism  socialism , if there is n't an super extraordinary situation . 
  socialism is not a legitimate alternative . 
  we had experiment of soviet revolution , we had experiment of the third way in africa , and we had western countries with capitalisms ( even if they were welfare states - still more capitalist than what soviets had ) . 
  now we can look at history and derivate conclusions . 
  even nowadays , you can argue that venezuela fought poverty , but it 's a country with enormous amounts of oil . 
  such estonia does not have natural resources , yet in 20 years after the fall of soviet union it 's one of the most developed countries east of oder . 
  why ? 
  because of economic freedom . 
  based on 2014 index of economic freedom by the heritage foundation and wall street journal , aswell as observations of development of my country . 
  the welfare states of europe started as capitalisms , when they had biggest economic growths . 
  the welfare states were built later , when those countries were ahead of the rest of the world in terms of economic progress . 
  also welfare state is not equal with socialism . 
  in most of european countries the markets are regulated by taxes rather than subsidies , and state is not actively intervening , if nothing wrong happens . 
  btw compare western block and soviet block during the cold war . 
   they do n't want us to believe that socialism is a legitimate alternative . 
  it is n't . 
  you do n't always have some hugo chavez or someone who will take care of the country and lead it cleverly . 
  there were plenty of socialisms in the world , yet i ca n't remember any that could be called ` succesful ' - even venesuelian one is disputable .

best wishes !, 
  we are not ? 
  are we sending all the asylum seekers to first safe countries ? 
  are we punishing them for trespassing borders of lots of countries ? 
  are we declining them the right to stay if they came from safe country , or lied ir broke another laws ? 
  we dont do it or do it partially . 
  instead of stopping them when we still could everyone just sat down and didnt give a fuck . 
  i dont know why honestly , whether they just dont care or are too weak to do something ... 
  ~ i wont edit most of typos and wording . 
  english is not my native tongue so i do know i 'm making lots of mistakes , i just hope i 'm being understandable . 
  but to the point : i never claimed otherwise . 
  their entry at the border of eu is legal per se if they will claim without delay to authorities they seek asylum protection ( so they could register and leave the country and register just by the borders in another , and another and another and ... that would be all ok in terms of law ... ehhh ... o_o ) if they fail to do that they are breaking treaties regarding refugees in general and countries laws regarding crossing borders in particular . 
  problem is : 90 % of immigrants ( i 'm taking the number out of my ass to be honest  just mu guess ) , calling themselves refugees come through safe countries - turkey , russia , maghreb countries and so on . 
  obviously that does not mean we can send them back . 
  human rights and treaties prohibit us from mass deportation without going on with asylum processes . 
  but at the same time lots ot the migrants either did come from safe country , crossed borders against the law , applied numerous times for asylum ( often under fake names ) , or simply doesnt come from dangerous places at all ( the wave does not contain only of syrians who do need some kind of help ) . 
  mate its ok to say you were wrong if you were  we are all trying to get a grasp on this thing and learn a thing or two . 
  so do i every day . 
   article 31 of the geneva convention says : the contracting states shall not impose penalties , on account of their illegal entry or presence , on refugees who , ** coming directly from a territory where their life or freedom was threatened ** in the sense of article 1 , enter or are present in their territory without authorization , ** provided they present themselves without delay to the authorities ** and show good cause for their illegal entry or presence . 
  thus it does not refer to immigrants who come from safe countries . 
  mate , that one is pretty obvious . 
   article 4.3 schengen border code : without prejudice to the exceptions provided for in paragraph 2 or to their international protection obligations , member states shall introduce penalties , in accordance with their national law , for the unauthorised crossing of external borders at places other than border crossing points or at times other than the fixed opening hours . 
  these penalties shall be effective , proportionate and dissuasive . 
   the flow of migrants had a direct knock-on effect on the western balkan route , where people who had arrived in greece were recorded for the second time re-entering the eu . 
  in the october-december period , there were 466 800 detections of illegal border-crossings associated with the migratory flow from serbia to croatia . 
  austria : `` illegal '' entry of individuals to the austrian territory is sanctioned with an administrative fine of 100 to 1,000 euros or up to two weeks of imprisonment ( art . 
  croatia : article 42 a natural person shall be subject to a penalty of a 30 day prison sentence or a 2.000 to 10,000 hrk fine and e administrative decision on expulsion if alien crossed or attempted to cross the state border illegally . 
  the prohibition of entry and stay issued in a decision on expulsion may not be less than three months or more than 20 years ( 107aliens act ) estonia : illegal crossing of the state border or temporary border line of the republic of estonia , if committed is punishable by a pecuniary punishment or up to one year of imprisonment . 
  the same act , if committed 1 ) by using violence ; or 2 ) by causing serious damage to health ; is punishable by 4 to 12 years ' imprisonment . 
  germany : the administrative offence in accordance with \u00a7 98 , section 5 , german residence act ( aufenthg ) , can be punished with a fine of up to euro 3,000 . 
  italy : the sanction imposed as a penalty is a fine from euro 5,000 to euro 10,000 euro . 
  sweden : a fine or a maximum of 1 year imprisonment . 
  norway : the punishment can be a fine or imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months or both . 
  there are other obviously , but i 'm at work and cant really go on with all of it . 
  some of those penalties are administrative , other are penal , yet it all comes to breaking the law . 
  well . 
  being immigrant does not allow you to cross lots of borders without permision just becouse you are yelling ` asylum ' right ? 
  that would be breaking the law of particular countries whose borders has been illegaly breached . 
  youre right . 
  althought they would still be sent to the first safe country they came by . 
  that is partialy true . 
  but this is connected one to another . 
  if we would firmly keep up to our laws and send them back as thi all starte the numbers would be definately smaller . 
  why go through half of the africa and then through mediterrean to just get send back another day ? 
  the same with other migration directions as well . 
  it makes you wonder : if he could avoid corruption of money and power he could become another hungarian hero but that wont happen , eh ? 
  and honestly this fella is doing better than the other goverments . 
  that would make them `` backwards '' wouldnt it ? 
  well ... one may ask for asylum only in first safe country he came to . 
  so basically 90 % of immigrants should be sent back to turkey or russia or some north african country where they arrived . 
  and yet we dont give a fuck and happily register them in centrl or northern europe where they came illegaly crossing couple borders while breaking the law . 
  well you got me there  in poland we didnt feel it that much ( or at least not where i lived ) . 
  althought the number was taken pretty randomly , refering to rather small ammount of illegal immigrants ( at least comparing to whats now ) in the past . 
  but im not shure if we can compare immigrants to refugees . 
  i have to agree with most of what yo usay but compasionate was an irony on my part . 
  she says she is but at the price of her ( german ) or our ( europenas in general ) people not her price so its just a words and i do get it . 
  the crisis was rising , you are right . 
  and if we would stop them now , with stron will to send them back according to our laws , while changing them , we wouldnt be so mych in shit right now, 
  maybe you are right and i would need to check it throughly with some decent translation . 
  media comments tend to distort sens of ones words but even then actions towards immigrants , or lack of actions , or taking slow actions while providinng money/shelters without work etc makes for a good invitation :(, 
  while i aknowledge shes unfortunataly one of the biggest politics in last 20 years of europe and i do know shes populistic , manipulative and opportunistic , inviting immigrants to germany does not seem as `` pushing away '' , more likely like drawing them . 
  she can . 
  and now what ? 
  it must be funny do to base your whole statement with some media - biased opinion with no support in facts . 
  it mus be funny to feel all superior and looking down on me yet you have no idea what you are talking about while being quite openly xenophobic . 
  way to go :d, 
  hey mate , greeting from poland  while the media tend to say the same shit as everywhere in europe about orban some of us aree able to look at him ( with the good things hes done and the bad ones ) objectively . 
  for all i know he did minimum of the right things in all this mess regarding immigrants so i hope eu wont force on you guys anything bad in this matter . 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9ydf7uidqo ask her about her rights . 
  i see no reason to treat my rights ( as a european , since youre so cunning and trying to pick on something like that ) as secondary to their rights . 
  even more . 
  we are at home . 
  we are the hosts . 
  our rights should have a priority . 
  theres one and only one thing that can save us . 
  and its not `` unvolountary quotas '' for all eu members . 
  its sticking to our own law . 
  why all of a sudden , after like 50 years theres suddenly sucha a problem ? 
  becouse those immigrants saw that we are unable to abide to our own law regarding immigrants . 
  so , if we wont send them back , stop them or anything , why would they give a flying fuck about our borders and about our law ? 
  they wouldnt . 
  thats why they are coming . 
  also ... 
  the law has holes , the law , becouse of `` human rights '' ( which obviously apply only to other people , not european ) we cant really sufficiently defend ourselves , and they all are exploiting it . 
  nedt time merkel will will say some stupid shit about compasion ask her about compasion to europeans . 
   the day i get to become world leader , is the mankinds population is reduced to 200 million . 
  we need more compassion and empathy i see what you did there , 
  that changes literraly nothing . 
  there is no law that would bring anything about planned forces ( they dont really know yet how they will be constructed ! ), 
  being similar to those fucking bastards . 
  there are no final decisions about implementing those things in any law actually . 
  and even if , that would actually act in favor of opposition nad make them nothing like sa you populist . 
  nations will does not mean goverments will if we assume that most of our society would be against current goverment . 
  im not even going into difference between general directives and tenets ... 
  we both know that political force behind most of the protest are po ( kod leader was taking part in po actions during presidential elections ) and nowoczesna . 
  we were talking big politics not grasroots . 
  its obvious that normal manifestantes are mostly not inclinded politicaly ( in sense that they are not members of political parties ) . 
   oh , i do n't know how to properly name polish offices in english so i dont know anything about democracy . . yes . 
  wrong . 
  you know little , becouse you say something that have nothing in common with democracy per se as something that is supposedly dismantling democracy .

  no , you probably wo n't even notice the protests . 
  have a nice stay . 
   poland and turkey had parties with comfortable majority and a personality cult around their leader . 
  you mean kaczy\u0144ski ? 
  52 % of poles does n't trust him , 10 % is indifferent , 35 % trust him and the rest does n't know . 
  hardly a personality cult .

   as a polish citizen of lithuania sorry to ask , but i 'm curious - do poles from lithuania generally have dual citizenship ? 
  how does it work ? 
  is everyone bilingual ? 
  42 % for people under 35 is extremely high . 
  excuse me if i remain sceptical ... 0-2 % ? 
  i do n't know . 
  i 'd prefer poland to be poland and lithuania to be lithuania . 
  no need to make the same mistake twice . 
  my mother was called `` polnische schweine '' in germany . 
  some people are idiots . 
  yep , sorry - guilty as charged . 
  i try to be reasonable , but i find * some * germans sneering and holier-than-thou attitude irritating sometimes . 
  these are germans for you . 
  * edit : ok . 
  i snapped , some germans . 
  please . 
  you ca n't be serious ... 
  do n't bother . 
  people like him must hate women . 
  i 'm not surprised . 
  he 's deflecting much . 
  i mean , the beginning was fine but bringing nord stream 2 , 5 passports and vanishing refugees are not the answers . 
  i 'm out the loop . 
  how did he `` slain '' her ? 
  flower crowns suit them !, 
  just gals being pals . 
  it 's illegal to pay them less than french minimal wage . 
  if that 's really happening your labour inspections should go after them . 
  i find it very hard to believe because : a. it 's lllegal and b. why would anyone work for peanuts in france when you can find work in the uk or germany for more ? 
  or even be employed in france . 
  posted workers pay for a social security in their home country . 
  of course polish government will support that system - it 's good for them and bad for you . 
  i do n't believe it 's about workers anyway , it 's about money . 
  `` as a posted worker , you will continue to be covered by the social security system of your home country for a maximum of 2 years . 
  if you are working abroad for more than 2 years , you will have to switch to the social security system of the country where you work . 
  in some specific cases , you can extend your social security cover to more than 2 years . '', 
  do you genuinely think polish workers in france get polish minimum wage ? 
  the only reason they work abroad is higher wage not unemployment . 
  we call it `` ha i em '' - `` i '' means `` and '' in polish so we 've kinda polonized the name . 
  we just do n't care :p edit : ok , sometimes we just call it `` ha em '' , screw '' & '' , 
   do you mean k\u00e5nken , as in the backpack ? 
  is that well known in poland ? 
  yes , this backpack brand - i was just too lazy to look for '' \u00e5 '' to paste . 
  eh , probably 99,9 % of the polish people have n't heard of it , but i 've seen a bit of these backpacks in my city and my best friend has one . 
   yeah , jean-baptiste was a marshal of france under napoleon . 
  the two had a pretty turbulent relationship . 
  if you look close you 'll find napoleon 's imperial eagle on the coat of arms of sweden . 
  oh , i have no idea about this . 
  i will look it up . 
  stockholm and g\u00f6teborg have some kind of a rivalry between them you can not bring surstr\u00f6mming to the plane cute banter with denmark their current dynasty is of french origin ( napoleon times and so on ) they rock on eurovision both as the producers and artists kanken and h & m swedish deluge was more devastating than ww2 linda hallberg oh , and snus, 
  no , we did n't . 
   there even is a german word for this there always is , 
  oh , shoo with your reasonable arguments . 
  they do n't have refugee status . 
  if someone wants to come to poland and be a part of a our society , either as a refugee or an immigrant , he/she is more than welcome . 
  relocating people who do n't want to be in poland in the first place is a bad idea for us and them . 
  oldest surviving mosque in current poland territory i guess . 
  [ here you can see how tatar mosques in belarus , lithuania and poland looked like . 
   can we have a civil discussion ? 
  what are you trying to achieve by offending polish people on this subreddit ? 
   this is the nursery level of immaturity . 
  nah , this subreddit went downhill . 
  it 's pretty hostile these days . 
  it was built in late 18th or early 19th century . 
  nonono , it 's a male issue . 
  nothing to do with a culture . ^ / s, 
  that 's pretty cool . 
  shhhhhhhh , we want to be relevant okay ? 
  do n't spoil it ... 
  eh , not surprising . 
  why not lie if you could get better benefits from the country you feel no loyalty towards ? 
  eh , not surprising .

   because where they come from they could never go to a school . 
  where was that ?

  are you a real prince though ? 
  and there was another [ family who left poland for damascus in 2016 ] ( http://www.polskieradio.pl/5/3/artykul/1665432,syryjscy-uchodzcy-nie-chca-mieszkac-w-polsce-wracaja-do-damaszku ) . 
  so that leaves me confused - is it dangerous everywhere in syria or not ? 
   very religious , conservative , right wing , 90 % think homosexuality is immoral and abortion is murder ... and that 's just the youth . 
  any source for that claim ? 
  [ because the only country in middle east with similar homosexuality acceptance is israel ... ] ( http://www.pewglobal.org/2013/06/04/the-global-divide-on-homosexuality/ ), 
   also , in terms of societal norms poland is much closer to the middle east than western europe ( and especially netherlands ) . 
  do n't make me laugh ... 
   expat - someone who moves to another country not intending to stay permanently  immigrant - someone who moves to another country intending to stay permanently are you sure ? 
  so polish workers who move to the uk/norway or wherever else for short time just to save some money for a house etc. 
  are called expats ? 
  or even white collar workers who do the same ? 
  i 'm pretty sure i 've never heard that . 
  `` expat '' is a fancy word for western europeans who do n't intend to integrate . 
  it probably will be deleted . 
  it 's low quality source .

  nobody gives a fuck about where you 're parents are coming from . 
  go back to / r/canada,

  shias make up 25 % of muslims ? 
  how 's that possible ? 
  pakistan , bangladesh , indonesia and egypt are all sunni .

  juncker is a head of eu government .

  and to be clear , i do agree with that view , but it 's despicable to manipulate people like this . 
  you might make a more convincing point if you left out godwin 's hammer in the future ... 
  do n't take up the us 's bad habits and scream `` racism '' every time you feel slighted ... 
  the ones living up there are rejects - we did n't want them , either . 
  unsurprising they give swabia a bad name . 
  ( well , them and stuttgarter dialect ... ), 
  they were just joking about how eesti can neither into relevant nor into nordic . 
  probably german , then - it 's a common insult here . 
  i , for one , believe we should institute a worldwide copulate . 
  you 're about 150 years late for that feeling . 
  except for the strategic position and coal , germany has pretty bad tiles . 
  yeah , that 's a different point . 
  imho , we really should see asylum as a temporary aid for people in dire need whom we treat as guests , try to accommodate in their differences and expect little of , as it has been for more than a millennium . 
  in no way does that include an obligation to support someone permanently , and at one point we have to consider the needs of the country . 
  i. e. normal immigration procedures should apply after that need has passed , and thus their status changes if they 're capable of contributing and integrating by their own will , without needing much assistance . 
  anything else just is n't sustainable in the long run and a recipe for disaster . 
  i know it 's not that easy to implement this in the real world , but there are way too many feelings and baseless accusations being thrown around to get clear , rational and profitable procedures established . 
  edit : or to put it short - i would value an us-like immigration system that is primarily profit-oriented while still continuing to accommodate refugees out of compassion . 
  but the two systems would have to be completely separated . 
  edit2 : and regardless of those points , of course , the distinction is relevant for statistical purposes in any case . 
  it 's more like `` grumble '' , signifying complaint instead of aggression . 
   intentionally encouraging or assisting an offence : under section 44 of the act , someone commits this offence if they engage in an activity that encourages or assists the commission of an offence ; and they intend to encourage or assist in its commission . 
   encouraging or assisting an offence believing it will be committed : under section 45 of the act , someone will commit this offence if they engage in an activity that encourages or assists the commission of an offence ; and they believe that the offence will be committed and their act will encourage its commission . 
   encouraging or assisting offences believing one or more will be committed : the components for this offence under section 46 are the same as under section 45 , except that the person encouraging or assisting the commission of the offences has no belief as to which specific offence will be committed ( yet believes that one will be ) . 
  http://www.findlaw.co.uk/law/criminal/crimes_a_z/500491.html they 're right . 
  i do n't think anyone would argue she intends to goad someone on during murder or really believes someone will go out and commit one due to her tweets . 
  sorry if the law hurts your feelings . 
  sort of understandable , looking at your history ... 
   i 've never actually heard anything like that from that side . 
  then search for `` biodiversity '' , for example . 
  it 's simply untrue that things like that are never said , regardless of personal opinion towards that stance . 
  at least in germany , people think about turkey and not africa when asked about non-eu immigration . 
  and i 'm not aware of any problems with africans , either - they 're either asylum seekers or just normal , not known for being anti-german or things like that . 
  asylum seekers are n't immigrants . 
  i have no idea why the two are so commonly conflated . 
  it ca n't be just due to propaganda from both sides of the aisle , and it 's not like the concept is that hard to understand , either . 
  the superego is a powerful thing . 
   no countries near sweden have a refugee problem . 
  depends on your definition - germany does have a refugee problem in the sense that we have no place to put them , for instance . 
  they commonly get makeshift container housing now , but even production of those ca n't keep up with the demand . 
  ... what about a bar chart ? 
  if circle areas are intuitive to you , this seems to be an encounter of the third kind . 
  i ca n't understand how it would be , honestly . 
  look at poland - `` half '' the circle is full , but it 's 1/5 of the number . 
  you see that intuitively ? 
  i mean obviously , anyone who knows basic math will know that it 's a lot less , but without calculating it i could n't say to what degree . 
  and `` calculating it '' is the opposite of intuitive , even if it 's just sqrt 25 . 
  look at germany - is seems as if there is a minor difference between the quota we should take and the one we do take , when in fact it 's 108k vs 173k , i. e. we take 160 % of our share . 
  does that circle look like that ? 
  ( geometrical reason of course being that circle area is pi * r ^ 2 , i. e. it does n't increase linearly like the eye would expect in this case , but quadratically which diminishes the visual effect . 
  it 's a pretty classic move if you want to purposefully misrepresent data , but in this case i believe they were just being idiots . ), 
  next they 'll probably accuse you of being a fake jew trying to earn sympathy points . 
  what a laughable attempt at manipulation ... 
  whoever chose to use circles for this deserves to be slapped with a geometry textbook ... 
  i lived at the swiss border for half my life , and i simply know rural tribal mentality . 
  _ any _ stranger is a suspect , it has nothing to do with race . 
  that 's something city people just do n't seem to understand , so they dismiss rural folk as primitive ( edit : driven to racism by lack of culture ) . 
  but calling something `` racism '' is an extreme thing to do as that word carries _ enormous _ weight . 
  a lot of people seem to abuse that deliberately to elevate themselves , which i despise . 
  rephrased for your convenience . 
  i 'm not a jerk by nature , i 'm a jerk to people who demand that everything be idiotproof . 
  they 're currently working towards destroying the western world , after all . 
  and my username is a grindcore reference . 
  i like jellyfish stew . 
  it 's like they do n't teach reading in school any more ... hint , reading does n't only involve the action itself after the first year , but also interpretation . 
  that someone would assume that `` like , _ literally _ nazis '' could be meant seriously is ludicrous , and putting that idiotic and in 90 % of cases misused / s after it only serves to dumb people down further towards those who ca n't read . 
  and i wo n't fashion my posts to be understandable by that bottom percentile . 
  i was about as serious as if i had referred to a german as a `` nazi '' . 
  tribal mentality does _ not _ equal racism . 
  it may be difficult for city people to understand , but it 's very unfair to the point of deliberate manipulation to apply that _ extreme _ stigma to something that merely appears similar from the outside and at a passing glance . 
  and you know that , too - you just want to feel better than `` those primitive apes '' . 
  that the swiss are , like , _ literally _ nazis . 
  pseudo-superior fucktards , just ignore them ... 
  yes , that is why most swiss children have the habit of marching with rifles and practicing inflammatory speeches in their free time . 
  how so ? 
  i had zero problems when traveling by rail in 2006 . 
  granted , everything seemed to be old , but not rotting or obviously unmaintained . 
  ( then again , i had the same basic experience in india - apart from hanging out of a moving train , which was fun - , so maybe my standards are low . ), 
  ... yes , i did mean that . 
  bavaria brews lots of bock , andechser in particular is famous , as is the yearly starkbierzeit and the nockherberg festival . 
  yeah , northerner , as i said . 
  bock beer is awesome and not trampagne at all . 
   a few 7 + trampagne/pennersaft type beers .

  jesus , i do n't want to appear like i 'm getting into some serious bullshit argument here , but to spell it out because this behavior and the associated purposeful obtuseness _ really _ annoys me in general - you have the self-important `` superiority '' and public appeal of a missionary vegan , coming into a place where one subject is discussed but having to bring up something related but completely unprompted because you would n't otherwise be able to demonstrate your superiority . 
  there were absolutely zero judgmental comments at the time of you posting , so you two brought the issue up yourself in order to weigh your position against it , reaffirming each other how far above the common plebs you are even though the plebs showed no sign of inferiority . 
  is that goddamn clear enough ? 
  they do , there are color schemes even meant to be discernible in black and white .

  not entirely surprising . 
  first , putin is a cunning fellow and easy pr stunts are easy . 
  second , i can easily imagine him not being personally homophobic and simply going along the greater flow of russian conservatism in order to be popular . 
  not that he is a liberal in disguise , but the nature of his subjects is not moderating at all . 
  that 's just a mask made of botox . 
  underneath he is very much decayed . 
  a mummy , of a kind . 
  the wave will subside , though , this was essentially an overflow . 
  proper channels will be restored either way , though i hope it becomes coordinated instead of every european country for itself like now . 
  do n't know about the donations , but taking people only from the refugee camps sounds like it would have been a great idea a year ago or so . 
  sadly , europe was happy to mostly ignore the problem then , and so now we got an explosion . 
  yup . 
  it is getting a little bit better in recent days , but the narrative is still much to often somewhere between `` dirty arabs '' and `` fuck you , got mine '' . 
   mate , they came from the middle east almost 2000 years ago . 
  the only europe we had back then was what the romans had conquered . 
  and we are still roughly christian and non-jewish despite the onslaught of judaism-obsessed migrants !, 
   i guess you 've never been in one of those cities then or know what they looked like 60 years ago . 
  they changed more in that relatively small time period than they ever did in 1000 years before that . 
  i have been to marseille and london . 
  yeah , a lot of funny-looking people , so what ? 
  on the other hand , i live in poland were everything is horribly ethnically and culturally homogenous . 
  you still have ghettos of poverty and `` no-go zones '' which are incompatible with outsiders . 
  i am not certain such a state is inherently `` better '' . 
   the cultural difference between jews and europeans is ridiculously small and they 've been everywhere in europe since the diaspora during the roman empire , so that 's a ridiculous comparison . 
  ridiculously small ? 
  they were from the middle-east , just like arabs . 
  middle-eastern immigrants were eroding our `` europeanness '' for a thousand years and yet we are not jewish by now . 
   just look at marseille , rotterdam , stockholm , london etc. 
  the changes those cities went through because of this immigration is insane , and many would say those cities are n't french/dutch/swedish / english anymore humanity is in constant flux , those `` many '' are mistaken to think things do not change and grossly exaggerate said changes . 
  no one says it is always positive either , but it is a fact of life . 
  trying to preserve some kind of eternal `` purity '' is neither practical nor sensible . 
   you ca n't force japan , ghana or saudi-arabia to embrace this lunacy , they 're way too proud of their own culture . 
  but no one calls those people racists for wanting to preserve that , yet here we are ... saudis and the japanese are n't racists/aren ' t called racists ? 
  before eu ? 
  well , in europe we had a cold war which was kinda unifying the west and ( to lesser extent ) the east , although the east was mostly forced into that . 
  and before that we had two europe-centric world wars and millennia of continental warfare . 
  europe of independent competing states was , historically , a recipe for trouble . 
  i am all for proper processing , in fact . 
   the problem is that maybe even 500 million people want to come . 
  that 's plain stupid , sorry . 
  contrary to what you might think most people do n't want to migrate unless they really have to . 
  even if they live in a desert , it is their desert where they feel at home . 
  no one says they are an improvement . 
  of course refugees are a huge cost and a problem . 
  but it is false to say that we can not help a number of them . 
  and we should , because we have always helped refugees and it is part of what makes us civilized . 
   and it threatens europe because they totally change the cultural and demographic landscape of europe . 
  there were a huge number of jews long time ago , and yet europe was still europe . 
  of course , some people thought they were a threat , so here we are . 
  and what exactly do you hope will replace it ? 
  we kind of tried a europe of proud strong nations , quite a lot in fact . 
  there were always limits and there was always the asylum process . 
  and how do their decisions threaten the whole of europe ? 
  which just reinforces the need for some mothafucking orderly response and not this `` anyone but me '' idiocy . 
  there goes eu , then, 
  what hard choices ? 
  you seem to have some solutions in mind . 
  threats ? 
  no one in eu will force you to do anything . 
  uh , no ? 
  it is simply an attempt to better manage the situation , not a u-turn on the whole issue . 
  dream on . 
  the end of schengen and trust between the countries will be the end of eu alright . 
  this . 
  current situation , where plenty of countries sit on the sidelines , is disgusting . 
  that is why there should be a pan-european solution and not this hot potato bullshit . 
  sadly , it seems most other countries are content to not give a fuck . 
  this has a serious potential to destroy eu , much bigger than the euro crisis . 
  congratulations , europe , nationalism and selfishness threaten our continent yet again . 
  such love !, 
  thankfully , you are not into shooting each other nowadays . 
  a small number of refugees is probably christian . 
  sadly , they are also arabs , so many people do n't like them anyway . 
   that 's what civilized [ 1 ] ( left ) men do . 
  haha , `` our death squads are better than your death squads ! '', 
  yeah , like christians . 
  most of them are not in a hurry , though . 
  you are blatantly misinterpreting the quote you provided . 
  somehow , you have inserted `` directly '' , even though there is nothing about it in the definition . 
  but it does n't mean the refugees are not refugees anymore , just that they do n't follow the rules . 
  in this case the rules turned out to be woefully inadequate , so an explosion happened and here we are . 
   anything beyond that is economic migration , and you all should admit that so we can move on to the next discussion - how open should europe 's immigration policies be ? 
  why would anyone agree with that ? 
  why is your definition of refugee supposed to be the right one again ? 
   the 1951 refugee convention spells out that a refugee is someone who `` owing to a well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race , religion , nationality , membership of a particular social group or political opinion , is outside the country of his nationality , and is unable to , or owing to such fear , is unwilling to avail himself of the protection of that country . '', 
  most important part : that they are outside . 
  not that they are in the first country , 10 meters from the border . 
  they can be on the north pole and they will still be refugees as long a syria remains a warzone while they don ; t have any other citizenship . 
  say , i lose my home , my belongings , my job , my whole social environment . 
  i am sorry that i will want to earn as much as possible as fast as possible to try to mend the huge crater the war left in my life . 
  what you call abuse is existential necessity . 
  nope . 
  no one says anywhere they lose that status . 
  they still lost everything , they do n't magically un-refugee themselves once they put a foot in a reception centre . 
  refugees are refugees because they lost their homes , jobs , belongings in a war . 
  it does n't matter where they end up , they are still refugees . 
  you do n't stop being one just because you got a spot in a tent somewhere . 
  i do n't know about your motivation , but usually when this argument is raised in poland nobody actually cares about the dignity of refugees . 
  it is just yet another bullshit smokescreen for masking unwillingness to take any refugees at all . 
  biologically , there is all kinds of cruel bullshit .

  the fact that you have declared independence with your capital in wilno was irrelevant . 
  a good thing you have not declared your capital to be san francisco , as that would be even more problematic . 
  by doing it you merely claimed vilnius as yours in 1918 - and so did poland . 
  in my other posts i tried to explain to you thoroughly why `` poles live in the city and also in the countryside around it , and we also control it since the germans left '' is a better claim than `` hurr durr it was our capital in medieval times so it 's ours even though we do n't live there anymore '' . 
  that 's the exact same data that is in the official documents , just in higher resolution . 
  so the lithuanian 2001 census is bullshit ? 
  well , that 's good to know . 
  [ well , you need a bit higher resolution to see where that areas are . 
  ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/11/poles_in_lithuania_barry_kent.png ), 
  lithuanians in poland live in three or four villages along the border . 
  poles in lithuania are a major ethnic group in a large continnuous part of your country . 
  interesingly enough , the very part acquired by lithuania not that long ago from poland . 
  ... actually that 's precisely why you do n't wa n't to give them autonomy and just pretend they are lithuanians who were maliciousy convinced that they are poles . 
  i understand lithuanian point of view better than you think i do , and i know it 's not in your interests . 
  timisoara was never a part of romania before 1920 . 
  neither was bratislava part of any czech or slovak state before 1920 . 
  yet they were given to the respective countries based on ethnic lines . 
  and so was wilno . 
   since most of polish residents emigrated back to poland after wwii . 
  they have . 
  and yet they are still majority in this area and are denied autonomy . 
  you have not proved anything either . 
  maybe save for this part about your own skewed version of history . 
  vilna was not a part of lithuania at any point before 1920 . 
  you have claimed it , and so had poland , lit-bel , and possibly some other countries , but that does n't make it automatically your territory which could be `` annexed '' by the evul poland . 
  we have annexed it in 1922 . 
  you have annexed it in 1920 ( and yes , you claimed it since 1918 , but so did we ) . 
  we have controlled it since 1919 ( and fought several battles with bolsheviks over it ) . 
  before it was controlled by ober-ost . 
  no , it 's just a little bit of banter , because i 'm really amused by lithuanians hysterically and hopelessly trying to defend their skewed version of history . 
  also , * you * have started this discussion about historical belonging of wilno/vilna/vilnius . 
  i was talking about the reason of current pro-russian stance of polish minority in lithuania . 
   was part of lithuania ... according to lithuania . 
  the first time lithuania was actually in control of the city was when soviets gave the city to them in late summer of 1920 . 
  before that it was controlled , depending on changing fronts , either by polish administration or various bolshevik states like lit-bel soviet republic and soviet russia . 
  there was no clear ethnic majority in vilna in 1920 . 
  the two main ethnicities in the city were jewish ( speaking yiddish and polish ) - about 40 % , and poles ( speaking polish ) - who , depending on census , were either 30 % ( 1897 russian one ) , or 50 % ( 1916 german one ) of city 's population . 
  both censuses agree that there was about 2 % of lithuanians in the city . 
  the obvious conclusion is that the city should without doubt be awarded to lithuania . 
  i love discussing this issue with your countrymen , you are so deluded . 
   the line was incomplete and did not provide adequate protection to vilnius . 
   the most controversial issue -- the future of the city of vilnius -- was not explicitly addressed . 
   the city was founded in the beginning of the 4th century by emperor constantine , and turkish population started to grow only in 16-17 century , mostly because of turkish language status and lack of greek identity ( and popularity of turkish identity ) , in these times most of ethnic greeks in constantinople started to identify themselves as turks . 
  the logical conclusion is that istanbul should be given to greece right now . 
  it was historically a greek capital , and that 's the single only thing that matters . 
  and \u017beligowski has retaken our rightful lands taken from poland by soviet russia during the polish-soviet war and given by it to lithuania in 1920 . 
  see , i can play this game of `` but you took it first '' too . 
   our rightful lands how could they be your rightful lands [ if at the time the population of that area was vehemently polish \\ ( with a strong jewish minority \\ ) . 
  after 70 years of first ussr , and now lithuania , numerous deportations to siberia and the fact that a lot of them have emigrated to poland !, 
  okey , i get that on the other hand wilno/vilniaus is your historical capital . 
  and you are a small nation . 
  but your claim to it in the interwar period was exactly as justified as would be claim of today 's greece to istanbul . 
  edit : fixed the link with map , it was corrupted, 
   that stance is totally against what polish government and about 90 % of the poles are thinking . 
  very weird . 
  it 's not really that weird if you know something about history of poles living in territories annexed by lithuania in 1939 . 
  [ i think this explains the whole situation well . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polish_national-territorial_region ) basically poles , who were ( and still are ) a majority in the vilnius area ( though not in the city itself anymore ) have proclaimed an autonomous region in 1990 . 
  they had support of local russians and the communist party . 
  soon after lithuania regained independence . 
  they denied poles any kind of autonomy though . 
  that 's why , unlike their compatriots in the homeland , poles living in lithuania are very pro-russian . 
   there are a lot of ethnically russian folks in poland . 
   as a result , there 's a good chunk of polish that are ethnically russian or from other former-ussr nations . 
   its native people got sent to siberia . 
  uhm ... what ? 
  seriously , i think i live in a different poland than the one you are talking about . 
  there are more vietnamese or even * americans * than russians living in poland right now . 
  the thing you have described is true only about the easternmost parts of poland anexed by ussr when it invaded us in 1939 , and which are nowadays parts of lithuania , belarus and ukraine . 
   while the polish government might be very anti-russia , that mentality is n't shared by everyone . 
  i can assure you that the anti-russian stance of polish government is one of the most popular things this government has ever done . 
  that technicality being the fact that no country can be forced to join erm ii . 
  and without being in erm ii for 2 years you are not eligible for joining the eurozone . 
  thus a country can , if it wishes to , indefinitely postpone ez accession by deliberately not meeting one of the requirements . 
  which is what sweden does since the 1999 , and what will be the policy of czech republic and poland for the forseeable future . 
  probably around the time sweden joins . 
  popular support is abysmal so no party would risk such move , not even mentioning it would need a change in our constitution which would require 2/3 of votes . 
  or , if by some miracle world economy is suddenly again like before 2008 , as soon as possible . 
  joining in current situation would be a bad move for our country . 
  euro seems unstable and you ca n't be sure it will last another 10 years . 
  also , z\u0142oty is heavily undervalued now , which boosts our exports . 
  we will lose that advantage when we join eurozone . 
  [ the green island , totally untouched by the crisis . 
  ] ( http://bi.gazeta.pl/im/3/8239/z8239153q,polska-jako-jedyny-kraj-w-unii-europejskiej-nie-za.jpg ) honestly though , exactly like with our hard stance in ukrainian crisis , it 's the `` poland strong '' propaganda for domestic use . 
  i do n't think sikorski really is going to become eu policy chief either , even though he is one of the very few people in the ruling party which i have some respect left for . 
  there are countries in which there are no tescos ? 
  yes , even the name literally means `` congress of the new right '' . 
  they are eurosceptics , but it 's not the primary focus of their election platform . 
  immigration is not really an issue in poland , as we do n't get many immigrants , though they are in favour of strict immigration laws . 
  the more moderate parties in poland are , economically speaking , all the same . 
  the `` far right '' party ( knp ) is the only one which offers some kind of economical libertarianism . 
  thus i have no choice but to vote for them . 
  as economy is the thing that matters the most , social issues are not really a factor in my choice , though still - as i consider myself a moderate conservative in that regard , even their ultraconservative view on social issues is better for me than the decadent view of the leftist parties . 
  well , the significantly more liked military dictator was one of the crucial figures in regaining our statehood after over 100 years of captivity . 
  he has also won the war with soviet fucking russia . 
  the other one was a foreign puppet and did everything he could to ensure that the soviet influence in poland will remain a dominant force for as long as he could . 
  shame that this traitor of the nation and soviet agent has escaped the justice and died of old age unpunished . 
  he should have been executed 25 years ago . 
  it was already tried in 2005 . 
  and did n't work out .

  this is not parliamentar or any kind of democracy . 
  you can interpret it in any way you wanrs , some issues are clearly not supported , some are , some countries want this , others wants that . 
   schulz attended the heilig-geist ( holy spirit ) grammar school , a private roman catholic school run by the holy ghost fathers yeah , about that ... and he attented it for 9 years . 
  i do n't care about farage , he 's nobody and never held any responsible office . 
  we have a saying : * `` better is the enemy of good '' * . 
  not sure if fitting but the real question is if that 's an improvement and i say it 's not . 
   for free are writiers working for free ? 
  are the booksellers , publishers and printers working for free ? 
  that would be slavery or communism , which is no difference really ... but fortunatelly nothing 's for free . 
  why do n't you start listening to the people before it 's too late ? 
  instead of that we have more of utopist wet dreams . 
  because for some reason few obsessed people ca n't work with the union as it is or was so they 'll risk its stability , memberships and even its very existence and for what ? 
  to have more power . 
  btw . 
  schulz could n't even finish a middle school ... such is the eu `` elite '' . 
  i do n't even know and never met a retard that could n't pass `` matura '' . 
  ** edit ** : i see the downvotes and i must say that i do n't hate retarded people , i think that martin can be a valuable member of our community and take responsible jobs , as a coffee kid for example . 
  ukraine and moldova were poor and corripted some time before the pro eu goverments were established , not to mention that the ukrainin president was a minister in the previous govs. . . 
  yes , sweden and norway are considered , the contest will be open and connected with the order for cruise missiles for the submarines ( for about 2bln $ ) . 
  i doubt if germany can provide these . 
  the outcry is pretty big and i do n't know if reactions could be any different as nobody really takes their propaganda and excuses seriously anyway . 
  neither i consider russia suicidal , it can only become dangerous when gets unstable with some political crisis or typical for them palace coup . 
  we 've neglected not just our defences but international relations , prestige and influence , russia was given a free hand and its policies tolarated for too long , same as turkey . 
  eirope is just too soft and ineffective when dealing with some strong neighbours . 
  and why former ssrs ( baltic states ) should not be allowed to have sovereign foreign politics and join whichever alliances or organusation they can and wants to ? 
  if you mean nordstream then nobody calls it a `` provocation '' . 
  i brought the so called `` refugees '' because this kind of unpopular and insane policies angers the people , it 's not about a pack of `` nationalists '' which are in every country but the commomn people which turns against the `` elites '' when they ignore their issues and pretend to be `` empathic '' to the others . 
  sorry , be pragmatic , the economic cost of sanctions is a serious argument , you just have to have better if you wants to convince people , you ca n't ignore reality and insult your opponents forever . 
  i call that `` idiotic '' when nonoe else but a foreign minister openly criticise the exercises of his own military alliance and was not criticising russia and belarus for theirs , especially `` snap '' drills which are closed to the foreign observers . 
  every country can do it and every military can be interpreted as threatening . 
  the problem is that we neglected our defences for years when moscow was modernizing and developing its own . 
  another `` provocative '' headline ... horrors !, 
  they linked a wrong article obviously but i was n't expecting such a reaction in post brexit / r/europe anyway , if not the censorship i 'd rather link sputnik or rt. 
  it 's not just about a `` threat '' , but the promised `` answer '' and that 's why it 's called a `` provocation '' . 
  you mean to `` intervene '' by sanctions for russia and credits for ukraine ? 
  like russia cares about international law ... that would harm their propaganda most of all . 
  i doubt that 's the case . 
  crimea is about military bases , nationalism and all of the propaganda around it is just for the people , separatism in georgia is nothing new ( in opposite to ukraine ) and in both cases it 's used to hold nato . 
  basicly russia accepted the fact of loosing both of these countries and tries to reduce the losses , if they ca n't have these states , then nobody can . 
  the russian bear is getting old and its circus smaller . 
  that 's what kremlin owned sputnik sugessts , you can find it at the bottom of their article . 
  i 'm arguing or actually quoting that `` building up military capabilities '' seems to be a problem for russia . 
   these actions by western colleagues tend to undermine strategic stability in europe and force us to take a retaliatory measures , primarily in the western strategic direction . 
  how can i interpret it in any other way that they consider our `` military capabilities '' as a provocation that has to be answered ( i wonder in which way ) . 
  are you sugessting that britain would defend ukraine ? 
  that whole costume party in crimea and proxy war in donbas is not very convincing , everybody knows who 's behind it anyway . 
  it is , this deal is just a part of `` building up military capabilities '' and that 's what russia criticise in general , of course when these are the other 's capabilities . 
  he also said about `` nato countries '' , which does n't mean the whole alliance , just these coutries . 
  it 's obviously a mistake . 
  and why a nuclear power such as russia has to hide when invading neutral countries ? 
  ... google that title , i do n't want to accuse you of anything but you 're clearly mistaken . 
  no idea which article was you reading , but it was n't * `` germany , poland make ` historically unique ' deal to combine submarine fleets '' * because there 's that quote from shoigu . 
  yes , i 'm not sure if that was you who pointed that out some time ago . 
  it was discussed , supported and opposed as every us action anyway , that was not some war by proxies ( or `` hybrid '' war as it 's called now ) and nobody was pretending that some unknown pilots bought their aircrafts and uniforms at some hardware store ... 
  ... read the article of sputnik , if any article is `` lying '' it 's that one which is also said here that was the source . 
  if you have something better then i 'd really like to see it . 
  used tanks , costing maintnance , being replaced by newer models and if you look at the other contracts it 's not really uncommon . 
  anyway it 's not like poland `` stole '' it or forced germany to sell them at this price and as for subs they will be rather ordered from sweden or norway afaik . 
  i guess that sputnik is censored on this sub as well as many other media ( which is stupid imo ) but the article `` germany , poland make ` historically unique ' deal to combine submarine fleets '' clearly quotes these words of shoigu . 
  of course the russian gov criticise ** every ** nato activity and that includes this agreement . 
  which `` academics '' ? 
  this is the narration created and repeated by kremlin over and over again but the reality is that moscow does n't control eastern europe anymore , these states are free to choose whichever alliance they wants and invasions of neutral neighbours clearly proves that it was necessary . 
  ca n't see relation between kosovo and ukraine , is that some `` revange '' on ukrainians for what americans did 6 years before ? 
  that does n't sound serious ... thet 're actually retreating from georgia and ukraine , desperatelly scorching the land and keeping it as a buffer with instability and border disputes . 
  lets be honest , criticism of kremlin is viewed as `` trechery '' by russians , they takes its side not just because it 's the right side , even when it 's wrong it 's just `` their '' side and we 're the `` enemies '' . 
  there 's also no opposition , no alternative to the ruling party and its politics but there is and quite a lot of choice and criticism of the establishment in the `` west '' , their gov media like rt and sputnik are clearly adressed to the foreign public . 
  i do n't like censorship , we should challange the russians in this information war instead of hiding and escaping . 
  everybody cares and everybody was and is discussing that exactly because that 's usa and not russia which does whatever it wants without consulting anybody . 
  read the [ original source ] ( http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/2364203.stm ) , russia and france opposed the `` language '' and the latter one wanted to propose an alternative resolution but still they voted down the one proposed by usa while china abstained . 
  how is russian invsasion of ukraine , which is the reason for sanctions , related to us `` imperialism '' ? 
  what intervention ? 
  this is an agreement between german and polish submarine fleets to establish a single command , what is wrong about it ? 
  o really ? 
  point out at least a one `` lie '' in my comment . 
  ... in the usual sense that polish taxpayers pay for 100 % of our military hardware , like german leopard 2a5 tanks ( 203 million $ ) and upgrade of 2a4 ( 605 million $ ) . 
   if nato can undermine russias nuclear retaliation capabilities it ca n't . 
   russians will do the same do what ? 
  if you mean they 'll not discuss with us then you 're quite late because they were n't consulting anybody about modernization of their nuclear arsenal , deployment of ballistic missiles at our borders or actually anything . 
  usa and nato almost every of its actions consulted in un , where even russia aprooved invasions of iraq for example , just to complain about it later . 
  yes but the problem is not just the russian public opinion , which does n't really matter for kremlin as it ca n't influence its politics . 
  the problem is that there 's growing support for putin in europe and even usa , many people just listen to this kind of narration and believe that it 's russia which is reacting to nato actions , not the opposite way . 
  not sure about baltics , if so then i condemn it and the same goes for arresting absolutelly unimportant piskorski but we do n't censor or prevent pro russian or clearly kremlin made media and organisations . 
  i do n't care what people say and it 's not `` whataboutism '' because it 's just not a comparable situation . 
  your russophobic comment is a provocation . 
   `` the military-political situation along [ russia 's ] western borders remains unstable . 
  the united states and other nato members continue to build up military capabilities , primarily in countries neighboring russia , '' russian defense minister sergei shoigu so , building up `` military capabilities '' is a provocation , of course only when we do it . 
  typical hypocrite barking of russia , probably even they know how ridiculously that sounds but they have to nail it to the people . 
  edit : this is mostly just a simbolic move but poland wants to buy at least three submarines until 2020 for about 1.5 bln $ and replace that old junk we have at now . 
  can they ? 
  actually , why so many czechs are against eu membership , is there some party or media which wants secession ? 
  i know little about sobotka but the previous czech president klaus seemed much more reasonable and most of all sober , no idea how czechs could elect someone like zeman ... 
  do n't think so . 
  i guess you mean the sanctions imposed on crimea . 
  i do n't think that russian organisations or gov owned media are forbidden in europe . 
   it was unclear what president putin was referring to when he spoke of troops 1500 kilometres from the finnish border . 
  russia maintains military bases significantly closer to the border near st. petersburg , at alakurtti and in murmansk . 
  oh it 's very clear that he 's just lying . 
  besides these bases , there were many [ exercises ] ( http://yle.fi/uutiset/russian_troops_near_finnish_border_placed_on_combat_readiness/7871824 ) right next to the border of finland . 
  if i recall correctly there 's barely 34 % support to leave eu in czech rep , but only 49 % support to stay . 
  it 's still quite a lot , in poland that 's barely 13 % for leaving and 81 % in favour of staying .

you watch too much tvn and tvp . 
  of course there are people like that , however i wouldnt say that they are majority . 
  our minister of interior is so amateur . 
  she get this position , because she is a friend of kopacz . 
  her main experience is being a deputy of polish parlament for 4 cadences . 
  she even doesnt have experience with special forces and as minister of interior you are responsible for that . 
  beside that her main experience is teaching in school . 
  they have start rebranding few months ago . 
  some people who were fully supporting po ( platforma obywatelska ) created nowoczesna.pl in the internet they are called po 2.0 . 
  this political party also has support of polish banking system , because of leszek balcerowicz ( he is famous for the balcerowicz plan ) this way people who wont vote for po , will vote for nowoczesna.pl and if they get to the polish parlament , they will for sure create a coalition . 
  guess why our current pm did n't complain . 
   anti-immigrant minority i would say pro-immigrant group is minority . 
  there are plans , some sources say it will be in 2024 , greenpeace claims 2031 ... we even have special company for this project , which is responsible for preparation ( localisation etc. ), 
  since 2009 . 
  they cost us ~ ~ defrauded ~ ~ already 43,3 mln eur . 
  lot of people say that this company is just a place for friends of politicians to get money , for doing nothing . 
  what happens if they are not granted asylum ? 
  does finland deport them to sweden or to i.e iraq ? 
  i wish poland has nuclear power plant ... 
  sorry for not narrowing down this to only western european countries . 
  no they arent , but in my opinion if we had less tax burdens on our heads , we could have more money to spent and than our yearly gdp growth would be higher . 
  no-go zones in sweden, 
  we see what is happening in ~ ~ european ~ ~ western european countries where muslims population is bigger than 1 % . 
  415 eur is minimal wage ... ( 306 after taxes , than if you subtract vat ( 23 % almost always ) , you are left with ~ 240 ) according to gus ( main statistics office ) the median salary is about 950eur ( about 670 after taxes and ~ 520 after vat ) . 
  they are not `` lazy '' in my eyes . 
  i do n't fully support neoliberal doctrine . 
  how can someone success , if his `` wings '' are undercut by regulations and taxes ( or tax office ) . 
  i would say poland was neoliberal country in the 90s , now it is guided by eu . 
  what ? 
  neoliberal ? 
  haha . 
  http://www.corpwatch.org/article.php?id=376 ** the main points of neo-liberalism include : **  the rule of the market . 
  liberating `` free '' enterprise or private enterprise from any bonds imposed by the government ( the state ) no matter how much social damage this causes . 
  greater openness to international trade and investment , as in nafta . 
  reduce wages by de-unionizing workers and eliminating workers ' rights that had been won over many years of struggle . 
  no more price controls . 
  all in all , total freedom of movement for capital , goods and services . 
  to convince us this is good for us , they say `` an unregulated market is the best way to increase economic growth , which will ultimately benefit everyone . '', 
  it 's like reagan 's `` supply-side '' and `` trickle-down '' economics -- but somehow the wealth did n't trickle down very much . 
  i do n't remember them to follow this point . 
   cutting public expenditure for social services like education and health care . 
  reducing the safety-net for the poor , and even maintenance of roads , bridges , water supply -- again in the name of reducing government 's role . 
  of course , they do n't oppose government subsidies and tax benefits for business . 
  they do n't cut public expenditure either , they increase it . 
   deregulation . 
  reduce government regulation of everything that could diminsh profits , including protecting the environmentand safety on the job . 
  we have much more regulations . 
  oh wait , they are trying to deregulate access to some proffesions . 
   privatization . 
  sell state-owned enterprises , goods and services to private investors . 
  this includes banks , key industries , railroads , toll highways , electricity , schools , hospitals and even fresh water . 
  although usually done in the name of greater efficiency , which is often needed , privatization has mainly had the effect of concentrating wealth even more in a few hands and making the public pay even more for its needs . 
  they follow this point , however the number of bribes is enormous . 
  thats why they are called thieves in poland . 
   eliminating the concept of `` the public good '' or `` community '' and replacing it with `` individual responsibility . '', 
  pressuring the poorest people in a society to find solutions to their lack of health care , education and social security all by themselves -- then blaming them , if they fail , as `` lazy . '', 
  they do n't follow this point . 
  ** sorry man , but the only party which is liberal on the polish political market is korwin . 
   they are liberal conservatives . 
  no , they are not . 
  they pretend to be everytime before election time . 
  the next thing they do , is to increase taxes and reduce civil liberties . 
   this number comes on top of the initial scheme to relocate 40,000 asylum seekers , approved by parliament on 9 september and endorsed by the justice and home affairs council on 14 september the total number of people to be relocated is thus ** 160,000 ** . 
  actually they are already trying to get to poland through belarus . 
  http://kresy24.pl/72947/na-polske-ruszyla-przez-bialorus-lawina-uchodzcow-z-azji-i-kaukazu-horror-w-terespolu-to-czeczenski-dzien-swistaka/ chechens , armenians , georgians , kazakhs , azeris , kirghiz , tajiks - everyday at least 300 of them manages to get asylum seeker status in poland . 
  the problem with syrian refugees might be nothing in comparision with that , what is happening on polish eastern border . 
  `` almost none of them come to poland to work . 
  they know , they will get benefits for every child . 
  than they will go to germany , france , sweden and there the whole procedure will start again . 
  this way they can nomadize in europe for years '' - says the representative of law firm taking care of refugees . 
  ok , so we have pretty much 2 options here . 
  all poorer eu countries , increase social benefits to the same level as in germany/sweden or rich eu countries decrease social benefits to the same point as in poor countries . 
  of course increasing social benefits in poor countries is not possible , because people will stop working there . 
  you didnt read it either . 
  which one from 46 articles poland is not respecting ? 
  because those people dont want be here and will cause troubles for the police and locals . 
  they didnt want end their journey in poland . 
  do you think they will have initiative to learn a language in country where they dont want to stay ? 
  moreover , work here ? 
  they will be burden for our economy . 
  why should they stay and work in poland , if the amount of money they get from social benefits in germany is more than minimal wage here . 
  the thing is , poland wont have problem with people who are willing to stay there . 
  we dont need `` refugees '' whom , the first thought is `` how to escape this camp and get to west '' . 
  thats why i used the phrase `` concentration camp '' . 
  we are using about 800k ukrainians . 
  which article exactly ? 
   ( ... ) and urge them to stay in the country . 
  it sounds like a concentration camp . 
  which refugee convention poland is not respecting ? 
  what do you think about eu and their quotas ? 
  do you have ideas , how europe should solve problem with immigrants ? 
  probably because its about 200km away from the german border . 
  the source quotes rtl ; tagespiegel and europe 1 tv station . 
  poland follows dublin treaty . 
  few days ago there was a news about deporting immigrants . 
  https://etransport.pl/wiadomosc,38151,9_nielegalnych_imigrantow_zatrzymano_w_chyznem.html it 's in polish , but i 'll translate facts for you . 
  9 illegal imigrants were arrested in chyzne . 
  6 iraqis and 3 syrians . 
  during control it turned out , that they are crossing polish - slovakia border illegaly . 
  they did n't have any documents .

  it 's even already figured out : https://www.reddit.com/r/shittyaskscience/comments/4pn0p7/eli5_britain_is_officially_leaving_europe_where/, 
  actualy it 's just about overrustling polish users, 
   anti establishment how can you be anti-establishment if you are part of the establishment ? 
  that sounds more similar to bratislava, 
  the start was shaky though as in the winning elections possition shuffles they missed the deadline on sending the candidature for the aiib board of directions making us a `` lower member '' ( there 's some mistakes in what i said , i do n't remember the details , but the point is we lost a pretty significant inflence opportunity ), 
  [ map ] ( http://www.inpraiseofchina.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/map-china-new-silk-road-eau.jpg ) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/one_belt,_one_road https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lkdxxppfolc https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9thokmfwke, 
  nope / edit : it 's not even that common on the wider internet - it 's a thing that revolves mostly around reddit and a bit of gamming communities, 
  for poland i guess it would be [ polish -- soviet war ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polish%e2%80%93soviet_war ) just after ww1 . 
  it gives lot of context to things like polish participation of partition of czechoslovakia , relations between neighbours in eastern europe , evolution of communism and soviet `` help '' during/after ww2 . 
  from reddit i got the impression it 's a thing that is not even mentioned in not-directly-involved countries, 
  i do n't agree , it 's super brief though - pretty much only a date, 
  in poland we call it `` demokratura '' ( combination of democracy and dictatorship = dictatoriship of the majority ), 
  use google translator for polish names , msot of the times it does a decent job . 
  with english alphabet it would be something around vrocwav ( / vr\u0254t\u032a\u0361s\u032aw\u00e4v / ), 
  https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/search?q=cooking&amp;restrict_sr=on yt channel with some polish ones : https://www.youtube.com/user/aniaskitchen, 
  yep , pretty much the the europeistan meme , nothing new, 
   we can just talk in our native tongues and understand most of what each are saying not exactly . 
  in most cases people instantly switch to english even if they are bad at it . 
  people recognise some words and structres , but if ask them to translate they are unable or get it wrong . 
  you can get to the level where each can speak his own language and be understood , but it require both sides to have expirience with the other language to know what pharases/words to use, 
  there 's quite big community of every nation in canada : ), 
  hungary does n't count as you are bounded by [ the magical rhyme of friendship ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pole_and_hungarian_cousins_be ) , actually it 's a curse : ^ ), 
  ever since russia is a country and before that with russian predecessor states . 
  first one on wiki is from 981 vs kievian ru\u015b ( [ list of wars involving poland ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_wars_involving_poland ) ), 
  iirc georgians also like us, 
  weird english spelling strikes again !, 
  i only give it couse it covers people 's procentage responses pretty well, 
   a west/east divide with no centre better represents the countries ' alignments the thing is it 's not true today . 
  would n't be much of a problem if he had n't introduce `` central '' at all, 
  depends on pairs and how much of another language the speakers know , [ this ] ( https://elms.files.wordpress.com/2008/03/lexicaldistanceielangs.jpg ) show how much who understands whom pretty well, 
   meanwhile our chechen ( muslim ) refugees from the time of chechen wars seem to like it here , even though our country was much poorer at the time they sought asylum in poland . 
  actually that 's not exactly true . 
  many just failed to get to germany . 
  those who stayed even after so many years are not able to get a stable job and sit in criminal grey zone . 
  i do n't know the numbers , but saying that we succeed in integrating chechens is way overexagerated / edit : damn english uses our `` cz '' for czechs , but not for others ... eh, 
  ymd also works in poland , so does writting name in surname name order, 
  ah , i expected a detailed article , quite underwhelming ; (, 
  same here i always remember it as being a cold day and often it was one of the first days with snow, 
  eee why would one replace another ? 
  if anything halloween can be set up against andrzejki, 
  i prefer snow way better, 
  except it has been raining for the whole day in nearly the whole country . 
  worst 01.11 weather ever, 
  not for parties and not what is considered a national alcohol though i wonder how is it possible for spirits to have bigger consumption than beer/wine when both wine and beer is more casual beverage, 
  czechs prefer beer while hungarians and slovakians p\u00e1linka ( i guess ) . 
  only poland is a vodka country from the 4, 
   jan tomasz gross ok also they could n't make a better clickbait title, 
  some churches in my hometown got big banners in front of them saying that `` it 's a sin to celebrate halloween '' and around this time of year it 's nearly a must to hear how evil and anti-christian halloween is during the mass, 
  getting the accent and day-to-day lingo is pain in the ass though, 
  i 'm so saving that, 
  yes , as soon they learn they can not move to germany/sweden ( having really overblown expectations ) they do n't want to come or go back . 
  it 's not all ofc , but group big enough that made refugee supporters switch their possition . 
  same thing for other countries, 
   where is the will to help war torn people ? 
  split between various policies . 
  funnily enough there 's also lack of will to be helped as well, 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/flag_of_europe#number_of_stars  the number of stars on the flag is fixed at 12 , and is not related to the number of member states of the eu ( although the eu did have 12 member states from 1986 to 1994 ) . 
  this is because it originally was the flag of the council of europe . 
  [ 30 ] in 1953 , the council of europe had 15 members ; it was proposed that the future flag should have one star for each member , and would not change based on future members . 
  west germany objected to this as one of the members was the disputed area of saarland , and to have its own star would imply sovereignty for the region . 
  [ 14 ] twelve was eventually adopted as a number with no political connotations and as a symbol of unity . 
  [ 30 ] in his 2006 book boris johnson drew attention to the emperor necklace which depicts twelve caesars , and looks ` uncannily like the euro flag ' . 
  [ 59 ] while 12 is the correct number of stars , sometimes flags or emblems can be found that incorrectly show 15 ( as of the rejected proposal ) or 25 ( as suggested by some after the expansion of the eu to 25 member states in 2004 ) . 
  [ 60 ] [ 61 ] however , the flag also remains that of the council of europe , which now has 47 member states . 
  number of stars is not tied with number of members . 
  also it 's not flag of eu , it 's flag of [ council of europe ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/council_of_europe ) ( which groups all countries in europe , minus temporarily belarus for being a dictatorship ) , eu just adopted it, 
  way overrated imo, 
  \u00f3 = u ( it 's pronounced the same , just orthography ) polish '' \u0142 '' = english `` w '', 
  ugh that looks even worse, 
  from my dad 's company ( ac/ventilation ) expirience supportened by expirience by entroponour from other side of poland ( hydraulics ) from the same sector ( building ) - it 's really hard to get anyone to work with requirements as low as just willing to work and being sober for the entry pay equal or more than entry in some financial corporation where you need master degree + minimum one fluent foreign language . 
  the requirements are nearly non existant and the pay is decent, 
  unless they got polish/lithuanian roots , they go to russia instead, 
   problem is locals do n't want to work for a shitty wage not exactly - in building sector there is just no workforce , it 's not a wage problem, 
  people are often not so keen on hiring ukrainains, 
   interesting , you changed what we are talking about as you realized i was right and when was that ?

  polish education ... same can be said about you  your example is an ethnic group displacing another no displacing happens in the example , just switch in rulling . 
   would you not call the above americanized turks ? 
  ethnically yes - they are turks , nationality wise - most likely not , at this point we can speak of a new nation . 
  to sum up again - yes turkic people lived in the are of byzantine , but there 's no continuation between the byzantine and ottoman/turkey , they are in two separate brackets,

  i can say that few would complain . 
  the current system was a facade anyway , and people could not count on it when it mattered . 
  if pis delivers prosperity and safety to people - it will be a step up form current situation for most . 
  the funny thing is that eu can not officially even attack them about handpicking judges . 
  remember venice commission about poland constitutional court ? 
  vc claimed then that it refuses to acknowledge that some judges are politically inclined ( in this case judges elected by po ) and spew bullshit about how judge loses all its political connections when he is appointed . 
  ( it worked in po favour back then ) now it will bite them back as polish government has venice comission report on his side - claiming that there is no danger in changing supreme court because judges are not politically inclined when being appointed . 
  these are the recent supports cbos - gives government better support ibris - gives opposition better support http://ewybory.eu/sondaze/, 
  you are right in that matter . 
  still we will have the `` joker '' dillema with ships and bombs here . 
  if one government treats opposition fairly - and loses power - will he be treated the same way ? 
  there is no outside arbitrary to see to that . 
  eu is out of the question - as it is a side in this fight ( eu would prefer po to be rulling in poland - and enforce many things people in poland do not want ) . 
  and usa recently turned right - just as poland . 
  there is no neutral arbiter anymore . 
  government never cared for opposition in poland . 
  winners rulled - loosers criticized in hope of gaining support - for the last 28 years . 
  eu chose not to see that because po was in eu majority . 
  pis is treating opposition exactly the same way as it was treated before . 
  notihing changed in poland in this matter . 
  eu is `` concerned '' now because it is their `` pupils '' that are treated poorly now . 
  i would say even that po is treated better than pis was , because pervoios government used `` specials '' to raid opposition newspaper ( wprost ) and often used police aggainst protesting people ( to break the march ) - pis never did that . 
  as for `` democratic '' standards - pis stands above po but is not in eu majority coalition - this is the reason for entire shitstorm . 
  if we count it like that - all decisions made for 8 years by pervious coalition po-psl - are not valid because they also had less than 50 % of total polish population . 
  we need to draw a line somewhere . 
  either the majority in sejm rules - or it doest not - and can not change a shit in the country . 
  if someone calims that pis dont have a mandate to do what it dows - neither had pervios majorities - and all ther decisions should be invalidated . 
  not really . 
  i mean - they would simply leave for the west . 
  we would have three options only : 1 ) give them the same money as they have in the west - which is more than average full time worker in poland gets . 
  only sucidal government would propose that - people would overthrow them 2 ) keep them locked in camps and guarded - not very good for political reasons 3 ) take them , let them leave towards west , let them be deported from there back to poland and observe as tensions between countries , local societies and refugees grow . 
  so taking them is a no-win situation for anyone . 
  europe trembles with my every step !!, 
  those plans from cold war we had about assault aggainst western germany might yet prove useful . 
  we have more tanks than germany has now . 
  we will save netherland from bike-holocaust . 
  poland - in response to the european commission - is requesting discontinuance of eu infringement proceedings in connection with refugee ( pap ) relocation decisions in 2015 - the ministry of interior and administration announced on thursday . 
  on june 14 , the european commission decided to initiate proceedings against poland , the czech republic and hungary for their `` failure to comply '' with their refugee resettlement obligations . 
  these countries had a month to respond to the ec . 
  in july and september 2015 , eu member states agreed to transfer 160 thousand . 
  refugees from italy and greece . 
  the deadline for these actions was set for september 2017 . 
  on thursday the head of the ministry of interior and administration mariusz blaszczak at the conference on poland 's response to the european commission on refugee resettlement argued that security is a national policy , not a community policy . 
  the interior and administration department has informed that poland , in its reply to the ec , is requesting to discontinue proceedings for infringement of eu law in connection with the relocation decisions of 2015 . 
  `` systemic deficiencies in the mechanism of relocation decisions that do not allow for adequate security guarantees '' . 
  `` the ministry of interior and administration in its prepared response to the european commission stated firmly that poland does not reject the eu principle of solidarity and the need to provide humanitarian aid , '' the ministry said . 
  in response to the ec , it was pointed out that both italy and greece did not develop `` effective methods for verifying people to be relocated from a security perspective '' . 
  `` it is also not possible to quickly identify people in need of international protection and to separate them from economic migrants , '' the mswia reported . 
  it has been pointed out that until now , no `` effective mechanisms and procedures for verifying '' refugees have been identified in terms of security or the prompt and rapid identification of persons in need of international protection and `` migrants solely for economic reasons '' . 
  at the conference , b\u0142aszczak emphasized that the key issue addressed in the letter to the european commission was security policy . 
  `` the document argues , in my opinion , very strong arguments for the fact that poland does not have to accept economic migrants from north africa and the middle east , called refugees . '', 
  my argument is based on the principle of security , `` he argued . 
  he added that the document was created under the supervision of a deputy minister responsible for for issues of migration policy jakub skiby . 
  according to blaszczak , the relocation mechanism is ineffective . 
  `` it was imposed on poland with the consent of the po-psl coalition , which is a mechanism that attracts new waves of migration . '', 
  the security of polish citizens is the highest priority of the polish government , `` stressed the minister . 
  the polish side emphasized in its address to the ec that the key to solving migration problems is to work at the source - that is , where migration is born . 
  `` therefore , in our view , action by the european union should be based on cooperation with third countries located along migration routes , building their asylum and migration management and humanitarian assistance to refugees near their countries of origin . 
  the external borders of the eu and the fight against smugglers and traffickers , `` emphasized the speaker . 
  according to poland , the relocation decision was based on an incorrect legal basis . 
  `` the decision , in our opinion , ( ... ) should be taken not by the council of the european union , not by majority , but by the european council on a consensus basis , '' said blaszczak . 
  in response to the ec , the interior ministry also drew attention to ongoing pending relocation decisions . 
  in december 2015 , hungary and slovakia brought an action for annulment of the council decision before the court of justice of the european union . 
  poland joined the proceedings as an intervener . 
  as blaszczak said , procedural and substantive objections were raised in proceedings pending , inter alia , that no unanimity was required in the decision-making procedure . 
  the polish side also provided detailed information on the attempts to carry out the relocation decisions from italy and greece . 
  as reported , poland in 2015 reported willingness to relocate 100 people , indicating their preferences - among others . 
  families , single women , having contacts with poland , communicative knowledge of polish , english , russian , french , other eu languages , vocational qualifications , education confirmed by any documents , affiliation to religious minorities in countries of origin . 
  the interior ministry pointed out that the liaison officer appointed to italy was prevented from conducting direct interviews and verifications against the italian relocation candidates . 
  `` poland is thus deprived of the basic means of assessing the credibility of applicants '' , emphasized in the document . 
  on the other hand , as far as greece is concerned , the liaison officer took part in the hearings of the applicants in greece , but in the verified group there were people who might have been a threat to the security of the republic of poland ( eg false identity or false reporters ) . 
  data on their age or country of origin and persons who were informed that they have ties in terrorist groups ) . 
  accordingly , the polish authorities in april 2016 informed the greek side of the inability to ensure an adequate level of security . 
  the greek side withdrew all proposed proposals '' - added . 
  `` our experience is that it was impossible to separate people who are refugees from people who are immigrants who want to come to europe to improve their living conditions . '', 
  it is also impossible to tell the identity of these people , their real age , their country of origin . 
  these are very important issues in terms of security . 
  i will not take a decision that would threaten the safety of polish and poles , `` emphasized blaszczak . 
  `` this is the argument i presented to the ec , and i am convinced that any reasonable person will share these arguments , and we will see how it will be in the case of the european commission to see how ideological fuss is relevant in confronting facts . '', 
  asked what he expected of the decision , the minister replied : `` i expect a sensible response , i expect that the arguments i have presented will be shared by the european commission . '', 
  count kukiz 15 on pis side . 
  in poland votes are counted towards number of all who validly voted . 
  outside of that you have rules . 
  - parties below 5 % support do not enter sejm - coalition of parties starting together below 8 % do not enter sejm we have about a dozen of those - with few `` balancing '' on 5 % support . 
  the rest is calcualated by d'hondt method i have a link to it but only in polish - mayby you will find something in english https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/metoda_d%e2%80%99hondta enough to say that this method is beneficial to larger parties . 
  lucky distribution of votes gave pis enough support to have over a half of sejm . 
  this has happened for the first time in 28 years . 
  untill now the coalition of parties ruled in poland . 
  never single party . 
  senate is elected in direct elections in single mandate regions - so its composition might be diffrent than sejm . 
  the opposition loves to say that current government has `` only '' 19 % of support ( as the recent elections had slightly more than 50 % frequence ) . 
  hovewer they shut up when you point them out that they have only about 12 % counted with the same method , 
   making the law is a popularity contest , deciding who obeys that law and who does n't is n't . 
  but that is exactly the point !, 
  i dont know how much you know - but whole mess is about judicary system and government clashes about making the law - not obeying it . 
  judicary system does not want any changes and claims that government has no right to pass any changes concerning judicatory system because of judicary independence . 
  government believes otherwise .

  i do n't know man , i 'd rather have muslims hurt over and over again until they grow thicker skin and manage to control themselves like every other group . 
  just to be clear , i 'd propose the same treatment for christians if christian extremists were a problem . 
  the content of your first sentence was so fucking stupid that i decided to ignore it , sorry man . 
  there are things intended to specifically hurt pretty much every group you can imagine . 
  just name a group and i can probably find something that was made with the intent of hurting it , unless the group is extremely irrelevant and low key . 
  what are you trying to argue here , exactly ? 
  that everyone should be expect to throw a childish fit ( or commit a not-so-childish terrorist attack ) when `` offended '' or that muslims are the one a special protected group that can not control its butthurt ? 
  [ finn deathsquad will roll up to my house and behead me any second now ] ( http://i.imgur.com/gm8pwot.jpg ), 
  the muslims you know are idiots then , since the `` do n't draw muhammad '' rule exists specifically to prevent him and other prophets being worshipped too hard by muslims and that 's clearly not the intention of people drawing muhammad fucking goats not that it matters , they have the right to be offended and everybody else has the right to do n't give a shit,

  you 're right with that last thing :  the document also envisages that a parent of a child under 7 years of age or a disabled child under 18 years of age , three and more underage children takes part in the financing of public spending . 
  `` upbringing kids counts as work '' . 
   the ordinance includes an exhaustive list of categories of people exempt from the fee . 
  in particular , these include legally incapable persons , disabled persons , underage persons , women who have reached the age of 55 years and men who have reached the age of 60 years , other categories of people . 
  `` people which might have problems with doing any work are exempted '' . 
  other categories of people exempted from paying or classified as `` employed '' : * full-time students * monks and clergy * registered unemployed people ( they have to participate in a state-sponsored training and accept work offers to keep count as registered ) * registered artists * lawyers and doctors * entrepreneurs * individual farmers * people who arrived into belarus in april last year or later * pensioners receiving their pensions from other countries * and more source : http://president.gov.by/uploads/documents/3decree.pdf,

  long story short , for most of the history , germans had dozens of tiny states . 
  austria , ruled by hapsburgs , was the biggest one , and it gained control , via various means , of bohemia , belgium , southern poland and hungary . 
  meanwhile , prussia , after gaining independence from poland , started uniting other small german states into the german empire . 
  austria-hungary was a bigger state than the newly created germany , so it did n't join . 
  besides , germany was more of a nation state , while austria-hungary was a multinational state . 
  i might have made some egregious simplifications . 
  in poland , it 's enough to get 3 % to get money . 
  which leads to a funny situation , when korwin-mikke is getting money but did n't get to the parliament ( 4.76 % ) , and kukiz is in the parliament , but does n't get any money ( his committee was registered as a voters ' committee , so there 's no party that can receive that money ) . 
   imagine if a party could enter parliament with 1/407 of the vote , it would be total chaos . 
  we had that in 1991 , [ see the results for yourself . 
  the first coalition government was supported by 4 parties , i.e. 
  whopping 27 % of mps . 
  needless to say , the parliament was dissolved and the next elections were in 1993 . 
  so if  95 % of people cast invalid votes , no party would get elected and serbia could enjoy 4 years of peace without any politics ? 
  [ this one would come in handy in 1939 . 
  we have plenty of people that claim that the current polish government is left-wing , and only the true right is a solution for all poland 's problems .

  as it turns out , there are more such cases . 
  according to the estera foundation , which brought the syrians to poland , it 's a result of a trauma , which makes them behave irrationally . 
  **  ( ... )  as it turns out , some of the arrived syrians have already run away to germany , despite bing provided in poland with housing , food , support , school for children , and polish language lessons . 
   `` in total , we have been informed about flights of over a dozen families . 
  their goal is germany , although we talked with them about it multiple times , that in that country the situation is very hard due to excess number of refugees , and it would be better for them to stay in poland , '' explains przemys\u0142aw kawalec from the estera foundation to wirtualna polska . 
  `` sadly , as you can see , in many cases it does n't help , although some families , who ran away to germany , seeing the situation there , decide later to return to poland , '' he adds . 
   in the last few days , there was a famous case of , among others , a a family of five running away from \u015arem , where they were hosted by one of parishes . 
  according to * portal \u015aremski * , the refugees had very good conditions -- a fully-furnished flat in one of the newest blocks for the residential cooperative , and food . 
  the children were provided education in a catholic school and the parents were offered jobs . 
  despite all of that , the family fled to germany without a single word of explanation .

  we are all untied today , more so than ever before . 
  i really expected better from der spiegel, 
  where are the cameron haters now ? 
  leave it to a swede to lecture us about pizza . 
  equality for all !, 
  because its garbage , much better festies such as sonus , sonar , awakenings , unsound , dekmantel, 
  this is / r/europe, 
  and gasoline, 
  the gun violence in the u.s is not an immigrant issue for the most part . 
  its black youth on black youth retaliation killings . 
  you can thank socialism for that . 
  libya is the new home to daesh ... 
  and writing a law is just words on paper , you cant dismiss things so fast . 
  dude shut up , ease of access is always good for commerce . 
  what more can government due to improve ties and increase opportunity, 
  if you marry a us citizen you can get a permenant residence card and then when the time comes apply for citizenship . 
  attacking the real issues i see . 
  so the party is over , everyone is going back home ? 
  you underestimate your adversaries you under estimate the strength of boko haram http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/2015-year-in-review/isis-owns-headlines-nigeria-s-boko-haram-kills-more-ever-n480986 your dismissal of threats is worrying , as your country is beacon of hope for the region . 
  they did n't make it because of the russians , turks , kurds , syrian front and americans . 
  who will you call for help when they come ? 
  boko haram has sworn fealty to daesh and and controls half of africa and is briskly moving north saudis are stirring the pot on the iran issue, 
  daesh , iran , boko haram and saudi arabia . 
  im just playing devils advocate , its funny you should say that your fear is american controlled israel because their is similar sentiment of israel controlling u.s policy . 
  egypt is in way better shape than syria and look how much of clusterfuck syria has been . 
  the only thing stopping the whole thing from imploding is the u.s contributions to the military , are you really so naive to think the islamist government would do nothing after the us cash dries up . 
  i 'm sure when the egyptians say death to israel it 's just empty words . 
  you may win a few battles even the war , but is n't sacrificing peace to feed your ego a little selfish ? 
  nope , i meant what i said . 
  sweet we both win , my country ( i live in the u.s ) is in debt we could use a few billion and a few less headaches . 
  but i wonder how fast egypt would turn on you , followed by the rest of the arabs once the money stops flowing . 
  do you forget about the camp david accords ? 
  maybe the u.s should cut of aid to egypt and israel , that should help with your internal american problem . 
  if i 'm giving you money , i should have say in how you spend it ... 
  obama is dove ? 
  are you forgetting about the arab spring ? 
  the syrian clusterfuck , and the iraqi clusterfuck ? 
  sure he didnt invade iraq but his laissez faire policy helped form isis . 
  or even israel, 
  why would n't that be the case with baltic . 
  im not trying to be difficult , i 'm genuinely curious . 
  relations between are not great , but would turkey be hostile enough to do such a thing ? 
  every power has a plan for every foe or friend , its really a none issue . 
  is n't that the purpose of crimea , a warm water port, 
  whats the difference ? 
  some of the fastest american war planes are from the 60 's, 
  everyone in the u.k sniffs , whats the news again ? 
  trump said something similar we have a border or we do n't, 
  because that does n't fit the liberal narrative . 
  done,

  grounds for concern exist in practically every area where the new government has made its mark . 
  most conspicuous is law and justice 's attempt to pack poland 's constitutional tribunal with its supporters . 
  the tribunal rules on the constitutionality of laws . 
  its credibility rests on political independence . 
  there is some truth , as the tribunal itself acknowledged , in law and justice 's complaint that poland 's previous government -- led by the centre-right civic platform party -- acted improperly by rushing to fill vacancies on the court just before it handed over the reins of government . 
  in a sense , both of poland 's largest parties are guilty of a high-handed approach to the law . 
  yet law and justice 's behaviour has other motives . 
  the party controls poland 's presidency and has an absolute legislative majority . 
  the tribunal is the one branch of government beyond its influence , with the right to block its laws -- as it did when law and justice held power from 2005 to 2007 . 
  party leader jaroslaw kaczynski has not forgotten . 
  elsewhere , the government has removed civic platform appointees that ran the civilian and military intelligence services . 
  the heads of chief executives in large , state-owned companies will roll . 
  the new chief co-ordinator of the secret services is mariusz kaminski , a friend of mr kaczynski . 
  mr kaminski was sentenced to three years in prison for abuse of power when he headed poland 's anti-corruption office . 
  but president andrzej duda , a former law and justice politician , pardoned him so that he could take the intelligence job . 
  stripping one 's political opponents of plum jobs and giving them to friends is a practice not unknown in western democracies . 
  but elzbieta witek , poland 's government spokeswoman , has gone further by calling for donald tusk , the eu president and former civic platform prime minister , to be put on trial for his handling of a 2010 air crash in russia . 
  the disaster killed lech kaczynski , jaroslaw 's twin , then poland 's president . 
  it is axiomatic among law and justice conspiracy theorists that mr tusk was involved in a cover-up . 
  poland 's ruling law and justice party is no ordinary conservative movement , writes tony barber even before the rightwing law and justice party swept to victory in poland 's october 25 parliamentary elections , it was obvious that this was no ordinary conservative movement .

the verb is prove . 
  goede morgen ( if that 's how you spell it ; which ( probably only in some dialects ) sounds like '' / huje morhe / '' , which is similar to hujem w morde in polish ( dick in face ) ), 
  again , he did it for the benefit of the ruling party . 
  law was changed , decisions on a national level were made for the benefit of a certain group of people who want to rule a theoretically independent country . 
  holland will win , it sounds almost like polland, 
  yes , brussels plz send peacekeeping forces !, 
  and russia , bring more army to kaliningrad , asap !, 
  ** please !!!, 
  ok , it might be . 
  but the money is to be printed not out of care for the economy or prosperity , but ** in order to allow the ruling party win the elections ** , and that is , i believe , the biggest scandal . 
  but it 's not done in order to invigorate the economy , but to invigorate the ruling party 's ratings . 
  you 're very likely to get a professional opinion on reddit , a lot of professionals here . 
  you came to the right place , friend . 
   there was never talk about any bribes or anything like that . 
  just two sovereign forces within state structure agreeing on an approach and deciding to change the law . 
  the head of nbp gave certain conditions for his support , all conditions have been met since the meeting . 
  his support is essentially printing more money and giving it to the government so that it can pretend that poland is prosperous . 
  remember greece ? 
  they should be and are in theory . 
  what , you 're having a tape scandal happening right now too ? 
  these recordings were made long before the ukrainian crisis, 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=po3-wu_rdxa&amp;feature=youtu.be here 's a vid of the chief editor of that paper being attacked by the secret service, 
  oh my god , ladies and gentlemen - the king of lemmings . 
  i hope you wo n't hear of another scandal involving this govt . 
  because it will cease to exist in a matter of days . 
  exactly , just different faces . 
  and people who see only two parties are narrowminded to say the least . 
  they reached a compromise - we get the president ( the commies ) you get the prime minister ( the new commies ), 
  i ca n't imagine him staying in power after this . 
  maybe he 'll flee to germany , 
  some of our politicians ( ministers and head of central bank ) were recorded while making different deals . 
  not all tapes have been leaked yet , the one that has includes a conversation of our interior minister with the head of the national bank over how the bank will help the ruling party win the elections by printing money if the party replaces the minister of finance and gives th head of nbp more power . 
  ( edit : the replacing and giving more power things have happend after the tapes had been recorded ) now the government lost their mind and sent a prosecutor , the secret service to the hq of the newspaper that published those tapes and are confiscating their computers . 
  a shitload of police and reporters from other papers/tv stations are on the spot . 
  tuskin probably lost his shit out of fear what might be on those tapes and acted irrationally . 
  this situation shows to what extents he is able to go to remain in power . 
  i do n't believe he will remain in office for much longer and i sincerely hope so . 
  not an outrage ? 
  police + secret security forces accompanied by a prosecutor raiding a newspaper 's headquarters and demanding the reporters ' computers on the orders of a compromised minister is not an outrage ? 
  maybe in belarus or soviet russia , but i 'd like to think i live in a democratic country . 
  exactly . 
  the prosecutor general has started a case in order to establish who was the person making the recordings and bring him to justice . 
  poland is a banana republic . 
  i 'm pretty sure he saw a horse at some point . 
  shit fart ? 
  and if deutschland decided it braucht more lebensraum in the ost , the panzers are equipped with a self-destruct protocol which can be triggered from the bundestag, 
  last communist leader and first president, 
  wawel or pow\u0105zki ? 
  i ca n't , i 'm going to be working at my minimum wage job . 
  so sorry . 
  seems legit, 
  poland . 
  invading europe since 2007 . 
  very good idea, 
  it reminds me of poland taking zaolzie from czechoslovakia in 1938 , when hitler was occupying another part of czechoslovakia , sudetenland . 
  only when we sing, 
  not to mention that they succesfully destroyed the iraqi weapons of ass destruction !, 
  would n't that be cannibalism ? 
  because shit stains on your underwear are so slavic, 
  volvos are awesome , i used to have an s60 t5 , it 's the best car i 've ever driven . 
  took too much gas , though . 
  i think it said 360 types , but i found that difficult to believe . 
  it 's probably 360 different beers . 
  the beer thing is the thing i associate with belgium . 
  i 've read somewhere you have about 360 different types of them . 
  impressive . 
  before that i had thought germany is the beer empire . 
  would you rather they mentioned surstr\u00f6mming ? 
  we do n't do our laundry in a bucket with our tits hanging out, 
  do you actually think that jaceniuk is hitler awakened from hibernation after 70 + years ? 
  i think most nazis , if not all of them , have been long dead since 1945 . 
  but it 's a good idea for a sci-fi movie . 
  is n't it impressive that , considering the circumstances ( war , few polling stations ) over 3/4 of people did go and vote ? 
  bush was right , putin is a true democrat . 
  also , it was a great idea to make a polling station in moscow . 
  at first i thought it was a joke , but apparently it was for real . 
  great idea . 
  btw : possible explanation - the ballot actually said free donuts republic instead of independent donetsk, 
  next time we 'll fart on them, 
  hey , that 's actually [ correct ] ( http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/joseph_goebbels#misattributed ), 
  democracy at its best, 
  does the ballot for greatest patriot go 1 ) lenin , 2 ) stalin , 3 ) putin , 4 ) ... 
  i 'm not very good at russian, 
  ... or as it is in best korea, 
  nice, 
  actually he 's already in mother russia, 
  new type of the russian reversal, 
  wow , i did n't know that . 
  - joseph goebbels, 
  [ here you go ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlmgknvr_pg ), 
  i think vladimir is busy with annexing stuff . 
  besides , hitler got just one olympic games , so it would n't fit into the scheme . 
  kind of reminds me of that monty python bit with mr. hilter, 
  now i wish i could read in russian, 
  it was a translation error , he actually said the ukraine border will soon pull back from russian troops . 
  achievement unlocked, 
  . . which shoot butterflies instead of bullets, 
  sound like a swell guy , would fit into the pro-russia entourage perfectly . 
  it used to be a quite popular solution around here, 
  yeah , but 1 ) it would rather take a long time for the us to deploy any serious amount of forces to europe , they also need infrastructure and stuff 2 ) nukes,

  the guy is a centrist , why all the fuss ? 
  i remember the left circle-jerking all around him like he 's some kind of messiah but he 's just another mix of conservative and liberal ideas , like merkel or tusk . 
  i 'm sure we will hear more views like this , he pandered to the left during his elections and i suspected that he will reveal different stances afterwards , i 'm not suprised . 
  i hope you are not being ignorant on purpose . 
  he meant that many polish soldiers went to join other ally forces after poland lost . 
  there were polish divisions fighting until the end of the war . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/no._303_polish_fighter_squadron here is a quick example . 
  if we stop shoveling in people who make 3 + kids on average , then we can talk about population control . 
  at this moment it looks only like european population control , but not chinese , indian or african population control . 
  edit : the chinese actually seem to try to control the population , a misplaced example . 
  [ yeah ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cke7ymfsrck ), 
  i 'll add that his name means ` happy soldier ' in slavic . 
  op made a mistake , i live on a maria sk\u0142odowska - ** curie ** street . 
  her second name is commonly accepted in poland . 
  the title sounds like the spy tried to mildly annoy the president . 
   what makes you think a `` superordinate '' must necessarily exist ? 
  there is already a universal hierarchy in place , which does n't give a sh * t about us mortals , and thats that 's in the laws of physics : from sub-atomic to galactic levels , there is always something larger or smaller . 
  i do n't think there is an inherent requirement or need for something superordinate to exists , other than the universe itself . 
  i 'm talking about superordinate regarding how you act , i do n't think anyone here questions science or physics . 
  that 's why i brought up laws , philosophies , religions and quasi-religions , they tell people how they should act in order to live a good life . 
  and before you come up with some typical argument like `` people should find it on their own '' , it 's better to have something to guide you . 
  that 's why teachers exist , people often ca n't find things out on their own , they need guidance . 
  you 'd learn extremely less in areas of science if not for teachers . 
  that 's what religion is for people , a life philosophy . 
   this is some irrational statement and really based on personal misconceptions and wrong assumptions . 
  why would i need to have `` something above me '' in order to avoid being a hedonist or a nihilist ? 
  i think one can live a perfectly happy life without being a hedonist , and without needing to have something above . 
  i do n't need a god to give a reason to my life . 
  what was irrational about it ? 
  current generations are over-indulging and becoming less and less self-disciplined . 
  you do n't become what i described from day to day , rome did n't turn into a home of degeneracy within one year , that takes time . 
   there are plenty of atheists who live good , happy and productive lives . 
  do you want to imply that they have no moral systems they are subservient to ? 
  because if you act morally , then you have a system above you , you do n't need a deity for that . 
  you are just kinda proving my point . 
   i mean , i do n't think this is really true for everyone . 
  if it 's not true for somebody then what becomes superordinate ? 
  human ? 
  well that 's dangerous , you either fall into nihilism or start making up rules on your own because you 're in the first place after all . 
  as far as your movie stuff goes ... movies always comfortably create their own strawman argument against atheism ( daddy in the sky ) , while completely ignoring all intellectuall spiritual people who will tell you in the first place that ` daddy in the sky ' is bullshit , at least for catholics . 
  i do n't agree with fundamentalists who take everything in the bible literally , but what angers me even more , are the atheists whose only argument is what those fundamentalists say . 
  if you were to be perfectly rational , with nothing above you , you are destined to become some kind of hedonistic nihilist , and that 's not a happy life . 
  well , i do n't know what you 're responding to exactly , i was n't talking about anything supernatural . 
  they 're always deemed most efficient after all . 
  so it 's just free busing for 50 people that each pis member gets tickets for ? 
  media are really just grasping at straws at this point . 
  this is a thing that political parties have been doing forever . 
  they 're probably going to invite their friends and family , oh the humanity !, 
  not only poland , but most other eu countries too . 
  it seems counter productive to move them to central and eastern europe if they are going to run to germany , france or uk anyways . 
  what we 're supposed to do ? 
  forcefully keep them in camps ? 
  that does n't sound good at all . 
  that was sarcasm , because that joke is older than ` australia is upside down ' joke . 
  people always worship `` something `` it does n't have to be a deity . 
  some philosophers and psychologists wrote about this a lot , that `` something `` always will replace religion if you root it out , because it 's in human nature to put `` something `` above everything . 
  it can be money , a dictator , astrology , a philosophy etc. 
  nietzsche 's `` god is dead '' is not triumphant at all if you read what follows . 
  it 's more like `` god is dead , fuck , what now ? '', 
  and human conscience , we have n't uncovered even 1 % of that shit . 
  that are some fresh memes my friend , where did you get them ? 
  on top of john paul ii and many priests who worked against communism , being religious was a form of rebellion against the regime that endorsed atheism . 
  in poland , the numbers are probably like this only on paper . 
  a chunk of those 87 % are probably ` not practicing ' catholics , and a small chunk are atheists who simply remain catholic on paper because they got baptized by their parents . 
  i 'd say it 's closer to 60-70 % , we 're still a super catholic country though . 
  we really like pork and alcohol , so no muslims . 
  you hear news here about major scammers getting busted almost everyday . 
  i 'm glad there are actual improvements on that . 
  stalin is worse . 
  now replace russians with germans , and stalin with hitler . 
  russians please , i 'm not even going to call them dumb or anything , because i believe that very few people are truly stupid . 
  some russian please explain . 
  tbh i 'm really bad at paying attention to anything . 
  hm , good arguments . 
  favourite neighbour , good places , good people and good beer . 
  lowkey want to move there . 
  here 's how bernie can still win . 
  a witcher necklace , nice . 
  he argues that poland was n't a bitch , despite such huge difference in power , we fought for longer than others , french capitulated after three weeks . 
  then , most polish soldiers escaped to join forces with other european countries , that 's why he 's saying that we were on every front , because we were , you can read up on that . 
  pilecki 's suffering transcendented that twat . 
  what do you think we should do about that ? 
  if you kill your enemies , they win . 
  what 's interesting , a lot of my pis hating friends actually like him . 
  i myself am ambivalent about piss , i do n't like poo as well , but i 'm quite fond of the guy after the fucking sleepy bear . 
  our minister of defense is kinda paranoid about russia , i wish we could just get along . 
  quickly !, 
  find ways to bitch about our president !, 
  i think the main problem is in the big cities . 
  apparently cities like london are becoming less and less english . 
  [ here 's an interesting piece of interview where john cleese says that ` london is no longer english city . 
  ' ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjheodypuei ), 
  a norm is that a woman is paid the same for the same job . 
  that 's in no way a excuse , he just wanted to do something violent , because he was probably told so by his radicalized environment . 
  long time ago , leftists claimed that children of arabic and black immigrants will 100 % integrate and be culturally british , well there you have it . 
  most of those violent twats are children of immigrants . 
  if this guy felt british at all , he would n't be so mad at trump dropping bombs at child killers and religious zealots enslaving women . 
  they do n't feel british or european at all , they are still alligned with their backwards , violent ideology . 
  which is already a norm in most of europe . 
  i honestly have no idea , i 'd love to know .

  i said that 's it 's wrong that a government of a country glorifies genociders of a neighboring nation . 
  that 's all . 
  i never said anything about the people . 
  i feel offended . 
   do n't judge people by their government ? 
  i never did ??? 
  strawman dude, 
   , it would become a superpower overnight only if it wanted to . 
   increase your public spending in social benefits then . 
  `` just stop being poor '', 
  why is everyone itt forgetting that the litas was pegged to the euro since 2002 ???? 
  no shit nothing changed, 
  but east slavs do n't have vowel length . 
  wtf are you taking about . 
  czech and slovak are the only ones with vowel length , and this length is not directly related to the one in proto slavic . 
  you mean free word stress ? 
  every slavic language can be called an outlier . 
  serbo-croatian has pitch accent . 
  czech and slovak have vowel length . 
  polish has nasals . 
  bulgarian has no declension . 
  golden hours lmao, 
  your government does . 
  this is unacceptable, 
  do n't be silly . 
  having policy that welcomes refugees and ignores international agreements and the usual definition of refugee is inviting . 
   she said things like that the german constitution knows no limits for asylum seekers and that she wo n't be ashamed for the fact that germany is being friendly . 
  she 's not stupid . 
  she knew very well what that would sound like to refugees . 
  to them it 's basically an invitation . 
  well you 're not wrong, 
  i have trouble believing that . 
  serbo-croatian has like half the phonemes of ukrainian and has like 3 additional tenses and has many turkish loanwords , while both russian and ukrainian were united little over 1000 years ago, 
  why are people downvoting this ? 
  it 's factually true . 
  is someone from latakia a refugee ? 
  i know it 's not a good thing but i do n't see anything about it that has to do with free speech, 
  as in , shared budget , fiscal policy , common agencies and everything ? 
  infringement on free speech would be if they banned different point of view from being published . 
  if you do n't like tvp you can watch another channel with different bias . 
  that 's what free speech is about . 
  so do you want united european tax policy ? 
  if there was to be a currency union it makes sense for participants to be similar economically . 
  i know it sounds like a joke nowadays , but if someone cared in the 90s this could have happened . 
  or any kind of economic union . 
  because it exists but does n't do anything . 
  kind of like the nordic group . 
  the member countries are very similar culturally and economically but unfortunately everyone thinks pan-european integration is more important than that with the nearest regions . 
   free speech what 's wrong with that in poland ? 
  nothing changed . 
  it was different with tusk . 
  that was about political struggle between pis and him . 
  this is about economic interests that could affect not only poland , but also rest of the region negatively, 
  either way the french have no right to complain . 
  same thing happened to poles , [ during ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/katyn_massacre ) and [ before ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polish_operation_of_the_nkvd ) the war . 
  how are these statistics relavant ? 
  they are n't about the uk but about the respective countries, 
   if it was n't a codified crime at that given point . 
  holocaust was n't illegal under nazi germany law . 
  so we should let it go , right ? 
   have you seen what counts as art nowadays ? 
  you mean all the movies and songs ? 
  they 're great , are n't they ? 
   what i ca n't respect is you being pro russian at the same time . 
   i do n't see that, 
  buda *, 
  i was suspected that but i was hoping that it would n't come down to this . 
  how is that propaganda ? 
  it 's a statement by a polish minister, 
  how does that relate to my question ? 
  the point is , trump 's behaviour does nothing to help him , it only makes him look bad in fact . 
  probably because it 's genuine . 
  so why would he be doing this intentionally ? 
   proto-slavs just branching out of baltic language group or we could say proto-slavs branched out of proto-balto-slavic , like people said here itt . 
  how is that any different ? 
  we 've got migrants from ukraine already tyvm . 
  christians , speak similar language , have similar culture . 
  this way of thinking not only is not solidary but it 's also shortsighted , completely uneconomical and petty . 
  yes , the great patronizing `` we pay you , now shut up and do what i say '' attitude, 
  gravity is a theory . 
  taking care of refugees is not part of eu members responsibilites . 
  this whole thing is a case of power abuse by germany . 
   returning the national prosecutor to the ministry of justice somehow nobody had a problem with this for 15 years, 
  you mean 11 ? 
  why ? 
  nah it 's punching souther scotland for sure . 
  the leave campaign was not representative of the uk society or leave voters . 
  anyone could campaign for either side .

  some of smaller isp have 1gb/1gb options for 29 euros . 
  that 's amazing . 
  nice . 
  do you maybe know if there is some coverage map of various local isp in wroclaw/warszawa/krakow ? 
  could be . 
  here in poland , upc seems to be most popular choice among fastest isp options . 
  it 's 250/20mbit . 
  uploads speeds are quite shitty . 
  and it 's [ usa ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/upc_broadband ) company providing internet service for european countries . 
  but in our case they were quite better then what we had before . 
  there are also smaller local isp in given cities , that offer better uploads but they have often limited coverage . 
  4 min to download 30 gb of data . 
  8 min to upload it . 
  lucky bastards !, 
  do other countries have even 1000mb/500mb offers ? 
  ** edit : ** ~ ~ it looks like digi is providing such option in various countries , including romania and hungary . ~ ~ actually the company offering it is home grown . 
  impressive . 
  you can feed family of 4k tv 's with that . 
  i think in such cases they freeze accounts until investigation is over . 
  and if they are silently still investigating i 'm sure they would love them to continue spending money illegally to collect evidence . 
  in the end , it 's all speculation . 
  what we know now it 's that bank decided to close their account for no specific reason . 
  officially . 
  can they say no to gay couple if it 's against their christian roots ? 
  to be honest , i think they should put some explanation behind it . 
  even if it means they did for political reasons . 
  should then eu banks decide to drop uk clients after brexit and latest spying revelations ? 
  i think if they put just clear explanation that they do n't support current russian global politics , it would make more sense . 
  but i 'm not exactly sure if blocking newspaper is a valid way to go about it . 
  what 's next . 
  russia should close totally for west media ? 
  next korea ?

  bbc put this clickbait title and then change it .

  bromania !, 
  keep it comming guys . 
  people assume that i want to defend them . 
  pis politicians are still at fault of pushing it through initial phase . 
  but they are not ones that made this project . 
  they also do not fully agree with all parts . 
  just want to present more broad view . 
  but i understand that people react emotionally according to their personal view . 
  i already saw here opinion that we have same abortion law as ireland , which is totally untrue . 
  ireland have now what those christian lawers want to push in poland . 
  when pregnancy threatens a life of a mother , abortion is allowed in ireland . 
  that 's the only way there . 
  if there was fatality case maybe mother decided to go for it either way . 
  i can understand such decision when not forced by government . 
  no they do n't . 
  please stop spreading misinformation . 
  ireland has what those christian lawmakers want to push for here in poland . 
  currently in ireland : * abortion is not legal in ireland in cases of rape , incest or foetal anomaly .

  except the exact opposite happened . 
  poland gradually antagonized germany by refusing to take offensive action against the soviet union , and when they started to act agressive it declared that it would not step down even a little and came for ( ultimately worthless , as it turned out ) france and uk instead . 
   something that happened after proves him right  unless he had a sixth sense , it 's not a justification . 
  i do n't really follow you here . 
  soviet union attacking half of continent in preparations of predicted invasion is `` buying time '' , but poland making defensive precautions against the predicted invasion is `` not a justification '' ? 
  that 's absurd , i find it hard to take you seriously with such fallacies coming from you . 
   was referring to war against germany . 
  and i was referring to wars against poland and finland , lawless annexations of latvia , lithuania and estonia , and forced cession of territory by romania . 
   had poland not occupied then obviously what claims would the ussr have over poland ? 
  it would have the exact same ammount of claims it had in otl - zero . 
  that did n't stopped them here though . 
   what is percentages agreement a futile attempt of churchill to lessen soviet grip on europe at least a bit . 
   are you referring to west ukraine ? 
  well , seems that germans were merely securing their control of reichskommisariat ost then , and there was no such thing as german invasion of ussr . 
  post-invasion names count as an argument now , apparently . 
   if hitler was stopped before he could even invade poland , the outcome would have been much different . 
  if hitler was n't backed up by soviets in his invasion of poland , and the french did what they were supposed to do instead of hiding behind their incomplete fortification line the outcome would indeed be different . 
   if germany did n't have a neutrality pact with the ussr they would not only be in war against britain and france , but the ussr would be in a much more powerful position and could put germany into another two front war . 
  how nice of ussr to make things so convenient for their supposed enemy then . 
   quality argument i 'm glad that you are not even trying to deny the truth . 
   britain and france would n't have to bear the brunt of the war effort had the ussr been an ally they did n't have to bear the brunt of the war effort in 1939 either , as over 80 % was concentrated on polish border , but it did n't help them either . 
   because britain and france were n't waging a war , does n't mean that the same would have happened provided the ussr allied with them , you ca n't know for certain . 
  conversely , just because britain and france were n't waging a war until september 17 , does n't mean that the same would have happened provided the ussr would n't join the invasion of poland , you ca n't know for certain . 
   decisions made at the time were not made in accordance of what we know now . 
  and , in accordance with what we knew them , letting the soviet army into poland would be exacly as big a mistake , as it seems with the current knowledge . 
  polish people in the interwar period were not blind and deaf and seen through the soviet bullshit from the very beginning . 
   yeah pilsudski and his anti soviet attitude to international politics was totally justified because the ussr occupied poland a few years later . 
  exactly . 
  he was right , and ussr was a danger of poland just like he thought . 
   he had no idea what the outcome would be . 
  it turns out he had a pretty good idea what would happen if he allowed the red army on polish territory . 
   could have been totally different had the ussr not been isolated from the rest of the world and had other nations not been so hostile . 
  it would definitely be easier for ussr to conduct their communist coups in foreign countries if that was the case . 
  you literally asked whether anyone would mind if everybody wrote in his language first , then english . 
  i just answered this question . 
  censorship of the immigration-related posts . 
   what if everybody had his language first , then english ? 
  personally , i would find translating everything i have already wrote in english back to my native language both time consuming and obnoxious . 
   why may ? 
  germany withdrew from the german-polish non-aggression pact in april while we have already shot down most of possibilities for anti-soviet alliance with germany by spring 1939 , and signed a defensive pact with uk in march 1939 ( which was a direct cause of german withdrawal ) , the 5th may speech of our minister beck in which he upheld our foreign policy of standing up to germany and not foldimg to them no matter what was what have ultimately closed all the other possibilities we still had by then . 
   yes , after they failed to ally with britain and france , no , it was only a convenient excuse for soviet union to finally unleash their imperialist machine they 've been gearing up for two decades . 
  britain and france in 1939 were in no shape to be of any * actual * help , as they have proven by their utter failure to deliver on alliance treaty they had with poland . 
   i never said alliance oh , but * i * said that . 
  germans literally tried to persuade poland to join the anti-comintern pact , and poland declined . 
  in hindsight , that * was * a great mistake on our part indeed , we should have totally agreed to this proposition , survive the war as a german puppet , and then become occupied by ussr like we did in real world anyway . 
  allying france and uk was among the worst courses of actions we could have made , while having two agressive power-hungry superpowers on our borders . 
   and let 's not forget that the western nations also intervened in the civil war too , so who really is the aggressor here ? 
  the western nations were allied with the pre-revolutionary government of russia , of course they sent help to what they seen as the legitimate government of russia fighting a rebelion . 
   poland has been aggressive as well , and pilsudski wanted to divide up the soviet republics and had interests in those former plc territories . 
  pi\u0142sudski had his belarusian and ukrainian allies , who did n't want their countries to become soviet republics . 
   pi\u0142sudski regarded the new chancellor as less dangerous than his immediate predecessors , ... and saw the soviet union as the greater threat soviet union * was * the greater threat . 
  seeing as , ultimately , they were the ones to occupy our country . 
  hitler could have been easily disposed in 1933 , which is what pi\u0142sudski initially proposed , soviet union already was a powerful country with a recent history of attempts to conquer poland by then . 
   especially when you said poland was unable to defend itself , well , it 's certainly not easy to defend yourself when the red army invades the territory you have planned to retreat to from the start . 
   and when poland already had non-aggression pacts in the past . 
   the 1934 polish-german non-aggression pact , soon followed by a trade agreement with germany '' we also had a non-aggression pact with soviet union , signed in 1932 . 
  when you border two dangerous totalitarian dictatorships avoiding conflict with either of them is generally the thing you are trying to do . 
   the point where he opposed french and czechoslovak efforts to include the soviet union in a common front against nazi germany pi\u0142sudski knew that once the red army would enter poland , it would not leave that easily . 
  and , as the aftermatch of ww2 shown , he was proven right , as the exact thing pi\u0142sudski feared would happen happened - 45 years of soviet occupation of poland . 
   the pact would benefit both sides yeah , it eliminated all the neutral states that had misfortune of being located between ussr and germany and allowed a creation of direct border between the two countries . 
  pure defensive genius indeed . 
   ussr does n't go to war except for having to invade six different countries , that is . 
   whereas germany will not go to war on two fronts since the western nations were n't allied with the ussr . 
  germany does n't need a pact for that , as attacking poland already means war with uk and france , and they are not attacking ussr until they deal with them . 
   had britain and france allied with the ussr , hitler would n't be able to expand further without threats from three powerful nations . 
  again , britain and france * were * allied with poland , and they either were n't ready and capable of waging a war yet ( britain ) , or thought their defensive fortifications are sufficient and were n't willing to invade germany themselves ( france ) . 
  lack of alliance with either of those countries was a cheap excuse for ussr , nothing more . 
  it 's not that it would be of * any * help for them . 
   except we 're discussing pre-ww2 here not after ww2 except it turns out that ussr did the exact thing poland feared it will do all this time . 
   do n't think that the western allies actually liked the ussr it was only an alliance out of a mutual enemy but i fully understand the position of western allies , poland during the ww2 was in the exact same position ( or even worse , as we were actually invaded by ussr before we became forced co-beligerents due to common enemy in nazi germany ) . 
   yesterday was stalingrad day yesterday was also the day the nazi-soviet alliance that lasted until 1941 was signed . 
  i 'd say it 's much more important than some `` stalingrad day '' , especialy as neither anniversary was round . 
  this is * not * a map of german-majority areas , but a map of areas where germans were more numerous than 5 % . 
  it 's * very * misleading , especially regarding territories in poland where most of german-colored area actually indicates only a small german minority . 
   do but to respond to aggression with aggression thus becoming no different than nazi germany , especially considering their equally as brutal treatment of occupied territories . 
   especially when a neutrality pact between germany or poland would not be an unlikely possibility since may of 1939 the possibility of such course of action dropped to zero . 
  soviets signed their alliance with germany * three months later * . 
   considering they both had a common hatred for the ussr all neighbours or ussr hated it , considering that it was a totalitarian , powerful , aggressive and dangerous country . 
   not disagreeing with that , i 'm merely pointing out that poland was passive in regards to german expansionism i wonder how on earth you imagine poland being `` active '' in regards to the german expansionism . 
  we had no capabilities to be * active * . 
   would not be unlikely had germany been neutral with poland and decided to go for ukraine or belarus instead , since such territories may have been of interest to poland considering their history . 
  except we have consistently declined all the alliance proposals for germany . 
  that 's exactly why they invaded us - together with their new soviet allies . 
   yes , after lenin 's death they adapted a `` socialism in one country '' policy rather than one of a worldwide revolution and we have totally seen after the ww2 how much they held to this principle , installing socialist puppet regimes all over the europe . 
   they did n't form an alliance , they agreed to create spheres of influence . 
  exactly . 
  they lawlessly divided entirety of europe between their countries into their own `` spheres of influence '' , promised not to interfere with each other 's spheres , and then proceeded to invade and annex the countries in their respective spheres of influence , with . 
  if that 's not a * de-facto * alliance , it 's one of the best examples of co-belligerence in history at least .

  ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a5/armia_czerwona%2cwehrmacht_23.09.1939_wsp%c3%b3lna_parada.jpg )  pilsudski himself said he wanted hitler to stay in power as long as possible pi\u0142sudski also proposed france a joint preventive invasion of germany in 1933 , but was declined . 
   that 's exactly what i meant , as if poland was completely non-interventionist we were n't completely non-interventionist , but we have n't invaded and partially or completely annexed six different sovereign countries in a span of one year after prior agreement with nazi germany either . 
   poles respected german claims to the klaipeda territory in lithuania for example . 
  we had no claims to k\u0142ajpeda territory ourselves , and in turn lithuania had its own claims to the wilno territory in poland . 
   that they did n't despise the ussr of course we despised the ussr , we seen it as the biggest existential threat to our country from the moment it formed . 
  it 's not like soviet russia almost counquered our country in 1920 , or anything . 
  actually , not at all , this particular map is infamous for showing all areas where german speakers were above * 5 % * of population in the exact same `` german '' shade . 
  which leads to gross visual overestimation of area of german , for it 's not like most of central poland had lots of 20km in diameter german communities all over it .

  also , using your logic which again , anchores on voter turnout , as far as i remember no party had majority , ever . 
  so pis is saying that majority ( biggest chunk ) of people who did care during voting simply voted for them . 
  anyway , if opposition received that 45 % ( majority ) , why did n't they made one voting block ?

  we are fucking poland , we dont have a good secret service to do shit like this . 
  but meanwhile relationship with russia and belarus was deteriorating for a while now , now this happens after trump being elected .

  well we have historical differences , but generally ukrainians want to come here to work and have a better future . 
  thats understandable and good for them . 
  it is called `` being a neet '' now, 
  do we ? 
  i have never seen it in real life , i rarely see it on the internet too . 
  yeah , sure just like poles did from the uk, 
  we lost about 2 milion young poles who basically plumb in the uk , netherlands and germany right now . 
  so we are in need of young population and cheap workforce , this void is filled mostly with ukrainians . 
  generally it is hard to estimate their number in here , many sources claim about 1milion , growing to 1,5 during holidays . 
  the rapid growth was especially seen after crimea annexation , we werent used to having immigrants , but they integrate quick since our cultures and lanuages arent too different . 
  right now we have 8 % unemployment rate which is the lowest since early 90s . 
  but what happens now ? 
  i mean ukrainians chose eu and usa over russia . 
  with trump eletected we can expect us to give them a cold shoulder . 
  on eu side , dutch made a referendum which was n't really favourable , too . 
  the current situation , although is very good for my country since we got hundreads of thousands ukrainians as immigrants , does n't bring much optimism to this part of europe . 
  not only . 
  for example poland has an embassy in north korea , not many countries have them . 
  this , if i were to say economically they gained a lot from this attitude . 
  even countries historically unsure about germany like us are right now with union with them . 
  well it is good to be ready years or decades before . 
  better safe than sorry . 
  i am all for basic ideas already implemented by eu, 
  oh okey i have seen a topic about it on other forum . 
   protest demanding a right to protest we need to go deeper, 
  i am ok with that map, 
  good for you guys !, 
  well , right now we do n't have minorities our neighbours want to kill so it is worth taking a risk . 
  of course , but along with polish labour there comes cheap products you have on your shelf . 
   ee live cheaply send the money back to build homes and buy businesses you sound like this is a huge percentage of money they make , can i please have a source on that ? 
   what you dont take into consideration in your `` taxes '' is the extra cost of schools , healthcare , infrastructure and homes . 
  yes of course , along with money invested in your country . 
   due to the one way relationship with the eu where i believe the uk does n't come out favorable . 
  well is it one way ? 
  you gained about 1 milion young people who are europeans ( so cultural differences are n't that big ) who work for your retirement system every day in jobs british citizens would n't do . 
  if you do n't want them they should be sent back here , yet noone - afaik - in british politics even remotely considers this . 
  why is that ? 
   i am quite aggressive to ee in my comments no worries , we kind of experience it from both ways , on the one hand we lost 2 milion citizens to the west , on the other 0,5-1 milion ukrainians live here ( who mostly moved to poland after crimea annexation ) . 
  another thing is that poles pay taxes in your country . 
  a portion of it - yes - comes back as donations . 
  who ? 
  we dont have currently an eurosceptic party in parliment . 
  afaik tusk started to build highways when we were to host euro 2012 , also tusk became pm in 2007 . 
  thanks bro , plumbing has benefited us greatly it seems, 
  current state of higways ( 11.01.2017 ) - https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/81380146/mapka-igorsel.png green - built red - building ( there is a date near it when it will be finished ) purple - building will start in few weeks/months yellow/orange - planned to be built around 2019-2023 ( yellow is more advanced plans ) blue - planned but not before 2022 eu donations are mostly ( ? 
  or at least in great number ) invested in highways . 
  usually for every kilometer a half of it is eu financed . 
  and as always we see how shit communism was , we lost ~ 50 years of development thanks to it . 
  it does and i am far from defending it . 
  but it is either a medical procedure or not , you cant just stop doing surgeries for meme reasons . 
  wut well today we wont treat cancer becauee fuck it, 
  not from wroclaw , but rents are generally low in poland so you just might have a chance, 
  it is important to have the capital protected . 
  invest in western polan , we are desperate to buy electricity . 
  no there is no without additional source of financing it . 
  i am not sure why do you think everyone considers climate problems as the biggest ones . 
  you can be smart on reddit , but i see no real solutions coming from you . 
  allright , you ca n't precisely estimate the number of ukrainians in poland just like you cant do it in england since there is a big grey zone . 
  english stats are also faulty here . 
  there are no more precise stats of ukrainians than what i posted afaik . 
  thanks !, 
  friendly reminder we had even more rapid growth of ukrainians after crimea annexation , now we have about milion of them , growing to ~ 1,5 m in summer . 
  additionally , mind that polish population is smaller than british . 
  it isnt that simple , abortion for example plays a big role in this rank . 
  looks cool, 
  it is really bad in krak\u00f3w too . 
  this movie made by polish youtuber from krak\u00f3w explains it all . 
  [ it is drastic , i dont recommend it for sensible people ] ( https://gfycat.com//selfishoblonghorse ) text there says : `` filter after one day in krak\u00f3w '' . 
  pis ( our govermental party ) is pro eu . 
  donald tusk was our pm when pis was the opposition , hence this dislike . 
  it has nothing to do with eu . 
  he knows a thing or two about stupidity . 
  happy for you guys . 
  keep on wih the good work . 
  recent tax cuts and victories over corruption in romania made a lot of people here upset about our current shape . 
  competition like this among eastern members is very important and thanks for it .

if the biggest and richest economic body in the world is unable to stop a bunch of unarmed migrants what would happen if other country decides to attack us ? 
  i mean , are you nuts ? 
  honestly , i 'm speechless now . 
  no offense , but are you like 12 years old ? 
  how ? 
  i 'd say it 's better than most of the competitors in poland . 
  they 're already finishing them off in many ways , after all , even brits paid for it : http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jul/02/lidl-1bn-public-development-funding-supermarket-world-bank-eastern-europe so in short it 's not about supermarkets at all , but about german supremacy in general . 
  this makes me cringe for three reasons : - first of all , even if poles would be `` the thieves and robbers '' of germany then i have absolutely no idea what we 'd have to steal to make us even , after all germans stole everything from us not so long time ago , - most poles i know are stupid and by stupid i mean they work harder than germans for less , same goes for the uk and other countries , i 'd say most of them are the perfect immigrants economy-wise , - looks like there are more german thieves in poland than polish in germany , german & polish police releases stats for brandenburg and west pomeranian voivodeship annually and looks like in 2013 germans commited 5591 crimes , while poles 1231 in brandenburg alone , but it 's 13 % of the crimes commited there , 62 % were commited by germans and around 15 % by russians . 
  i know maybe it looks like poles are the thieves because every time someone steals a car they run quickly to poland ( and then usually to russia / ukraine , generally as far as possible from the eu ) , but this is not the case . 
  i totally get your point , it 's not much better in poland , the point is , your approach is harmful to your own country and i 've seen this happening in my own country . 
  let me just try to translate old polish `` joke '' ( in fact it 's not funny at all and what 's even worse it 's still relevant after 15 years or so ) :  i wake up in the morning , turn my japanese radio on , then i put on my american pants , vietnamese t-shirt and chinese shoes . 
  after that i take german beer from my dutch fridge . 
   i sit in front of my korean computer , i pay for shopping in british online shop through my american bank . 
   after getting spanish fruits , belgian cheese and greek wine i go back home , sit on my italian couch and i look for a job in a polish newspaper . 
   still nothing , i 'm wondering why the heck there are no jobs in poland ?!, 
  note : there 's almost no polish press anymore , over 90 % of our media belong to germany now ( i 'm looking at you axel springer , verlagsgruppe passau and the rest ) . 
  i 'm not saying i have anything against germans per se ( even though my family members were killed in contraction camps ) but i do think we , polish , really lack some common sense and are most likely corrupted by corporations from bigger , much wealthier countries ( example : http://www.businessinsider.com/afp-german-corporate-giants-suspected-in-greek-corruption-cases-2015-8 - you can also google `` siemens auschwitz '' if you want to get a bigger picture ) . 
  tl ; dr please romania , do n't do what we have done if you still have some economy running . 
  we 've sold everything we could ( even tried to sell national forrests recently , yup ) and i can confirm - roads are n't helping us much now . 
  also , we also make 300 euros a month in many places , do n't believe the propaganda . 
  let just germans finish off tesco and we 'll see if they will be willing to pay that much after that , 
  this way romania will always remain poor and that 's why you 're getting so much cash in the first place ( every eu country contributes and gives it to you so you can buy german or british or french shit ) . 
  take a look at my other post . 
  sad to say , but this is total bullshit , i do n't have much time right now to prove it but i will show you a few examples . 
  as a pole , after over a decade in the eu , i can confirm investing in infrastructure is a lie , it 's hard pill to swallow for some , but the wealth countries have good infrastructure not countries ale wealth because they have good infrastructure . 
  countries like ireland got really rich because they were investing european funds in people and made some very good decisions ( tax cuts and stuff ) while recently developing countries like poland or romania invest almost all the money in the infrastructure , because : a ) we have absolutely no fucking idea what else we can do with the money , b ) the richest countries ( eg . 
  germany ) profit from it as they produce and sell a lot of materials and stuff we have to use in order to build the infrastructure . 
  over 7 million poles earn less than 166 eur/month , 75 % of us earn less than 715 eur/month and what we do about that ? 
  we paint buildings ( it 's almost like a national sport nowadays , notice the three on the left are already done , the one on the right was transformed - by the way i have no idea who chooses the patterns but sometimes the buildings look worse after than before ) : http://imgur.com/a/obuzm we 're also very good with sidewalk renovation ( and sometimes we even put some flowers here and there ) : http://imgur.com/a/wawjj ( the unemployment in this area is close to 35 % and people earn 350 eur/month on average , but shut up and be happy , enjoy your pavement ) . 
  but come on poland , sidewalks ? 
  you can do better . 
  let 's start with airports !, 
  107m eur : the most important , modlin airport right next to our capital city , warsaw , got closed right on the spot for six months : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/warsaw\u2013modlin_mazovia_airport#runway_closure right now only ryanair uses this airpot and they 're planning to move to chopin airport based in warsaw anyway , so they might most likely cut many flights from modlin . 
  50m eur : szymany airport - i will just give you google map link and you can figure it yourself ( yes this is in the middle of fucking nowhere ) : https://www.google.pl/maps/place/szymany/@53.4553719,20.8241225,8z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x471df03e64abf2e9:0xd53b9b09d02c22b0 20m eur : radom airport - my favorite , in the recent years we managed to build 4 major airports around radom , so when they built their own ( because why not ! ), 
  not a single airlines wanted to fly from there , for over a year the customs were walking around the security checks just to `` get the grip of it '' ( after all after year without passengers you might forget how to do your job , right ? 
  ) , amusing especially for the kids that were often present in the airport as school tours from the whole area used to visit the airport just for fun . 
  here you can see a school tour and customs doing fake security checks for them : http://www.echodnia.eu/apps/pbcsi.dll/bilde?newtbl=1&amp;site=ed&amp;date=20140524&amp;category=galeria12&amp;artno=524009999&amp;ref=ph&amp;item=2&amp;maxw=670&amp;maxh=600&amp;border=0 luckily just recently air baltic decided to fly to and from radom airport , the first flight carried 7 passengers on board ... 
  highways : for everyone who thinks `` the infrastructure makes countries rich '' i have bad news . 
  even if that happens to be true - polish highways are not free to use , furthermore they 're most likely the most expensive roads to use in the whole eu if not the world !, 
  here 's a proof : http://www.newsweek.pl/g/i.aspx/720/0/newsweek/635566769353303556.jpg so basically , if you want to go from middle of the country ( \u0141\u00f3d\u017a ) to the german border ( 340 km ) you have to pay ~ 19 eur . 
  that 's more than many poles make a day . 
  and you have to pay every time you use the road , you ca n't get `` subscription '' of any sort . 
  so yeah ... and my personal favorite from ( poor ) city my parents came from - we 're building tram lines for over 105m eur . 
  people do n't really use public communication in that particular city ( most of them have cars , note they 're mosty 15-20 year old cars ) and the city itself is quite small . 
  the public transport in city inhabited by 200k citiznes moves less than 100m ( possibly around 50m ) passengers yearly and it 's decreasing every year , while in warsaw it 's over 1 billion people yearly . 
  so what you can do in a city where people do n't use public communication ? 
  invest in public transportation , for sure !, 
  http://tramwajowo.blog.pl/files/2013/10/trasy-tramwajowe-olsztyn.jpg sorry romania , you got it all wrong and you will see it in just 10 years if not earlier . 
  tl ; dr infrastructure will not help you , after all poor people living in renovated houses , walking on renovated pavements will remain poor . 
  you have to invest in other stuff first , like people ( education ) , specialists , companies , law improvements . 
  paving bricks suck , ask roller skaters . 
  there 's no irony at all , poles are in the uk legally , try to get to any civilized , non-brainwashed by the commies , country illegally and share the experience . 
  plot twist : you will get shot in many cases . 
  that 's how the racists of north america do it : http://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2013/10/31/ef742d75-4782-11e3-a5af-047d7b15b92e/thumbnail/620x350/2f8f3e6dfa195679f763c020eb7019b9/usmexborder_183004973.jpg, 
  there 's plenty of expats in poland , in warsaw especially and they 're doing just fine , especially british and north american folks love the place , lately we 're getting really popular among young italians . 
  we also have second generation of polish-vietnamese ( 20-40k people ) and they 're living happy lives and are generally respected and well-off in many cases . 
  i 'd say poland is a great place to be if you can afford earning less than in western europe , you 're willing to work and you 're here legally . 
  i can even couchsurf you myself . 
  if you 're an illegal immigrant , that 's a whole different story . 
  what country / city do you live in if i might ask ? 
  i 'm polish and in warsaw it 's not that hard to earn 650 euros , while you could get a whole flat for 450 euro a month , and we 're fucked economically anyway compared to western nations .

  here are 10 interpretations who started ( or was most responsible for ) the ww i outbreak , 9 of 10 times it includes germany , 2 times exclusively , not sure why downvoting : http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-26048324, 
  the last thing we should care about now is being tasteful . 
  sorry , but you 're missing the point . 
  it 's really hard to get driver 's license in poland , actually the fail rate of around 70 % makes it literally impossible to get the license here for many people . 
  there are around 3k really tricky questions you have to know the answers for , then over 30 hours of driving after a few weeks of theoretical lessons . 
  it 's actually easier to get to drive a car in almost every country in the world . 
  the problem is our driving culture here sucks , not the driving skills . 
  same goes for italy , have you seen roads in towns in southern italy ? 
  or ever tried to park a car in genua ? 
  i 'd say 1 in 100 german drivers would be able to park their car in genua . 
  in fact , in poland we dislike german drivers for their lack od skills , especially on worse roads with speed limits of 70-90 km . 
  who drives 50 km/h there ? 
  of course germans only . 
  around 4x slower than russians ( damn , these folks are crazy ) . 
  i 've been visiting my relatives in leicester , uk and looks like it 's not all that bad . 
  in leicester you could find a decent place to live for 100-120k gbp , the minimum wage is 5.3 gbp/hr , if you work in any factory you should make around 1k gbp monthly , so for a couple it makes 2k . 
  i 've seen couples working overtime and saving around 1k monthly , after 5 years have muuuney for half of the house . 
  i 've never ever seen people in poland working basic jobs and even thinking about buying a house , while in the uk it is possible or at least was 2 years ago , it seems . 
  for comparison a decent-sized flat in poland would be around 200k pln in towns where you could make 1,4 k pln in a factory tops , usually less . 
  for warsaw it would more lore like 400-450k pln for a decent-sized flat and around 1,8-2k salary . 
  so the flats are 2-4x more expensive here than in the uk , relatively . 
  and unfortunately , shitton of people still buys them ( thanks banks ) so it wo n't change for better anytime soon . 
  i 'm not thinking of buying my own place in near future , with these prices it makes no sense at all , though 100-150k for a semi-detached house in the uk still looks like a bargain to me . 
  of course london is the whole different story . 
  wow , how it 's even possible ? 
  i mean , you 've got your own house you paid for and then government requires you to do `` this or that '' and if you do n't obey they just take the house away from you ? 
  can you give me some examples/links ? 
  where shit like this happens ? 
  sounds crazy ... 
  not really , check out wikipedia , this is actually quite interesting if you consider how the crash site looked like . 
  `` ziad jarrah and saeed al-ghamdi 's passports were recovered from the flight 93 crash site . '', 
  source : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_airlines_flight_93, 
  and how two terrorists passports from united airlines flight 93 were found ? 
  how about other 9/11 passports ? 
  not an expert but these people obviously wanted to be known , recognized and maybe even praised by their folks , i find it funny most of western guys ca n't wrap their heads about the simple fact - `` if you 're going to kill yourself in the name of the idea you fight for you want to be remembered and recognized '' .

  white people ? 
  nationalists ? 
  conservatives ? 
  communists ? 
  thieves ? 
  catholics ? 
  ** is dislike to a large group of people always irrational or it depends on the group ? 
  ** if it depends on the group , then * what * decides if it is irrational or not ? 
  when you * may * dislike some group of people and when you * ca n't * ? 
   aversion to black people is irrational aversion . 
  aversion towards homosexuals is irrational aversion . 
  ok , so if you strongly dislike certain group of people then you are a * thisgroupphobe * . 
  is this `` rule '' limited or maybe general in nature ? 
  stop . 
  * aversion is not phobia . 
  true * irrational aversion is phobia . 
  true ( i would like to have something more than just your opinion to back it up , but nevermind ) . 
  * aversion is irrational [ aversion ] ? 
  false * aversion is phobia ? 
  false your argumentation lacks logical correctness and this is what bothers me . 
  regarding your repeated suggestions that i have some dislike about black people : well , just no . 
  my attitude to black people as a group is neutral and in personal interaction they get a small positive bonus from me just to counterbalance potential bad experiences in our strongly homogenic population . 
  this positive bonus manifest itself in the fact that i am trying to smile to these of them who i meet at streets while i generally do not smile to strangers : , 
   if you have an aversion to black people you 're a racist , aversion towards homosexuals , homophobe . 
    do words and their definition offend you ? 
  let 's use some word definitions . 
  are you trying to say that [ aversion ] ( http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/aversion ) is the same as [ phobia ] ( http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/phobia ) ? 
  in my opinion they both describe negative feeling about something but the phobia is extremely strong and related to fear while aversion is just strong dislike . 
  aversion to apples or to rock music or to conservatives . 
  these are pretty normal feelings ( negative but normal ) . 
  i simply refuse to accept that the fact that you dislike something , even strongly is enough to call you * somethingphobe * . 
  it 's an exaggeration used to make your interlocutor look at least mentally unstable and as such a cheap trick and manipulation . 
   there 's nothing wrong about having an aversion to same-sex relationships . 
    there 's nothing wrong about having an aversion to black people . 
  there 's nothing wrong about having an aversion to apples . 
  because you have a human right to have a [ strong feeling of not liking ] ( http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/aversion ) apples , black people , white people , gypsies . 
  darn , you even have a right to dislike polish people or slavs in general :  you have the same right to dislike same-sex oriented people . 
  you have no right to persecute them . 
  you have no right to beat them . 
  you have no right to take their lives , steal their property , put them in camps . 
  in my opinion , you should also keep your dislike to yourself . 
  but you can dislike all of them and still call yourself tolerant . 
  there is nothing * somethingphobic * in it . 
  this is the difference between tolerance and admiration . 
  party ? 
  sounds good , 
  oh , come on orban !, 
  no need to to be shy !, 
  i think that they got closer recently , during the refugee crisis . 
  previously , orban was evil fascist dictator for entire europe , including other v4 countries . 
  this is why v4 was and unfortunately still is a rather theoretical than actual political force . 
  i hope that the change of government in poland will make orban 's hungary a little less isolated in european union and will drag orban to the side of light , 
  wow . 
  this is actually true , ~ ~ but is there a stereotype saying that ? ~ ~ :d edit : after thinking about it , i must admit that every single use of kurwa in polandball comics i have seen was correct and valid . 
  that 's truly fascinating :-), 
  that 's actually a kogut . 
   time for the far-right terrorist apologists to down-vote this thread i do n't agree with you . 
  in my opinion , people supporting violence about migrants will rather see this submission up-voted ( because they want to promote the image of `` normal people being angry '' ) . 
  these are `` bleeding hearts '' who would rather down-vote it ( because it contradicts their idealized image of german society ) . 
  the violence against migrants is the worst and in the same time most probable scenario . 
  some people see mistakes made by frau merkel as excuse for their violent nature and frau merkel should foresee that . 
  unfortunately she apparently could n't foresee anything . 
   attempt to be `` relevant to the current situation '' . 
  but it may be relevant . 
  it gives a hope for integration and a strong promise : * be loyal to your new country and you will be considered respected and valuable member of its nation and your religion wo n't influence that * . 
  is n't it an approach which would eliminate most of muslim migrant related fears and hesitancy ? 
  people afraid that large groups of muslim migrants will come but they will be disloyal and will push to change the host country much more than themselves ( sharia law anyone ? ) . 
  this is also a problem with some people in western world ( sorry german friends , we polish consider us part of it :p ) . 
  they dislike the * traditional * western culture and heritage so much that they want it replaced or at least diffused with anything . 
  even desert culture disrespecting all their values is better than the traditional culture for them . 
  when people who generally like their world see this bad will approach , they feel endangered and oppose any kind of migration - even migration of people open to integration . 
  is it so hard to understand that people opposing the approach currently enforced by german government are n't against helping people in true need ? 
  there is no problem in helping people who were persecuted , who were starving and dying because putin was defending its influences in syria and no one had balls to do something with it until isis exploded . 
  there is a problem with helping smart-asses aka welfare leeches . 
  there is a problem with allowing in everyone , from north africa , central asia , middle east and albania . 
  there is a problem with accepting that when they ( migrants from other countries than syria ) will come they will never leave because this is the most probable outcome . 
  you wo n't have a place to throw them out . 
  people oppose unlimited number of leeches . 
  unfortunately , under terror of this `` bleeding heart moral superiority '' , if you state that you do n't think that everyone should be allowed in , you are automatically classified as racist and barbarian . 
  that 's the sick part . 
  the air must be pretty bad there . 
  to think that i am mad when i have to wait two light cycles on one junction . 
  smaller cities have its advantages , 
  do n't they have a pretty good metro system ? 
  if you add another line to a road , you often end with more cars there ( they previously were using an alternative road but this one become better ) . 
  there is even some kind of transport theory law stating it . 
   i guess this is the end of eu . 
  its germany 's way or no other way . 
  it 's not like you just discussed directly with frau merkel . 
  still , is n't it funny how fast things escalated ? 
  last week a ruling party was democratically changed in poland to a one less desired by germany and this week we are on a fast track to become the pariah of the eu . 
  this is really grotesque but also a little scary . 
  european partners my ass . 
  you know that the nord stream was built before the migrants crisis ? 
  now , they only want to add more pipes . 
  uk has its holy right to limit immigration to their country . 
  visitor visas are not really important to most of polish , it is an eternal , secondary topic . 
  painful for some and ignored by most . 
  the most important advantage of the alliance with the usa and uk is that they do not actively make lucrative , dangerous deals with the country being the main real danger to ee countries . 
  with all respect to the germany , you are not currently considered a danger in poland .

  forget i said anything . 
  fun fact : you were n't even offensive , you simply said they do n't give a fuck . 
   end of discussion . 
  glad to see you are the voice of teh americun peepool, 
   they 've tried and failed with gun laws , and they 'll fail here too . 
  what ? 
  that gun bullshit is your problem . 
  foreigners will not try to force you to do anything in that matter . 
  ca n't stop us from being totally befuddled by this cultural stupidity , though . 
   we are a very religious country and many of us believe in eye for an eye . 
  that 's not religious , that 's just straight-up primitive . 
  whatever , man, 
  you are creating a false dichotomy . 
  while i agree there is no `` good '' answer , i disagree we have to choose between two extremes . 
  there are many places in poland where outsiders feel incredibly out of place and where crimes and social issues are handled internally by the inhabitants . 
  and , what do you know , these places are inhabited by ethnic poles . 
  you do realize there is actually no such thing as `` no-go zones '' ? 
  greater cooperation is very much possible . 
  oh god no , it would not . 
  let the polish hell remain in poland . 
  they probably would . 
  it is no surprise with that mep at all . 
  i suppose sweden has to crack down on this now . 
  with taxation being so high , it harms your whole system . 
  the mafia they work for can often have links to their own hometown , blackmailing and threatening in all kinds of ways . 
  even more pronounced in sex-trade trafficking . 
  yah , criminal organizations do that , had some poles being enslaved in italy as well . 
  human trafficking is horrible . 
  thankfully , modern awareness about the issue is not that bad . 
  i would think this would dry superfast as a source of jobs . 
  only some businesses would risk hiring illegals . 
  thank you `` non-bleeding heart non-naives '' for framing the debate in terms of being `` pro '' or `` anti '' immigrant , instead of having some more rational discussion about how do we manage this mess . 
  i actually want a stringnet pan-european asylum system that weeds out the undesirables proper-like but it is hard to talk about it when i am confronted by people raving about refugees bringing `` the end of civilization '' . 
  welp , they ca n't skip over the issue of there not being homes for them in the desired places . 
  climate also prevents constructing shanty towns , i would think . 
  do you think , though , that perhaps sweden is not managing them well enough , possibly due to not wanting to be seen as xenophobic ? 
  mind you , i have no clear opinion on this . 
  i suppose it is possible to drag nato into such situations , but the response will always be minor when not dealing with actual war . 
  and even then it is not nato 's function to respond to terrorism . 
  you need at least a foreign-sponsored insurgency for that . 
  i really wish eu and usa had some grand trade pact that would bolster our economies and bind us closer together . 
  but i do n't want it to be a multinational wishlist and i do n't want certain us philosophies to be transplanted into europe . 
  frankly , i think in this situation i would prefer eu to tighten its own internal ties first , before negotiating with usa . 
  there is much more to prosperity than just economic growth . 
  look , few people really like ttip but let us not call it what it is n't . 
  hyperbole is not helping this discussion . 
  well , i think everyone can support obama making a deal with iran . 
  or us authorities going after fifa and corrupt banks . 
  or for usa providing a nuclear umbrella and thus making nato countries un-attackable by most means . 
  i mean , there are so many different things being done by such an entity ... sure , opposing iraq war was sensible ( especially in hindsight ) but that 's only one thing from many . 
  being against such a complex entity as the us makes no sense in general . 
  they do so many different things , it is only ever sensible to be against specific policies . 
  even russia is too complex to just be `` anti '' or `` pro '' . 
  i despise putin and generally consider him a harmful element on the world stage , but even then i am not `` anti-russia '' . 
  we are still so prone to binary thinking , heh . 
  ah , opposition to a widely unpopular policy , one of the best get-into-power cards in the history of politics . 
  kinda sad how cliche schroeder was by combining anti-americanism with being pro-russian . 
  cold war has scarred us horribly . 
  please , do not generalize a bunch of misguided opinions onto everyone . 
  others also massively benefit from the eu . 
  your vision of germany paying money and then being a sole beneficiary of the markets and regulations is just as false . 
  it just blows my mind how he got onto russian retirement plan . 
  i was always seriously confused why germans did not absolutely crucify him . 
  what , you are a black redhead ? 
  cool , cool , i would n't have asked such a personal question but hey , you did say `` ama '' , so there . 
  my intent was to discern to what extent you are polish culturally . 
   i look polish i do n't know what does it even mean , to me poles appear quite plain , with no really discernible features , although i am very obviously biased . 
  run of the mill white folks with all kinds of hair types and colors . 
  i suppose dark blonde hair is dominant , but i do n't know how would it differentiate them from other central-y-northerl-y europeans . 
  a pity much of the discussion was hijacked by being pro or against , pushing everyone to extremes . 
  an early victory for the far-right , i suppose . 
  how polish are you ? 
  to be clear , there are no good answers to this . 
  i both like and dislike various aspects of my particular ethnocultural thingie . 
  i wonder if there is a parody of internet parodying edgy things . 
  i am not even sure if i am joking or not . 
  i suppose it is circular bullshit that eats its own tail . 
  pros and cons of being a renowned corporate launchpad :p, 
  this is getting kinda cyberpunk-y . 
  how is the dutch attitude towards climate change , i wonder, 
  i agree , my displeasure was aimed at being a tool of george w. bush . 
  still suits him . 
  a revitalized nato is a convenient boogeyman . 
  he can also fuck something up so hard that hungarians actually take notice . 
  happens occasionally in politics . 
  i still laugh at it . 
  through tears . 
  well , in poland you get called far-left if you are not in favor of building a huge fucking wall around europe . 
  people should n't say shit like that just for opposing immigration . 
  many anti-immigration arguments are , in fact , racist , but it does not excuse such inflammatory blanket statements . 
  i consider myself left-leaning and i can criticize far-left endlessly , if they say stupid shit . 
  problem is `` left '' `` right '' and `` far '' are interpreted very differently by plenty of people . 
  for some , not being anti-immigrant is `` far left '' and vice versa . 
  if we keep yelling at opposite extremes , we won ; t get anywhere . 
  if it was only about stopping immigration , then calling such people `` fascists '' is unjustified and unhelpful . 
  on the other hand , people who want to stop immigration often say a lot of other things too , some of which might , in fact , be called in strong words . 
  but again , blanket statements are stupid either way . 
  yeah , but they are seen as occasionally troublesome minority . 
  not a threat to everything as we know it . 
  world of a difference .

  well the fucking joke were already there for cameron i wander what did boris fuck . 
  well that description was harsh , but even a lot of remainers have problems with eu going forward so more integration is impossible with the uk in eu like it is today . 
  i think that the best choice will be the 2 phase eu ( lets call them blue and gold for the flag colors and removing the bad connotations with in/out or first/second ) with the escs in the blue one going all federal over each other and the rest including the uk in the gold one going at it slowly and getting into the federal union when they are ready and willing . 
  at least some good news :d, 
   what obligations do you speak of free movement and abiding by eu regulations regarding to trade . 
   but it is this quasi government that no one directly votes or elects that creates policies in realms that it has no right to do that impact nations . 
  your representatives in the eu are your pm and ministers in the council and your meps that are directly elected . 
  the way the president of the commission chosen needs a lot of work but it was the result of direct democratic elections to the eu parliament , as junker was the candidate of the largest party in ep . 
  maybe the time has come to try again this time with a incentive . 
  you have years of success with you to show as an example . 
  maybe with some bribing ( lowered austerity for the south ) you will see better success . 
   ( mostly germans , italians , french ... ) someone annoyed at those pesky germans , french and italians coming to `` take their jobs '' ( or whatever they do ) made my day . 
  i want to see them succeed with their plans every time they try something new , but it is bit more entertaining when they crash . 
  i watched it later . 
  i only watch live launches for spacex because i want to see it land ( crash ) live . 
  for ariane 5 i expect `` alumage vulcain alumage eap decupage '' and a flawless flight . 
  wait so you need to vote nexit in parliament and then ask people in the country `` are you sure about this ? '', 
  they kind of already did http://www.euronews.com/2016/06/24/bank-of-england-and-ecb-take-measures-to-reassure-markets/ which is a sensible thing to do . 
  seams like that carney guy was the only one not asleep at the wheel . 
  of course motherland produce gift by nature , no real true socialist can eat fruits of oppression of south americans ( viva la revolution ) like kakao or kawa so we make better with glorious technology . 
   direct democracy is for the birds . 
  only women get to vote in the next referendum ? 
  well any future integration has to have a mixed system of votes to accommodate population differences . 
  there is a mechanism now for it ( the council - one country ~ ~ one vote ) the us has one with the senate and most of european countries have different kind of electoral system for their upper chamber of parliament precisely because of it . 
  iirc the banana classes in the directive were based on preexisting british law, 
  after the meal, 
  you 'll say they 're immigrants from outside of the eu and send them to turkey . 
  i hope the news in the uk raises awareness of their pay . 
   including the uk uk has always had a opt-out of the refugee quotas . 
  because of the nhs they can go to more then one, 
   concentration aid you mean amphetamines . 
  the history of that place is one dick move after another https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/zaolzie#1918-19, 
  the drastic change in industry in the 90 's and huge investment form the eu that changed if not the structure of power consumption then a lot of it 's technology . 
  gdp to energy jumped from bellow world average to maybe the top 1/5 . 
  1990 - 2011 is just a really bad time frame to compare this ( well anything ) for our region an try to get some general results . 
  gdp and co2 emission are linearly tied since gdp is tied to energy use . 
  with varying scales based on the composition of the economy and energy mix ( france has a very low coefficient thanks to nuclear energy ) . 
  the variables that make up the coefficient unfortunately take a lot of time and effort to change and it 's already quite good in the developed world . 
  in the part were you define which countries you are going to conquer together and then you do it a week later, 
   molotov-ribbentrop pact . 
   these people are adults , living under a free press , they could know what they were voting for , the did , this government represents what a plurality of the polish people wants . 
   i do n't think these voters were stupid , i think they are alien to me and what i associate with good government . 
  because good government is alien to them , not by choice but by never seeing it . 
  i consider the direct contact stable democratic institutions one of the main benefits of joining the eu by poland . 
  and it 's working especially in the larger cities , the attitudes about following rules ( weather it 's rule of law as a whole or just not walking on the grass ) . 
  putting a stop to that now will guarantee that instead of an ally germany , and by extension the eu ( v2 ) gets a disgruntled neighbor . 
  i 'd ok with the eu doing more but i do n't think anything short of economic collapse will change anything . 
   i never said we should kick the poles out of nato , i doubt anyone is talking about doing that pushing out of eu is moving poland into russian sphere of economic influence . 
   if someone is going to be on the russian border , i would rather have it be the polish than some nation closer to mine . 
  sensible , i 'd rather it be the ukrainians but it seams it 's going to be us for quite some time . 
  i remembered it having spires and a dome , i do n't know why . 
  i looked like it should have a dome hidden somewhere . 
  also it 's huuuuge . 
  palaca of culture is quite big ( about 4 apartment blocks ) but yours is something else . 
  hmmmm the polish flag is turned anti clockwise when flown portrait as that retains the heraldic order of colors . 
   non-populated how many people is non-populated ? 
  also / r/combatfootage had this movie and now i know that it is not wp but a special russian mix of thermite , thermite with explosives and thermite with jellied petroleum https://rogueadventurer.com/2012/11/27/update-cluster-munitions-in-syria-zab-2-5-incendiary-submunitions/ so no problem with wp legality . 
  i starter reading the documents till i saw a relocation scheme that mentioned 20000 people across the whole of eu . 
  and i checked the dated 13.05.2015 . 
  this is a bit of old news , though the movie with juncker still has only french subtitles . 
  no kaiser means no konig . 
   these voters are a void if they could n't see through some marketing . 
  you have a mighty high horse . 
  i ca n't really argue that we got the government we deserve . 
  but you simplify the reasons why that happened and why it still has support to poles are idiots and let them fuck of to russia 's sphere of influence where they belong . 
  your not wrong just and asshole . 
  unfortunately your other comments in this thread reek of well grounded realism so i 'm going to sit in a corner and cry about my future authoritarian state . 
  neither pis or fidesz won their elections over refuges . 
  not everything is about the refugees . 
  they were elected on economic populism and social conservatism ( by a small plurality only in both cases , not some overwhelming majority ) . 
  that they elected probably means there is something wrong with the electorate , but that is naivety and 20 years of economic and social transformations that far outpaced civic education . 
  i do n't know about fidesz but pis had a really well put together campaign . 
  it was mostly lies and half truths ( with most of the controversial ideas and people hidden ) but prepared very competently . 
  they mostly copied the american political branding of republicans along with the social manipulation . 
  like fox et . 
  they started tv an radio stations , magazines and internet newspapers that present their distorted vision of reality . 
  hell they almost convinced me that this time they are going to be different , still shit but moderated by reality . 
  as it happens the long time on the sidelines has just made them vicious and they jumped straight for the jugular of everybody that slighted them in the last 10-25 years . 
  and now they are like orban preparing to hold power when they loose the plurality that elected them because the polish budget ca n't handle the the handouts for long . 
  meanwhile since they won all of the democratic institutions and retain still 40 % acceptance thanks to welfare they gave the only thing left to do is wait till the next election ( 3 years ) or wait till they do something that warrants going out to the streets and start throwing stones since they clearly do n't care about peaceful protests of the other 60 % that did n't elect them . 
  it 's all in the targeting , using wp against people to kill them is illegal , using it to burn the whole city ( with or without people in it ) is . 
  you ca n't destroy infrastructure and materiel with poison while wp is double use . 
  and you probably get better results , the rain sometimes stops ( offer not available in the british isles ), 
  poland took a small sliver of contested land that czechoslovakia took by force when poland was fighting bolsheviks . 
  still a shitty thing to do . 
  but poland was advocating for a preventive war since hitler took power but france and england did n't listen . 
  well poland already had 2 nuclear arsenals with soviet weapons and pilots that were trained in using them during the cold war . 
  https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/bro%c5%84_masowego_ra%c5%bcenia_w_polsce unfortunately the corresponding article in english is shit, 
  our defense minister proposed moving the nuclear sharing program form germany to poland in the first week he was in office . 
  it is but autonomous . 
  it left the eu about 1 year after denmark joined . 
  because of fish iirc . 
  actually we do n't share a border anymore . 
  it 's mostly historical ties from the 17 century reinforced by not fighting each other ( out of our will ) from then while we fought all our other neighbors . 
  yeah i saw the ads ( there was a soldier one also ) . 
  that is some us level of scaremongering . 
  suspected as much, 
  hmmm til than it 's sad that it was not an option, 
  i agree that pr is probably the best of the easy to understand systems , but maybe av would be step in the right direction and i do n't see a proposal for pr gaining track in the uk . 
  you had a referendum for av in 2011 but you voted against it .

  this is not about president protecting democracy , this is power struggle . 
  he vetoed two of three controversial acts , and it 's not compromise on his part . 
  two laws he vetoed , would severly limit his authority in judicary , by transferring many of his prerogatives to minister of justice . 
  who 's brigading ? 
  and upvoting or downvoting ? 
  i 'm wondering what agent orange has to say about this . 
   putin is now following emmanuel macron, 
  we 're not playing ball with russia , and anyone attempting to do so will commit political suicide . 
  title says world war 2 . 
  danzig was not a german city . 
  it was a free city . 
  they can pretend constitution doesnt ban that . 
  they control consitutional court , and even if they didnt they would just ignore ruling . 
  activate article 7 now . 
  unless you mention things like first man in space . 
  then they will be first to mention how `` we put a man in space '' and how other republics contributions were `` insignificant '', 
  dont they know we 're on holidays ? 
  until they shoot you . 
  let 's just call him timmy . 
  not all of them . 
  we really should require americans to get visa before coming to europe . 
  nobody makes movies about our heroes :(, 
  plot twist - they will decrease quality in western european products . 
  i do n't know man . 
  they seemed to be backing down until few days ago , then they passed everything and punished dissidents . 
  was he trying to get fake documents and plane ticket to argentina ? 
  this night , i called from my balcony from more protests . 
  can you please make article about me being leader and inspirator of protests ? 
  that sounds like something liberty prime ( or europe prime ) would say before firing his laser . 
   certain politicans are opposed to frenchman 's proposals  / r/europe : fuck that entire region . 
  and fuck everyone that disagrees with us . 
  never change . 
  let 's just say i am not holding out for an answer . 
  i wonder what changed . 
  rule of law ? 
  can you tell me which law they violated ? 
  they can legally change laws , all they do is legal . 
  that 's what pisses me off , people seem to do n't care what is good and wrong anymore . 
  it doesnt matter if deed was good or evil , all that matters is was it legal . 
  legality is killing morality . 
  edit : you 're all missing my point . 
  i am not defendint this reform , quite the opposite . 
  i just said people should consider whenever it is good or bad , rather than whenever this is legal or not . 
  fact that just because i said this is legal you guys think i am defending that reform proves my point . 
  they should just follow example of phillip and conquer grece . 
  eu 's malevolent regulations infected our youth with sin and perversion , to cure our youth we need to introduce additional control measures . 
  see ? 
  i did it in less than one minute . 
  arresting them might be difficult with armed men behind their back . 
  i thought she supports sanctions ? 
  the kebab fear the samurai . 
  discovery of america ? 
  i remember erdogan saying something about muslims discovering america . 
  i 'm not condemning anyone . 
  i 'm just saying this is hardly a nuclear option . 
  mount doom seems like a good place for meeting . 
  i heard eveyone will get souvenir rings !, 
  isnt that what austria was doing ? 
  busing migrants to german border ? 
  one warning . 
  announce that militants will be fired upon , and that they should disperse immediately . 
  if they choose to stay , their problem . 
  not condoning what they did , but reform changes judge election system to similar one to germany . 
  so germans criticizing us for that seem a bit hypocritical . . 
  i just say courts are not working well now , and their independence often translates into abuse and misconduct . 
  i know that from experience . 
  after trial lasteng several years , i filed papers for removing court costs ( which amounted to over 10000z\u0142oty ) court should give me answer within month . 
  after 11 months , they partially agreed , and reduced court costs i was supposed to pay to 1000 z\u0142oty , then on the same page they demanded i pay 10.700 z\u0142oty . 
  i appealed , and after three months they reduced it to 4000 z\u0142oty . 
  and i 've seen more crazy things in courthouse . 
  i really would like for someone to fix this , even if that means giving government control over courts . 
  you speak as if democratic countries did n't do the same . 
  one of main causes of brexit was british politicans blaming eu of shit they did themselves . 
  he would invade it . 
  france , as a major military power was a loose end . 
  uk might remain ally of the reich , provided they would accept no longer being safe at sea because after victory in europe germany would create navy stronger than british one . 
  keep in mind , german naval power was one of main motivations for brits to join first world war . 
  as i pointed out in other post , france most certainly did n't . 
  treaty stipulated more things than declaring war . 
  yeah , sure , he never wanted to retake alsace and lorraine . 
  he was totally fine with that . 
  you didnt , treaty spoke about more than `` declaring war '' but also described `` major offensive within two weeks since beginning of hostilities '' . 
  and do n't pretend that was altruistic . 
  you know well krauts would not leave you alone , they would have come for you sooner or later . 
  so stop acting like you guys did anyone a favor . 
  honestly , maybe it would be better for us to ally with germans and enjoy the show how they turned your country into butt of all military jokes for the next century . 
  medieval soros borrowed money from us , giving us spisz as lien . 
  soros , being greedy hungarian did not return money and so we kept spisz . 
  poland was spared largely thanks to casimir 's order of preemptive quarantine . 
  i would n't say so . 
  on east , serfdom was expanding . 
  on west , we had later jaquerie and other peasant uprisings . 
  they do n't have to be north african . 
  not sure if this is genuine or is this german humor . 
  either way , equally pitiful . 
  smartest way to handle this would be to locate all refugee camps within one km of western border , i agree . 
  still , i fear that they would try to make us keep them in , rather than do something about influx . 
  do you think anyone in the backroom will ever say `` you might have law on your side but look at tweeter '' ?? 
  well , maybe trump would , but noone else will . 
  then why insist on moving them here ?

  i still do n't think poland would n't exist anymore if it was n't for the uk . 
  uh , okay . 
  so what are those guarantees actually good for ? 
  if countries not guarantee things with their military might , what ** do ** they guarantee with ? 
  so you 're saying , ukraine got cheated out of their nuclear potential ? 
  because there would n't be these kind of incursions into their territory if they 'd kept their a-bombs . 
  what message does that send to iran ? 
  what the fuck , actually , what message does that send to me . 
  with this kind of `` guarantees '' i 'm starting to wonder if my country should launch a nuclear program . 
  what am i expecting , that `` the usa or the uk are obligated to intervene militarily in order to safeguard poland '' because they guaranteed it in article 5 ? 
  it 's silly , i guess . 
   they followed through on their guarantees well i do n't have the alliance documents in front of me right now , but i suspect that something more than a * sitzkrieg * was expected . 
  the ultimate letter of concern , the declaration of war . 
  i mean , french troops were already ** at the german border ** but they prefered to sit on it . 
  also , this still does n't explain why if [ the uk ] `` not stepped in poland would n't even exist any more '' . 
   and the nazi plan for poland was ? 
  that 's where my argument stems from . 
  soviet rule was better than nazi rule would have been , hence a net gain i mentioned . 
  i do n't follow . 
  what 's the role of the uk in this ? 
  the nazis attacked , then the soviets attacked , then the soviets defeated the nazis in the east , conquering poland . 
  still ca n't see what 's the role of uk in this and especially how they ensured that `` poland would exist anymore '' . 
   without britains declaration of war hitler would have had free roam to do the things he did and wanted to do he did it anyway . 
  only the soviet offensive in the east and us opening two front in the west was enough to stop him . 
  yeah , ok , i can pretty much agree with this post of yours . 
  yeah , the americans wore ussr down and yeah , winston churchill was probably pure at heart . 
  still , the sentence  `` if we 'd not stepped in poland would n't even exist any more '' is false . 
  you stepped in and let poland perish , then did n't care what the soviet installed does to us until :  we 've overthrown [ it ] on our own . 
  no foreign intervention , we did it , and we did it peacefully . 
  fine , the conditions were right for us , but still no british participation whatsoever . 
  so i guess your remark about us `` not existing if it were n't for you '' is to be withdrawn ? 
  oh , you give yourself too much credit , brit . 
  your version of poland was actually destroyed , not being recognized even by the uk 's government in the end . 
  the occupied poland had a communist government , installed by the soviets . 
  which , by the way , we 've overthrown on our own , paving a way for freedom in eastern europe . 
  i 'd say - with or without you things would turn out the same in poland . 
  you did n't help jack shit and poland , as a whole , is actually [ still butthurt for it ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/western_betrayal ), 
  the us , along with russia and the uk guaranteed territorial integrity of ukraine in return for ukrainian nuclear disarmament in 1994 . 
  as of now , it looks like that they are not going to act with accordance to that guarantees . 
  '' ... expresses it 's grave concern about regrettable incursion of unmarked military with russian equipment into eastern poland . 
  it also inquires all of the involved actors why did n't they invest instead . 
  there will be a letter sent , fo sho . '', 
  i thought i 'm on / r/paradoxplaza for a while, 
  no krs entry ( the company register ) for `` exotic meat poland '' , too . 
   boom , support growing . 
  top lel remember , you ca n't really draw any conclusions if the results lie within a statistical error, 
  dude , i 'm not going to argue with you . 
  you asked for a taboos , here they are , regardless if true or not . 
  this is the message he conveys through media , good luck winning the election with that . 
  i do n't think you understand what it takes to win an election . 
  `` being right '' is not one of these things . 
  also , you 're wrong and have a nice adolescence !, 
  yeah , i 'm not `` pan janusz '' follower either , but here 's a socially allocated advice for him : - `` it was better during hitler 's reign '' is not going to win any votes . 
  - `` let 's segregate disabled children [ so they have no contact with the healthy ] '' is n't going to be considered best educational policy - `` women are inherently less intelligent than men [ but that 's ok , because we love them ] '' will most likely alienate , like , 50 % of potential voters, 
  it was also speculated to be largely ineffective and/or unable to act . 
  supposedly , their equipment is in really bad shape and their morale is down . 
  according to western newspapers from few years back , it 's a paper tiger . 
  i do n't know for a fact how true this is . 
  after all , they did manage to overwhelm georgia . 
  on the other hand , that operation was n't of ukraine 's scale . 
  haha , yeah . 
  i guess it 's because our public transport might be considered expensive by people who live over our eastern border . 
  this probably is thought to ease their travel around poland . 
  what , the russians sacked him ? 
  well , i do n't know about us , but i really , really struggle not to see kremlin as evil band of thugs . 
  seriously , how are they not evil ? 
  i never said it 's not . 
  but i 'm just guessing . 
  i hope his actions end up helping you guys out of that crisis . 
  pretty much , yeah . 
  well , not to piss on your parade , but when it comes to politicking this guy could run circles around all the people involved in current crisis . 
  he 's connected to many uk and us officials , he attended the same elitist schools as them , he actually fought against soviets in afghanistan . 
  i 'd bet he knows his game . 
  that he is a giant , raging buffoon is a dfferent matter . 
  i guess he 's trying to intimidate the opposition leaders to sign the deal he fathered so he can reap some sweet politicians karma . 
  but that 's only my guess . 
  you say it woul `` anger the world '' . 
  but what will the angry world do ? 
  who 's going to take action ? 
  yeah , did n't think so . 
  i prefer hottentottenstottertrottelmutterbeutelrattenlattengitterkofferattent\u00e4ter source : julian tuwim making fun of german language , the anecdote here : http://linguacuriosa.blogspot.com/2009/10/german-for-beginners.html, 
  this one is strange . 
  i have definetely got a lot of friends whose family members work abroad and send money - a lot of them are completely dependent on that income for years . 
  yet , every official statistic tells me that this inbound cash is insignificant in the grand scheme of things , and does n't contribute meaningfully to the economy . 
  it 's weird to me , as it contraticts directly what i see -- but i 'm probably biased ( or gray area , maybe ? ), 
   soviet union cash flow i 'd really need to see the sources of that cash flow . 
  from what i know , poland exported at a loss to soviet union because of politics . 
  maybe this `` cash flow '' was meant for soviet union members , like ukraine , baltic states ? 
  poland was independent and i really do n't know about any significant aid from ussr sent this way ( except fortheir `` brotherly military advisory '' ) . 
  that 's just biased . 
  he was pretty original in pointing your bravery that way !, 
  there 's next to none of them here . 
  they just subscribe to this `` islamisation of europe , whole london is brown now and every car in paris is burned by muslim youth '' rhetotric .

  vocals are in real highlander dialect . 
  it 's a party dynamite . 
  there 's also prince ( king ? 
  ca n't remember ... ) brzetys\u0142aw invasion in 1000s or something around that . 
  apparently , they stole some kind of ... spear ? 
  also , disputes over silesia .

  bla bla bla , it is all about humanity , bla bla bla , not german retirement system , bla bla bla , our factories dont need cheap workforce anymore . 
  wow , we should be even more tolerant to muslim culture . 
  thank you based luca , may the force be with you . 
  we warned you that those syrians imposed by eu will affect this country and muslims ( or people from countries with islam as dominant religion ) living in it . 
  we have a saying that the people who hate poles the most are other poles . 
  this is pretty accurate in peacetime . 
  we are country that was occupied like milion times by everyone . 
  so we have a tradition which leads us to consolidate in times of crisis . 
  ( like with almost no resources we created one of the biggest [ underground movement ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/home_army ) during wwii . ), 
  so in times of problems we switch to hate inviders . 
  if those syrians ( and other muslims ) will be seen as foreign culture taking over ours , no laws will apply . 
  i am afraid they kind of are , since this is proven that among them there are isis members and we do n't feel like being terrorised . 
  we live in a [ safe ] ( http://www.oecdbetterlifeindex.org/topics/safety/ ) country and we dont want it to change . 
  this has nothing to do with turkey , those syrians imposed by eu radicalise this country pretty quick . 
  sorry for what happened . 
  seriously what do those people learn in there ? 
  you 're goddamn right , jesse . 
  kick us out if you dont like poles in your country . 
  it is your country to decide about and all immigrants are just guests in there . 
  we will gladly accept those poles back , they are our people and responsibility . 
   democracy , or democratic government , is `` a system of government in which all the people of a state or polity ... are involved in making decisions about its affairs , typically by voting to elect representatives to a parliament or similar assembly , '' as defined by the oxford english dictionary you are not involved in political decissions since your participation in elections is irrelevant . 
  this is what you get when you have magic powers and yet you have n't recieved howgard 's letter . 
  eu foreign policy ? 
  let 's see who is a [ head ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/high_representative_of_the_union_for_foreign_affairs_and_security_policy ) of it . 
  okey , let 's see something about her ? 
   a member of the italian communist youth federation from 1988  in 1996 mogherini joined the youth left after the dissolution of the italian communist party before its transformation into a social democratic party  criticism of mogherini ranges from claims of her being pro-russian and too close to the kremlin , to not taking the threat of russia seriously . 
   nonetheless , mogherini 's decision to choose a spokeswoman whose husband is a partner in a firm lobbying for russian energy giant gazprom caused public criticism . 
  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/federica_mogherini what a bright englightened individial !, 
  when we got our ass kicked by commies she lived happily along commie youth . 
  fuck communism . 
  oh so you have read the non existing agreement yet ? 
  care to share it with us ? 
  [ sorry , but my first thought ] ( https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/ee/a7/8f/eea78ff683a4268bd38b533404b876b8.jpg ), 
  germany i think has experience in making people die , what about that ? 
  okey so you need a background of polish culture . 
  we have a saying that the people who hate poles the most are other poles . 
  this is pretty accurate in peacetime . 
  we are country that was occupied like milion times by everyone . 
  so we have a tradition which leads us to consolidate in times of crisis . 
  ( like with almost no resources we created one of the biggest undergound movement during [ wwii ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/home_army ) . ), 
  so in times of problems we switch to hate inviders . 
  if those syrians will be seen as foreign culture taking over ours , no laws will apply . 
  i am afraid they kind of are , since this is proven that among them there are isis members and we do n't feel like being terrorised . 
  we live in a [ safe ] ( http://www.oecdbetterlifeindex.org/topics/safety/ ) country and we dont want it to change . 
  it protects minorities , we have muslim minorities like tatars who we respect very much . 
  muslim syrians are n't seen as minority here , but invaders . 
  police can not check 90 % of the country , who dislike those newcoming muslims . 
  how many ? 
  i would say 0 . 
  our society does n't like muslims whether you like it or not . 
  those people will be attacked , since islam is percieved here as an ultimate threat . 
  i am not happy about but dont tell me i didnt warn you . 
  agreement does n't exist , yet people demonstrate against it in germany . 
  in title i write support for ttip not support for existing ttip agreement . 
  ttip is soon to be agreement . 
  but thanks , i like how you remembered my post . 
  i mean i can understand germany ( also austria ) also france since they do n't want a bigger player among them , but sweden ? 
  what is there to justify ? 
  free market on global scale is a bad thing / s, 
  i see germans more like a victims of their goverment honestly . 
  nord stream means that you value partnership with russia more than solidarity with eastern europe . 
  which is good for your economy and bad for solidarity . 
  it means also that in case of problems with russia you , ight pick for example cheap gas ( which is pretty neat in terms of economy ) than solidarity . 
  historical reasons did n't start with hitler , it is you who are overly concerned with nazism . 
  yeah and nord stream was lik what ? 
  i have travelled i was in the most west europan capitals . 
  i mean we have historical reason to be careful , but dont take this too seriosuly i was joking in this post , i should have placed / s tho . 
  no it is n't now it is just negotiation . 
  it isnt trade agreement yet . 
  you know that you can sue countries right now , without ttip ? 
  ttp , different deal nothing to do with europe . 
  do you know what negotiations are ? 
  tell me since when negotiations are public ? 
  i kind of need european side on this one , 
  but ttip doesnt exist , you do n't like a name of it or what ? 
  i think it can be called tttip if you dislike ttip that much . 
  every pole gets anxsious when germans and russians follow some project . 
  btw anyone has a source on the informatio that ttip will be public for one year before the vote ? 
  stop what ? 
  ttip agreement doesnt even exist , what they are trying to stop the name ? 
  what ? 
  yeah i can not , tho i do n't want to speak about things i am not completely sure about in different christian religions too , so i prefer do n't talk about it at all . 
  wow , you just like to ask questions about things that noone even remotely implied , do n't you ? 
  bible , in contray to koran , is open for interpretations . 
  christianity develops because its ideas are to be universal but applied to times . 
  of course carholicism isnt christianity , but you have to excuse me , i am a pole and i am speaking from catholic perspective . 
  sure old testament shows acts of violence , but again i am a catholic and speaking from this prespective . 
  the catholic doctrine gave an interpretation to bible . 
  submission ? 
  you mixed us with muslims a bit here http://www.catholic.com/quickquestions/what-is-the-catholic-view-of-women will she ? 
  if you are n't from japan i live a safer country than you according do oecd . 
  so no beating i guess . 
  and it suceed ? 
  did n't it ? 
  it got itself with the modern world and as far as i know new pope is respected even among atheists . 
  i am sorry that i ca n't quote properly i am on ipad and safari is shitty . 
  yeah they want to spread christianity by a sword which is against what caholics believe right now ? 
  but i think you finally got it since you need to compare medival christians to nowadays muslims . 
  i think i did my part in here . 
  new testament ?

  if you had a normal multi-party democracy your politics would n't have degenerated like that . 
  libertarians would vote for libertarians , socialists for socialists , centrists for centrists etc. 
  if you wo n't fix that you 're screwed . 
  and since the inertia in your politics is so high you sure as hell wo n't . 
  ergo , you 're fucked :(, 
  all of the reports suggest that he won because of disenfranchised blue collar voters , trade unionists and a such thanks to his anti-open trade and anti-establishment rhetoric . 
  all the people that sanders would have in a bag . 
  also all the studies from the time of primaries were showing easy victory by him over trump while predicting clinton loss . 
  germany is doing ok in that department , so i did n't really mean them , but when it comes to countries such as uk , france , spain , greece , poland etc. 
  ( neo ) liberals are pretty much despised by the majority and them clinging to power , not understanding their mistakes together with media establishment defending the status quo are just giving victory to the far-right on the silver plater . 
  liberalism is dead , time to support the new left or keep pretending it 's business as usual and thus give power to the far-right . 
   the clinton supporters do you mean `` trump opponents '' ? 
  wow . 
  have n't thought about it . 
  democratic party sure fucked you all over . 
  and you sure been bending over for years if not decades , waiting for it . 
  and to think that if liberals were n't so afraid of left-winger messing up their oligarchy sanders would most likely be called a winner by now ... sure how european establishment will learn a thing or two . 
  you 're really into rocks , are n't you ? 
  whole thing is made up . 
  check other comments . 
  hdp are a democratic left very similar to podemos or corbyn 's labour so they , among other things , promote and practice institutional gender equality . 
  i 've met a few of them here in poland since [ we ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/razem ) 're cooperating with them a little bit and they 're really great guys . 
  well educated , brilliant young politicians every eu country would be lucky to have . 
  difference between them and the ruling akp is mindboggling . 
  so looks like we are at `` first they came for the socialists ... '' part of the story . 
  a democratic left-wing opposition that got 5 million votes in last election is being jailed under terrorist link pretenses by a the islamist-xenophobic jingoistic authoritarian cunts . 
  just fucking great . 
  what are you more ? 
  an utter moron or a homicidal far-right nutjob ? 
  i ca n't really tell . 
  it is very much independent from religion in poland as well . 
  it 's pretty hard to botch a death rate data collection . 
  i 'd imagine it 's due to the quality of healthcare . 
  our cardiology is pretty damn decent . 
  have n't you heard ? 
  they 've been overrun by pirates and are now held for ransom somewhere . 
  i mean , i love me some russia blaiming as much as the next guy , but i 'm not quite sure it makes sense here ... 
  since the grammar is so barebones they are needed to clarify how various words interact with one another within a sentence and between them . 
  that 's one part , rest is kinda pointless and more in the realms of orthography . 
  i mean ... how can one think i 'm being serious ? 
  author must have mixed up czechia ( often called czechland ) with completely different country called czech republic . 
  that 's probably where those discrepancies come from . 
  is n't a stereotype supposed to be something false ? 
  mostly due to the time passed and stiff competition in that department . 
  you find sodomizing russian children hilarious ?!, 
  you monster !, 
  while his arguments are stupid , the idea is n't new and has been toyed with for well over a decade , mostly due to russian side interfering with our shipping . 
   no you are n't . 
  this is a talking point that has no basis in reality . 
  it does n't matter how often it is debunked , it just keeps popping up . 
  can you point me in the direction of a piece that debunks the danger of quality regulations being set to the lowest common denominator ? 
  the gist of it is that we 're endangering our quality regulations and our sovereign right to implement a new ones for a minuscule to small trade increase with a 2nd rate trade partner . 
  i 'm yet to hear reasonable answer to the claims that ceta is a trojan horse for us corporations through nafta . 
  all in all the balance of risks and possible benefits is so far off here that this whole deal should n't even be considered . 
  and years of widely praised polishing of that turd failed to fix the most important issues . 
  being under 5 % for 25 years in a row is a definition of irrelevant , 
  i would n't say that poles are either inherently left or right wing . 
  few people abroad remember it now , but 10 years ago country was ruled by socialist left alliance ( sld ) , a postcommunist , anti-clerical party after they got 40 % of the votes in the election . 
  and in the last 8 years all of the elections were won by centrist po . 
  downfall of those both parties and rise of pis is very much of their own making . 
  after this term ( it remains to be seen if it will be a full one ) things will definitely swing back to the center , or even all the way to the left . 
  th bright side of it is that if they go ahead with it , it will simply kill them as a relevant party for at least a decade . 
  not sure what they 're smoking , but it 's pretty obvious that they ca n't win elections by solely pandering to those few % of catotaliban voters . 
  election took place at the end of a long 10 year period of duopoly of two parties - previously ruling po and pis . 
  no other parties really mattered . 
  that situation helped po to stay in power for 8 long years till people were so fed up with them that they voted for their enemy . 
  it was easier since pis pretended that they got ever their hardline conservative obsessions and they just want to focus on more social economy . 
  other two established parties were discredited post-communist left-in-name-only sld and agrarian ultra-nepotist psl . 
  both with support around 5-8 % . 
  at the same time 3 new parties were taking shape - neoliberal . nowoczesna , populist-conservative kukiz '15 ( technically not a party , but w/e ) and new left , social-democratic razem ( think corbyn 's labour , but with central-european view of russia ) . 
  . nowoczesna was seen as a new incarnation of po , just more neoliberal and thus mostly got votes of pissed po supporters with such economical views landing at 12 % . 
  kukiz '15 was quite successful , but that was mostly a protest vote with an iron ceiling of 15 % or so . 
  razem being the newest and considered totally irrelevant have not gotten any media coverage will the very last week of the election and ended up with 3,6 % below 5 % threshold thus only managing to prevent their rivals on the left - sld from getting any seats . 
  overall situation happaned to be very convenient for pis . 
  he obviously talks about forcing women to do that , just not in cases where their life and health ( sic ! ), 
  is in danger . 
  poland was the most `` liberal '' country in the eastern block , or as it was called at the time `` most joyful hootch in the socialist camp '' , so it was easiest to come here and take pictures without secret police controlling your ever move . 
  whole thing ai n't over yet , either . 
  oberprimeminister kaczy\u0144ski just went off the deep end saying : `` we want for even very difficult pregnancies when the child is severely deformed and will surely die end with birth , so it can be christened , have a name and a funeral . '', 
  `` only if the life and health ( sic ! ), 
  of a other is n't in danger , though '', 
  whole rout was very enjoyable to watch . 
  last time i 've seen government backpedaling so fast was after acta protests few years back . 
  i 'd bet you the same left hand that if there were no protests the bill would have passed as proposed . 
  if protests were smaller there might have been a laxer version , but still . 
   quite a risky bet , as i think a lot of pis and k '15 mps will vote for the bill , but not enough of them for it to pass . 
  so the exact same outcome there was going to be with or without any demonstrations . 
  told ya . 
  i 'm not sure . 
  they 've been pulling a lot of shit like that , but not nearly as blatant so i do n't know what is the legal situation . 
  till now those things mostly worked on custom and common courtesy , but pis does n't have much regard for either . 
  since they 're pulling similar or worse things every week or so and in this case their u-turn is actually along with the agenda of the opposition ( save the desire to grill them using it ) it will probably be left alone . 
  `` pro-life '' organizations may want to protest or sue in some way , but as i mentioned , i 'm not really sure how would that work . 
  have you listened to any pis politicians or watched the government tv last week ? 
  they sure as hell supported it . 
  it is a political matter so political parties are the proper tools for this topic . 
  and as a member of razem i have to point out that we 've both kickstarted the whole thing on internet with #czarnyprotest campaign and organized dozens of demonstrations on our own , so saying that we want to `` capture '' it and that it 's `` disgusting '' is a bit of a stretch ... 
  till today i 'd say that the most likely option was for pis new `` compromise '' to come through and them trying to sell it as a sensible middle-ground . 
  as 2nd most likely option i would had named passing the whole thing in the middle of the night hoping that people will forget about it till next elections and 3rd that they 'd bury it in commissions and never actually put it to the vote . 
  the interesting part is that they clearly got scared enough to put this shitshow of killing the bill withing 24h .

you mean the case we sent you a road salt as a table salt and poisoned alcohol ? 
  have heard there 's been a thing before , maybe for the [ zaolzie ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/zaolzie ) , i do n't really know . 
  the point is , people talk about it appareantly occuring , but neither i nor my friends ever experienced it . 
  here is one : there are three kind of poles - the south pole , the north pole , and the pole that steals your job . 
  yeah , i heard you got some problems with poles , but i lived in your country 5 years and never ever anyone made me problems . 
  those were actually one of the most nice years of my life . 
  \u010cr is beautiful , all i can say . 
  i ca n't really see what 's their problem with calling black people black . 
  are n't they black and are n't turks , turks ? 
  some people with insecurities , i guess . 
  btw , i 'm polish and got no problem with people joking about us being a cheap labour ( because we actually are one ) , and am doing it myself . 
  just sayin ' if that bugged you , 
  erdogan is the president . 
  he won the elections this year . 
  some theory says we hate in other people what we suck at ourselves . 
  thanks for giving an example , vlad . 
  you better beware who are you calling a coward , you yourself hiding behind a dictator whose only argument is the argument of force . 
  sweden recognized palestine . 
  lieberman said something among the lines _ this conflict 's more complicated than ikea 's furniture _ - or something like that . 
  in poland it 's widely taught , along english - at least in middle school and high school ( in mine high we could choose german/french ) . 
  i wish i could give you more upvotes . 
  nah , that 's pretty normal . 
  i was talking about myself :d but maan , the same shit in poland . 
  exactly the same . 
   2 ) in greece , the same people ( those that are hated ) are elected over and over again and they will again be elected . 
  quote me on that . 
  funny how things you thought apply only to your country actually happen elsewhere too . 
  but that 's ** a passport ** . 
  it 's a identification document you use ** all over the world ** . 
  it 's got to be in english - not french , polish or , i do n't know , chinese - in order to be understood worldwide . 
  french is n't taught everywhere , but - surprise , surprise - english is . 
  when and where was kazakhstan considered european ? 
  i hear about that idea for the first time in my life :o, 
  question of the year : who gives a fuck ? 
  noone can compare to commies . 
  thought no need to mention that , 
  hard to say , most of them are pretty shitty ( welcome to poland ) . 
  though definitely antoni macierewicz , known for his pointless theories ( see the smolensk crash ) is one of the worst . 
  tell me , what 's repressive about learning english . 
  i did n't say either of the cities is better than the other one . 
  you brought that topic up now . 
   why anyone would want to destroy it ? 
  i do n't know . 
  it was years ago and i do n't even remember who popped out with this idea . 
  okay , so i guess that theory of mine was n't that valid after all :d anyways , warsaw has it ** too ** . 
  and it 's its symbol ** too ** . 
  that 's probably closer to reality now . 
  true , but when you see a picture of it , do you first think of warsaw or moscow ? 
   say that the best building in warsaw is that big soviet palace thing . 
  just for the record : when a plan of destroying the palace of culture and science appeared , practically all people said no , since it 's warsaw 's symbol . 
  we rather consider it a polish eiffel tower than something we do n't want or are ashamed of . 
  i suppose we both just agree it depends on context , 
  great pics !, 
  thanks for sharing , 
  i 'd see him as a threat if he waved a terrorist organisation 's flag . 
  ignorant people are paranoic about things they do n't understand/don ' t know . 
  pole is a completely normal denonym , just like polish . 
  polack is appareantly offensive , but i do n't find it offensive in any way . 
  and it sounds similar to polak , which means _ a pole _ in polish , 
  i do n't really think there anything more than that . 
  but i might be biased , i have n't been in poland for years . 
  we have a lot of talking about drunk drivers , especially on days like al saint 's day , new years eve etc. 
  is it what you meant ? 
  i 've lived there for 5 years , the landscapes are stunning , people are decent , and if you still want a big city , [ ostrava ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ostrava ) is nearby . 
  being from poland myself , i need to admit you have a valid point , sadly . 
  yup , 2004 , they joined the same day poland did . 
  yeah , i know . 
  but otherwise , what 's the point of adding some minuscule island in oceania or an american state to ** european ** union ? 
  they likely already have their own unions anyway . 
  and besides , if turks ever get rid of politicians like erdogan , i 'll welcome them in ue with open hands . 
  they are in the eu since 2004 . 
  geographically they 're more european than many countries listed here . 
  edit - spelling . 
  russian troops enter ukraine , but of course russia is n't willing to admit it . 
  why should we do anything ? 
  it 's arabs ' thing . 
  if they ask for help , let 's help , but why commit by ourselves ? 
  what 's wrong about that ? 
  win/win . 
  good i did n't say how much i bet . 
  i thought you are in eu . 
  i bet the map 's for eu countries only .

  in a more broad term , i hesitate between european and central european : i feel more related to central european countries like czech or slovak republic , since they are closer to us mentally and culturally - but at the other hand , we are all from europe . 
  i do n't fully understand where are you coming from . 
  _ baba _ is a rather obnoxious name for a woman , at least in a common language . 
  hence _ chick 's _ , for a lack of a better word . 
  would agree with _ babcia _ / _ babka _ though , despite the similarity of these words ( hence _ grandma 's _ ) . 
  ** polish ** * ** indian summer ** - _ babie lato _ ( grandma 's summer ; or chick 's summer ) * ** milky way ** - _ droga mleczna _ ( literally ) * ** sunshower ** - i 've got no clue  * ** go\u0142oled\u017a / czarny l\u00f3d ** - '' _ black ice _ '' - a transparent layer of ice on a road ; appears when a rain falls on a ground that has below-zero temperature .

  ** the most ** : germany/czech republic ** the least ** : russia, 
  ** fun fact ** : polish parliament resides on wiejska st. ( village st. ) , and polish colloquial for mess and lack of class is wie\u015b or wiocha ( village ) . 
  which describes our politics perfectly . 
  / / _ the difference in the name `` wie\u015b '' and `` wiocha '' is a place , while `` wiejska '' is an adjective from it .

  `` we have not solved it . 
  but i can see progress from my point of view , and that is already a lot . '' part of the resistance to pietrasiewicz 's project was professional , with opposition from local politicians and pressure groups , and some of it was frighteningly personal . 
  stones painted with swastikas were thrown at his windows . 
  a bomb squad was called to dismantle an explosive device left outside his house , and for years posters were plastered around the city bearing his face , with jewish symbols and anti-semitic threats . 
  `` i was attacked for being a friend of the jews , '' he says calmly . 
  `` it surprised me that what i did awoke so many negative emotions . 
  i knew that there must be people that opposed this but i never thought it would result in aggression . '' pietrasiewicz rejects the notion that he is a hero or celebrity . 
  while his supporters clearly idolise him and his vision , he is uncomfortable talking about himself , steering the conversation back to the project . 
  last month he received the inaugural award created by the polin museum to honour those who work to protect the memory of polish jews . 
  at a moment when eastern europe struggles once again with the idea of multi-ethnic societies , his work in lublin seems especially timely and relevant . 
  `` sometimes i asked myself , ` how important is this ? 
  what am i doing ? ' and i realised that what the nazis wanted to do here was not only kill the jews but erase any trace of them afterwards . 
  if there is evil in this world , it is from this dark utopian idea , '' he says . 
  `` so what i am doing is creating another utopia .

  sixty years old , with bright eyes and a sharp wit , pietrasiewicz works alone every night in the institute from 1am until 7am on his own projects , after which he starts his day job as operations manager . 
  he sleeps from 7pm until midnight . 
  he was born in siedlce , a town two hours ' drive north , and moved to lublin as an infant , later studying in the city . 
  he joined the anti-communist underground movement , working as an editor and printer for samizdat publications while developing a passion for theatre . 
  that led him to the grodzka gate in 1992 , where he had dreams of forming a theatre company in the building . 
  not jewish himself , it was when he stumbled on the history of the gate , and of lublin itself , that he had an epiphany . 
  `` it changed my life , '' he says . 
  `` imagine living here , with no idea of what had happened . 
  nobody ever told me . 
  and then i was hit with this information . 
  every person has turning points in their life , and i had that moment -- whether to create a theatrical institution without any regard for what had happened here before , or to do something about it . '' he collected stories , fragments of memory , diary entries , letters . 
  and a picture began to form of a community expunged from history his problem was that much of the documentary evidence of lublin 's murdered jews had been destroyed along with their homes . 
  in the late 1960s , poland 's communist regime launched a virulent anti-semitic campaign , driving out many of the jews who had managed to survive the holocaust and instilling prejudice among the state apparatus . 
  there were no archives or files in lublin 's library or history museum -- traditional research methods were useless . 
  instead , pietrasiewicz began to talk to people . 
  he collected stories , fragments of memory teased from witnesses , photographs from private collections , letters and diary entries . 
  slowly a picture began to form of a community expunged from history . 
  from those first memories , pietrasiewicz 's mission has become all-consuming . 
  the gate has become one of poland 's most important archives of jewish history . 
  since it opened , 1,600 people have come forward to tell their stories or donate books , diaries or photographs . 
  dozens work on chronicling the history , processing documents , oral transcripts and photographs . 
  marian turski , vice-president of the association of the jewish historical institute in poland , credits pietrasiewicz with building a bridge between an often wide gap separating christian and jewish poland . 
  `` grodzka gate , which before the war was the link between the two christian and jewish cultures , symbolically regained its former function thanks to the work of tomasz pietrasiewicz . 
  it is a place where the memory of a common polish-jewish past of the city is continually cultivated . '' five years ago , a project was begun to create a file for every one of the 1,500 homes that existed in jewish lublin before the second world war . 
  today at least 900 of them are filled with letters , photographs and official documents , each painstakingly compiled by researchers often working with just a name or a fragment from a diary to give them a clue of who lived there . 
  relatives come with just the memory of a street name , or a number , and find out for the first time about the lives of their family members . 
  `` we are creating an ark of memory , to take into the future , '' says pietrasiewicz . 
  the next stage of the archive is even more daunting . 
  pietrasiewicz and his team are creating a file for each of the pre-holocaust city 's 43,000 jewish residents . 
  throughout the centre , everywhere you look there are metal shelves packed with pale green files , or empty ones waiting to be filled . 
  they snake through the exhibition rooms like a thread that ties everything together . 
  it is a powerful sight : impressive for its sheer scale , eerie and unsettling . 
  many of the files contain just a blurred photograph of an anonymous face , some just a name . 
  `` it is a massive process of finding materials , '' pietrasiewicz explains . 
  `` we can take just a single sentence out of a story , a speck of memory . 
  for us it is nn -- ` no name ' : it might be the only trace of that person 's existence and nothing more will be found . 
  this project shows us the tragedy of how little we know about some people , and how we will never know anything of others , '' he says . 
  `` most of them will be empty , no-name files , waiting , maybe , to be filled . '' a medieval building , the centre is cramped and labyrinthine . 
  its stone walls and floors are cold , its ceilings very low in parts . 
  its shape lends itself to the sense of discovery and revelation that pietrasiewicz was sure almost all its local visitors would feel . 
  we are led through the exact room where a young jewish girl was hidden during the nazi occupation , the outlines of her furniture painted in white on its grey floor , like the chalk outline of a corpse at a crime scene . 
  her story ends more brightly : decades later she came to pietrasiewicz and recorded her memories , one of hundreds whose voices fill 5,000 hours of recordings at the centre . 
  article text , part 1 ( because it 's behind a paywall apparently ) : the polish city 's jews were wiped out in the second world war . 
  one man is determined to tell their stories the young boy has a shy smile and neatly combed hair , and his smart-collared shirt is tightly tucked into a pair of flannel shorts pulled up high on his waist . 
  in his striped socks and bright white shoes , this is the last photograph of henio zytomirski , a six-year-old jewish boy . 
  he would be murdered three years later in a gas chamber in the majdanek extermination camp on the outskirts of the city of lublin , in nazi-occupied eastern poland . 
  in a city that for decades had buried its jewish past , this grainy black-and-white image has helped to prise open the lid on a history that many in poland are only just coming to terms with . 
  `` henio was born in 1933 . 
  his father took a photograph of him every year , '' says tomasz pietrasiewicz , the man who discovered henio 's story and who has dedicated the past 20 years to chronicling the lives of lublin 's murdered jews . 
  he flicks through the seven photographs showing the smiling boy getting older . 
  `` and that is the last picture : 1939 . '' henio has become the personification of the holocaust in this eastern polish city . 
  more than 40,000 jews were killed here but for decades that horror was erased from history , buried by repression and forcibly forgotten by a generation of postwar poles desperate to ignore what they had witnessed . 
  `` the places are gone and the people are gone , '' says pietrasiewicz . 
  `` but here , henio is still alive . '' we are standing in the grodzka gate nn theatre , part museum , part library and part cultural institute , where pietrasiewicz , its founder , has painstakingly pieced together the lives of thousands of forgotten people , a mission sparked by the boy with the shy smile who never saw his 10th birthday . 
  the grodzka gate , in which the institute is housed , was built in 1342 . 
  for centuries it marked the division between christian and jewish lublin . 
  to stand under its arch and look out , away from the medieval city walls , is to gaze across an expanse that 75 years ago was one of poland 's most vibrant jewish communities . 
  in 1939 , 43,000 of lublin 's 122,000-strong population were jews . 
  many of them lived in a bustling network of small streets around and between the gate and a 12th-century castle . 
  today , nothing but the gate and the castle remain . 
  a vast car park , flanked on one side by town houses , dominates the view . 
  a small park hugs the base of the castle 's mound . 
  a pizza takeaway , ice-cream shop and taxi rank have replaced a jewish district whose population was systematically eradicated , before the buildings were razed one by one . 
  such was the hurry with which postwar communist authorities smothered this dark history -- less than a decade after the last jews were killed in concentration camps -- that the foundations of the destroyed homes can still be found , buried under the tarmac . 
  walking here , every day , we walk over destroyed streets . 
  we are walking on the burning foundations of houses - tomasz pietrasiewicz `` there were houses , shops , printing houses , synagogues . 
  everywhere you could hear yiddish , '' says pietrasiewicz . 
  `` you have a concrete space here . 
  if you lift it up , you would see the foundations of the houses . 
  but despite this concrete shell , the memories come through . '' the city 's main dual carriageway cuts across the land to the north of the castle , slicing through an area that was once one of the most important jewish settlements in the world , the location of europe 's most senior rabbinical school . 
  every morning , thousands of the city 's commuters drive over the remains of a synagogue built in 1567 and big enough to accommodate more than 3,000 people . 
  used by the nazis to sort jews selected for deportation to death camps , it was burnt to the ground afterwards ; all that remains of it today is a plaque . 
  `` walking here , every day , we walk over destroyed streets , '' says pietrasiewicz . 
  `` we are walking on the burning foundations of houses . 
  it is not a closed history . 
  it is warm . 
  this is not the history of the battle of waterloo but of people still crying , still hurting . '' he stares out over the bleak car park . 
  `` this is not only the disclosure of a forgotten town but it is a reaction to something that is still a moral issue , saving the memory of what happened here . '' . 
  in many ways , lublin was the heart of the holocaust in poland . 
  of the city 's 43,000 jews , fewer than 300 survived there . 
  operation reinhard , the nazi programme to systematically murder all of occupied poland 's two million jews , was headquartered here . 
  the plans for belzec , the first extermination camp , were drawn up and its construction administered in lublin : belzec and the sobibor and treblinka death camps are all less than 200km away .

  we are not federalists ' slaves . 
   you ca n't continuously take money and shout against the eu at the same fucking time . 
  of course i can . 
  i am perfectly allowed to like the unified market and open borders aspects of eu ( and free monies ) - nothing more , nothing less . 
  protecting your national sovereignity by giving it up ? 
  that 's like the most idiotic idea i have heard today . 
  yeah , there 's even more sure method to make russian * threat * disappear - all you have to do is to simply give up your sovereignity to * russians * . 
  we celebrate napoleon as well . 
  he is even mentioned in our national anthem in a positive light . 
  til napoleon is disliked in some european countries . 
  yes , and greece is 4x smaller than poland . 
  2 \u00d7 2 = 4 4 \u00d7 4 = 16 poland has 16 voivodships . 
  my math checks out :d, 
   they do n't want to tell . 
  if they do n't wa n't to tell , it should be their own fucking problem , not ours . 
  they could be petty criminals fleeing the justice system in their country for all we know . 
   there still a likelihood poland and romania might officially join the euro by 2020 ? 
  definitely not , we 'll be following sweden and czech republic in short to medium timeframe . 
  in a long run though ? 
  who knows , maybe by 2050 we might join the eurozone , though for that to happen it will definitely have to be a way different ez than the one existing nowadays . 
   they have to , as they promised that in their treaty of accession . 
  so has sweden , and they managed to avoid euro just fine until now . 
  even though in theory we have to join * at some point * , there is no way to * actually * force us to do so . 
   ignore the fact that our neighbour slovakia adopted $ without problems . 
  yes , but then again , the entire slovakian economy is comparable to the two average polish voivodships . 
   polish youth is very different from their parents , most of them do n't differ much in their opinions from their western counterparts . 
  this is funny , because the polish youth is noticeably more conservative than the baby boomers ( 30-40 year old ) generation . 
  note : those are the most common names for children born in 2014 , not in the general population . 
  we probably had them like 200 or 300 years ago . 
  the one big blob of `` polish '' would look weird , so they had to dig them up even though the are all long extinct . 
  it also came * from * the term balkans . 
   what the hell did hoover do for poland ? 
  sent a lot of humanitarian aid here after the ww1 . 
  though it was way before he became a president , sure . 
   baltic and slavic languages are related . 
  but they * are * related . 
  baltic languages are definitely the closest non-slavic languages to , say , polish - and they look way more ... similar than anything germanic , romance or celtic . 
  while both branches definitely diverged at least 3 thousands years ago , that 's still later than divergence with any other branch of indo-european languages . 
  yes , and adam ma\u0142ysz ski jumping hill in wis\u0142a . 
  probably some more , if you really looked for them - though they most likely all include the * imienia * - `` named after '' part . 
  by `` places '' i meant streets , roundabouts and squares , and naming conventions of those are just like i described . 
  of course you are , we have converted you in the first place after all , 
  catholic pilgrimage sites are included in the `` traces of polishness '' part . 
  there are many non-religious people praising jesus in the church during christmas . 
  it 's already a very common tourist destination in poland ( and the average trip focuses solely on looking for surviving traces of * polishness * , old wilno and famous poles who lived there ) . 
  guess it 's just like the german trips to wroc\u0142aw or szczecin . 
  we have numerous roundabouts , squares and streets named after hoover , wilson , washington , roosevelt or reagan as well . 
  this one 's a joke though , we do n't usually name places after * living * people ( the only exception being if you are a pope who happened to be born in poland ) . 
  as to why - usually we do it to honour the us politican who did something which benefited poland immensely , like reagan or wilson . 
  yeah , but i would say that the traditional polish way of enjoying those particular holidays which is how most people tend to do it is inherently * un * secular . 
  because personally , i do n't see anything secular about singing christmas songs about baby jesus , and then going to the mass at midnight . 
  that 's our doing . 
  you are cultural catholic if you do n't really care about religion in your daily life , though you keep observing the catholic traditions , participating in catholic holidays like easter , christmas or all saint 's day ( which might include going to the church on those days , even if one usualy do n't bother ) , etc. 
  i 'd say that out of our supposedly over 90 % catholic population , about half are only cultural catholics . 
   excuse me , courland is and has always been baltic clay . 
  well , baltics still were diligent subjects of the glorious commonwealth at the time . 
   was, 
  advocating * against * a common european ticket , comparing it to some nazi idea . 
   many of people in poland ( maybe the majority already ) wants to exit this communist/socialist experiment `` european union '' . 
  not yet , right now the general consensus is `` let 's stay in eu at least until the * wunderbar-magical-free-money-for-infrastructure * fountain runs out , and then we 'll see '' . 
  yes , we would have to invent several new symbols , or keep using digraphs and trigraphs to make it kinda bearable . 
  either way , in the end there are * no * advantages from adapting cyrillic , while there are countless disadvantages . 
  at this point , we could try to adapt katakana or bengali script well enough . 
  that would be even worse , with czech system we at least could keep writimg our language phonetically , cyrillic results in monstrosities like those seen earlier in this discussion . 
  switching to cyrillic so we end up like english and have to learn pronounciation separately from spelling sounds like a doubly shitty deal . 
   little late on spelling reform . 
  yeah , but thanks to this even texts from medieval times and renaissance are quite easily readable in original ortography . 
  we will never taint our glorious indigenous writing system with some cheap czech invention : dd and interestingly enough , the `` dz '' sound is spelled that way in every other language that also uses it . 
  '' \u0434\u0436 '' would be `` d\u017c '' . 
  we also have `` d\u017a '' , and even `` dzi '' ( which sounds slightly different from d\u017a , more vovel-like and can make a syllabe ) . 
  this version is not particularly close either . 
  anyhow , i have always thought cyrillic `` e '' to be an equivalent of our `` ie '' , and '' \u042d '' or '' \u0404 '' to mean our `` e '' . 
  it kinda used to be the `` official '' pronounciation until the interwar period ( though it was aleady rarely used by then ) , but by now it was replaced by `` english w '' pronounciation everywhere but some kresy dialects still remaining in lithuania and belarus . 
  that 's how polish transliteration of cyrillic works . 
  and yes , ie/e ; \u0142 / l and ci / \u0107 are all different sounds . 
  that would be `` szie\u0142ieszczjaci '' in polish spelling , definitely not . 
  at this point it could be the bengali script or incan quipu well enough , if we were going to change to something so exotic anyway . 
   one epic rune = one sound , no more digraphs . 
  we would have to dig up some funny looking symbols for \u0105 , \u0119 and \u0142 then , because i do n't recall either of them being in current form of cyrillic . 
  and with katakana we get one symbol = one * syllabe * , think about space conservation we gain this way if simple digraphs bother you so much !, 
   much benefits , already used by other slavs . 
  unfortunately , this is greatly outweighed by the `` ugly and looks like * russian * '' disadvantage . 
   why so serious ? 
  i still like my `` switch to katakana '' proposal much better . 
  it 's definitely much more plausible for starters . 
  uhm , so what 's exactly the difference other than the former looking like ugly russian-runes instead of being instantly recognizable as polish ? 
  for comparison , look how neat `` zbigniew kazimierz brzezi\u0144ski '' looks like in katakana : \u30ba\u30d3\u30b0\u30cd\u30d5 \u30fb \u30ab\u30b8\u30df\u30a8\u30b7\u30e5 \u30fb \u30d6\u30ec\u30b8\u30f3\u30b9\u30ad\u30fc poles should switch to kana . 
  well , if we * had to * change to some alien writing system anyway , i 'd definitely chose this one over cyrillic anytime . 
  colonization * of africa * , mate . 
  you shall look back and read it carefuly . 
  in a long comment chain focused solely on africa it would appear to be a quite usual occurence for the discussion to remain on topic . 
  from what i 've gathered , that 's how conversations tend to work . 
  in a long comment chain focused solely on africa it would appear to be a quite usual occurence for the discussion to remain on topic . 
  about one post earlier . 
  in fact it was you who specifically mentioned it , i will even quote your exact words for convenience :  africa is a shithole because when europeans came they drew fake borders and made a society designed for extraction of resources , which they leaved and left in ruins in the second half of the 20 . century . 
  til t * h * ailand is in africa . 
  i have n't noticed ethiopia ( or liberia , though it kinda * was * a colony of us ) being significantly better off than the rest of africa . 
  quite the contrary to be honest . 
  it already was a shithole when europeans came there . 
  anyhow , i 'd take * zero * rate of terrorism over a low rate of it anytime .

  no country with active territorial dispute is allowed to join nato . 
   d : let turkey permanently close the strait , cutting off access to the russian base in syria . 
  i would laugh hard , but that 's not possible . 
  not without breaking international treaties - and turkey , unlike russia , still cares about it 's opinion in the world . 
   eu must answer in the strongest way , short of military intervention , least we see more annexation attempts in the future . 
  ruble cheap . 
  ruble cheaper every day . 
  poland can into space . 
  there was never a truce . 
  just a one-side invasion without armed resistance . 
   who though ? 
  russia does . 
  it 'll be used as a pretext for partitioning of ukraine . 
   or we could just waste less power . 
  i know , that 's probably terrifying . 
  that 's got a short-term benefits and is really expensive on a level of each family living in a country and each large company based there . 
  yes , we should n't waste as much energy as we do in europe ( brits and their buildings make me terrified - need to constantly heat the building when it 's +10 outside ) , but even if we would cut it by half - it still does n't change the fact that consumption of energy is constantly raising and reducing energetic waste would n't offset that on a country-wide level . 
   there is a big issue that i see emerging . 
  miseducation . 
  emerging ? 
  i think it 's already there . 
  you 're new here ? 
  people on reddit point out dicks in government almost every time we talk about russian invasion on crimea . 
  8 downvotes . 
  i can bet all of them were from poles . 
  density of planned military exercises per square meter of europe is going dangerously close to the critical mass . 
  good point bigos , only it got one problem : we ( or more importantly : our politicians ) also ca n't see what is being done right . 
  so in many cases we have a discussions about making changes for a sake of making changes . 
  each time there 's just part of a system going wrong - we want to tear the whole thing upside-down ( look : nfz , voivodships , gymnasiums , trains in a winter , etc. 
  hi , and thank you for doing this ama , i wish more politicians would follow your example  . 
  we had a lot of discussions here about lack of eu-wide media or press that would allow europeans to find out what 's going on in whole eu ( not just their own country ) and what are the highlights from eu structures ( not just europarliment alone , but it obviously is a major highlight ) . 
  what do you think is a reason for that , and what can be done to improve people 's awareness of european union ? 
  how do you think crimean situation affected europarliment ? 
  there are opinions that putin did more to united european politicians more than anyone during last 20 years . 
  can you see any change in eu parliament during current crisis ? 
  how do you feel about further expansion of eu ? 
  sweden ... you have such a good record in ensuring democracy and freedom in your country that you make everyone around jealous . 
  oh , so we operate on assumption that government might do something bad so it 's automatically bad ? 
  smart ... 
  i would have thought of that . 
   if 97 % of the population hated the russians than there would have been incidents durring these last weeks when they where de facto ocupied . 
  there most likely would be if not armed guards on every corner . 
  what 's that again ... 30 000 troops deployed to keep population at the gun point ? 
   but it was procedurally correct you 've got to be kidding me . 
  you have no slightest idea what the hell is going on in there if you dare to say anything like that . 
  just random fun fact : 123 % of sevastopolians voted for crimea to join russia . 
   the government is using the political situation to gather immense support that can be abused if we only concentrate on how evil russia is . 
  and examples of that abuse are ... where exactly ? 
   was there a mass conscription based on a inflamed nationalist rethoric ? 
  then it wasn extremely nationalist in nature . 
  and was there one in ukraine ? 
  it 's mostly based on a rhetoric of defending country from russia . 
  not leading it to racial glory over others or anything in any sort reminding extreme nationalism or fascism . 
  besides - conscription is based on a shape of current ukrainian army and the need for manpower . 
  purely practical needs . 
  rhetoric got very little to deal with it , regardless what sort of it is that according to you . 
   i absolutely agree , but that is precisely why the focus should be on the government not the russians . 
  should be , but russian invasion did n't allow it . 
  there are important matters and urgent matters that ca n't wait any delay . 
  partitioning of ukraine by russia is certainly the latter one . 
   the us 's help is worthless you have no clue . 
  advisers can make a huge difference . 
  just look at poland - we had advisers from uk , france and usa . 
  ukraine did not . 
  now - compare the results of first 10 years independence for each country . 
  it 's not a paramilitary - it 's a reserve military force . 
  many countries got national guard - everything is fully legal - you get a training and then you go to reserve . 
  regular military draft for university students in poland looked quite similar before we switched to fully professional army ( you could volunteer to go for summer training at the military camp , some additional lessons during one semester , and you 're done - pretty much identical to what these people are doing right now - difference being that no one accused us for being `` extreme nationalists '' ) . 
   revolutions do not solve systemic issues of course . 
  but they give a chance to improve . 
  it 's better than sitting in stagnation like they did for years before . 
   they just give the system a chance to reset ( it rarely succeeds ) yep , orange revolution is a prefect example of failure . 
  but i hope they learnt their lessons from that and now with advisory from us and eu ( which they did n't have last time ) everything will go little bit more smoothly . 
  hope is pretty much the only thing these people have right now with their economy in very bad state and russians invading their homeland while we are watching it in a tv . 
   collegee graduates joining an civilian armed brigade under the goverment college graduates going to army is standard in all countries that have conscription . 
  and young people were majority of military forces through every conflict in the history . 
  i do n't know why you see anything `` extreme '' in that . 
   ukrainian government is putrid with corruption and incompetence that 's why they just had a revolution . 
  so . . nothing would change ? 
  as that 's exactly what russians are saying right now . 
   i know that it got overturned pretty quickly but thats probably because they realised what a stupid move it is and they know they need to keep the eu and us on side to keep russia at bay . 
  not just russia at bay but also money flowing in . 
  and it 'll be like that for years to come . 
  and as long as ukraine is dependent in any way on west - you wo n't see any fascist-alike laws being implemented there . 
  it 'd be a suicide for their government . 
  all this fascist fears are greatly overblown . 
  first of all - no party that ever was connected to fascists will manage to rule ukraine on it 's own , and other parties are opposed of extreme nationalism . 
  secondly - svoboda distanced itself from it 's neofascist past - that 's what allowed them to win seats in parliament during last elections , while pravy sector did n't have any seats at all and most likely wo n't have them as soon elections will run again . 
  and finally - eu and us are watching every move of ukrainian government . 
  misstep and they can forget about any support or joining eu ( which they obviously really want now ) . 
   no , fascists are just militarized extreme nationalists . 
  so ... that video is suppose to show extreme nationalists ? 
  interesting . 
   but a couple of deflections from the government toward external sources and you got that solved . 
  care to elaborate ? 
  he is not an mp . 
  and look at this : http://www.wprost.pl/f/pic.php?t=news&amp;p=2610&amp;w670=1&amp;brt=1 ^ that 's who this guy is . 
  pro-nazi with contacts in russian intelligence . 
  no wonder he supports nazi-alike russian government . 
  he is nothing more than a scum in polish politics .

  together razem translates to `` together '' . 
  we have not so small vietnamese community mainly in warsaw and there never was any significant problem with them . 
  also i do n't think they did made poland homogeneous , non existent social for non working foreigners did it . 
   hundreds of people showing up shows great solidarity . 
  and they should stopped there , with showing up , lightning candles and shout slogans . 
  peaceful protest can send the message as well . 
  otherwise today they throw stones at windows , tomorrow at people , would you like this kind of sending message ? 
  people stoning each other on the streets ? 
  well i would n't want it in poland .

  i see the immigration crisis and personally i 'm advocate of [ australian solution ] ( http://pakistan.embassy.gov.au/files/islm/140925finaladvert-noway.jpg ) and in my opinion it will come to that sooner or later , because now europe gets only the richest immigrants and poor refugees must live in [ camps like this ] ( http://tarekmostafa.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/zaatari1.jpg ) . 
  but i do n't like seeing people throwing stones at windows , because i 'm afraid what will be next . 
  i agree that chalk drawings were stupid , i agree that people should be mad and gather . 
  but not riots . 
  already done . 
  google translate : *** uneasily in elk - demolished premises catering , near which new year 's eve killed 21-city dweller . 
  on-site gathered in the afternoon approx . 
  300 people . 
  police on the spot helps the military police . 
  the officers on the spot arrested 21 people and announce that this is not the end . 
  demolished premises this point kebab seller . 
  the group that gathered there in the building threw bottles and stones . 
  broken windows , overturned or candles that someone poustawia\u0142 before the premises . 
  stones were thrown at the police cars . 
  police reports that detained 21 of the most aggressive hooligans . 
  after hours . 
  17 at the scene remained only a few dozen people . 
  police appeal to residents of elk did not come in the vicinity of the intersection of army and eliza orzeszkowej . 
  on-site they are still throwing bottles , stones and firecrackers . 
  according to the police , the killed man was most likely a customer demolished kebab . 
  he had two stab wounds in the heart area , probably from a knife . 
  the murder of 21-year-old police detained 4 people . 
  with our informal arrangements that include employees of a catering citizen of algeria , tunisia and morocco . 
  the police under the supervision of the prosecutor 's office determined the details of the tragedy . 
  president thomas elk andrukiewicz appealed to residents to remain calm . 
  there has been a great tragedy . 
  i would like to appeal and ask residents for calm and respect the tragedy of the family is experiencing a 21-year-old daniel . 
  i offered psychological help this family - he said . 
  not so happy new year here . 
  it 's not an official statement , it 's an opinion of a victim , as said in the title . 
   i 'm all in . 
  where do we start ? 
  lest begin with protection of our water border like australians . 
  we can talk about an island later , lets practice protection first . 
  [ why do n't we learn from other continents actions already ?

  yes it was . 
  you ca n't imagine how the whole country hopes it was n't some depressed pole . 
  owner of the truck company says that he and wife of the driver could n't contact with him for hours . 
  edit : damn it came out wrong . 
  of course we would like it to never happen in the first place at all . 
   how anyone could perpetrate such an attack an think `` i 'm the righteous one , i 'm on the right side of history '' ? 
  brainwashed since birth .

  so wait , are they voting for interest of their group , or are voting to `` merge mexico and usa '' ? 
  because you are moving goalposts quite hard right now . 
   i thought there is no such thing ... 
  i thought there is only american vote . 
  do n't play stupid here . 
  you are playing stupid here and you know it . 
  you are painting those people as `` outsiders '' , people that will vote for interest of country they may have no real connection with and not `` sub-group of americans '' ( which is still weird , but that 's not the point here ) . 
   that 's essentially what they mean anyways . 
  yeah ... in your mind . 
   ( of which mexicans/hispanics are by far the largest group ) oh , so you are one of them . 
  people that live in your country for few generations , similarly to other migrants in xx century are now not `` americans '' , but `` mexicans/hispanics/latinos '' , ot whatever you want to call them , just because few generations ago someone emigrated from different country . 
  for god sake 83.7 % of americans are `` non hispanic nor latino '' . 
  for once your weird race relations can give some nice results to use in pointless discussion on the internet . 
   merge literally no one used that word there . 
   still think this is some `` slippery slope conspiracy '' ? 
  yes , yes i do . 
  you would `` few mexicos '' migrated to the usa ( and all speaking in one voice ) to even make a dent in internal politics . 
  you literally quoted people that want to closer ties between two countries and `` having leverage '' . 
  do you think that mexico will go full sudetenland on california ? 
  so ... in the end you do n't know what ponzi scheme is , do n't you ? 
  nice slippery slope there , mate . 
  i ca n't agree with you 100 % on this . 
  yes , some people treat it like that , but many do n't . 
  it 's one of the most common tropes here . 
  people literally say that they are `` irish '' , or even more `` irish than people from ireland '' . 
  you can see similar trope of `` something is in my genes '' , even things purely developed by upbringing . 
   i think you 're talking about govt/state support for people who do niche sports where you ca n't make enough money to actually support yourself . 
  i think in austria this is done via the army in many cases . 
  like the athletes are officially employed by the army but can use most of their time to practice . 
  it 's quite different here , but take it with the grain of salt , because it may differ from uni to uni . 
  scholarship you are describing may be even non-existant here . 
  in case of niche sports it is mostly sponsored by teams ( and it may be conencted to ministry of sport and tourism , polish olympic committee , or similar organizations ) . 
  in terms of scholarships in universities it 's very similar to scholarship for good grades - it 's merit based . 
   no sports scholarships either , afaik . 
  i mean , i do n't know how it works in austria , but you sort of can get scholarship in polish universities . 
  obviously not `` we pay for your tuition '' ( because there 's no need for that ) , but you can get some money if you play sports on national , or international level ( like you said - outside of school ) . 
  your questions are unanswerable now * , at least without painting in very , very broad strokes . 
  differences between countries are big enough to basically dismiss every question bar last one and even that one will depend on season , specific city , etc. 
  * and will be borderline unanswerable in 2018 , or 2019, 
  it 's bit more complicated . 
  it is big ( ish ) in usa because it is , for all intents and purpouses , only option they have . 
  in most european countries it is just alternative . 
  i do n't need third party option if i have ( in my opinion ) better alternative directly from the bank . 
  some banks have own apps you can pay with via nfc , all cards issued nowadays have touchless payment and i can get contactless `` visa sticker card '' from bank . 
  yeah , i think i was mistaken . 
  it looks like it 's random here , too ( but it 's rather ambiguously phrased ) . 
  i do n't know how it 's set in different countries , but iirc it also needs pin after certain number of transactions . 
  it looks like site for freelancers . 
  you mentioned something different , but in the bigger scheme of things many shops either have local versions ( like mentioned by you ebay and amazon ) , or are selling things across eu ( even things like beer  ) . 
  no , we are insulted due to ignorance . 
  i simply do n't agree with your statement - lack of knowledge and logical thinking in this case is willful ignorance , it may be reflection of education system , it may be personal , but outcome is the same . 
  but it proves your point even more . 
  why we should n't be insulted . 
  or annoyed ? 
  you paint yourself as `` the best country '' , yet simple train of logic is problematic . 
  you paint yourself as `` the richest country '' , yet clearly education about anything outside of usa is lacking . 
  in theory * maybe * he could do this - if any university social programs would be applicable to him , but i have doubts that 's the case if you study abroad . 
   edit : yes it 's just alcohol and food ... because your priorities are right , 
  in [ * this * ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/askeurope/comments/4nnso0/phone_plans_for_traveling_through_several/ ) subreddit ? 
  it 's literally second post after yours when i [ put `` sim card '' and sorted by newest ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/askeurope/search?q=sim+card&amp;sort=new&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;t=all ) .

  yes . 
  maybe . 
  can you use search and come back then ? 
  basically ... everyone ? 
  but it depends what do you mean by barbecue specifically . 
  some countries will have more `` elaborated dishes '' , in some it will be sausage , or chuck steak . 
  i would say that there is definitely much less hamburgers . 
   i have never heard anything like that here it 's definitely repeated here , on reddit , quite often . 
  basically it boils down to `` americans ca n't have [ nice things ] , because they are paying for safety of others '' , or `` it 's easy to have [ nice things ] in europe , because americans are paying for their military '' . 
  [ nice things ] = be that healtcare , free university , or some welfare programs . 
   seriously though ; to be fair , europeans do it to the usa all the time as if we are a homogeneous , monolithic people when really we are closer to what the eu would look like if it ever federalized . 
  not really . 
  you overestimate the differences within usa and underestimate differences in eu . 
  you could find some similarities , sure ( like economic differences between countries in eu and states in usa ) , but even then it 's not that simple . 
   honestly , i think this sort of thing is overplayed/overrepresented on reddit . 
  [ excuse me ? 
  * ] ( http://m.mlb.com/news/article/187351764/first-base-fort-bragg-game-unprecedented/ ) [ what about that ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3r9hh0gayak&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=1m41s ) ?

  but then why you want to travel if you just see glimpses of what cities have to offer ? 
  sometimes less is more . 
  3 , tops 4 cities for a two week trip ( especially that you will have to travel ) . 
  i would add generally tatra mountains for fourth . 
  i do n't know why so many people are recently obsessed with borderline speed traveling , where 's the pleasure ? 
  and then you end up with people that mix break and gas pedals . 
  it 's mix of things , really . 
  we do n't have as many high speed roads ( that are generally safer ) as other countries and to some degree it creates vicious circle - we are speeding on regular roads , because everyone is in hurry and there is no alternatives . 
  also - relatively old cars . 
  officially palace would deny everything , even if she would be caught running around naked with sign saying `` fuck eu ''  you know , shapeshifters and lizardpeople . 
  definitely more important here is what clegg said and general reputation of tabloids in the uk . 
  maybe , maybe not . 
  you will always have old people that do n't want change , people that want change now will become old and entrenched in the future - they will vote for status quo and own benefits ( see brexit ) . 
  and keep in mind that your two party system is not helping here either . 
  maybe easier than some other things . 
  in the bigger scheme of things this still would be a problem , considering how strict are rules now . 
  and on top of that you would need to put your whole fabric of society upside down to even start creating such union . 
   and only if someone acts upon his preference , then he is not just a pedophile ( which is not punishable ) it 's bit more complicated in usa , at least that 's how it looks from some [ comments ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/3i0qty/til_germany_has_a_program_targeted_at_pedophiles/cucd23u ) . 
  so in worst case scenario - even if you are seeking help ( and did n't do anything ) it may be turned against you, 
  at least by few people ,

  if we would go back to vistula and set our defenses on it , then we would have quite capability to do so . 
  you dont need ukraine in eu to veto russia . 
  poland is enough . 
  it ` s literally non existent . 
  for celebs , politicians and other popular people , i dont remember any . 
  but they happen sometimes , usually when there is violence connected . 
  but how is calling for less immigration of specific ethnicity a hate crime ? 
  those people dont follow dutch customs or culture , and they hardly integrate . 
  you can easily see a problem here . 
  nope . 
  we are very light on political corectens . 
  unless you beat someone from minority , its rare to see people being trialed for wrongdoings against them . 
  that part is rarely used in our country . 
  there was case when kaczy\u0144ski said that immigrants from 3rd countries are bringing disases , worms etc. 
  and while in we it was seen as very bad thing , in here it wasnt much a thing . 
  i believe every county has right to decide who it takes and who it doesnt . 
  if uk , germany or people in another countries believe it shouldnt take poles , or any other nationality/ethnicity it has right . 
  different thing is if that country has an agreement like countries in eu for open borders and it is obligated to meet that agreement . 
  i do , even more i plan to be one . 
  there are always some patological situations in every place , doesnt mean that the place overally is bad . 
  not at all . 
  i dont even see whats wrong with this question . 
  how are we fundamentalist ? 
  aye , were quite conservative but not anywhere close to fundamentalist christianity . 
  nah , germoney is quite cool , and irish , they are good lads . 
  in poland rather negative . 
  we overally dont like muslims . 
  you have a lot of bosniaks in south too , in sand\u017eak . 
  been there . 
  its most beautiful country i ever seen . 
  mountains , sea , lack of people outside big cities . 
  people are serbians , so very nice and pleasant . 
  using euro , soon joining eu i believe . 
  split with serbia in 2003 if i remember properly . 
  tl ; dr our few hundreds years of having border . 
  so where do i start ... 
  i would say its both germans and russians . 
  we have centuries of wars in our history . 
  poles in lithuania have right to be poles , yet you have problems with guaranting minority rights to them . 
  in poland minorities have donates by goverment for their media , germans have sit in parliment . 
  and you have problem with recognizing polish as a local administration language , or with two language signs , despite poles being bigest minority in lithuania . 
  their liberal stance on guns . 
  i think every one should have right to protect himself and to own tool to do that . 
  in poland can people buy guns or are they basically not allowed ? 
  - yup , they can , after getting license , or without license black-powder replicas up to 1856 , counting revolvers in . 
  what kind of steps are required for buying a gun ? 
  : - for guns ( everything above 17j ) you need license , for black-powder you need to be over 18 years old . 
  there are 3 kinds of license : - sport - you need to start in competitions and be part of shooting organizations . 
  then you apply for license . 
  they test you knowledge about guns , check your mental health and you crime record . 
  you need to have safe for storing weapons and ammunition . 
  sadly , even after being positive the last word lays in police , and they can say that you ` re not fit for it without explanation . 
  - collection - same thing as previous , but you need to be part of collection organization rather than sport one . 
  - self-defense - same thing as previous , but this time additionaly you need to show that there is some kind of danger towards you . 
  hardest one to obtain . 
  what kind of guns can be purchased ? 
  everything up to 12,7 . 
  recently there was thing in court about ability to poses automatic weapons , and he decided that in law there is nothing about not being able to poses that , so in fact you can obtain automatic weapons too . 
  how common is knowledge of using a gun ? 
  : - in older part of society , quite good . 
  mans were obligatory to go to army , and womans together with mans had some shooting in school . 
  but recently , as mandatory army for males is not anymore , and school dont teaching anything about weapons its rather poor . 
  how is the purchase or storage of ammo controlled ? 
  : - you need to do it by yourself in shop , having your license with you . 
  then its writed how many bullets you buy , and its sended to police . 
  you are obligatory to have safe , and that its where ammo is storaged . 
  from time to time you have police controls over your guns and ammo . 
  do you think your gun laws are about right , too restrictive on purchasing and owning guns , too lenient , or about right ? 
  : - there shouldnt be last word of police - if you pass everything , license should be for you . 
  and getting license should be cheaper , getting patent etc. 
  closes in price of new glock , so that is not nice . 
  can agree , have pl on the end , mostly tryharding to be top in scoreboard . 
  listening to wardruna for years , love them . 
  you should check song named krigsgaldr , you should like it c :, 
  why does its embarassing ? 
  some people are just for cash and dont give a fuck about rest . 
  they there to work , not to integrate . 
  ireland introverted ? 
  man , go to ce or ne . 
  only in ireland people started to talk with me even when i had earphones in my ears . 
  it unthinkable in poland . 
  i never had a girlfriend and cant find one : /, 
  it doesnt , creating non existent problem . 
  switzerland , czechia , norway for years have been in schengen , yet the problem didnt rise . 
  europe doesnt have any problem with gun violence . 
  and whats funny the countries with more liberal laws for guns have less problem with any crimes done with them than those with more strict . 
  you just want to ban guns because muh feling is bad , even if facts and statistics show that guns are not a problem in eu . 
  glad that my country and czechs voted against it . 
  people like him doesnt care about facts or statistic , it should be banned for him cause muh feling is bad .

  and for weapons and weapons are cool . 
  its very unlikely .

  most of the projects were infrastructure-oriented , like repairing stuff in parks , creating new parks , redesigning pedestrian crossings , installing additional city bike stations , repairs of pavements , filling in gaps in bike path networks or planting trees . 
  the others were usually community or sports-related . 
  pretty similar to what can be seen in paris .

  he used household items as weapons . 
  he threw a mallet and some pipe first , he escaped with a knife iirc . 
  he was shot in the legs because the police deemed it too dangerous to let him leave . 
  the sound was added afterwards iirc . 
  it was video only . 
  the situation was very dynamic , there was no time for backup to arrive before he would have left the scene . 
  he had mental problems . 
  should we go on and kill everyone dangerous in psychiatric hospitals ? 
  he had other weapons on him . 
  they shot at him to stop him from escaping and endangering other people . 
  the court decided that the policemen have done the right thing . 
  he had mental problems . 
  he was placed in a psychiatric facility , possibly for the rest of his life . 
  he had a knife . 
  they shot at him since a guy mad enough to attack armed policemen would likely not think twice about attacking random people .

  where can we get the complimentary beer and atheism ?

  and maybe the score distribution ? 
  edit : according to the official statistics , in poland only 23 % would pass maths with passing grade of 66 % , and somewhat less than that would pass polish . 
  given that you have to pass both , it would be a disaster . 
  no , i meant the place is irrelevant as long as you can find somebody who lets you have a wedding there and you pay the civil servant for trouble . 
  you can . 
  you can even have a civil marriage in a church ( as in without religious ceremony ) , as long as you can shell out 1k pln for the civil servant and probably double that to find a church which will agree on something like that . 
  that too . 
  most are bound by their vows of celibacy . 
  these are some conversations i 've read today on different polish forums and websites ( and i by no means support any of them ) : - marriage is defined as something between a man and a woman - gays can get married already ( to people of opposite sex ) - marriage is for procreation only - gayness is a disease and should be dealt with by any means necessary - most gays are paedophiles - in the us they let negroes marry and now they are burning their cities ( sic ) - they should be put in a camp for therapy ( no mention of pink triangles yet ) - now we should ship all faggots to the us - it 's a false flag for < insert any weird conspiracies you can think of  - now homofascism , maybe goatfuckers will want marriage , too ? 
  - faggotry is a mental disease and they should be isolated from the society and treated instead of letting faggots destroy civilization of white man ( this one had a jew in avatar ) - they will want to adopt babies next ( they already can , but not as a couple ) - gays throw their sexuality all over the place - three terrirost attacks , genocide in syria , poland is taking in refugees and now this ... - first gays , then they will legalize paedophilia - faggots ' propaganda campaign < some other gibberish  - it 's lefties way of taking over the country ( sic ) - it will force church to give gay weddings ( sic ) - it 's an effect of a long-term western propaganda actions ( no mention of the jews , this time ) - they will now walk down the streets with their penises exposed i think that the figure for poland is quite overstated . 
  pics or did n't happen . 
  it 's not related at all . 
   gay people choose to be gay . 
  that 's bollocks . 
  you ca n't change that .

  it 's similar to the fact that you ca n't change whether you are left or right-handed at a whim .

  the last guy who tried that got 1.5 year prison sentence suspended over a period of 3 years and a fine of 8k pln .

  if they are real professionals , they will get their clientele . 
  i am just fed up with seeing another professional group that is rioting so that they can get special privileges paid by my taxes .

  in my view giving any benefits to any people impair them and make them dependent . 
  and they become a perfect leftist 's electorate . 
  gulf countries know what they 're doing by not taking the so-called refugees to their countries , even if they share the same religion and culture . 
  i think the main reason why eu ( = germany ) wants to accept so many newcomers is demography . 
  europe with its fertility rate is literally dying and desperately in need of immigrants to keep the number of inhabitants at least unchanged . 
  funny enough , demography is the biggest problem in germany and its them that are the biggest supporters of current immigration policy . 
  do n't listen to donald tusk . 
  total liar and angela merkel 's servant . 
  this is why he obtained a position in eu administration when his party in poland was collapsing . 
  no , i 'm not . 
  for example , poles in general do not live in ghettos , but i know some of them living in the uk for 10 years ( since poland joined the eu ) and they can not say more than ` ok ' in english , because they speak in their native tongue with their polish neighbors , do shopping in polish shops etc. 
  the only reason why such neighborhoods are not called ghettos is the fact they are small and most of their members have normal jobs instead of living on benefits and committing crimes . 
  people have a natural tendency to stay within their comfort zone , so if they can choose between living with people that speak the same language and have the same culture they choose to do so . 
  the fact that they can stay in europe should be enough for them . 
  i am an economic immigrant myself and i never demanded anything from the country i have moved to , just rolled up my sleeves and started working and learning the language ( paid by myself , sic ! ), 
  after moving out of tents they will be given social housing ( at the expense of taxpayers of course ) and create new ghettos , because it is much easier to stay in a ghetto , take benefits and preach shariah law rather than roll up your sleeves and start working like a normal citizen . 
   yea , the european commission is not a credible source . 
  yes , i confirm your view . 
   the other 27 ministers in each of the council 's rounds , the commissioners , the administrators , the european parliament how are they elected ? 
  i do not remember having a possibility to do so . 
   the ecj , the ecb ( which has for the past years acted in direct conflict with the german government 's and the german central bank 's wishes ) the ecb is constantly trying to keep bankrupt countries afloat by buying their worthless bonds . 
  this triggers two major effects : - bankrupt countries repay their debts ( principal plus very nice interest ) to banks ( mainly german and french ) - the money used to buy bonds of those bankrupt countries are created out of thin air , thus increasing the supply of money and making euro weaker . 
  this benefits exporters and germany is the biggest one in the eurozone . 
  why should i provide you with good sources while yours are not credible ? 
  driving roads in poland is not for free , you forgot about this too . 
  not directly , to make people like you believe everything is fine . 
  and i do not want to hear such abusing words , it tells a lot about your intellectual level . 
  the other 50 % had their chance but they did n't take it , their loss, 
  if you are not trolling you do not know how is pulling the strings in the eu . 
  89 % of the money sent to poland as part of eu structural policy returns to german firms in form of cross-border orders . 
  and you forgot that poland not only receives the money , but also pay taxes and has to abide the eu laws that paralyze its economy . 
   germany is being investigated for north stream 2 's possible negative impact on eu energy security , for example . 
  and who has the decisive power whether it is negative for the eu energy security ? 
  germany . 
  long life our european democracy !, 
  the end justifies the means , son . 
  it 's also worth to add that the owner of polish version of newsweek is ringier axel springer polska , part of ringier axel springer media ag , one of the biggest german media company . 
  * your arguments are based on hipocrisy of `` commie hunt '' or plagiarised book with no research * none of these , i 'm sorry . 
  and again , i do not accuse you of being x or y , but if you do n't see the difference between po and pis , then we have nothing to discuss anymore . 
  where does the information about plagiarism come from ? 
  who is the chief editor there ? 
  that group is quite big in poland and will exist as long as po receives public money . 
  i am not accusing , but considering it as one of the possibilities . 
  i would n't do so if i knew that paid trolls do n't exist there . 
  but it 's even more likely that you 're one of hundreds of thousands of public administration workers afraid of losing job . 
  or some of your close family is . 
  if you believe the book is purely fictional , then you probably also believe that current protests are to protect the democracy in poland and germans are truly concerned about our well-being and not their peculiar interests . 
  i assume pis is left-wing when it comes to their approach to the economy , but right-wing when it comes to the worldview . 
  not extreme right as you mentioned , but conservative . 
  sadly , views that were called conservative in the past now are called ` extreme right ' . 
  it says a lot about who is setting the trends now . 
  and it seems that most of your compatriots are ` extreme right ' , probably ` racist ' and ` homophobic ' . 
  lech walesa was a soviet agent and collaborator ( nickname bolek ) , poles owe nothing to him . 
  he should be tried and sentenced for that . 
  briefly speaking , we wo n't reach any consensus if your source is newsweek , der spiegel , le soir or le monde . 
  you either have an interest in maintaining the previous status quo or you are one of those that are paid to spread anti-pis propaganda on the internet . 
  and again , i do not support pis because of their view on the economy , but i clearly notice that they want to make poland finally sovereign . 
  * check out / r/polska to see how true the story likely is ( hint : the author plagiarized chandler , mac lean and larsson , did n't bother to use any bibliography ) . 
  * we are not discussing technical aspects of the book - i do n't care whether it was nicely written or a plagiarism of another book , but i am interested in facts that were presented there . 
  for some reason none of the names mentioned in the book did sue sumlinski for spreading false information about them . 
  regarding pis , i believe there are some black sheeps there ( e.g. 
  the ones you mentioned ) , but the overall picture of this party and their actions look way better than any previous one . 
  and with all due respect to reddit , it is not the best source of information since it is largely occupied but left-wing thinkers that are ready to protect their status quo in poland at any cost ( as long as it 's not them bearing it ) . 
  check biographies of politicians that are members of aws , uw , sld and po ( do n't be afraid to mention those names in your posts ) . 
  interestingly enough , former aws/uw members moved to sld/po when the former to parties were over . 
  if you have troubles finding this information , i recommend you a fresh bestseller , `` niebezpieczne zwiazki bronislawa komorowskiego '' by wojciech sumlinski -- this should give you plenty of information about linkages between the most prominent people from all former governments i have mentioned , including po . 
  also , please read the story of litigation between the author of this book and former president , komorowski ( mentioned in the title of the book ) and check who won . 
  i am not sure if the discussion with you is worthwhile since you mention with a capital letter all countries but poland ... 
  same with conservatists - you should start the sentence with a capital letter too , no matter how much you dislike the conservatists . 
  when it comes to the capital - yes , it has a nationality and it is very often a tool of political pressure on countries and i would say that examples you mentioned are either exceptions or an examples of losing the ability to protect countries ' national interest . 
  plus , some industries are more strategic than others and your examples are not considered to be strategic . 
  why do you think about communists as the ones that nationalize private entities ? 
  to avoid misunderstandings in the discussion , let 's call all aws , uw , sld , po post-communists . 
  and yes , they privatized lots of formerly public firms - for the fraction of their fair value . 
  it 's one of the biggest crimes they commited during their rules . 
  contrary to protesters from kod , i am not calling for the government dismissal right after the elections . 
  we will know them by their fruits . 
  the previous government proved that they are communists and should never be elected again . 
  call us racists , but it 's not us having troubles with terrorism and our women can wear whatever they want without being called bitc * es in city centers , our kids are not bullied at school by juvenile arab gangs and we do not have to pay for the benefits of people that prefer to do nothing than working for non-muslims . 
  good luck with all of it , tolerant europe !, 
  i do n't live in poland since 2011 . 
  i like the country , still visit it very often , but gloomy career prospects made me leave the country during my studies . 
  i disagree with all socialist governments and the current one is no different in that matter , but at least it seems to be less corrupted and less dependent on german and russian paymasters . 
  and it 's the fist government that is not led by ex-communists , which is a huge change - that 's why you see numerous groups of interests protesting now ( supported by the german media ) . 
  i love the example of germany . 
  they opened their borders very late for poles that wanted to migrate there to work and they were always reluctant to do so . 
  and now they invite hundreds of thousands of young men that are not skilled in any profession , do not want to learn professional skills and have no intention to integrate with local community . 
  german leaders and their voters are real masters of logic and consistence !, 
  taking in refugees that are not influenced by totalitarian islam makes sense since they are ( and they will be ) struggling with labor shortage , but the idea of welcoming muslim men in their 20s and 30s to countries where unemployment is already very high (  10 % ) is a pure absurd . 
  and it 's the responsibility of socialist governments that are trying to satisfy their voters and try to raise another unemployed generation of socialist 's voters that is dependent on public money . 
  pis has been elected in a democratic election , so if you feel persecuted you can move to another country . 
  i remember very well that the same solution was given to po opponents during the last 8 years . 
  why do some people ( including the mayor of cologne ) say that those attacks have nothing in common with the current wave of illegal immigrants ? 
  if i 'm not mistaken , one year ago there was a normal new year 's eve party and normal carnival in cologne .

  drawing borders basing on local population rather than historical claims was a pretty common occurrence in post ww1 europe . 
   facts and statistics can interpreted , given different agenda , yours that poles were morally good , but never bad . 
  i criticize polish actions in the interwar period quite often , especially the polish-soviet peace treaty of 1921 , which betrayed belarusian and ukrainian allies of poland , and resulted in a half-assed shape of poland that went against both nationalist idea of dmowski , and federalist idea of pi\u0142sudski . 
  subsequently , the policy of the polish state towards the minorities resulting from it also left much to be desired . 
  i 'm quite ambiguous about the zaolzie conflict with czechoslovakia - on one hand , they were total dicks agressively moving the border well into the ethnic polish territory in 1919 , on the other hand moving the border back to where it was in 1919 * just a few days after the munich conference * was a big mistake . 
  the conflict over wilno perhaps was n't handled in the nicest way it could be , but compared to those dark cards of the interwar polish history , from a moral standpoint it certainly is n't something we should be ashamed about either . 
   what makes you think that lithuanians will prioritize poland over lithuania 's independence ? 
  what makes you think that poles would priotize lithuanian nationalist-imperialist ambitions , over the right of self determination of local polish majority population ? 
   that 's what your own imagination is thinking . 
  i wish that was only my imagination but , alas , that 's what official line of republic of lithuania appears to be , and what lithuanians repeat * ad infinitum * on the internet . 
   was not a gift , we already had control of the city before you occupied it , you forgetting \u017deligowski revolt ? 
  typical lithuanian argument , conveniently ignoring that poland already had a control of the city * before * \u017beligowski 's revolt pretty much since we regained independence in winter of 1918/1919 ( with interlude of bolshevik control between january and april 1919 ) , till the soviet takeover in june 1920 . 
   poles revolting against poles , does n't sound right , does it ? 
  more like poles revolting against an unwanted foreign government , which took control of their home city 2 months earlier after a shady deal with soviets who took it from the polish government in the first place . 
   says pole , who tries to justify ukrainian , belarusian land grab . 
  i actually do n't really care that much about almost uninhabited swamps of polesie , or mostly ukrainian volhynia , as there were virtually worthless once it was apparent that mi\u0119dzymorze / federation wo n't come to fruition ( though it was only apparent after the disastrous riga peace treaty where our belarusian and ukrainian allies were betrayed , in my opinion we should have actually pushed further to help them create their own states , as pi\u0142sudski originally envisioned but alas dmowski 's nationalists were against it ad screwed it up ) . 
  the only moral ambivalence i feel about it is that it * did * save people living there from soviet totalitarianism - though in such case , the polish government definitely should have given a great deal of local autonomy to polesie , volhynia and stanis\u0142aw\u00f3 voivodships - another great mistake interwar poland did . 
  anyhow , the only thing i justify are polish control of the polish-majority area in the northeast of the country , and the polish control of the historically polish ( a part of kingdom of poland since 1340 ) , ethnically mixed in proportions ranging from 40-60 to 50-50 in the southeast of the country . 
   yeah right , definitely not fuelled and blinded by ultra nationalistic tendencies . 
  til that hard facts and statistics are `` ultranationalistic tendencies '' . 
   did you make up this `` meme '' ? 
  because we do n't say such things . 
  poland forever lost two out of four principal centers of polish culture during the ww2 , and the justification given in those two cases were the exact opposite of each other . 
  if the argumentation of poland 's opponents was internally consistent , we would at least retain one of them - that 's the point of this meme . 
   we were n't soviet co-belligerents what are you talking about ? 
  you were n't ? 
  you surely seemed like ones from the polish perspective , considering the provisions of soviet-lithuanian treaty of summer 1920 . 
  giving soviets military access when their offensive against poland continued ? 
  or most importantly , taking as a gift a portion of territory soviets * just * took from poland ? 
   do n't understand what is your obsession with lithuanians in trying to portray them evil it stems from the lithuanian obsession in trying to portray poles as evil , and the ridiculous mental gymnastics they use to justify their blatant landgrab of ethnic polish teritory wile\u0144szczyzna was in the first half of the 20th century . 
  very infuriating for someone having enough historical knowledge to see through their bullshit . 
  seeing how attempts to forcefully implement this philosophy in the real world resulted in unprecedented amounts of misery , suffering and despair , i 'm actually quite sure that it can not . 
   what have you achieved an [ annualized gdp growth rate since the communism ended ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9f/gdp_growth_per_capita_%28annualized%29.png ) comparable to china in the same period , and better than ireland , south korea or hong kong . 
  and it only shows how * much * of a disaster communism was , if even with all that unprecedented economic growth during the last 25 years , right now we are still at best halfway through to catching up . 
  for more detail , see the table at the end of [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_gdp_growth_1980%e2%80%932010#references ) article . 
  it `` went wrong '' , because it 's a shit and disgusting ideology . 
   its lithuanian land and city . 
  it was never yours to begin with . 
  [ i like how the main two arguments criticizing the eastern borders of interwar poland are internally contradictory . 
  ] ( http://i.imgur.com/pigpzpq.png )  poland circa 1920 just acted like a kindergarten bully poland circa 1920 was [ fighting for its survival against soviet russia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_warsaw_ ( 1920 \\ ) ) , so it should n't come as a surprise that later that year it did n't have a soft spot for soviet russia 's co-belligerents such as the republic of lithuania , who provided military access and logistic help to soviet troops during their invasion of poland , for which they were gifted the ethnically polish wilno area soviets took from the republic of poland one month earlier . 
  polish census 2002 , polish census 2011 . 
  [ link to the latter ] ( http://stat.gov.pl/download/gfx/portalinformacyjny/pl/defaultaktualnosci/5670/22/1/1/struktura_narodowo-etniczna.pdf ) p. 104 and further the absolute numbers are a bit smaller than i remembered , but the proportion - that most orthodox polish citizens also declare polish ethnicity , remains . 
  what ? 
  in modern poland there are around 500 thousand orthodox polish citizens , out of which over 300 thousand are orthodox poles , 150 thousand are ukrainians and 50 thousand belarusians, 
   poles either in 1910 , however for 1900 there are no poles according to the data . 
  did n't hungarian censuses classify all slavs in that area as `` slovaks '' ? 
   next up , orawa or \u00c1rva was never a part of poland , the loan lasted for over * 350 years * . 
  at some point poland certainly realized that hungary is never going to pay the loan back . 
   either way , they were n't lithuanians , but poles , not matter what they considered themselves . 
  wilno confirmed to be majority polish in the interwar period by a radical lithuanian nationalist , i 'm screencaping this for further discussions . 
   next thing we 'll be hearing is that vilnius was majority polish ? 
  lol ... wilno * was * majority polish according to 1916 german census , so unless you are suggesting that germans were in on the great polish conspiracy , better get used to hearing about it . 
  it was n't a part of lithuania during the interwar period , and rightfuly so . 
  we took wilno from the german ober-ost command in january 1919 , then bolsheviks took it later the same month , then poland retook it from bolsheviks in april 1919 , then bolsheviks retook it from poland in june 1920 , then bolsheviks gave it to lithuania to secure their friendly neutrality in polish-bolshevik war , and then polish troops retook ithis polish-majority city for the * third * time in two years , this time for a little longer . 
  so yeah , you could say we `` stole '' it in october 1920 but at least also acknowledge that lithuania stole it from us three months earlier . 
  before the ww1 many of them really were neighter slovaks nor poles , and only after the polish-czechoslovak border was set , their national identity truly crystalized to whichever country they ended up in . 
  spisz and orawa , which is the area in question , was a part of poland between 1412 , and 1769 , so it 's not that unreasonable that 20-30 % of slavic highlanders living there might have identified more with poles than slovaks in * 1900 * . 
  \\  me \\  ultranationalist lol . 
  i 'm just pointing out the blatant lies spouted by lithuanian ultranationalists whenever i see them . 
  and tarnopol voivodship had 49 % poles ( compared to 46 % ukrainians ) , wilno voivodship had 60 % poles ( compared to 22 % belarusians and 5 % lithuanians ) , while nowogr\u00f3dek voivodship had 54 % poles ( compared to 38 % belarusians ) - yet all three voivodships were also annexed by ussr . 
   those areas were inhabited by almost exclusively belarusians and ukrainians yeah , those areas were inhabited by them `` almost exclusively '' to such extent , that poles had a * plurality * on them , and numbering over 5 million people and 38 % of its total population , were the single largest ethnic group there . 
  [ and that was n't only because they were spread out over the entire territory , they actually formed local majorities in significant partbof territory annexed by ussr , most notably almost the entire northeast including wilno and grodno areas . 
  ] ( http://s24.postimg.org/u4d92sedh/polacy_na_kresach.png ) for more detail , a map showing the [ most numerous language group by county ] ( http://s3.postimg.org/j5gzlscdv/polacy_kresy_d.png ) other maps for reference : [ population by ethnicity in interwar poland ] ( https://m.imgur.com/j0pr6nf?r ) [ percentage of polish population by county ] ( http://s3.postimg.org/q7627ydir/the_poles_map.png ), 
  well , they * do * seem pretty happy about the land they got at least . 
   whereas nazis were out to wipe out people for arbitrary reasons . 
  as opposed to soviets , who for a change were out to wipe out people for arbitrary reasons . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polish_operation_of_the_nkvd https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polish_genocide_in_the_soviet_union, 
   when you 're dealing with an objective evil like the nazis . 
  or an objective evil like the soviets , who set out to exterminate people based on their flawed theories like communism . 
   but i think he looks much more impressive with such hair . 
  [ in fact , he * did * have such hair once ] ( https://s27.postimg.org/brlqkf4j7/z12767827_q_donald-_tusk-.jpg ) . 
   but it was n't created for that purpose what a cheap talk . 
  the * main * purpose behind eec ( which did n't become the eu until 1992 ) was economic cooperation and development as well as customs union and free trade , not to `` stop wars '' either . 
  though the latter was certainly used as a talking point to help sell the former . 
   since there has n't been any major war between eu countries since it was formed , it has done a pretty good job indeed , nato , eec , european space agency , european broadcasting union , the champions league and the microwave oven have all done a pretty good job since there were no wars in central europe since they were created !, 
  though we should n't forget about probably even more important factor , which is the existence of nuclear weapons , and the doctrine of mutually assured destruction resulting from that fact . 
  nato was n't ? 
  if anything , the danger of soviet agression during the cold war , and the nato cooperation that enused from it , did much more for the `` lack of war '' between european countries , than economic organizations such as efta , eec ( and its successor eu ) or perhaps ecsc did . 
  oh dear , here we have a prime example of `` correlation implying causation '' fallacy . 
  let 's have some similar , and equally as true sentences : * number of wars in central europe before nato : many . 
  * number of wars in central europe since nato : none . 
  or perhaps * number of wars in central europe before uefa : many . 
  * number of wars in central europe since uefa : none . 
  or maybe * number of wars in central europe before techno : many . 
  * number of wars in central europe since techno : none . 
  out of [ 16 voivodships of interwar poland , poles were n't a majority or plularity only in three ( volhynia , stanis\u0142aw\u00f3w and polesie ) ] ( http://polska1918-89.pl/photos/demografia-w-ii-rp,2149.jpg ) , and even there they made up about 20 % of population , which is an order of magnitude higher than the lithuanian proportion of population on the territory of interwar poland claimed by republic of lithuania . 
  also , even that borders were considered too extensive by polish * nationalists * . 
  during the peace talks with soviets in 1921 in riga , the soviet delegation actually offered poland a border about a 100 kilometers further east , but ( much to the dismay of pi\u0142sudski ) * nationalists * in polish delegation declined , argumenting that there are too much ukrainians/belarusians , and not enough poles there . 
  polish nationalists in the interwar period ( dmowski 's party ) were supporters of polish borders encompassing territory strictly with polish majority or plurality , it were federalists ( pi\u0142sudski 's party ) who wanted to rebuild poland in a way resembling the commonwealth , at least in pre-1772 borders , and as a ( con ) federation of various nations inhabiting that territory , that would be a strong counterweight to both russia and germany . 
  in the end , neighter conception was fully realized , the end result was something in between - an outcome about which both dmowski , and pi\u0142sudski were n't happy in the slightest . 
   i consider myself lithuanian nationalist , but in no way i would ever want those lands back , those lands have nothing left of lithuanian in them any more and would be more of a problem than extension to our nation state . 
  the same was the case for wilno area in the interwar period , yet radical lithuanian nationalists back then did n't seem to care about that in the slightest . 
  well , we would still end up almost 1/4 bigger than we are right now if at the same time we also got back all the land soviets took from us in 1939/1944 . 
   doesnt make sense to post photos of johannesburg or san paulo here . 
  of course it does n't , as neither south africa , nor brazil have any territory in europe . 
  france on the other hand , as it was already established in this thread , has integral parts of its territory * outside * of europe - be it south america , africa or perhaps even oceania . 
  in fact , we even happen to post under a photo of one of those * non-european * parts of its territory . 
   they have absolutely full voting power , they control all votes , while the president ( who can veto such things ) is also pis ... there is no actual democracy here anymore . 
  i do n't really follow you here . 
  is `` actual democracy '' somehow supposed to be about the ruling party not having enough votes to pass new bills , and president ( mandatory from a different party than the government ) having to veto everything ?

  not real communism !, 
  :d was waiting when that pops out, 
  fascist this , fascist that , i get it , you like the word , but saying ussr was fascist not communist makes you really a special case of fun, 
  let 's be serious ... 
  my sides :d lot of commiescums in this thread, 
  i 'm seriously hoping you are the one that do n't know shit about history , because there are only 3 options for someone defending communism . 
  no knowledge , insanity , or evilness . 
  sometimes it 's all three , and you have antifa trash as a result . 
  you are right . 
  it 's the communism that makes all communists scum . 
  the question is : is it the vile ideology that makes people scums or maybe a person is a scum in the first place and that makes this induvidual to like a vile idealogy . 
  kinda like chicken or the egg dilemma . 
  a basic google search for molotov-ribbentrop pact gives 1 , ultimate example how both nazis and communists were scums . 
  ofc at the same time , hitler did hate communists and wanted to exterminate them , but what 's it got to do with anything ? 
  i already said i 'm not for killing them , just isolating them , and your argument `` it always starts like that and leads to genocide '' simply is n't true . 
  i know about ww2 quite a lot actually . 
  like nazis and communists were best buddies when they both started that war . 
  thieves coming back to power vs. some infected trees . 
  what could be more important ... tough choice . 
  no alternatives, 
  if a political idea is an existential threat it should be contained . 
  we quarantine people with infectious diseases and i see no difference between communism and a plague . 
  in fact there are some good bacterias , there are no good communists . 
  besides , `` that 's how it always starts '' argument ... please . 
  you said it yourself `` thousands of people in america were unfairly prosecuted and imprisoned for being communists '' , did something started there ? 
  deathcamps in america ? 
  i do n't count deathcamps as prisons . 
  never said communists should be killed , just separated from the society . 
  how is imprisoning a communist unfair ? 
  it 's where they belong . 
  even with premature elections , they would still just win them again, 
  reminded me of [ adolf niggler ] ( http://i.imgur.com/mnxywtn.png ) , supposedly a nationalist from finland . 
  i 'm still not sure if this guy is real tho . 
  do n't know why , but german and belgian flags look scary . 
  besides , why are every country named in english . . and there is deutschland ? 
  i know i should have asked previous op like 2 days ago but still ... 
  op said that people in poland are being arrested for blasphemy . 
  arrested , and that never happened . 
  there were a few trials , but no one , ever , was handcuffed , put to jail , not to mention about sentenced for prison, 
  a couple of months ago , exactly , trully a crusade of our times . 
  yet i can agree with you , such incidents propably occur more often in poland than in sweden , in which people are more often attacked for having `` lighter skin '' than in poland  . 
  he specifically mentioned arrests for blasphemy and `` censorship by the church '' whatever that is , which are lies . 
  support for lgbt rights is low in poland , that 's true , but there is no more violence than in other european countries , and even so , it 's not supported by the government . 
  and what anti russian and middleeastern sentiments got to do with democracy or freedom ? 
  do people really do n't understand what `` arrest '' mean ? 
  yes i know that there was this case , but he was not arrested . 
  for the love of god people ... 
  yet no one was ever arrested . 
  true about drinking , lies about everything else .

  poles would make a great astronauts for a mars mission .

  for poles you can just dehydrate potatoes , bread , pack it with a few cans of beer and you 're done .

   poles with historically significant german influence ( silesians ) . 
  silesians you think about are in upper silesia , province in question is located a lower silesia , with little to no * german influence * ( [ related read ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polish_population_transfers_%281944%e2%80%9346%29 ) ) .

  interesting . 
  in poland most of the people having guns are either hunters or own them for self-defence . 
  '' * getting rid of the fucking boars * '' is not a valid reason to get a gun permit - if you want to do that call to the [ state forests ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/state_forests_%28poland%29 ) , they 'll send someone in to decide whether to shoot the animal or attempt relocating ( usually it 's * shoot * , but at least you 'll have professional doing it with a single shot instead of some amateur * doing his best * ) .

  you 're not missing anything , guys . 
  not to mention that v4 is still pretty much meaningless , even despite of attempts from new polish government to resurrect it 's dead body . 
  still nothing useful is being done through v4 , it might change , but there 's only as much as one can do . 
  i ca n't and i do n't . 
  as i said - what is needed is an assist and expansion . 
  we very much agree here . 
  i just do n't think that giving up your border control would achieve the goal . 
  if eu member states want to - they can extend frontex competences and rise it in a numbers - something that in my opinion would be far less intrusive than what hungary expects from greece . 
  though as far as i 'm aware there 's quite a lot of [ opposition to that , even in hungary ] ( https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2015/12/17/eupl-d17.html ) :  `` the italian interior ministry is very unhappy about having outsiders on italy 's borders , '' a senior diplomat in brussels told the british guardian newspaper . 
  `` there are too many sovereign sensitivities . ''   protests from warsaw and budapest were even more explicit . 
  polish foreign minister witold waszcykowski rejected the commission 's plans on the radio station rmf , saying they would create an organisation that could arbitrarily make decisions about member states without giving them any voice in the process . 
  the border troops have no democratic legitimacy , he insisted . 
  foreign minister peter szijjarto made similar complaints and insisted that border control must remain a component of national sovereignty . 
  so ... border control must remain a component of hungarian national sovereignty but not greek ? 
  if my [ longer explenation ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/45vqo7/visegrad_group_opposes_germanys_refugee_policy/d00kdv7?context=3 ) did not cut it , than i hope that by now you see that they do n't have as good intentions as you , and few other posters around here , try to picture . 
   included persuading greece to hand over the defence of its frontier to the remaining 27 member states volunteer troops patrolling the union 's outer border oh ... no wonder everyone voted against it . 
  what 's needed is an assist and expansion , not completely giving up current border control to the eu volunteer force , even organizing that would take months , not to mention little to no real benefits it could bring . 
  beautiful fortress . 
  looks really great .

  few facts : * macedonia have been building a border fence on it 's own [ for a while now ] ( http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/european-refugee-crisis-macedonia-builds-10-foot-high-razor-topped-fence-along-greek-border-1537078 ) ( [ 2 ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-34954858 ) ) * poland has been [ helping ] ( http://www.defence24.pl/266575,polski-smiglowiec-wspiera-ochrone-granicy-wegier-ponad-300-tys-imigrantow ) to secure eu borders since late 2015 , before the new government stepped in . 
  * degree of support to be provided by v4 is unknown and unlikely to be significant - most likely it 'll be populist move used for domestic politics '' * how good our government is comparing to the bad , hopeless western europe * '' - as pointed out above , macedonia already did most of the work . 
  * '' * she was forcing others to pay for it * '' - it was n't merkel , but rather majority of the eu member states . 
  i know it 's not comfortable for a current political agenda of a right-wing parties across the eu , but it 's not just merkel that wants redistribution of immigrants or financial support for the regions affected by crisis . 
  * '' * right-wing hungarian prime minister viktor orban urged macedonia and greece to follow his example and fence off their borders against refugees . 
  * '' - greece has a huge problem with islands , most notably lesbos , which is [ here ] ( https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/lesbos,+greece/@38.8727244,25.3580988,7z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x14af8516edc7f755:0x8627d601b32663e7 ) . 
  building fence * around an island * is a nonsense , not to mention that greek coastline is roughly 14 000 km , [ lesbos ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lesbos ) coastline alone is 320 km , comparing to 175 km [ fence ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hungarian_border_barrier ) build by hungary . 
  * '' * unlike macedonia , greece was not invited to the visegerad meeting in prague . 
  athens fears that macedonia might close its border soon , leaving thousands of refugees in greece . 
  * '' - problems of greece are absent from political discussion in these four countries because they do n't serve their political agenda . 
  if they 'd actually want to help solving migrant crisis - greece should be near the very top of their priorities . 
  we blob like crazy , but then everything goes down to shit , mostly due to our own fault , though shitty spawn point can be blamed too . 
  this '' * beating shit out of spaniards * '' is not a joke , i see ... look at the number of people killed ... jeez , you guys went full on berserker . 
  danzig is a polish city - [ gda\u0144sk ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gda%c5%84sk ) . 
  as for kalingrad , well , it 's basically a military base , with rather poor population , though it 's still one of the best-performing regions in russia economy-wise . 
  poland has a special non-visa agreement for kaliningrad oblast , and they have a special economic zones there , boosting commerce . 
  local population is rather friendly and due to constant contacts with the eu citizens - they tend to be less pro-putin 's - russia than other regions are ( [ apperently ] ( http://www.targetmap.com/viewer.aspx?reportid=14351 ) in 2012 presidential elections putin got only 52 % there , the lowest result of all regions in russia ) . 
  military-wise they have a nukes there * constantly aimed at poland * , which they remind us about every time they do n't like what nato is doing ( they say that they deployed [ iskanders ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/9k720_iskander ) with nukes aimed at poland - it 's so common that `` iskander '' is a name of a missile that pretty much every pole knows ) . 
  other mean of annoying poles with kaliningrad is by blocking pass through the [ vistula spit ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vistula_spit ) - poland does n't have one , the only available is in russia . 
  also back in '90s kaliningrad used to be a source of constant border infringement incidents , including attack helicopters flying dozens of kilometres into polish airspace , even after we joined nato . 
  they calmed down when we bought f-16s . 
  and luckily enough - it 's such a small territory , that needed be - we can level it to the ground with artillery ( which is something our military [ reminded ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1zgxcr/poland_conducts_military_exercises_near_ukrainian/ ) them during the war in ukraine ) . 
  currently they 're building a [ nuclear powerplant ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kaliningrad_nuclear_power_plant ) there , fly planes back and forth between petersburg and kaliningrad , occasionally some submarines or warships . 
  in general it 's a source of constant annoyance . 
  as for having polish or german influence - not really . 
  does n't * feel * so . 
  some of the buildings have german architecture , but other than that - it feels like russia . 
  at least that 's my opinion , others might disagree . 
   soviet occupaion - well bulgaria , gdr , even mongolia were also difference is that soviet occupation is the only thing we have in common with mongols ( well , other than some [ mongol invasions ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/template:campaignbox_mongol_invasion_of_poland ) ) , on the other hand - it 's one of many things that we share with hungarians . 
   you don \u00b4 t share borders , cause you stand on our way , slovakia !, 
   read the article i linked about a [ first vienna award ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/first_vienna_award ) - one of the root causes behind it was that poland and hungary wanted to restore a common border . 
   for you - poland i think closer should be belarus , ukraine - for historical resons - their western areas were poland - even polish minorities - kresy , lithuania also - but linguistic similarities are logically not present here , but wilno was polish city for centuries ... i mean each of this countries based on those aspects i mentioned should be far closer than hungary if you want to say this is our , , brother nation , , yes , i even have a distant family in ukraine ( [ damn russians ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/recovered_territories ) ) , but none the less - noone really views them as a brother-nation in poland . 
  linguistically we 're more similar to czechs and slovaks - your languages i can understand , at least to a degree . 
  in terms of shared history obviously lithuania would be the closest , but they do n't like us , and ... well ... are too small to matter . 
  whatever relations existed in a past were mostly severed somewhere after [ partitioning of poland ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/partitions_of_poland ) . 
  cultural similarity - well , that we share with pretty much everyone with whom we shared border over the history , i have n't been to belarus and russia , but other than that - i have n't noticed that any neighbor would be more similar to us than other ; sure , we 're less similar to germans ( the further away from the border the less similar they are ) , and even less so with turkey ( almost always at war ) or sweden ( rival empire , [ deluge ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/deluge_%28history%29 ) , again : almost no period of friendly relations ) , but that 's about it . 
   if you and hungarians see each other as brother nations o.k , if you do recognize that , than it should pretty much end the discussion , should n't it ? 
  cause that 's what counts most , imho, 
   no - only limited under some monarchs looong time ago . 
  well , there 's [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/first_vienna_award ) , and a years of soviet occupation , obviously . 
  that 's very recent history . 
  plus : apparently our new government wants to make a * budapest in warsaw * , so there 's that too ... kind of a new era in our special relationship ... this time french-kissing among right-wingers . 
   but their relationship lacks some aspects from mentioned czech/slovakia there are very very few nations that have the aspects you two share . 
  it 's quite amazing just how close your nations are , it 's kind of like ... you know how bacteria splits in two to reproduce ? 
  it 's almost the same , only somehow sloviakia ended up being smaller , 
  hole see ? 
  oh , sure , still i added a little bit of detail in , 
  to poland it 's hungary . 
  there 's even a related proverb - [ pole and hungarian cousins be ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pole_and_hungarian_cousins_be ) .

  amusing how you complain about all previous governments while a current one has some of the most socialist polices since the death of communism . 
   we are extremly poor in comparison to wealth west , north and south of europe no , we 're not * extremely * poor . 
  go abroad one day , or something ? 
  visit ukraine , or kosovo ? 
  or better yet : visit some of the african countries , away from tourist routes .

  they didnt let me talk to women . 
  over all very rasist stuff . 
  city was dirty with tons of random garbage on street . 
  i never felt so afraid going alone during nights . 
  for me it was cultural shock . 
  i never expected england to be like this . 
  unfortunately we do n't have pretty cities due to our tragic history . 
  and warsaw our capital is very ugly . 
  that lithuania is basically our rebellious province . 
  that wilno is one of most beautifull polish cities alongside with lw\u00f3w . 
  also lithuania is our homeland after mickiewicz in `` pan tadeusz '' . 
  we gave you culture , nobility , great slavic language etc. 
  and so on . 
  nazi were aliens form other galaxy or mostly germans ? 
  as far as i know in poland fan base of any league you mentioned above can be counted on fingers of your left hand . 
  and in general public media mention some events from those sports once , twice a year . 
  rather bad in both fields . 
  and no sign of future improvement .

  finaly some one will have to pay it back . 
  the true tragedy is that it wont be those who made that decision . 
  last major correction of borders has happend after wwii . 
  we lost almost 80.000,00 km ^ 2 ( about the size of czechia ) . 
  also whole country moved from east to west few hundreds kilometers . 
  i do n't think there are any active disputes regarding those lands , but we still feel kinda nostalgic about vilnus , lviv or brest ( my familly comes from there ) as these cities were major polish cultural , science and political centers . 
  even our greatest epos starts with words : `` lithuania my fatherland ... '', 
  glad no one mentioned poland , because it would be awkward ... 
   a lot of countries not located in europe are mentally much close to europe than russia that 's the point .

  not really . 
  most of them left in 1945 and went west to todays poland . 
  all english speaking people that left ireland when it became independent state are probably british , tho . 
  if you consider them to be lithuanian , then all german speaking population of ` recovered territories ' were polish . 
  i 'm not claiming that we should get wilno or the germans should get breslau . 
  but i 'm not also claiming that wroc\u0142aw was under german occupation 1918-1939 . 
  well , ka\u0142 means something different in polish :d, 
  it 's not anymore . 
  but it was . 
  it took you 70 years of depolonization programs to make it ethnically lithuanian . 
  according to german 1916 census , poles were 55 % , jews 40 % , lithuanians 2 % .

  there was a significant polish minority just before ww2 . 
  even earlier ( back when this kind of architecture was built ) , poles could have even compromised majority of population . 
  you should n't evaluate comments about complex history of a region you apparently know nothing about . 
  tbh , it is for me . 
  yeah , because poles suddenly moved in from space in 1945 . 
  there 's a difference between spending money on army and actually using that army . 
  if it was n't for russia , they would be swedes today . 
  damn , i better start learning ukrainian so i 'm not left out . 
  poland also included a bunch of belarus and ukraine . 
  ethnic poland was much richer . 
  some sources claim , that difference between east and west of poland at that time was 1st vs 3rd world . 
  people in the west installed telephones and bought first cars while the east was living in dugouts .

  if you 're good you can get about 60k-80k ( if you 're not willing to work remotely ) in top5 cities ( it may be possible in others too ) . 
  and that income actually makes you a prince . 
  oh , now i see, 
  good luck with putting india on the map . 
  i mean ethnicity of soldiers , not peoples of territories of that political enitity .

  my mom persisted on the issue though . 
  i 'm not a catholic , so i ca n't say how they looked like . 
  i heard that they were kind of free , but it really depends on a teacher . 
  in my high school there was a conventual , who looked very seriously , never smiled ( well , priests are usually those `` cool teachers '' afaik ) and people said he was very demanding , they had regular tests and needed to write essays . 
  people use it usually privately in groups , afaik . 
  use for medical purposes was legalized this year , though there is no refund for such medications and also some other conditions . 
  growing and recreational use is prohibited , but now there is no push for legalization . 
  in my opinion most people call them junkies and marijuana a drug , others do n't think it 's a drug really . 
  really , depends on who you meet . 
  i met many people who have smoked at least once , i was surprised there were so many of them . 
  i think people just smoke , but do n't know , i 'm not into it . 
   dostat kopa\u010dky czech is so funny  we also have `` dosta\u0107 kosza '' ( be given a basket ) for * have been turned down * by somebody . 
  not really , not the way you mean them . 
  food from truck you may find in summer by the sea or in other tourist destinations , selling fast foods or ice creams . 
  i think there may be probably a few of them preparing some good food in warsaw , cracow and other bigger cities , but it 's rare . 
  restaurants and bars - as others wrote below . 
  gas stations are usually open 24/7 , but they are expensive . 
  if we talk about cities , some private entrepreneurs ' stores - usually they have mainly alcohol and less of other supplies and some of tesco/carrefour stores are open 24/7 . 
  most of the chain convenience stores are open from 6-7 to 21-22 in the workdays and in the weekends 8-20 probably , it really depends . 
  private entrepreneurs set their own rules , it 's hard to generalize . 
  franchise chains are quite common and such as \u017babka or freshmarket are open 6-23 seven days a week . 
  during holidays some local solopreneurs usually have their shops open , too . 
   is there a time of day or week when pretty much everything is closed ? 
  if you live in a big city , not in the suburbs - no . 
  i do n't know what 's popular but very easy and quick meals i eat : * buckwheat/millet/spelt groats/pearl barley etc. 
  with fried onion * cooked potatoes with sour cream and fried onion * corn grits with raisins and some honey and not so quick , but also easy : * lecs\u00f3 ( kind of , i just use what i have ) * barley soup * zalewajka - kind of potato soup ; based on sour soup and with onion, 
  * most of the food from middle east , pakistan , bangladesh , india , love the seasonings they use * japanese okonomiyaki * pelmeni , known in europe , but they originate from siberia, 
   i can see one doing very well in london . 
  could you post an address , please ? 
  and q , x , v appear only in loan words . 
  thanks , actually i think yours was worse  i mean as far as i know , both sweden and russia wanted the land , which is strategic location . 
  they were rather powerful countries and there were less finish than polish people , who could fight for the country . 
  that 's why you people were very brave . 
  though in school i learned only about the winter war and simo hayha , when it comes to finland . 
  well , i think it refers to any country and any war  there are not many random people who would like to kill other random people . 
  only some psychos , i think . 
  i lived in london for a time , so i would only refer to this place . 
  i missed : * food , mostly dairy and sour , yet there are polish shops , so you can actually get some of the stuff you want ; * bread ; well , you may find some good one , but it 's very expensive then ; * sour cherries ; they only had sweet cherries ; * wild strawberries ; * common bilberries / blue whortleberries - not sure how you call them but i mean [ those ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vaccinium_myrtillus ) ; * mushrooms and mushroom picking ; there were no fresh mushrooms of different species ; * one tap for cold and hot water ; and the tap water sucks ; * grey toilet paper !, 
  - really annoying ; i could n't find it anywhere , but damn , toilet paper must be a bit rough for what it is used !, 
  * dogs ; there are less people with dogs and dogs need to be well-trained , obedient etc , and are not so spontaneous , they seemed rather reserved ; i really like dogs and they usually like me , but those were not communicative and open with people , as i was used to . 
  what about the erd\u00e9ly ? 
  is n't that those who live there have beef with the romanian ? 
  i read the history of finland ( not on wikipedia , some short book ) and i remember that you were in horrible situation for all those years between sweden and russia . 
  i was pretty shocked and sorry for your country , and at the same time it was amazing that you got over it . 
  i do n't keep any grudges , i just hear them around from time to time and wanted to know how about your countries . 
  i agree it 's the same everywhere with capitals , and warsaw is the main city of poor and weakly developed voivodship . 
  i myself do n't hate any of those countries , really . 
  i mentioned what are some common regrets , but it all depends on people you meet . 
  some are nationalists , but some are not , they just care about the history , but rather do n't hate random people . 
  thanks !, 
  i had no idea there is so much rivalry between those cities . 
   there is also minor resentment between london/south east england and the rest of the uk . 
  i have lived in london for a time , and i heard that it 's kind of separated island within uk , that if you 've lived in london then you know nothing about real english people and the country . 
  poland has about 38\u00a0000\u00a0000 people , while number of people speaking romani is 35 000 ( officially only half of that admit romani nationality ) , so it 's about 1 % . 
  it 's much less than in czech , slovakia , romania , hungary ... as i have never lived in area where there are lots of gypsies , i did n't mention that . 
  but sure , they are a problem , i have heard a lot of creepy stories about them . 
  i lived in fulham , which is just the opposite side of thames and i would say battersea is definitely good area , easy access to the riverside and i would say also to the center of london . 
  i think it is generally safe , yet i 'm not a female and did n't go there at night  i do n't think there are many poor people living there , i think it is rather expensive . 
  quiet - depends whether you live next to the pub/restaurant etc. , the exact location . 
  generally - cool . 
  from germany , they were adjudged internationally as being guilty for the ww2 and had to pay war reparations to other countries . 
  all the damages have been priced here for the government a few times since communism collapsed . 
  but well , there are lots of law issues around that case , i 'm not good at international law though . 
  all in all , the fact is the ww2 reparations have never been paid . 
  some people here think our gov should n't rise this as `` relations with germany would become colder , we would be ignored at political arena '' or `` it has been long time ago , why should we bother '' and so on . 
  which i bet sounds shit to an average pole , as they do n't care about international diplomacy stuff . 
  we were quite damaged and a few millions died , so reparations seem just like an obvious thing . 
  btw : i have nothing against german people or something . 
   trumps love of putin also begs the question of why since this seems in response to russia it was set during [ 2016 nato summit ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_warsaw_summit ) , when obama was us president . 
  i do n't know how all this president stuff works , but if it had been set before , then it probably had to be done anyway . 
  nope , reddit people wo n't solve that . 
  the reparations just crossed my mind when some people on youtube said about us army : `` we wish they were here during ww2 '' . 
  the exercises are common , but now they are to improve the east flank of nato in estonia , latvia , lithuania , poland and romania . 
  i looked up that some peter doran from center for european policy analysis said that 's because russia had annexed the part of ukraine . 
  and by the numbers given by the media you can see , that these are some * bigger exercises * . 
  i do n't know , i found that bison , gepard , dragon i saber guardian are the code names for those maneuvers , they along with polish soldiers , there are armored brigade combat team there , and some military helicopters group would arrive , too . 
  and russian soldiers came to belarus for zapad ( ? ), 
  maneuvers or something about the time . 
  [ here ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3qxgg5cpeg ) and [ here ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8v1jmlg6fss ) you have videos and that is piece from [ euronews ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjddx5x1wbo ) in english . 
  i saw the troops and all army stuff on the road , as well as american soldiers in the city , so did my brother in another . 
  there are some videos when casual people talk with them . 
  many people get pissed off like * get the fuck out you murderers * , * we do n't want serbia and libya here * , any foreign soldiers are not welcome so to say ( except maybe hungarian ) and so on . 
  many are happy - including our government , saying they feel save and it 's historical moment , as there were n't so many us army stuff here since cold war and wish they were here during ww2 and so on . 
  btw : we have n't been paid any war reparations after ww2 , does n't that sound strange ? 
  of course we have learned the wright brothers were the first . 
  poland gained independence back in 1918 , so first poles who flew were in russian in french airborne units . 
  the most famous polish pilots are f. [ \u017bwirko ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/franciszek_%c5%bbwirko ) and s. [ wigura ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/stanis%c5%82aw_wigura ) , who won the international `` challenge '' air contest in 1932 . 
  there are streets , schools etc. 
  named after them . 
  and there are those famous pilots from polish air forces in france and great britain during ww2 . 
   we do keep them all singular and we have them plural , except 1 km , 1 kg etc. 
  of course . 
  i do n't think we have any . 
  of course `` oh , my god '' , `` jesus christ '' , `` saint mary '' etc. 
  but they do n't count . 
  well , maybe according to first commandment catholic people should n't do that , yet that 's not a blasphemy . 
  the words `` god '' , `` christ '' , `` virgin mary '' are never used in blasphemy expressions . 
  it would sound very very strange in polish language to me , putting words meaning ~ `` fuck '' next to `` jesus '' , `` god '' etc. 
  i got used to it in english though , but i do n't use such expressions . 
  same as i wo n't use `` muhammad fuckin allah '' or so ... btw : i 'm not catholic , not even baptised .

  parts of uk in eu and parts outside . 
  on top of that , a bright new status just for uk , different from eea , is apparently considered here and there, 
  oh shut up on these neverendums and go back to work people, 
  meh , he 's just one man with a short cadency . 
  brexit is irreversible and far more damaging, 
  problem is he will be replaced by another tory . 
  most likely by boris or worse, 
  and you were angry on the english people , / r/europe . 
  top lads right there, 
  can the next vote be on abolishing democracy for oligarchy of wealthy and higher educated ? 
  i 'm all for it while not having a uni diploma nor money . 
  who 's with me ? 
  no one ? 
  i thought so . 
  i ca n't stand seeing these muttering idiots having a single vote as professors , economists , and lawyers . 
  it already is half way there , but referendum on accepting any kind of `` costitution of europe '' is doomed to fail, 
  regions ? 
  not like poorer districts of regions ? 
  london is quite expensive no matter where you look and it still has a lot of immigrants just in the cheaper districts, 
  meh , it wo n't happen . 
  this `` uk will fall apart '' circljerk on / r/europe has no bearing . 
  10 % of scots will change their minds just before voting and unionists will block reunification of ireland , mark my words . 
  there would need to be another major blow to stability of britain , like a lost fight for full soverignity over gibraltar or sudden death of queen ( king charles wo n't help keeping scotland in ) for any of this reeferendums to succeed, 
  brexit won by less than 4 % , do n't act like british people support you . 
  hah thanks mate !, 
  they are all , maybe not idiots , but at least ignorants and did n't really know what were voting for, 
  coz i 'm an idiot . 
  i have a second chance in september if i fail there i pay 400 z\u0142 to go further, 
  oh thank god, 
  as is dementia and parkinson . 
  in case you do n't have one, 
  i fucked up, 
  - strong economic ties wit spain - importance of eu membership for gibraltar - spanish dominion in the past - little population made up of people moved there by british - strategic importance i do n't see why spain should fight for shared sovereignity, 
  because experience teaches you macroeconomics and eu politics ? 
  but who 'll represent uk in the council if ~ ~ dodgy ~ ~ dave stepped down ? 
  queen ? 
  sub turned into / r/eurpeancasualconversation i do n't care . 
  it 's just an exam . 
  i 'll do better next time . 
  all i can think of now is brexit, 
  what does it have to do with anything ? 
  i ca n't even, 
  kurwa - that 's how . 
  im doing it again in september, 
  it 's a fucking hell hole . 
  no air conditioning 100 degrees, 
  just getting to the hall , so hot and loud :p fucking hell you too , keep calm and get an a or whatever is best to get there, 
  i 'm a redditor of course i do n't !, 
  talking vis a vis is for normies, 
  o7 means a lot coming from a true patriot, 
  these remaintards were so low energy , not even like a 10 anymore . 
  now united kingdoms - or however they call it - will be wining so much , so so much , they will get tired of wining , i tell you . 
  we are so smart , we know so many words and they give us some `` experts '' ( more like experderps right ? ), 
  that call us uneducated and ignorant , i wonder how many yuuuge deals they made ? 
  murrican enough ? 
  yeah , better to turn off internet for this exam session . 
  now make a map showing how to say `` fuck you too , britain '' in different languages, 
  thanks , 
  thank you, 
  british governments will still cooperate with the eu which may federalize in next decades . 
  uk will stay in eu 's sphere of influence as norway , switzerland or western balkanistans . 
  this cooperation runs deep and ca n't be broken by a vote . 
  there are forces far stronger than the will of the people in play here . 
  edit : `` sphere of influence '' is n't the best term to describe what i had in mind, 
  tell me about it , i have an exam in an hour, 
  do n't purge brexit related posts , mods . 
  it will calm down in 12 hours anyway, 
  you really do n't even know where ireland is ? 
  were we brigaded by / r/the _ donald ? 
  where are all these laughable morons coming from ? 
  wish that was to be true , but it wo n't . 
  different species actually if you consider trump to be a ~ ~ chimp ~ ~ monkey edit : confused words, 
  i look forward to seeing britons realizing that cameron was n't such a twat after all, 
  you 're advocating getting back to geopolitics of the old days . 
  hate and prejudice driven politics, 
  and then let 's invade britain !, 
  england would be annexed to france and the rest set free . 
  this gon na be good, 
  lizard people, 
  poor daily mail . 
  who will now give hiv to babies with eurocrats so far away ? 
  predictions are that it will take them at least a decade to do so ... , 
  i would propose to not let people vote on something this huge in a referendum . 
  democracy shoul be as much indirect as possible . 
  you should take a minute or two to read on democracy . 
  you do n't measure it by rightfulness of decisions that are taken besides , i 'm not saying referendum was n't democratic ( does anyone ? 
  ) , quite the opposite . 
  ignorant masses voted for option they think know best . 
  what 's funny about it ? 
  you 're still a repulsive idiot and recession will take that british horse teeth smile off your face . 
  even if so they are unlikely to vote yes this time, 
  so basically stupidity and ignorance won over reason and fact ? 
  democracy, 
  i thought it 's related to somalian, 
  oh god ... 
  i have an exam in few hours do n't make me cry now, 
  did eurocrats gave hiv to the queen ??? 
  new eu regulations on size of tea pots ??? 
  juncker the crackhead !!, 
  is it really that bad ?

  why so condescending ? 
  there are many individuals who directly benefited from actions of the multiple governments during the last 25 years and balcerowicz is one of them . 
  they form a * system * which is fundamentally parasitic towards the society . 
  is it wrong to call them by their name ? 
  balcerowicz is actively engaged in current presidential campaign , has voiced his support for komorowski multiple times . 
  just look at his facebook page . 
  i think he 's a palikot style decoy , just for economically liberal people . 
  balcerowicz , petru , frasynkiuk , olechowski - same old faces , just a different party name . 
  he disagrees with po a lot when it comes to economy , but he voiced his political support towards it on numerous occasions . 
  he 's a part of the system since 1989 . 
  it 's silly to think that his party is more than a decoy . 
  why would a part of a problem be the solution ? 
  he 's right there with balcerowicz , who supported po on every possible occasion . 
  he 's not an alternative , he 's an escape plan . 
  please take note that western countries are generally more wealthy than eastern countries . 
  this directly influenced the difference in foreign aid . 
  as to immigrants , we 're not that attractive destination for asylum seekers . 
  we 're a poor , cold , distant country with strange language , large unemployment , poor social security net , no sustained benefits for people with many children . 
  why go to poland when you can go to the uk ? 
  i also think that taking any immigrants from africa is against the interest of the ue . 
  we should just return them back to the libyan shores . 
  i 've seen the kind of people that emigrated from poland to uk or norway . 
  it 's no coincidence that our crime rates plummeted around the time borders were opened . 
  westerners have all the right to complain and enforce stricter immigration rules . 
  their country , their rules . 
  last thing we need is a group of immigrants who are impossible to integrate , do n't understand our language , do n't share our values and religion . 
  western european countries fucked africa up and now we 're to share responsibility for their actions ? 
  over my dead body . 
  i can easily accept immigration from ukraine , georgia , or any eastern european country , but africa is not our problem . 
  braun could read the navy seals pasta with a straight face during a debate . 
  i admire him for that . 
  he was one of the few who were released from it by the germans though . 
  `` bad state of health '' was the reason . 
  it 's not like he spent a lot of time there . 
  this has sprung some theories that he was in fact a collaborator . 
  i do n't want to diminish his achievements , but it is worth noting that he was a controversial person , with a largely unknown past . 
  most of what we know about bartoszewski comes from himself , in forms of interviews and biographies . 
  he was also against awarding the order of the white eagle to [ witold pilecki ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/witold_pilecki ) . 
  his reasoning was unknown , but most of his critics speculate that he wanted all of the auschwitz survivor glory for himself . 
  i think this is a very sensible choice , both militarily and politically . 
  i 'm also glad that italians wo n't get a dime , considering how big of a screw up saipem 's constuction of the lng terminal in \u015awinouj\u015bcie is . 
   long lonk, 
  but uranium can be bought from civilised countries , such as canada . 
  i 'd say there 's nothing more eco-friendly than nuclear power . 
  fukushima daichi was built on a goddamn tectonic fault . 
  not only was it subject to strong earthquakes but a tsunami as well . 
  none of these factors are present in europe . 
  i find this recent nuclear scare completely groundless . 
  nuclear power is the future . 
  it 's undenialable . 
  there is a reason behind this . 
  there really is . 
  this treaty , as correct as its goals are , is incredibly dangerous to our economy . 
  we rely heavily on coal , with no hope of changing that in the next 10 or so years . 
  if we agree , our electricity prices * will * skyrocket . 
  this will take away our chance for growth and , in the long run , our chance to switch to nuclear power . 
  there 's a large chance we may negotiate a favourable agreement with china concerning both funding and construction of our first nuclear power plant . 
  we matter little when it comes to global warming as we pollute less that most eu states , at least * per capita * . 
  yeah , i am . 
  if you think this money is free then i have bad news for you . 
  we spent a shitload of money to harmonise our law and procedures with the eu law . 
  i doubt that we 're breaking even when all things are accounted for . 
  yeah , yeah . 
  it 's just a coincidence that we can only spend it on stuff that eu explicitly agreed upon . 
  besides , 90 % of `` aid '' going back to companies in old eu is just a coincidence . 
  they both behaved really badly . 
  the presenter had an agenda , but gli\u0144ski should have acted differently . 
  this is not the behaviour we expect from a minister of culture . 
  we russia now . 
  hail glorious pis . 
  we need it back . 
  along with the original black boxes . 
  we deserve to know the truth . 
  i do n't trust the russians one bit . 
  i would doubt them even if they outright admitted they shot the plane down . 
  whoops . 
  i dind ' t even notice . 
  i 'll do better next time . 
  i think that 's insane . 
  some judge will probably `` misplace '' his files , then they 'll have to restore them . 
  that 's at least a year or two of freedom more . 
  he 's not a criminal . 
  at least not yet . 
  implying we need nato to defeat russia . 
  this chart of yours surely looks nice - showing our gdp , and not the rate of it 's growth . 
  here , take a look at this : [ link ] ( http://pl.tradingeconomics.com/poland/gdp-growth ) . 
  it 's probably also a real life bubble then . 
  i would n't say most people are `` mad about migrants '' , they 're just against helping people who exploit the tragedy of others . 
  during the debate both nowacka and zandberg were in favour of taking in as many refugees as possible . 
  i may have misunderstood them though - none of the leaders present at the debate said anything concrete . 
  how so ? 
  entire left side of the political spectrum shot itself in its collective foot by supporting unlimited or barely limited immigration from the middle eastern countries . 
  it 's almost as if they did n't want to be elected . 
  here 's mine : http://prntscr.com/8ozbys i 'm still not sure whom i should vote for . 
  i like this one : https://youtu.be/n-mjc25r0nc, 
   birth control pills have side-pills too of course they do , but day-after pills contain 75 times ( 20 mcg/day vs 1500 mcg in one pill ) more hormones than birth control pills . 
  they can really fuck you up , and getting your hormones in balance after things go wrong is troublesome . 
  i 'm not saying that day after pills * should * be prescription only , just that there are valid reasons for them to be distributed that way . 
  these pills contain hormones in large quantities , which can have adverse side effects . 
  i do n't think it 's unreasonable for them to be prescription only .

  wykop.pl is like 80 % 4chan 20 % reddit . 
  yes , but there 's considerable amounf of pis voters that tried to ignore that part of pis . 
  probably big intersection with these that believed macierewicz wo n't be back , and that pis is n't as `` hardcore '' as po and tvn made them to look . 
  it 's funny dynamic . 
  before elections pis is always mild , hardcore politicians do n't speak in public , smole\u0144sk crash is n't mentioned . 
  then there 's elections , and all the old boys are back , spewing the usual bullshit . 
  so , for example , on social sites like wykop.pl supporters of pis downvote articles about pis paying father rydzyk ( owner of backward even for catholic media - tv trwam , radio maryja , and nasz dziennik ) . 
  it 's not like they could just dismantle krus , and move people to zus , right ? 
  or simply make the conditions fair . 
  or allow people to buy farming land , but add conditions to apply to krus . 
  but no , better to keep the unfair advantages , but regulate who can buy land . 
  we 'll call it agrarnianism . 
  it 's also better than nazi occupation and prl . 
  why should i care ? 
  check this with a lawyer , ianal and i spent like 5 minutes reading this law . 
  you ca n't buy farming land in poland unless all of these are fullfiled : - you have farming education - you were registered for at least 5 years in the same district ( gmina ) where the land is , or a neighboring one - you will use the land for farming - you do n't have more than 300 ha of land already or you can just be a religious organization - then none of these conditions apply . 
  it 's supposedly targeted at evil foreigners who obviously want to buy polish land from poor farmers , but the end result will be - churches get to buy land for cheap , and then the law will be changed and prices will return to normal and churches will get rich . 
  another funny effect is - farmer 's kids that went to university for 5 years , and have different education than farming - wo n't be able to inherit the land , and the farmer that want to move to city for example will have to sell the land ( and national agency has the right to buy it first for a determined price , only if it decides not to - he can sell it to some other farmer , but not just any farmer - the conditions from above apply ) . 
  no , that 's not the issue . 
  they want to criminalize giving and taking abortions , in all circumstances . 
  5 year in prison for the women . 
  it 's already banned except for rape victims and when it threathens women life . 
  they want to ban it completely . 
  do n't think so : romania : 9 499 usd ; 18 410 ppp usd usa : 53 041 usd ; 53 750 ppp usd, 
  depends how `` wet '' the air is , and how cold it is . 
  but most people do n't do it , because it apparently destroys the fabric . 
  purchasing power parity , please . 
  otherways you basicaly say that a barber in new york doing exactly the same job exactly as fast is 5 times more productive in new york than in some shithole in texas . 
  i 'm polish . 
  i did n't even knew these things exist , and i still do n't imagine actually using one - clothes are dry the next morning anyway , so why bother ? 
  it 's not like i 'll spend any less time hanging stuff in electric drier than in passive drier ? 
  another thing - ac in private houses in poland is n't really a thing either . 
  usually there 's like 1-4 weeks of over 30 c in a year , and people just endure . 
  in offices it 's very popular on the other hand . 
  by hanging them inside ( usually in the bathroom there 's sth like this http://i387.photobucket.com/albums/oo317/marlenamitura/suszar.jpg or like this https://dobreusprawnienia.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/suszarka.jpg - this one is hanged over the tube ) . 
  and then you wait ( usually over night ) . 
  yes . 
  obviously . 
  even the canon example of `` do n't shout fire in a crowded theather '' shows that freedom of speech can be restricted and sometimes it 's worth it . 
  ad 1 - no  freedom of the press - the right , ( guaranteed by the first amendment to the united states constitution ) to publish and distribute information in books , magazines , and newspapers without government intervention . 
   freedom of speech ( also freedom of expression ) - the right to speak without censorship or restraint by the government the law i cited is restricting both . 
  ad 2 - no ad 3 - how exactly am i responsible for behaviour of `` leftist '' parties in other countries that i did n't voted for ? 
  ad 4 - lol no  governments restrict speech with varying limitations . 
  common limitations on speech relate to libel , slander , obscenity , pornography , sedition , incitement , fighting words , classified information , copyright violation , trade secrets , non-disclosure agreements , right to privacy , right to be forgotten , political correctness , public security , public order , public nuisance , campaign finance reform , perjury , and oppression . 
  sources : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/freedom_of_speech https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/freedom_of_the_press, 
  freedom of press is contained within freedom of speech . 
  if a press ca n't print something - it 's restriction of both . 
  like in the case i refered . 
  it is restricting freedom of speech . 
  just like the laws criminalizing holocaust denial do . 
  i do n't support these laws btw ( and `` leftist '' parties i voted for do n't either , or if you think otherwise please show me their opinion in writing or in a video . 
  will be hard without knowing who i voted , but somehow it did n't stopped you from stating that , so i do n't think i 'll help you here  4 . 
  not each restriction of freedom of press ( and speech ) is bad . 
  it depends on the profits and costs to the society . 
  i never argued otherways ( althought i did changed opinion on where exactly the line is a few times in my life ) . 
  and i do n't have strong opinion on that particular proposed law either way . 
  dependso n the details . 
  another matter is - is it worth it ? 
  sorry , first result fro mgoogle . 
  try this : https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/01/europe-releases-its-ttip-proposals-intellectual-property  meanwhile , there are other aspects of the agreement that remain troubling to us , perhaps most notably including europe 's insistence on including provisions on investor state dispute settlement ( isds ) , that could allow foreign investors to challenge laws that they believe impact the value of their investments . 
  although the ramifications of this policy extend much further , there is the prospect that balanced intellectual property laws that one country adopts -- such as an orphan works law , for example -- could trigger an investor 's claim . 
  how is that a good thing ? 
  i work as a software developer for 9 years already . 
  i do n't know a single person in the industry rooting for software patents . 
  ttip makes it possible to use software patents in eu with a workaround : http://techrights.org/2015/11/06/tpp-and-ttip-swpats/ it 's bad for eu , and especially bad for developing countries like poland , that are mostly ip importers , and where nobody is rich enough to hire lawyers and fight patent trolls/buy patents/register their own . 
  in my city - small 350 000 lublin there 's more than 5000 developers already . 
  it 's a booming industry , with ~ 10 % growth each year . 
  available office space in lublin are predicted to triple in next 6 years ( from 154 000 to 450 000 m ^ 2 ) . 
  you want to sacrifice that because of what benefits exactly ? 
  it he law passes in the current form then it 's unclear who to save , because both fetus and women have the same rights to live . 
  which is insane . 
  i can agree it 's more complicated when the pregnancy is advanced , and the kid is more or less a human being , with a brain etc. 
  that 's why such cases should be solved when it 's not an ethical problem yet . 
  which is the way it works now . 
  and the whole point of the original article was that people protested changes to that ( to make it also illegal in other cases ) . 
  cbos did the poll . 
  gazeta is only reporting it . 
  still choking ? 
  or just trying to back off from your lie ? 
  if you prefer - different polling center ( tns obop ) , different reporting media ( wp.pl ) , different year ( 2003 ) - similar results . 
  how can it be a person without having a brain ? 
  your dog is more of a person than that . 
  yes i am aware some people believe in ghosts . 
  does n't make it fair to force law motivated by that on people who do n't . 
  btw according to catholic church the kids killed by abortion go directly to heaven . 
  100 % conversion rate . 
  church should be for aborting everybody if they were consistent with their beliefs . 
  nobody is saying all the poles are against sth . 
  read the damn article before commenting and assuming . 
   much more are for it than against it you are now doing exactly the thing you were accusing guardian of . 
  according to last cbos poll : http://bi.gazeta.pl/im/b4/ef/12/z19854516q.jpg 80 % are for legal abortion when mother 's life is threathened . 
  73 % is for legal abortion when the pregnancy is an effect of rape or incest . 
  53 % is for legal abortion when the child is known to be born retarded ( sorry , ca n't remember the pc-word for that ) . 
  so , basicaly - most poles are for status quo regarding abortion . 
  details matter , and probably this percentage would change a lot depending on the exact details ( how late in the pregnancy it is legal , who decides , etc ) . 
   politics ca n't affect me personally cute . 
  but in such case - why are you criticizing people who do participate in politics ? 
  according to you it 's harmless anyway . 
  it seems to me it 's you who picked a party , not me . 
  i voted 3 different parties last 4 elections , each time it was ` lesser evil '' .

  we are arguing about abortion , which , by definition , is a termination of life of a human in fetal phase . 
   it 's you who 's ignorant . 
  right now you 're trying to derail the conversation to push an ignorant ( mostly religious ) agenda . 
  in all my posts i have n't made a single religious argument and all my points are backed by hard science . 
  on the other hand , all your arguments are backed solely by your own words and ideology . 
   all over the civilized world , according to laws a human only receives human rights at birth . 
  a parasite , whether it 's human or not , normally has no rights . 
  the host can get rid of it if she likes . 
  objectively , it makes sense . 
  an unwelcome offspring is far worse to the society than no offspring or delayed welcome offspring . 
  not really , you need to do some reading on human rights . 
  a lot countries actually have clauses that state human life begins at fertilization/implantation ( which , again , is the scientific consensus ) . 
  also , the entire idea of human rights being given to somebody is absurd . 
  humans have intrinsic rights not dependent on any jurisdiction . 
  there is no such thing as a human parasite . 
  homo sapiens are not a parasitic species . 
   objectively , if you die and some of your organs are required for someone else 's survival , will your organs be used for transplantation ? 
  assuming you have n't permitted that before death . 
  is there even an objective answer to this ? 
  if someone is about to die due to kidney failure and one of your kidneys is the only thing that can save him , should you objectively be forced to donate ? 
  those are not rhetorical questions , i want to see an answer . 
  we are not arguing about transplantation here , so you will not have one . 
   why would i ? 
  this is not a scientific journal , it 's a casual discussion . 
  i 'm not a scientist . 
  you 're probably not a scientist . 
  to me , a fetus looks like a parasite that feeds on the host to grow . 
  at least half of the infestations is involuntary . 
  so why the hell would you prevent women from curing themselves ? 
  it just does n't make sense . 
  that 's the exact reason people like you , the ignorant , should not have a voice in any serious discussion . 
  you will just brush facts aside and say ` hey , i think this is stupid and my emotional opinion is as valid as 400 years of research ' . 
  the scientific aspect is actually what matters most , because it is objective . 
  ideology is subjective and can also change in time , the understanding of human fertilization is prety solid and will not . 
  again , please stop using scientific terms like parasite with your own meaning , it just does n't make sense and only shows your pitiful attempt at using negatively-charged words to advance your agenda . 
  i 've never called him a nazi , i only implied that if he thinks humanness is defined by societal consensus then he shares this view uniquely with eugenicists ( of which nazis were a minority , really ) . 
  i do n't think anybody disagreeing with me is bad , i do however think anybody disagreeing with the scientific consensus is an ignorant and should not participate in discussions . 
  i am quoting a peer-reviewed whitepaper , as well as numerous scientific definitions . 
  you are quoting yourself and ` generally understandable knowledge ' . 
  come back to me when you have any adult arguments . 
  great , thanks for the insults and threats , do you have any actual argument to make against your eugenics stance or do you think i dread of internet tough guys ? 
  btw , in case you did n't know ( because you probably did n't ) , eugenics was a major topic in the whole western world in the beginning of 20th century ( and it was actually progressed by charles darwin and his family , mostly francis galton ) . 
  usa had compulsory sterilization laws , etc. 
  and nazis actually learn a lot from them . 
  so it 's not only big , bad nazis who had such ` progressive ' views . 
  judging from what you 've said , you are a eugenicist , you just can not admit that and think you are acting on behalf of ` greater good for the society ' ( hint - the original ones thought so too ) . 
  please , take your emotional arguments away and face the objective , hard-science first . 
  fyi i 've never voted for pis . 
  no , you are missing the point . 
  whether somebody is a human being is an objective scientific fact . 
  unless you are one of the ` untermensch ' folks , who think you can decide whether somebody is a human being by societal consensus . 
  in that case , just outright state that you are an eugenicist . 
  whether somebody is a person , is a philosophical question , just like i stated in the beginning . 
  in your closing remarks , you are basically stating that we should not base our judgements on objective , experimentally-verifiable sources , rather use ideology for that . 
  this is classic anti-scientism and ideologism that led to most atrocities of the 20th century . 
  we are talking science here , not metaphors or ideology . 
  yes , this is n't a debate , because it has been part of the scientific consensus for decades . 
  there literally is n't a single respected scientist , who thinks zygotes are not human beings . 
  generally understood terms means dumbing down the definition so even the thickest can understand it . 
  that 's not the way to debate anything , and in fact such issues can not even be described in ` generally understandable terms ' , because in general people are ignorant of biology , like you are . 
  that 's why scientific consensus is dealt with by people educated in the field , not by ` general public ' . 
  did you even read the paper i sent you ? 
  your infantile argument was already quoted there : `` it is important to note that embryological evidence shows that the human embryo is a whole , although obviously immature , human being ; it is not a mere part . 
  this is a crucial point : human tissues or human cells , whether body cells or gametes , are indeed human -- that is , genetically human -- but are not whole human organisms . '' '', 
  are you really that thick ? 
  do you think the term ` human development ' does n't imply the development of a ` human being ' ? 
  here , have a nice peer-reviewed paper from ncbi , a respected source ( which you 've probably never seen , judging by your scientific knowledge ) . 
  `` this new organism begins to grow by the normal process of differentiated cell division into an embryo , dividing into two cells , then four , eight and so on , although some divisions are asynchronous . 
  its cells constitute a human organism , for they form a stable body and act together in a coordinated manner , which contributes to regular , predictable and determinate development toward the mature stage of a human being . 
  [ ... ] the human embryo is the same individual as the human organism at subsequent stages of development . 
  [ ... ] it is important to note that embryological evidence shows that the human embryo is a whole , although obviously immature , human being ; it is not a mere part . 
  this is a crucial point : human tissues or human cells , whether body cells or gametes , are indeed human -- that is , genetically human -- but are not whole human organisms . '', 
  says genetics and the scientific consensus . 
  zygote is just a period in human development . 
  ` in biological terms , human development entails growth from a one celled zygote to an adult human being . ', 
  ` the term conception commonly refers to fertilisation , which is the successful fusion of gametes to form a new organism . ', 
  'em bryo [ em \u00b4 bre-o ] - a new organism in the earliest stage of development . ', 
  a fetus is not your own body and it is not a parasite . 
  please , for the thousandth time in threads like this , do learn basic biology before commenting . 
  there is a difference between a person and a human being . 
  every zygote is a human being and most probably is n't a person . 
  however , newborn babies are not persons either and we do n't abort them . 
  no , you can not . 
  please learn basic biology and comprehend what a haploid cell is . 
   there are plenty of scientific studies on this topic , and only uneducated fanatic can find any causes for a discussion here . 
  exactly . 
  that 's why uneducated fanatics like yourself often try to discuss scientific phenomena , which they have little understanding of . 
  whether the fetus is a human or not is defined entirely by its genetic code , which happens during meiosis in the first week after fertilization . 
  the way a fetus looks or on which stadium its organs are is irrelevant to this classification . 
  can you post the article then ? 
   not just jobbik , the hungarian government , trough multiple non profits , funds all extremist organizations in romania , serbia , ukraine and slovakia , while these non profits are funded exclusively by the hungarian government with hungarian public funds . 
  i 'm curious , do you have any credible sources on that ? 
  nothing a couple billion petrodollars can not fix , 
  i do n't know , maybe some rich , culturally-compatible and sparsely populated nearby countries like sa or uae ? 
  alternatively , the world population will decline , which ultimately is a good thing . 
  poland will almost surely benefit from climate change , in fact it is already visible by tamer winters and much less spending on heating . 
  we just need to keep our borders secure , but that has been a no-brainer for centuries ( up until merkel 's latest stroke ) . 
  cohn-bendit , the same guy who admitted being a pedophile and even wrote a book advocating pedophilia , as well as being editor of a pro-pedophilia leftist newspaper . 
  also , the co-chairman of one of main parties in the eu parliament . 
  we really have such wonderful people in charge of europe .

  do you imagine someone buying mona lisa ? 
  i guess they would n't sell it even if someone would pay a good price . 
  let 's not forget they were naming these five new judges deep at night , being in rush because the tribunal was to give decision the next day ... also they passed a law regarding the work of constitutional tribunal without vacatio legis ( the law came in life immediately after voting ) so that everything what would the tribunal do next was illegal . 
  also now regarding the annual budget law , they passed it in another chamber without informing the opposition , counting the votes by hand and you ca n't be sure if quorum was maintained . 
  we love you guys since 1385 . 
  i actually live in the marked area of poland but never heard of it ... 
  actually holocaust denial [ is a crime in most of the europe . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/laws_against_holocaust_denial ), 
  where do i begin ... 
  i will repeat you that i oppose the current government in poland but i also oppose the obligatory migrant quotas , ** as do most of the eastern eu countries ** and large majority of western countries . 
  that does n't make me a pis supporter . 
  secondly , does it really mean that if it is cold on the north pole , every pole ( what a coincidence ) is brainwashed by pis and orban ? 
  i do n't call muslim and mena people this or that so i ca n't relate . 
  you keep accusing me of things i did in your mind . 
  ok , i lost it when you started about germany shoving quotas down my throat . 
  ca n't fight that logic . 
  if you were talking about baltic air policing , poland does not benefit this ` decision ' . 
  there is no union in harshly imposing things no one wants , like it is with the obligatory quotas . 
  and lastly i called you ignorant on your very simplified vision of poland as a hmm some sort of evil state with brainless people or whatever you think . 
  where do i begin ... 
  i will repeat you that i oppose the current government in poland but i also oppose the obligatory migrant quotas , ** as do most of the eastern eu countries ** and large majority of western countries .

  and lastly i called you ignorant on your very simplified vision of poland as a hmm some sort of evil state with brainless people or whatever you think . 
  that is exactly what i was talking about . 
  i do n't agree with you , therefore in your mind i 'm brainwashed by pis and orban . 
  i did n't state anywhere that i support pis or orban and in fact i strongly oppose pis . 
  you 're just pure ignorant . 
  there is no ` my government ' . 
  secondly , talking about eu migration policy i was talking about the obligatory migration quotas that european commission was calling for . 
  yes , i like eu but i 'm discouraged sometimes by people like you that have so distorted view of some countries , have n't been to them but are keen to generalise . 
  crimea is ukrainian and not russian . 
  let 's not get over it . 
  so what do you want to say here basically is : `` yeah , we are so important we even get terrorist attacks '' ? 
  you eastern europe are not important so you wo n't get any terrorist attack '' ? 
  that 's some sick thinking . 
  like terrorism was something good . 
  we are n't scared of a handful brown people . 
  we oppose the current eu immigration policy saying that we should let everyone in , not even knowing who he is but that does n't mean we want to leave eu . 
  in fact , majority of poles support the eu . 
  also , your ` joke ' about putin was not funny . 
  in my opinion judging a nation based on unrealistic image of it that you have created in your head is really fucking sad . 
  please hype another start do-train with fraction of every population . 
  my eu4 experience tells me that venice , but i may be wrong . 
  warsaw was also the place where king resided . 
  and his court ofc . 
  i 've had no idea that baltic states ' gnp were so high , even higher than spain ... really . 
  ok coup d'etat of 1926 , but how can you blame him for 1920-26 when he was not governing ? 
  i still think the coup was necessary as the polish politics of this time was really shitty , could n't do anything and we needed a strong leadership . 
  by the way pi\u0142sudski did not rule after the coup anyway . 
  and yes , i would count 1920 as a positive year because if we had lost in warsaw , there would not be the second polish republic . 
  also [ lithuanians had an agreement with soviets ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polish%e2%80%93lithuanian_war#territorial_changes ) in which they would take these polish terrains that soviets ` guaranteed ' them . 
  how was lithuania richer than poland ? 
  and how can you blame pi\u0142sudski for things after 1919 if he was n't the one governing ? 
  and you forgot about his epic win in warsaw in 1920 . 
  how is tel-aviv an european city ? 
  what 's up with that gotland wanting to be russian ? 
  come on , that 's not his fault , no one can make country go from super poor to super rich in a few years . 
  think that way if it makes you feel better . 
  sorry , you were the ones to develop the most retarded system ever and install it in half of europe , using force . 
  we did win against communism in 1920 though . 
  let 's speak about the facts and not about what could have been . 
  ruling government propaganda . 
  speak for yourself . 
  i actually learned a lot of spanish on duo . 
  ca n't tell for russian tho, 
  worked for central and eastern europe , of course . 
  for millions of people under the soviet regime . 
  also take note that it 's the ussr that attacked afghanistan first . 
  to help communists that would n't win without russian help . 
  do you actually suggest that people move to poland because of our government ? 
  or maybe it 's blue because same sex sexual activity was never criminalised there . 
  look at the notes : in lithuania legal until 1795 ( 3rd partition of poland ) . 
  yeah , `` very very large majority '' . 
  bad intolerant poland . 
  i open the map and think : `` oh , who 's that terrible big red dot ? '' . 
  right , poland . 
  oh wow i did n't know we have such a diversity, 
  i do n't know if i ever heard of gwiazdor , if so it 's really rare . 
  slavic tribes started settling in the terrains of modern western poland . 
  several dozens of tribes existed , but most of them are presumed based on archeological research . 
  not many documents from this period exist to give precise information . 
  nato does n't occupy foreign territory , unlike russia . 
  lmao it 's even in the name of the country . 
  `` polish commonwealth '' . 
  what do we consider latvia before ww1 ? 
  weastern europe, 
  many former warsaw pact countries are in nato now . 
  wait ... do you blame russia for conquering siberia ? 
  i 've also heard from my spanish friend that when you do n't speak catalonian , some people would rather speak english to you than castillian . 
  but castillian and catalonian are two different - though similiar - languages . 
  no no , we were talking about holocaust not some immigration . 
  you called holocaust a mainstream ` fact ' and while you admitted that hitler called for extermination of jews , you did n't answer my question . 
  [ denying holocaust is a crime punished in many european countries .

  truth be told , people also make me hate people . 
  i may be wrong , but i thought it was more about the style fidesz won in hungary , literally steamrolling over previous compromised government . 
  not that he does n't also like how orban runs the country ( maybe besides his business with russia ) . 
  if i 'm right , what kaczy\u0144ski said may yet come true . 
  but he wo n't be polish orban in this scenario , oh no . 
  the funny thing is media every so often did mention tk , when it rules something unconstitutional , when opposition ( and on rare occasions also the government , i actually remember at least one ) sues a law to tk ( or threatens to ) , etc. 
  and at least some of us actually do know something about how the country is running . 
  my theory is he 's just projecting his own ignorancy .

  great yugoslavian republic of sparta , or gyros in short . 
  they took er tax moaneey !, 
  while what you said is true , it needs to be said that current gov broke the constitution way more . 
  you see , it 's not uncommon for gov to break the constitution , but then someone sues the law to constitutional tribunal , it makes a verdict , and gov either fixes the law to make it constitutional or not , which makes it invalid . 
  and everything is back on tracks . 
  now current gov put itself above the constitutonal tribunal ( and the constitution itself ) first proclaming all nominations by previous parliament ( funny enough apparently they voted for some of them ) unconstitutional ( which is ct 's job ) , and then when ct made a verdict 3 of the new judges were nominated legally ( 2 others were indeed illegaly ) and president is oblidged to take their oath , new gov went `` fuck you , we know better '' . 
   hahaha , did they really chant ` warsaw is not budapest ' ? 
  a bit of background : 4 years ago ( or 8 ? 
  ) , when jaros\u0142aw kaczy\u0144ski ( leader of ruling party and grey eminence behind somewhat puppet president and prime minister ) lost elections and at the same time orban won in hungary , he said `` there will come time when there will be budapest in warsaw '' . 
  there is a country where elks call you .

   what advantage does the moon have with respect to mars it 's closer . 
  it 's hard to overestimate just how much of a difference time spent travelling to and from the destination makes , it allows you to make an emergency evacuation almost at any time , it allows you to run near-real-time communications , it allows you to run literally hundreds of trips between earth and the moon during a single martian cycle , it requires less fuel ( if you take everything into account , including landing ) , it 's much more economically viable for commercial exploration , and it has fewer engineering challenges than trying to bring humans to the mars does , yet alone making sure that they 'll survive 2 + years on a surface out there . 
  moon is a gateway to the exploration of the entire solar system , mars is a gateway to ... mars . 
  yea , it 's been a significant improvement over what esa has how . 
  conference had a very positive outcome . 
  even norway managed to cancel expected tightening of its space budget , which was a good news to hear . 
   let the missions speak for themselves . 
  that was the policy ever since esa creation till roughly the late 2013 . 
  it was an utter failure , with almost noone knowing esa even exists , and those that heard about esa missions always thinking that these were nasa 's . 
  outreach is not an option , it 's a necessity . 
   with philae we watched a weird tv show where literally seconds after a quick nod from mission control we launched head-first into speech after speech from politicians you have some twisted view of what actually happened . 
  i watched the landing event live in one of the polish tv stations and do n't recall any politician , it was all centered on people in mission control . 
  and beyond that , in various media ( including 2 documentaries ) moments like andrea accomazzo jumping up with the entire team hugging and celebrating , interviews with tatooed matt taylor or fred jansen almost in tears of joy in his eyes , have gone into memory of thousands if not millions . 
  for many it was the first time they even heard about esa , or linked any particular mission to the agency . 
  yes , it was n't flawless , but it was without a doubt a great success . 
  it is , but good luck making it happen . 
  you 'd have to rewrite the entire copyright system , and that 's such an enormous challenge that i doubt any government or commission would be able to achieve that . 
  well , they said that they 'll fight tax avoidance , so that 's what they do ... though i do n't know how that vat on 22 eur gave you additional 13 eur ... that 's all it is - just added vat . 
  if stores scam you on additional fees exploiting law as an excuse then well - look for other stores , it 's open market , whoever offers the best sales wins . 
  nope . 
  whether you like it or not - there were cubans who welcomed the revolution and cubans who still think that his regime is/was a great thing . 
  to them he was a hero . 
  just like stalin was a hero ( and still is ) to many russians . 
  it 's just a diplomatic talk , do n't confuse it with praise or support , cause you only make yourself look like a fool . 
  fyi : there were two bills with * enough signatures to make them talk about it in their parliament * - and guess what ? 
  they dismissed one asking for liberalization of law in the first reading , while the one for increasing the ban went further on . 
   the way too soft reaction of pro-eu forces . 
  : / yep . 
  they accelerated process on an inter-governmental level ( eg . 
  eu border guard , upcoming eu army ) but forgot that the most important matter is making sure that benefits are clear for the citizens and that they want it first . 
  the thing you mentioned about press is also spot-on and really does not help . 
  that 's because falling down through the atmosphere is the best it did ... 
  just fyi : `` east of the oder-neisse line '' we tend to hate russian government and their actions , especially in foreign policy/invasions/little green man/etc . 
  russians , without going into politics , got much better opinion . 
  in an ideal world when media releases news headline that comes out to be russian propaganda - they should release a headline with equal importance pointing out that it was all bs . 
  or perhaps even do something unimaginable : fact-check . 
  then again : we 're far from ideal world ... 
  was n't it sold to chinese ? 
   not advertised enough , they advertise it on social media . 
  whenever eu spends money on tv , press or any other `` big '' adverts they are accused of `` spreading propaganda '' . 
   ignored by media ? 
  part of the freedom of media is freedom of ignoring stuff and focusing on bs in national politics 24/7 . 
  wow ... it 's like trying to explain economy to the child . 
  johnson 's more clueless than i expected .

  people in comments joke that someone managed to execute [ peking plan ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/peking_plan ) yet again . 
  an interview in polish with anonymous major from armed forces of ukraine for largest polish defense industry website - defence24 . 
  interview is available only in polish , therefore i 've posted few highlights below - mind you : it 's my custom selection and interview contains many other informations . 
  i highly recommend reading it . 
  they just wait for ground to dry so that their equipment would n't drown in a mud . 
  they are still reorganizing . 
  attack right now could push them out of ukraine . 
  * in my judgment potential future attack would follow : mykolaiv ( large city between odessa and crimea ) , debaltseve and mariupol . 
  they wo n't concentrate on one point . 
  it will have an element of psychological warfare . 
  attacks from land as sea . 
  they are already preparing for that , landing crafts are being brought to crimea . 
  none of the western countries will resist . 
  * the biggest problem from the frontline troops point of view is that they do n't let them fight . 
  each time they make progress they 're asked to retreat . 
  * people wanted to create new , modern and strong army made of volunteers , but due to corruption and deals that was made impossible . 
  such army could win this war in two months , instead we 're giving up village after village , people see it and loose morale . 
  retreat from debaltseve was n't necessary , but it was forced on soldiers . 
  * civilians in eastern ukraine change their view on ukrainian army - they 're much more friendly since september when army started to help them with rebuilding and supplying aid . 
  till then everyone thought ukrainian army is made of fascists bringing nothing else than devastation . 
  ** geopolitics ** * destabilization is not only in an interest of russia , but also france , germany and the uk . 
  strong and stable ukraine is not comfortable for anyone . 
  neither west nor russia wants competition . 
  what happens is another [ ribbentrop-molotov pact ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/molotov%e2%80%93ribbentrop_pact ) . 
  * sanctions are meaningless . 
  west sanctions leaders that do n't care about their own nation . 
  it makes no difference to them , they 're self-sufficient . 
  * information warfare is continuing . 
  we 've lost it and now europe will share the same fate . 
  all our values , culture , history and most importantly - truth is being altered or destroyed . 
  * we do n't need help from countries that left us - germany , france or uk - we 're hoping for countries that do understand us and are our neighbors - baltics and poland . 
  we 'd also like to count for other central european countries . 
  * even if they ( west ) want to train us - it 's not to deter russians or help us - they are just sending a message to russia that it should n't even consider attacking europe .

  and they had some criticism towards government , see ziemkiewicz and wildstein shows during 1st po term for one example . 
  this is a whole another level . 
  yeah right . 
  have you seen https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/antysalon_ziemkiewicza ? 
  was in tvp between 2008 and 2010 . 
  during po 1st term . 
  or maybe this ? 
  also between 2008 and 2010 . 
  and if you go earlier - even in early nineties - there were lot 's of criticism towards government . 
  do you remember `` kabaret olgi lipi\u0144skiej '' ? 
  or `` polskie zoo '' ? 
  at no point since 1989 public media in poland were as biased as now . 
  not even close . 
  it 's funny how extramarital sex is nothing special , there are no abortions , and very few extramarital kids in poland . 
  it must be a miracle , no way these women just go to czech republik or germany . 
  herba ta = latin for `` ta plant/herb '', 
  common enemy is needed . 
  someone noone cares about . 
  you should know how this works . 
  i also criticized that . 
  sld to be exact . 
  but pis as well was in power before it all was published and did nothing ( 2006-2007 ) . 
  what it even means `` leftist '' ? 
  pis was with po in one party for most of the 90s , they did the reforms they criticize now . 
  and pis current economic policy is more socialist than anything po did . 
  apparently the only thing people care about when speaking about leftists is lgbt laws and refuges . 
  but the exact people calling others `` leftist '' are criticizing the reforms that got away from communism , and are issueing economic policies clearly inspired by `` leftists '' ones ( 500 + , national economic programmer , taking money from ofe to government , nationalization of `` key '' companies ) . 
  it 's basicaly used as a generic insult at this point , with no meaning . 
  pis do have ~ 35 % supporters , most of them hardcore ( they survived through 8 years without election success , with everybody laughing at them ) . 
  that 's exactly the reason people vote for populists . 
  the end effect is the opposite of course , but it takes years for economy to crash . 
  but then you do n't have any way to vote for change again , because pis can basically issue law saying `` next elections 99 % of mandates are from countryside near rzesz\u00f3w , and 1 % from the rest of poland '' . 
   who the fuck i do . 
  we also have our retirement money stolen , our constitution broken , our courts subdued by the government . 
  but `` it 's ok because the previous government was bad '' . 
  well they were bad , but not that bad . 
  also they pay people money so they 're good apparently ... 
  maybe you 're unaware of the planning method they used : `` let 's assume everything will be ok and everybody will be glad to trade with us on current terms , and let 's not talk about details '' . 
  as in before making a decision . 
  usually you create plans before you do sth , 
  lithuania . 
  if you can walk there without passing other countries it counts i guess . 
  because current government openly breaks the constitution to introduce law changes they do n't have mandate to make ( they only got 37 % of votes in elections , thanks to the quirks of election system ( lots of parties that were just under the bias to get to parliament ) that translated to 51 % of votes in parliament , but to change constitution you have to have 66 % of votes in parliament - they do n't ) . 
  they ca n't legaly change the constitution , so they break the laws in constitution they do n't like instead . 
  the main problem for them is the fact that tk ( constutitional court ) has the right tocheck all laws against constitution and to void them if they are breaking the constitution . 
  so they introduced unconstutitional law that said `` tk has to operate with all 15 members on all the cases '' instead of the previous 3 members at minimum , and that `` tk has to handle the cases in the order they were given to them '' . 
  that would mean that all their bad laws would be checked against constitution years from now , including serious issues like privacy , independence of courts from government , public gatherings restrictions , etc. 
  for other example why it was bad - it gave the government right to fire constutitional judges ( and then they would put their own in that place ) . 
  they aso created many bad laws - anti-terrorist act that allows the government to put people in jail without telling people ( or their lawyers ) the charges , if the government decides there is terrorist threat , a law allowing them to forbid public gatherings for the same reason , a law restricting selling of farming land and forests , a law allowing to invigilate foreigners on polish soli without permission from courts , a law allowing them to keep peoplle in temporary arrest without charges for up to 7 days ( it was 48h before ) . 
  it 's just a few examples , there 's more laws that will probably be judged unconstutitional . 
  there were huge protests , eu and venetian commision was asked for opinion and said it 's breaking the rule of law , and the law about contutitional couort was judged unconstutitional by the tk , but pis said it does n't matter , they just declined to do what law says they have to do - to accept the verdict and publish it as part of the law . 
  so we have 2 law systems in poland since that day - the one respected by government , and the one respected by courts . 
  in the meantime there were a few civil projects of new law about tk , but the project that was sent from the main opposition group kod was changed by pis so much that kod decided to cancel it , because it became very similar to the pis project . 
  and now government wrote another law about tk - again saying that they should handle the cases in the order they were send to them , so that all these laws will only be judged years from now ... 
  and he was right . 
  ignore kaczy\u0144ski remarks , his bullshit is for internal use . 
  pis already had more scandals in 9 months than po in 8 years . 
  pis was elected , they changed the law to block contutitional court and introduced many controversial laws , and declined to follow the verdict of the constutitional court about some of these laws - breaking the constitution . 
  they also label every critic as `` previous government lackeys , communists , or leftist '' . 
  the main narrative pushed in government 's media is `` poland is finally standing up from its knees '' and that we need to be more independent from germany ( meaning eu ) . 
  right-wing ideology popularity , xenophobic views , and catholic church involvment in politics increase ( at the same time when pope asks to accept refuges - polish church is threathening people with them ) . 
  they also took spend lots of money on unsustainable social spending - buying the voters in short-term and fucking everybody long-term . 
  basically kaczy\u0144ski is sth between orban and erdogan . 
  same in poland . 
  we 're 1 year ahead of uk . 
  ask poles and jews , 
   iberal , pluralist democracy ... `` what is the point in it ? '', 
  not to harm people for no reason . 
  what 's the point in doing the opposite ? 
  dunno , it 's not like the `` leave '' side was big on `` how '' from what i 've noticed . 
  they just do n't want people to settle there i think . 
  tourists are ok . 
  the plan to make uk poor so they wo n't stay makes a lot of sense actually ... 
  so predictable  ignore the really bad ones , argue the debatable ones . 
  say i 'm for censorship . 
  i 'm actually not , and i dislike pc bullshit ( and i 've argued so on reddit , in many cases ) . 
  people being offended by x can simply decide not to buy that x. 
  on the other hand when the state pays for that x it 's a problem . 
  it 's especially big problem , when the state is courting the extreme voters . 
  because it changes the mainstream narrative - eventually it will be `` common knowledge '' that soros ( meaning - jews ) is behind everything bad . 
  then some guy like marian kowalski or other idiot will get into parliament . 
  and in a decade who knows - he might be a president . 
  i 've seen stranger things . 
  and it 's not that jews are special . 
  if it was catholics ( like in britain in 19th/early 20th century ) i would have just as much problems with that . 
  the state funding anti-minority media is a bad sign . 
  and pis tries to do it and get away with it . 
  i only want them ( and the people that support them - including pis ) to admit responsibility for these views they fund . 
  if you hate gays and jews - admit it . 
  stop pretending and making excuses like they do . 
  and for government it 's the same - if you pay rydzyk to win elections - do n't say `` we 're going to fight antisemitism '' . 
  you 're part of the problem . 
  fix the problem first then you can declare fights agains antisemitism . 
  or do n't , but then be honest and admit you need these voters so you 're going to pay rydzyk and hire his journalists en masse in public media . 
  journalists , invited `` experts '' , etc. 
  only the most hardcore things are reserved for listeners . 
  they invite guys like micha\u0142kiewicz , wrzodak , bubel ( calling himself `` main antisemite of poland '' ) so it 's really no wonder . 
  baffles me how someone may not recogize their programme , though , 
  you 're going to ignore it , or choose the most debatable and argue it 's ok , right ? 
  well , it 's for everybody to read and decide for themselves .

  it was supposed to be a `` tusk welcome ! '', 
  party organized by opposition back in spring , but due to extensive usage of red banners it ended up looking more like a mix between `` the politburo supports comrade donald '' celebration and `` show tusk the red card '' happening . 
   and on white subreddit background it looks like your flair is full red mate . 
  your monitor appears to need recalibration , as the subreddit background is grey , not white . 
  and anyhow , the size of flairs on this subreddit is standarized , 13px wide , so it is clear that only the bottom half is red . 
  [ as for usage of red banners in politics backfiring , i 'll just leave this here . 
  on one end you have two parties that are pretty much the same ( nowoczesna and po ) , with the main difference between them appearing to be that one of them is even more incompetent than the other . 
  it 's not hard to guess how the electorate will flow . 
  great majority of nowoczesna electorate in the first place were just former po voters . 
  after nowoczesna repeatedly proven itself to somehow manage to be an even less appealing political option than po , their ( brief ) supporters just returned to supporting po , or stopped supporting anyone altogether . 
   nowoczesna is a laughing stock , then i 'm not sure how to qualify all the other parties in your parliament . 
  do you even follow the day-to day politics in poland , or just read descriptions of various parties in wikipedia ? 
  because nobody doing the former would say anything like that . 
   so it is n't really surprising that they have n't managed to hold on to their short term burst in popularity . 
  considering their political actions result in failure after failure , their utter lack of competence is unveiled every time they attempt to do anything , and pretty much every time one of their politicians opens their mouths it results in a gaffe after gaffe , the only thing that is surprising is that they [ held statistically relevant support for so long . 
  ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8d/polish_opinion_polling_for_the_2019_election.png ), 
  nowoczesna is a laughing stock . 
  they 've been pretty much finished as a serious political contender a few months ago . 
  maybe the next time they should make the political banners that do n't eerily resemble commie flags then , if they do n't want them to get mistaken for them . 
   you want any change , vote for new left , like razem . 
  even if you do n't think social democracy is the way to go at least you will get some actual debate about economical models . 
  why would anyone even consider voting for the change in the * exact opposite * direction from the one he wishes for ? 
  seems rather counter-productive . 
   was going to write you a proper response , but you are dogmatic pff , as if you are n't * dogmatic * . 
  commies living in western countries that never suffered under the evil ideology of communism are always so entertaining . 
   ca n't even attempt to humor me or see things from another perspective . 
  in the next episode : nazis trying to convince jews to `` see things from another perspective '' . 
   even in your national anthem you sing poland may not have fallen yet our anthem was written in 1797 , two years after poland was defeated by prussia , austria and russia , by polish soldiers who went to france to keep fighting for the restoration of poland . 
  those words represent hope that their fight is not pointless - and it indeed was n't , as just 10 years later poland was rebuild as the duchy of warsaw . 
  even if its existence was brief and ended with napoleons ' defeat , it assured the next few generation of poles living under three foreign empires that poland is not yet lost , and when the circumstances are right , it will be reborn . 
  edit as a response to your edit :  fascist as a supporter of free markets and advocate of minimal state , so someone on pretty much the opposite end of the political spectrum from fascism , i feel comforted that at least you did n't call me a socialist . 
  that was n't `` original german territory '' by any means . 
   warschau til of the ancient german city of `` warschau '' . 
  mexiko-stadt , peking and rom are probably among other `` german '' cities that were only given to other countries out of goodwill . 
   material recompensation incurred by germany has been estimated as approximately $ 525 billion or $ 640 billion in 2004 exchange values . 
  that sentence means that that they * would * owe us $ 525 billion if we counted all the damage they caused to poland during the ww2 , not that it 's the amount that they paid us . 
  later in that article it is stated that the actual amount paid by germany was around 1/500th of that . 
  the second one , and one could have sworn it is getting longer and longer . 
   those differences were manufactured , primarily by the catholic church & hre working in conjunction to build a permanent divide i 'm quite sure the illuminati , reptillians and lord voldemort himself were also involved in this process . 
   largest slavic tribes , so they could never consolidate into a slavic confederation . 
  now you just sound like those those conspiracy theory guys we have in poland , who [ claim that in late antiquity and early medieval period there existed a great polish ( lechitic ) empire which spanned half of europe ] ( https://tajnearchiwumwatykanskie.files.wordpress.com/2016/04/slavic-kingdom-lechina-empire3.jpg ) , but was erased from history by late medieval chronichlers . 
   at which point do those differences warrant cause for separation ? 
  at the point in which they persistently existed in that area for most of written history . 
   if the promises of capitalist ideology had any basis in reality , there are at least 50 well-off countries in the world proving that it indeed does . 
   poland adopted capitalism and did n't have the usa/eu happily pumping funds ( to make russia look bad by comparison ) , poland would be very poor - think ukraine . 
  you know this is true . 
  ukraine is actually a great counterexample to your own arguments , as unlike poland they * did * not adopt capitalism immediately after regaining independence , did not introduce radical free market reforms , and did not privatize most of inefficient state-owned enterprises , but instead tried to remain a weird socialist-capitalist hybrid well into mid 1990s . 
   you know this is true . 
  it is n't . 
   if anything , the initial industrialization of the 1930s was by all accounts ( even modern accounts ) as rapid as it was planned . 
  yeah , the only cost were millions of cold , dead bodies , but we have already established that communists do n't value human life or dignity in the slightest . 
  all according to the plan . 
   revolution was supposed to be worldwide , thank god the brave polish soldiers put this sick plan to the rest at the gates of warsaw in summer of 1920 . 
   s to stop this from happening . 
  even when the people 's republic of poland was established , the eastern bloc first had to rebuild ( as all were devastated ) what was there previously and inefficiency of the communist economic system certainly did not make that task easier . 
   ted . 
  all the while the capitalist bloc ( mainly the us ) could just build on what it already had yeah , we all know that west germany somehow got away completly unscratched from the ww2 ... oh , wait . 
   and even then - the eastern bloc only had half of germany on its side . 
  ... and somehow managed to turn their half of mighty , rich , powerful germany into * utter shithole * . 
  communists truly posses a reverse midas touch . 
   okay , let me spell this out for you . 
  communism did n't end , because it never began . 
  you could say the end of socialism , but ` end of communism ' is uneducated . 
  end of communism as in `` the end of any significant portion of the population treating the very idea of communism as something different than a cruel and unfunny joke from the past '' . 
   proving human beings can survive in space by actually sending one up ? 
  at that point , it was already proven dozens of times by americans and soviets since almost 20 years . 
   you ca n't really use gdp per capita for a comparison of capitalist vs socialist economies . 
  but i just did . 
  you ca n't demand to play the game only where it suits you . 
  if anything , your chart shows in 1950 the socialist government was already in power for 3 years and you will see that the wealth kept up all the way until the late 1970s and then it crumbled under its own weight . 
  and it was n't particularly good before that either . 
   you 're also forgetting all those other nations were part of the oecd ( run by the us , which controls the majority of ocean trade through its naval power ) , which essentially was an endless piggy bank and promoted such programs as the marshall plan ( ie bribe european loyalty with higher quality/more material goods than the eastern bloc could produce ) we also could ( and wanted ) to be a part of those programs , and profit from participation in them . 
  alas , our soviet masters and occupants prevented us from doing so . 
   you mean 25 years of us/eu nations constantly pumping funding in to make russia ( and poland 's socialist past ) look bad ? 
  it was terrible enough in itself there 's no need to * make * it * look * bad , but ... thanks for that anyway i guess ? 
   why else is n't that money being pumped into latin america/africa , where people are poorest & suffer most ? 
  i 'm actually quite sure * lots * of money is being pumped there . 
   's a right , then why do n't most people have any private property that they regularly trade for profit ? 
  it 's a right to retain ownership of thing that belong to you and not have them stolen by someone else . 
   you confusing private property with personal property ? 
  the idea of personal property is contained within the idea of private property . 
  you think you 're better/deserve more , because you 're european ? 
  considering that europe was the most developed continent in the world for the last few centuries ( only recently it was overtaken by parts of north america ) , i think i can at least * expect * more . 
   why was shitty about it ? 
  why ? 
  because soviets came here , forced their quislings in power , and for 44 years tried to impose on us their crappy and inefficient system nobody wanted . 
   you act as if the western capitalist states did n't invade the soviet union during the october revolution ( in a bid to preserve capitalism ) , you act as if bolsheviks did not try to invade the rest of the world in 1919-1922 period , in a bid to spread communism ( fortunately for the rest of the world , mostly failing ) . 
   including poland - with real genocidal intent . 
  yeah , the 130,000 poles murdered during the 1937-38 genocide of poles , 1,000,000 of poles deported to siberia and central asia ( with severe death toll ) as a result of 1939 soviet invasion and occupation of poland , and 22,000 polish officers ( members of an army belonging to the allied powers ) officers executed by soviet union in 1940 certainly took solace in the fact that their soviet opressors mass-murdered them with an `` imaginary '' genocidal intent . 
   if there was a lack of opportunities , then why were there ` same ' outcomes at all ? 
  you 're still disingenuous . 
  the point was that the economy was not as developed , hence why the 1918 world revolution needed to unite germany and russia - and why poland was the bad guy in that situation . 
  i do n't see how a failure of your evil ideology to devour an even bigger part of the world than it did would be a * bad * thing . 
  and wth the countries destroyed in ww2 , there were obviously much less opportunities than if all three united ( and the other half of germany ) in 1919 . 
  what a disastrous vision !, 
  the agony of communism would most likely take a few years longer in such case , and prolonging the communist experiment even for a day longer than it lasted would be already an inmeasurable tragedy . 
   oh , you were expecting luxurious picturesque italian-style villas all along the countryside and nyc-style skyscrapers in the cities ? 
  no , i was expecting our cities continuing to be built in the same way they were built before the ww2 . 
  alas , the shitty soviet planning decided to permanently fuck our cities up . 
   how they event built those housing blocks is a miracle in of itself .

that 's right . 
  i somehow forgot that not every country joined the eu in 2004, 
  exactly . 
  unless all you care about is leaving country , you should check what is the best option within your academic and financial means . 
  if you want to study and then work in best uni/companies in europe ( or the world ) and your grades are sufficient ( not 30 % of the polish matura ) , you will probably want to look for the best , which is usually outside of poland . 
  they were both during my second year of high school , yes . 
  one was in a big german airline company that cooperated with my school and the other was a major american it company that cooperated with one of our local universities . 
  they were both about software development , but still pretty handy for a physics application . 
  this is why i did n't say impossible . 
  it varies a lot within universities . 
  some value ps 's a lot , some interviews and other just grades . 
  for example , i did n't make my offer ( my grades were lower than predicted ) , but still got in !, 
  there are so many factors , such as your nationality ( some unis put a lot of pressure on accepting international students rather than domestic ) , places available ( for example , when a-level students do really bad ) etc. 
  i 'd say if you 're connected to poland a lot and really do n't want to leave your friends and family , enrolling to a good uni and poland and then going on erasmus is a good idea . 
  it 's also much better than some crappy college in abroad . 
  in secondary school ( do n't mention primary school , it 's not particularly relevent ) , i did pretty good in the maths local ( kuratoryjny ) competition and computer science and english olympiads . 
  in high school i got into the regional stage of the economics olympiad and did pretty well in national robotics competition . 
  firstly , i wanted to study management , but i ended up in physics , so that 's why i took part in so many different subjects competitions . 
  but , imo , my internships were more important . 
  i took 2 one-year it internships in big companies , as well as had some cooperation with the local university for some projects . 
  they value stuff like this a lot . 
  get as much engaged in your subject as possible . 
  i would say scotland 's living costs are comparable to the rest of uk , so tuition fee is the main difference . 
  it used to be free for eu nationals , but they changed it this or last year . 
  [ edinburgh now charges # 1,820 per year ] ( http://www.docs.sasg.ed.ac.uk/fees/undergraduate_2016-2017.cfm?sorter=programme_name ) . 
  as for the loan , it is on good terms . 
  let 's say you got a good degree and start with # 28,000 pa ( per annum ) . 
  on these conditions , you earn # 2,333 per month and pay only # 52.5 of the student loan . 
  it 's closer to a phone bill than an actual ( e.g. 
  mortgage ) loan . 
  people usually call it `` education tax '' or sth similar . 
  as for living costs , you should look for maintenance loan/grant or bursaries . 
  the first one can only be provided to you from university , as the gov ' t grant is only for uk nationals . 
  there is also the maintenance loan , but if you ask me , it 's better to work a few hours on the weekends or evenings than taking another loan . 
  as for the bursaries , they 're similar to scholarships , you do n't need to pay them back and differ from uni to uni . 
  they 're usually based on your income and/or your grades etc , so you 'd need to look it up for a particular university . 
  unfortunately , i did n't qualify for any scholarships or bursaries in my university , so i rely solely on my job and parents ' money . 
  i did not get any scholarships whatsoever . 
  before i started uni , i worked a few weeks in england in a nasty-ass job to save some cash and now , i receive about # 500 a month ( 3,000 pln ) from my parents . 
  i applied for the tuition fee loan , which basically consisted of filling some forms and having a copy of my passport/id . 
  it took me a few weeks to find a part-time job , because i was kinda picky , but if you 're okay with working as a bartender/waiter/shop assistant , you should find a job in no-time . 
  there are loads of job opportunities on campus and if your uni is in the city , then it 's even better . 
  15-20 hours a week should be more than enough . 
  i 'd say both grades and personal statement ( british equivalent of a motivation letter ) are crucial . 
  look at the uni website or [ ucas ] ( http://search.ucas.com/ ) ( the uk 's application platform ) for suggested grades . 
  it is highly unlikely for you to get an offer if you do n't meet these minimum requirements , so talk to your teachers before you apply and ask them what your predicted grades might be . 
  personal statement is mostly about showing your interest in the subject ( i 'd say 80 % ) and your general personality and hobbies ( 20 % ) . 
  it 's usually a good idea to mention some of the books you 've read , taster sessions etc. 
  work experience/internships/some interest in work or education , competitions and olympiads are totally necessary if you 're thinking of applying to the top 5 unis in your subject . 
  otherwise , they 're very welcome , but you can still get an offer without them , provided decent level of the rest of your ps . 
  [ exactly . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ia5ykzfz-_4 ), 
  in england ? 
  not really . 
  it 's not that big of a deal and usually , you 're supposed to pay at least some part of it upfront , so if you do n't have # 9,000 ( or maybe just # 4,500 for the first half ) laying around , you 'll need to take a loan . 
  i am a polish student who did international baccalaureate in high school and now lives and reads in one of the best universities in the uk . 
  ama !, 
  ( or pm ) basically , if you 're interested in living and working abroad , it 's a good idea to study in the country of your destination . 
  mind you , studying in a bad university in e.g. 
  france when you 're interested in working in e.g. 
  germany is much worse than a good university in poland . 
  you should focus on what course you want to do and then look for best unis for this course in your country of interest/eu . 
  as for the language certificates , it really varies from country to country ( and sometimes from uni to uni ! ) . 
  in general , in the uk , if you 're holding a ib diploma ( and probably a-levels too ) , you do n't need ielts ( preferred certificate for internationals ) . 
  answering your questions : 1 . 
  as i said in the beginning . 
  now that eu is so unified with their job laws , many employers recognise foreign universities . 
  as i said , you should look more at whether the uni is widely respected and high in the national rankings for the course than if it is abroad . 
  [ costs of living differ greatly ] ( http://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/rankings_by_country.jsp ) from country to country . 
  as i can only speak for the uk , $ 380 is what i spend in a week , and i do n't live extravagantly . 
  what you would probably need to do is to work part-time ( as i do ) , work in the summer ( as i did too ) and/or scholarships ( either from poland : the gov ` t , charities , your school , your city , or from the university ) . 
  as for the loans , in england , you are guaranteed a tuition fee loan ( usually # 9,000 per year ) , as a eu national . 
  you start repaying it after you finish your studies , earn more than # 21,000 per year and it 's only a small fraction of the excess ( above the 21k ) . 
  i read somewhere that some people do n't even repay the whole loan ( it erases after 30 years ) !, 
  it really depends on where you 'd like to live and work in the future , what culture suits you , but i would suggest : the uk , germany , switzerland , netherlands and scandinavia . 
  the last two are a good choice economically , as they provide really nice financial support for international students . 
  when it comes to the uk , i would suggest the [ complete university guide ] ( http://www.thecompleteuniversityguide.co.uk/league-tables/rankings ) ranking and government sponsored [ unistats ] ( https://unistats.direct.gov.uk/ ) , but be careful with guardian !, 
  they have some very vague methodology and many universities recommend to disregard it . 
  if you still have questions ( and i bet you do ) , feel free to ask !, 
  this is going to be probably one of the most important decisions of your life and deadlines are close ( or it can be even too late for some unis ) !, 
  the same with setting up eu at all . 
  having open borders ? 
  sharing currency ? 
  we have our ups and downs , but the general trend is to unify and connect more and more . 
  why eu collapse ? 
  i know the trends show a kind of decline in general satisfaction , but still , introduction of many legislations allowed the ( mostly less developed ) states to grow and connect tighter . 
  i know what you mean . 
  when you look at the polls , usually younger people are more supportive of the eu , but we still do n't have any adults that grew up in countries as members of the eu . 
  i also feel polish , but also european . 
  i do n't think the patriotism goes away after making tighter connections with your neighbours . 
  it 's much different than the american states . 
  we still have our cultures etc , but it does n't mean we ca n't pay in the same currency or share some laws, 
  we still have many crucial federal laws , a federal government , 19 out of 28 states share a currency , basically open borders etc. 
  imo , setting up a federal state does not quite mean giving up sovereignty . 
  the 51 % for pollsters raises some serious doubt about reliability of the poll itslef, 
  before the eu parliament elections in 2014 , [ jaros\u0142aw wa\u0142\u0119sa ] ( http://www.europarl.europa.eu/meps/en/96774/jaroslaw_walesa_home.html ) visited my city and said that the eu is going to become a federal state , somehow similar to the u.s. , but not exactly like it . 
  i 'm mostly wondering if the eu will be considered a country in the near future . 
  to an extent , it 's already happening , e.g. 
  the eu is a member of g7 , it is recognised as an observer state of the un . 
  something similar to softball

  you really need special skills in mental gymnastics to turn this clusterfuck of polish diplomacy into a success . 
  yay , we isolated ourselves in eu . 
  like - literally nobody supports us . 
  great achievement . 
  it 's likely not even achieving that . 
  their hardcore supporters will vote them anyway , and the less loyal believers can sometimes see through the bullshit and constant narration changes ( wyszegrad 4 for the win / wyszegrad 4 are traitors/orban the great - orban the traitor/tusk has no power - tusk is responsible for brexit and refuges ) . 
  not really . 
  tusk returning on white horse from being 2-times eu council president just in time for polish presidential elections is stuff from kaczy\u0144ski nightmares . 
  it 's not . 
  presidents in europe have little power in general , it 's mostly about prime ministers . 
  i kinda want them to try #polexit . 
  the way they handled wo\u015ap and tusk we might end up with poland as eternal eu capital , 
  except poland , because kaczy\u0144ski is still salty about that one defeat 10 years ago . 
  britain is lucky to even got 1 referendum ( the 1975 one - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/referendums_in_the_united_kingdom#1975_european_communities_membership_referendum ) . 
  and now ( last year ) it wants another ? 
  dream on . 
  the hipocrisy of brexiters who are against scotland independence gets me every time . 
  it 's delicious . 
  today waszczykowski ( foreign ministry of poland ) said in one interview : `` tusk 's office has no real power in eu '' , and `` brexit and refuges crisis are tusk 's fault '' . 
  pis ( and waszczykowski especially ) contradicts itself all the time . 
  just 2.5 years more . 
  in case of democracy people who do n't believe in any of that bullshit are fucked too . 
  mostly because ( like me ) they voted parties that agree with their beliefs the closest , instead of voting the party that had a chance to stop pis . 
  i wo n't make that mistake again . 
  why ? 
  you do n't have to believe in everything party x says to vote them . 
  there 's only about 10 parties that have any chances to get to parliament , and millions of possible sets of beliefs . 
  it 's not an insignificant detail , because you try to portrait poles as concerned about too much refuges moving from poland to germany , which they are n't . 
  in fact the anti-immigration poles i know would be very happy if all refuges moved from poland to germany . 
  nah , not all their voters agree with 100 % of their propaganda . 
  some just want 500 + for example . 
  so you say if you define `` poles ... their country '' as eu , then there is no contradiction  i agree . 
  but why should i redefine words in such way ? 
  that 's what happens when one person rules the whole country and has no responsibility attached . 
  kaczy\u0144ski is n't even in the government , he just plays with his toys . 
  the sad thing is - like 20 % of poles believe that . 
   as for refugees from the middle east . 
  poles do n't want them in their country because they know that they will probably stay here forever compare to https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5yauc1/poles_in_favour_of_strengthening_collaboration_in/dep6kgz/?st=j025r32c&amp;sh=09213b4c  over half of syrian refugees in poland left to germany already how do you expect us to keep them here ? 
  put them in jails ? 
  do you see the contradiction ? 
  meh , it 's ok now . 
  i lived on and off in warsaw and lublin for last few years , and while i much prefer lublin , warsaw is ok . 
  it 's just not a very touristy city ( except for huge museums ) . 
  btw well-renovated , and positioned commie blocks are a ok . https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7525/16140144392_890288d1b8_b.jpg the problem begins when they are built between historic buildings . 
  but in the same way any great building can be bad in the wrong context . 
  me neither tbh , that period was a clusterfuck , and is glossed over even in polish schools except for a few key events . 
  i read about it because there was a great book series `` boles\u0142aw chrobry '' by antoni go\u0142ubiew . 
  reads like game of thrones ( 100s of characters , pov switches between them every few pages ) , but most of the events and characters are real or at least probable . 
  you just have to overlook a dose of catholicism propaganda , but other than that it 's great . 
   how do you expect us to keep them here ? 
  put them in jails ? 
  one thing is how , another thing is `` do we want to '' . 
  most poles do n't , let 's be honest , even if it makes sense politically and strategically . 
  and the obvious solution would be to pay other countries to keep their refuges there if we do n't want them or ca n't keep them . 
  but try to win elections in poland with that proposal  the only way to win elections is to insist poland will only take from eu and wo n't give back anything , and to complain about how eu is abusing poland at the same time . 
  so that 's what politicians say . 
  polish people were more pro-choice regarding abortion in 1990 than now . 
  and more pro-lgbt . 
  and more pro-refuges . 
  in fact when there were russian-chechnyan wars in 90s most poles were highly pro-refuges and there were over 50 000 refuges from there over the years . 
  you do n't get much more muslim than chechnya , yet there were no instances of muslim terrorism in poland , ever . 
  in the meantime there was massive campaign against refuges ( mostly showing how stupid west is to invite muslims and how they are all terrorists and rapists ) . 
  there was a huge church offensive ( religion in the schools since 1st class , with opt-out that is quite inconvenient ) . 
  abortion debate was restarted every time government changed and it wanted to hide real problems , and each time church portrayed the poilticians who were pro-choice as devils , and each time the consensus moved towards `` no abortion at all '' . 
  there 's nothing constant , society is quite easy to manipulate over time . 
  i can easily imagine polxit in 10 years if the circumstances are `` right '' . 
  poland is n't more male-dominated than spain . 
  it takes time to move troops . 
  the troops that are in baltic states are not enough to repel attack from the troops russia has in kalingrad oblast and mainland russia near baltic states . 
  it 's not my conclusion , it was in nato report linked in this subreddit a few years ago . 
  you can bite the bullet and fix what 's wrong or suffer indefinitely . 
  it 's exactly as much related as ukraine or belarus . 
   and europe could easily win that war with the combined budget it has today . 
  russia invades baltic states . 
  a week later they are conquered . 
  russia threathens to use nukes on anybody that wants to defend them ( which would involve re-invading them from poland or sea ) . 
  what can nato/eu do to prevent that ? 
  also when a hospital goes bust - wo\u015ap is technically only renting the equipment , so it just moves it to a different hospital . 
  if it was owned by the hospital it would be sold to cover debts . 
  i 'd say the whole anti-wo\u015ap campaign in national media worked miracles , 
  because of the worldview of the guy behind this organisation . 
  he 's very liberal , his most famous saying is `` r\u00f3bta co chceta '' ( do what you want in youth slang ) . 
  owsiak is one of the last widely respected liberal celebrities in poland - a thing that church and pis ca n't stand . 
  hence the campaign of insults and accusations of various kinds . 
  hard to say , because it 's `` around year 1000 '' , and around that year there were 3 polish-german wars . 
  i guess it shows the territories that were fought over at the time ? 
  the map is inaccurate anyway , there 's much more detailed map ( in polish only - the red line is 1025 borders , the dark pink is 992 borders , the light pink is regions joined between 992 and 1925 , and the orange is temporarily joined and lost regions . 
  https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/historia_polski_ ( do_1138 ) # / media/file : polska_992 _ - _ 1025.png, 
  would you protest if somebody painted a map with `` italian empire '' in 50 a.d. ? 
  that 's basically what this map is doing , 
   and why do men feel they need to be `` providers '' in the first place ? 
  that 's entirely cultural , aka : related to how they 're raised . 
  it 's not only men . 
  both sexes expect more of men . 
  you would have hard time finding men that dream of being vanity marriage partner , but you can find many such women , for one example . 
  much more women would n't marry unemployable guy than the other way around . 
  nobody will say you 're `` not a real women '' if you pursue a career , or stay at home to care for kids . 
  men have less options if they care for the society opinion . 
  you 're making it seem like it 's only the way the men are raised that 's the problem , when it 's not . 
  a straight guy that wants to have a family has to worry about being a provider for the family , even if he was n't raised that way , because most potential partners expect him to .

  they should n't be considered different communities , they are one minority of commonwealth tatars that happened to live in former commonwealth land ` couse plc no longer exist . 
  tatars are well respected in polish society , for example some bastard made pigs graffiti and wrote something like `` death to islam '' etc. 
  on walls of their 400y . o. 
  wooden mosk . 
  polish nationalists found those guys leaved them by police station and gathered money for mosk renovation . 
  our immigration policies are n't that strict as many might think . 
  we let in over 400k ukrainians on limited time worker visa ( they can work for one employee for 6 months ) . 
  all you need to find is an employee ( or agency ) that 'll employ you , that 's it . 
  our refugee policies are strict , but thanks to that we receive only genuine ones , not `` money hunters '' . 
  we just do n't care of political corectness . 
  if you wan na come , please come , all you need to do is to respect our culture and traditions and do n't expect better treatment ` couse you 're from middle east/africa . 
  we treat all of migrants from outside eu and without karta polaka ( pole 's card - document confirming polish roots ) the same , does n't matter if you 're from balkans , middle east , far east etc. 
  comparing to what western europe is doing , it actually work . 
  whait , so you 're saying that it 's better to kill people in the name of pedophile from some shithole desert in middle east , than in free elections elect party that 'll do what they actually said they 'll do ( which means we 're no longer germany 's bitch ) ? 
  damn dude , that 's just #leftistlogic, 
  it 's not like they actually do something and are not afraid to stand up against muslims . 
   introduce mandatory catholic religion high school exams . 
  national employment program for youth , new minimum wage . 
  source please  support unique and paramount role of catholic church did n't sld ( former communist party during polish people republic ) wrote constitution , where catholic church were give special role in poland  increase military spending from 2 % to 2.5 % of gdp it wo n't hurt us . 
   national and moral renewal , put a stop to dominating anti-patriotic and revisionist re-writing of polish history inscribing in poles the feeling of shame and guilt . 
  the mission for public media , according to pis , is to further build national identity , support patriotism by creating appropriate content , educate the citizenry what 's wrong in building strongly patriotic ( not nationalistic or chauvinistic ) society , society that loves their culture , country , history ? 
   higher taxes for ( foreign-owned ) banks and mega stores , lower income tax for small business ( which is like 50 % of our pkb\u0107omment of mine ) . 
  higher taxes for ( foreign-owned ) banks and mega stores . 
  put a stop to taking over the media by foreigners . 
  ` defend polish soil ' and prohibit foreigners from buying land in poland this is to make it easier for polish business in poland . 
   enhance social security program for farmers , 500 zl per each child for families with low income , free prescription drugs for seniors this is purely socialism  investment credit for businesses introducing polish technology oh no !, 
  we will invest money to create our own technology , how dare they do it ?!, 
   more powers for the security apparatus ; weaken privacy laws . 
  in favor of a presidential system where president has wide ranging powers including nomination and recall of judges . 
  tough on crime : going after corporate tax dodgers , pedophiles . 
  here they 're strictening the law . 
  now please tell me at which points , exept for those marked by me as `` pure socialism '' their ideas looks to you as national-socialist . 
  he was surveilled by communist secret police during operation hyacinth . 
  law and justice learnt a lot from their mistakes in 2005-07 , also we may like or do n't like their leader mr. kaczy\u0144ski , but he 's very intelligent , well-educated ( phd in law ) man , who from hated oposition became pretty much unofficial ruler of poland . 
  it 's more like #justslavicthings, 
  they 're kind of winter war best world player , ask russians ,, 
   literally nowhere and no festivities are safe from the reach of islamic fundamentalists not in so-called `` eastern europe '' , we do n't have that problem , 
  like israel in 1940s ? 
  transnistria is a `` self governing '' ( russian depentent ) piece of land ( 200x15km ) that is officially part of moldova . 
  it 's population of ~ 500k is almost 1/3 of moldovans , 1/3 of russians , 1/3 of ukrainians . 
  russian army ( ~ 1800 of both active and civilian personel ) station there as guarancy of their `` independence '' .

  same word we use for ( living/bed / ( ... ) ) '' - room '' . 
  in older polish ( like xix-early xx century ) `` rozb\u00f3jnik '' - thug , but in modern polish we use word `` bandyta '' as a thug , however word `` rozb\u00f3jnik '' is still well known . 
  actually since polish-lithuanian commonwealth times catholic church was something that helped poles stand together , it was uniting us . 
  during the partitions of poland catholic church was helping poles preserve our culture and language . 
  during interwar period , church was investing in young poles from poorer communities , creating for eg . 
  such organisation as polish catholic patriotic organisation in eastern poland , where young poles ( of both genders ) could get education on how to properly menage their money , land , on our history etc. 
  during communists rule catholic church was uniting poles again , and pope 's pilgrimages to poland where very important for poles . 
  i 'm an atheist ( not anti-theist , just non-believer ) and i fully understand how important role catholic church played in our history , how important role it has now , many of my non-believers friends share this view . 
  yeah , when germany will pay us 2nd ww reparations ( last time i checked something about 845 trilions us$ ), 
  looks like you should ` couse democratic eu is too much for german chancellor and german press to take . 
  we had but 1-1 ,5 mln people left our country ,, 
  for canada it 's different because it 's built by migrants , you ca n't compare old countries like poland , ireland , to former colonies like canada , usa etc. 
  nigeria is mix of many tribes , like most of subsaharian africa . 
  uae have over 80 % , but you ca n't stay there if you are over ~ 63 and the only way to get citizenship is to have parent that 's a citizen of uae . 
  you 're right , that 's why we 're getting closer with china , with our own , central-eastern europe region in 16 +1 initiative where poland leads the 16 and warsaw bacome capital of it . 
  we 're cooperating like never before with v4 . 
  we know we ca n't rely upon uk , france and germany , especially when they 're getting unstable , state is helping our companies in africa , our president is doing what he can with china and china truly understand us ` couse west made them west 's bitch for some time too . 
  we 're getting cheap labor from ukraine so pretty much no gettos and no muslim related crimes . 
  we blocked climatic agreement ` couse our energy sector is coal based and firstly we pretty much ca n't afford anything else , secondly we have world 10th coal resources and it would be stupid if we did n't use them . 
  so yeah , except for taking care of national pride we started to take care of our economical and geopolitical interest too , sorry west , 
  how can one once say `` yeah , everything 'll be just fine we 'll treat you like equal partners '' and then use funds that he established to make us their bitch ? 
  how does it work ? 
   our new government ( elected last month ) is full of orthodox catholics and they do n't like the eu for giving rights to gay couples and other ungodly rules . 
  they 're not fans of eu for viewing poland as junior partner , not like equal partner like they said they 'll . 
  also `` giving rights to gay couples '' is internal state policy and have nothing to do with eu . 
   to stop a play at some theatre because the script contained a sex scene that would be performed by two porn actors . 
  yeah , becouse state payed for it . 
  he also say it 's not a problem if it 's funded by private investor/investors but our state have more important expenses like army or family-oriented financial policies . 
   public television journalist was suspended for asking him `` in an aggressive way '' about this case on air . 
  during 16 minutes she interrupted him 52 times , that 's about 3 times per minute , quite a lot . 
   if we define western to mean `` derived from europe '' in eu most common definition is west from odra river , but truly it 's most likely west from vistula river not just `` from europe '' . 
  our values cames from our traditions based on specific mix of neverending wars , paganism/christianism and love to freedom . 
  our society is not mutli-ethnic anymore thanks to west . 
  and thank god it 's not as pc as western societies are . . our language , well it 's definitelly western slavic , pretty much between previosly define west and east . 
  what do you mean by '' your economy '' and `` your government '' ? 
  plus we feel there are very little positive stuff beetween us and west , they 've almost always stabbed us in our back . 
  polish society and german society have different definitions of `` free speech '' and yours have very little to do with freedom . 
  poland is neither west or east , never was , we are one of a kind mix . 
   free speech is about governmental control of speech you see , in poland free speech is kind of part of our traditions , we love freedom , even more than safety , it 's better to die as man than live as a slave . 
  free people are aware that if they 'll say something unappropriate there might be consequences , but not from state , no sir . 
  from other citizens who might not like it/it could hurt them and i do n't mean violence but for e.g. 
  court . 
  my freedom ends when yours begin and vice versa but no govermnent should tell me where yours freedom begin , you should stand for yourself if you 're offended , go to court and demand apology , but do n't try to limit our freedom . 
  plus in some speedway cities like rzesz\u00f3w , gorz\u00f3w wielkopolski or zielona g\u00f3ra speedway is at least as popular ( to watch ) as football . 
  if you wan na go it/or some building stuff just go to politechnika wroc\u0142awska ( wroclaw technical university ) , it 's respected all around the world + it 's one and only uni in poland that get 's you visa to australia right after geting engineering deegre . 
  for about 600-700 z\u0142 ( 150-180e ) you can get a single room in wroc\u0142aw , for other 800 z\u0142 ( ~ 200e ) you can easily live if you do n't smoke cig 's and do n't party a lot . 
  for 5-6z\u0142 ( 1,25-50e ) you can get beer in the pub and there 's a lot of pubs . 
  plus i really recommend it , if you wan na go for software developer or website engineer wroclaw technical uni and wroc\u0142aw itself is great place for start . 
  yea , but this poll is ` bout middle eastern ` fugees , op 's is ` bout refugees in general . 
  we are not against taking people from ukraine , a lot of them came here running away from war or poverty , but not as '' ` fugees '' but as migrants , however before all this russian-ukrainian conflict there was about 51k ( 2011 data ) ukrainians in poland , now it 's over 0.5 mln so you can easily see connection here . 
  especially when german politicians says so . 
  why `` radicalized '' ? 
  we just do n't wan na some people in our country and it 's our right to say `` no , you 're not allowed '' . 
   democratic zie jokes on you . 
   lithuania 's polish-speaking community it 's not like they 're just poles ( not polish speaking minority ) who lived in region of lithuania ( southern part of country of lithuania and northern belarus ) who 're living there since like xv-xvi century . 
   if it was forced then it counts . 
  was it ? 
  during plc ( 'till 1796 ) it was n't , we were just the strongest culture and biggest nation in commonwealth , however during the 2nd polish republic ( 1918-39 ) we were polonising not by forcing but by giving to other option .

you 've forgotten about v ** [ isengard ] ( http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/6172/1554461-img7444a9.jpg ) **, 
   korean and japanese are out of the game for diesel engines . 
  hopefully they will stay out of that game , especially japan car makers . 
  since renault/nissan and psa dropped their lovely v6 engines now virtually only lexus is capable of making some interesting petrol ( well , hybrid and they dumped the best v8 engine in thwe world from gs430 exchanging it with inferior hybrid v6 but still better than any small turbocharged pseudoecological engine ) engine . 
   or how about the fact that the ussr invaded and pretty much raped and occupied eastern europe for half a century and you still wo n't admit it was wrong oh , do n't you know ? 
  we were * liberated * by glorious soviet russia ; s and ribbentrop-molotov is just a nazi propaganda !, 
  fixed , thanks , 
  nord stream is just an another example of famous german-ruled eu 's solidarity . 
  i hope visegrad group will follow such example and behave in a similar way , at least when it comes to german affairs . 
  edit : visegard/visegrad . 
  i wish that could happen , really . 
  if all people from eastern europe working now in western europe would go back to their homelands you could easily employ all those new immigrants without hesitation ... https://i.imgur.com/dqta8d4.png, 
  ptsd man , just blame ptsd . 
  i wish all ukrainians could be as reasonable as you ( btw , poles too ) , together we could create much stronger opposition to russian aggression . 
  do you really compare polonization with [ volhynian genocide ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/massacres_of_poles_in_volhynia_and_eastern_galicia ) ? 
  besides , polonization happened hundreds of years ago ( we even do n't want lvov anymore , keep it and have fun ) and some ukrainians are praising bandera now , in 2015 , can you spot the difference ? 
   i could also point out upper silesians as a largest ethnic minority in poland , but as far as everyday life goes - they are no less polish than anyone in that 96 % majority ( despite of what largest opposition party leader tried to imply by saying that they are `` hidden german option '' whatever the fuck that means ) was n't that about [ silesian autonomy movenent ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/silesian_autonomy_movement ) ? 
  i can not recall now , but even he would n't be so stupid to call all silesians like that , would he ? 
  same here . 
   most energy comes from internal sources just make sure there are no any russian minorities popping near those sources . 
  we 're improving pretty fast , our emigrants are doing many ` real ' jobs now , not only those basic ones , we 're getting ( slowly , but still going forward ) more and more wealthy so it 's not that bad , we 're just lagging those 50 years . 
  i do n't know how it would end if hitler would won ww2 - maybe every single pole w 'd be eradicated , maybe not , honestly i do n't know . 
  what i wanted to emphasize is that being ` liberated ' and occupied by soviet russia is n't something that can be treated as good thing , we 've escaped one shitty regime just to fall into another and we will have to spend a lot of time to get rid of its traces . 
  instead our development has virtually stopped for 50 years and now we are europe 's poor brother good for cleaning british toilets . 
  we have also another gift from our eastern brothers - broken society - no rspect for public property , no good law , nobody trusts our government , no true political class and so on . 
  we will be rebuilding that for another 50 years just to ( maybe ) get to current western europe development level . 
  of course that is still better than being dead , but not much better . 
   while the american umbrella is nice , i do n't like the feeling of being dependent . 
  nobody does , we too . 
  almost nobody here belives in real support in case of some war against russia ( or little green men coming here ) - we know how it ended last time  - but for now only official politics count . 
   and being paralysed by fear of fsb is not good either . 
  that 's what they want , do n't indulge them . 
  build up your counter-intelligence and regain some confidence . 
  we are trying , but getting out of russian influence is not that easy , you know that . 
  being independent is not a binary switch , in theory we are independent since 1989 but in reality that is a long way to go , i hope we are at least halfway . 
  currently we are trying to build our own nuclear power plant and it goes really bad , maybe it will be finished in 2026 . 
  possessing nuclear weapon is doable only for strong , independent countries and we are still far too weak ( maybe even not so financially/technically but rather politically , no current superpower would allow us to do that ) for that , maybe in 20-30 years it will be real but not now . 
  unfortunately , we are probably still too deeply penetrated by russian fsb so such thing would never succeed . 
  even if we eventually get rid of russian influences our american masters wo n't allow that , that would be a total disaster for their politics so such thing would be very nice for us ( or virtually any other eastern europe nation ) but that is totally impossible . 
   that been said a freelancer with a gross income of 20k $ is below poverty threshold everywhere in europe yet you still fall into [ second tax band ] ( http://www.migrant.info.pl/personal-income-tax-pit.html ) in poland ( 32 % , virtually no tax deductions ) when you earn more than 85k pln which makes 20.3 k $ . 
  just like all countries conquered and occupied by soviet russia , i wish we could get those 50 years back ... 
  even if so than we 've got several confirmations that he said one thing and done someting another . 
  duda is doing things that typical socialist would do , that 's nothing strange and we can not expect virtually anything positive from him , but now it 's hard to tell he is worse than tusk ( except tusk was pm and done different things ) , maybe few years later that will be true , who knows . 
  exactly , tusk who many times proved how big liar he is ( higher vat only for one/two year ( s ) ? 
  going to brussels ? 
  and so on ) is compared to duda who well , have n't done anything till now - of course i do n't expect nothing from him , he is just another face of kaczynski but we 've got one confirmed liar with bad background vs probably liar with bad background . 
  i 'm against him too and did n't vote for him - who sane supports socialists ? 
  but saying dt who ruled for several years and proved what kind of man he is and still claiming he is better than ad or any other politician ... that 's just ridiculous , who except trolls or cp members can do that ? 
  wow , i did n't expect civic platform trolls here on reddit , nice job pal . 
  just for reference , in case of any ` polish death camps ' and similar bullshit history version lovers : [ german provocation ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gleiwitz_incident ), 
  err , that image is inaccurate , at least for poland . 
  here 's why : polish minimal wage in 2013 was 1181 pln net monthly ( in 2015 it is 1286,17 pln net monthly ) . 
  for all you westerners - yes , that 's not an error , it is ~ 300 $ monthly . 
  that 1181 net makes 1600 gross and it makes number from that chart ( 1181/1600 = 0.73 ) but that is not full gross amount !, 
  real gross cost is 1929 pln so it is almost ** 40 % ** . 
  for 2015 it is 1286 net / 2110 gross = 39 % tax sorry for polish source but all english calculators seem not to include that difference in their calculations : http://wynagrodzenia.pl/kalkulator_oblicz.php, 
  poland is great to visit from time to time but not so great if you live there and feel all things that are unnoticeable on vacation - low wages , overgrowth bureaucracy , constant law changes , virtually nonexistent public medical healthcare and so on . 
  fortunately almost everything ( maybe except law ) is gradually getting better each year but you wo n't suffer almost anything of it as a tourist . 
  maybe they are training ` defensive invasion ' ? 
  or defence of russian minorities ? 
  or defensive response to aggressive scandinavian threats , i.e. 
  not submitting whole country to russia is a probably quite big threat to russia , is n't it ? 
  i mean physical gold  it 's just in case of bigger financial disaster , probably wo n't be useful but who knows what will happen in 20-30 years . 
  untracked due to possible [ gold seizure ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/executive_order_6102 ) in such times , that 's why i put there 10-20 % of my savings . 
  first , no debts above 2-3 % yearly rate . 
  then corporate bonds , etfs , stocks for investment . 
  gold for security , but it 's hard to obtain untracked gold so i do n't have much . 
  almost pure economy , many poles who live in poland and work for polish rates do n't earn enough to cover all expenses after moving out , if you would have to pay all you earn just for rent , utilities , food and clothes then you would think twice about that . 
  oh come on bfv , stop being so racist and islamophobic !, 
   most other european countires would obviously rather risk not offering protection to people that are deserving of it than accept a few criminals more in their countries . 
  that 's understandable , even that would n't be bad if those unwanted people ( real criminals , etc. , nothing * phobic ) would be swiftly expelled and/or judged . 
  now the perception is that they can do anything they like and wo n't response for that because they claim to be war refugees . 
  maybe that 's just wrong perception ( media will follow ` hot ' stories not some dull cases ) and reality does n't look like that ( well , new year 's eve in cologne and hamburg , calais case and several others definitely are n't helpful ) but that 's what is most feared here - that we will be forced to take thousands of people who can do anything here . 
   it has nothing to do with feeling inferior to these people that 's what i sometimes read or hear in our media or even from regular people . 
  sometimes they try to explain such behaviour with thinking like : ` those germans feel guilty for ww2 so now they try to repay for that by accepting anyone who will appear on their border . 
  great , but why we have to suffer because of them ' . 
   you do n't understand why we see it as a moral obligation to help refugees . 
  we do n't have virtually any objections to help real refugees , really . 
  the thing we do n't understand and can not accept is how can you take all people without doing any background checks and keeping all of them despite of problems they cause , just almost like you feel inferior ( in your own country ) to them just because they are not from europe so they have to be tolerated and their crimes ( yes , there might be some criminals in such number of people ! ), 
  have to be masked . 
  almost like you have to integrate with them , not they with you . 
  at least that 's how it looks from here , i 'm not saying it 's truth . 
   we have excellent , long-standing relations with these countries ( especially poland ) and not including them in the visa waiver program is simply a petty insult it 's rather just a way of showing where our place is . 
  * * well , besides that we still exceed yours rejection rate limit ( 10 % ) , it was about 10.8 % last year ( and something about 9.6 the year before ) but since the us are not anymore a ` safe haven ' for us like it used to be in 80 ' and 90 ' this rate should drop in next few years , more people ( especially average joes looking for a simple job just for living ) just move within the eu . 
  is that real ? 
   but i strongly object to calling soviet crimes russian crimes . 
  that 's not that russians are hated here , if something is hated then it 's the soviet state and its apparatchiks , russians are pretty liked here - at least unless they 'll start praising putin , ussr , etc. 
   from the us makes me grin . 
  i w 'd rather say it 's some putinbot claiming to be from the us or maybe living there , even stereotypical americans are n't so stupid , 
  but they are in europe now , are n't they ? 
  you know , i think they should adapt , not us . 
  after all , they are coming here , not us to them . 
  we already do that - we 're just exporting them to the uk , 
   you can see how easy people are riled up against foreigners every day at the moment . 
  when poles in germany will start burning your cars , assaulting women and destroying shops germany ** should ** at least expel them . 
  in theory , yes . 
  on the other hand , if i should take into account their licensing costs and all other factors then why they should not do the same thing ? 
  i would earn much more if i would do the same job i do now but in the us so they should lower price for me , should n't they ? 
  besides , 1 $ = 1 $ is a very popular misconception , simple example : yearly subscription for all jetbrains products costs 649 $ - but only in the us . 
  if you are from eu you have to pay 649 $ + vat .

  does not have any bearing on the agreement 1 . 
  this remains valid 1 . 
  does not have any bearing on the agreement 1 . 
  i do n't know how to interpret it that leaves concern 's of 6.8 % of voters unanswered , that looks pretty good . 
  the fragment you cite equates them :  lotnik made it clear that atrocities could be attributed equally to both sides , ethnic ukrainian and ethnic polish it 's true that there where atrocities on both sides , it is not true that they were equal in scale . 
  that 's the only part of that citation that i have problem with , since the rest is accurate . 
   and i am supposed to be more careful with my words . 
  everybody being more careful with their words would be good, 
  probably because you are equating killings that are separated by at least two orders of magnitude . 
  also a lot of people feel more strongly about it then i do . 
  i freely admit the wrong that happened and would love if the ukrainians did the same . 
  operation `` wis\u0142a '' was a shameful act of ethnic cleansing . 
  and the nationalist partisans that committed those killings were war criminals . 
  there is no point of defending those things . 
   the firsts sentence is simply false . 
  no against voter was eased . 
  the most things i heard about the referendum was voting against the government and not starting ukrainian accession process . 
  the first has no bearing on the agreement and the second was addressed . 
  so what did the against voters really want ? 
  to fuck over ukraine for shits and giggles ? 
  edit grammar, 
  it 's been a few years and the program has changes a bit but this is what i had . 
  most people probably do n't really remmmember much out of this . 
  * munich and the shameful role of poland with zaolzie * ribentrop-molotov , glevitz incident , start of the war ( westerplatte , shlesvig-holstein ) . 
  attack of the soviet union , fighting surrounded , escape of the government and troops through romania , end of fighting . 
  * strange ( phoney ) war * katyn , kharkov , miednoje , ostasov * barbarossa , stalingrad * underground state , partizans * german death camps * relations of the polish government in london with the soviet union * 1st polish army ( anders ) and it 's evacuation to to iran * 2nd polish army and how it 's made sure to be sent to the eastern front * basically skip 42 , kursk , the turning tide , operation bagration . 
  * warsaw ghetto uprising , * operation storm - partizans and underground move out into the open to free cities from retreating germans before the soviets come . 
  ended mostly with the soldiers executed or deportated by the nkvd . 
  this lead to concentrating the efforts on warsaw and thus : * warsaw uprising , death , sacrifice , terrible logistical position with the only supply coming in from raf flying from italy while the red army waits on the other side of the vistula not even allowing the allied planes to land and refuel . 
  ends with 220 k dead and a city destroyed . 
  * italy ( mostly battle of monte casino ) , normandy , market garden , festung breslau , battle of berlin * one lesson about the whole pacific , pearl harbor , americans , soviets in manchuria , hiroshima nagasaki , surrender . 
  * ankara , yalta , potsdam and how poland was left in soviet sphere of influence . 
  * forceful implementation of communism , falsified referenda and elections . 
  stalinist terrors ( with stalinists in poland lead by bierut ) i think that 's about it . 
   is there any way in poland that pis could either stop being in power they 've hit ( again ) great economy all around europe so even if they over extend financially they are not in danger from the economic front . 
  from the other side the anti quota stance only strengthens them . 
  if things go on as they are going now they will win reelection in 2 years , although possibly with a coalition partner , though that would actually mean an even stronger anti immigration stance . 
   being held accountable for finding a solution ? 
  they 'd be hard pressed to say no to a solution that mainly involves strengthening the borders and relocating migrants to north africa first before assessing and potentially granting their refugee status . 
  even if that solution required money and people from poland . 
  it would be basically what they asked for and i 'm pretty sure that it would help italy and greece more then the current one . 
  problem with pis right now is that they do n't really want a solution , they benefit domestically greatly from the from it . 
  and with how poorly the scheme is doing in countries that agreed to everything ( very little relocations ) and how problematic it is for the ones that protest ( since it only strengthens opposition to them ) i 'm sure this stopped being about solving the problem . 
  at this point the forcing of the quotas by the commission is either a power play or a genuine bid to force cee to to at least leave for the eea if not further . 
  this is a very frightening realization either way . 
   if everyone was to refuse it , greece and italy would stick with all the refugees simply because they 're at the coasts . 
  if the whole scheme would go as planned greece and italy would still be left 95 % of the migrants . 
  and the transfers are not really happening even to the countries that have no objections . 
  clearly the solution is not working and it has a huge political cost . 
   think that there is a huge unpopular factor attributed the current gov does it 's best to fan that unpopularity and to present themselves as the sole protectors of polish safety ( from refugees ) . 
  they 've dug in and they wo n't budge since this is the best place for them , effect on polish foreign relations notwithstanding . 
  you are right the plague spreaders do n't understand the risks ( or rather the lack of them ), 
  for some reason i expected the greeks to be orthodox crazies and read their 44 as 84 .

  we are second best in the group that 's not even that bad :d, 
  it 's not really about the economy but about the mismatch of the valuation of the pound vs the official rate . 
  the uk put itself in a position where the market value of the pound did not match the official rate , all he needed to do was bet against uk reserves bot being able to hold the value up , not against the whole economy . 
  well he did push uk over the edge . 
  though the uk brought the pound to that edge all on it 's own . 
  well he 's been funding solidarity in poland and other anticommunist movements since the cold war . 
  the best part is that the current nationalists in poland and hungary might have been funded by soros 30 years ago . 
  looks like moscow and st petersburg are doing okish it 's the rest that 's fucked . 
  new wave of british heavy metal has brought me joy for half my life so good job on that :d, 
   nice try , sweden . 
  deus vult more like this why are american anthems/hymns always 2 twice as slow as they should be ? 
  this version sounds much better https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfqlg0pyod8, 
  they showed up later that day for the voting ( the diet they get is based on their presence during voting ), 
   inosmi.ru - i do n't know about the baltic 's but the selection of polish articles is very cherry picked with a lot of articles from very fringe crackpot sources . 
  and the ones from major newspapers do n't really say anything controversial . 
  someone selecting the articles clearly has an agenda . 
   nato wan na trigger article 5 for a cyberattack . 
  no it means cyber attacks by state actors are till attacks , especially if they target critical infrastructure . 
  nato needs to prepare reaction plans and scenarios beforehand to be prepared . 
  specifically so an escalation going all the way to article v does not happen . 
  also why do you consider total thermonuclear war ( or bombing where ever ) the only option available as a response ? 
  this did not happen when syrians shot down the turkish phantom in 2012 or vice versa when the turks shot down that su-24 . 
  nor did anything happen when the russian militias shot down a nato passenger plane ( by accident most probably ) . 
  an adequate response is needed for every possibility . 
  when the next attack happens and people actually die there needs to be procedures to react ( or not react ) and how instead doing it ad hoc . 
   yes , i 'm aware of where my tax-money went . 
  to western banks , the main problem with the polish banking sector was that parent companies of polish banks drained them of cash because they invested in derivatives . 
  polish banks where to smart/to dumb to invest in those toxic papers sot where left mostly untouched by direct problems . 
  polish economy was not tied to the bubble of 2004-2007 and grew more slowly then then the rest of europe but also did n't fall when the bubble burst . 
  we agreed that we will recognise cyberspace as an operational domain , just like air , sea and land , '' probably about time , it 's been 10 years since russia attacked estonia after the debacle when they removed the `` liberator '' from the bridge . 
  ignoring this will not really help . 
   it is a lot easier to fight unemployment when you do n't have a growing demographic it 's also easier to have a growing economy when you have more people . 
   but it keeps shifting in a way that means we 're losing territory in poland we just exchange some land about each ten years with our neighbors that we have river borders ( so czechia germany belarus ) . 
  the river meanders so what is gained in one knee of the river is replaced by the next one so the net changes are small . 
  some time we gain some times we loose . 
  is the danube really against you ? 
  and the politicians are dependent on those tensions to move the blame away from their corruption and incompetence . 
  bih would also have to abandon the dayton agreement to pass the copenhagen criteria . 
  that 's a huge step and it wo n't happen soon . 
  well we actually expected cuts either way in the next budget . 
  quite lot of the prosperous regions have risen out of the poorer segments ( < 75 % eu average gdp ) and the larger cities are close to or over 100 % eu average . 
  we would n't get the same amount of funds regardless of conflicts with the eu . 
  nah impact is due to electromagnetism since that is what keeps matter together . 
  and they do n't use asians for them , check his further comment on what he meant or check the oxford dictionary for usage . 
  asians in the uk means pakistanis and hindus, 
  the point is that google wrote their own implementation of the java api using all of the names to make existing java code compatible .

  unfortunately most motorways near where i live are toll roads , or at least they are going to be toll roads soon . 
  you hear sometimes about lithuanian lorry drivers on the news , so i can believe that . 
  but i would still like the accident rate to plummet in the following years . 
  oh , and by the way these figures do n't account for the population . 
  there are 80 millions germans , but only less than 40 million poles . 
  it 's pjn , it was started by some outcasts from pis . 
  these people were so ridiculous that they had to leave their previous political party and start their own . 
  it tells you something about these people . 
  i do n't think it 's limited to constitution only as the uk does n't have one .

  that 's about it . 
  a slow week . 
  i 'm wondering how the hell your * szuka\u0107 * ended up meaning what it means . 
  i guess that in poland we use every possible form of red available . 
  i guess it 's due to use of ruski ( protobelarussian ) during the times of the polish-lithuanian commonwealth . 
  something a bit similar to * rdzawy * ( rusty ) ? 
  there was n't melting pot friday thread this week , was there ? 
  we use `` krwawa zorza '' more often , though ( bloody dawn ) . 
  in polish we use ` rudy ' exclusively for colour of hair and czerwony for most other things . 
  i wonder how do they use these words down south ? ( croatia ? 
  serbia ? ), 
  we still have to find something to get rid of them :(, 
  and even more useless if you have to assemble them when you are attacked . 
  provide the data , then !, 
  it 's original content , draft to that , which means that the creator of this map is open for suggestions . 
  i 've informed / u/unjung about this thread , so he should take that into account . 
  that 's exactly the rounding of the bill . 
  i think that people who are above 70 years old should retake their test every 3 years . 
  that 's the age when perception , vision and reaction times reduce significantly . 
  they might be the most dangerous because they keep on driving regardless of their limited driving abilities . 
  in krak\u00f3w we have these bell-shaped containers for segregated rubbish in quite a few places , if you want to , you could recycle . 
  now , however , it 's mandatory , so things are going to change . 
  europe ends at ural mountains ( according to the most common definition ) . 
  european part of russia is big , most maps of ` europe ' do n't actually include it . 
  to give you some numbers , according to the definition above it 's 10,180,000 km2 for europe , 9,826,675 km2 for the usa . 
  we have also had quite a lot of reforms and now the universities are thinking of reintroducing entrance exams . 
  i 'm not surprised , we do n't even have any calculus or linear algebra in curriculum . 
  the language exams are also very lax . 
  is the finnish lion screaming because he 's just stabbed himself in the face ? 
  europe is bigger than the whole us . 
  ukraine is roughly the size of texas for example . 
  not to mention that europe has more than twice the population of the usa . 
  do n't you have any mandatory language exams you have to sit , like high school leaving exams ? 
   we do n't actually learn english in the mandatory education which languages do you learn then ? 
  it seems like we have different definition of ` fun ' over here ;p, 
  actually from my family experience ( i know , anecdotal evidence , but still ) most of them do n't return . 
  since 2004 they all got citizenship , got married , have children who attend british schools . 
  the same thing happens with people who migrated to germany . 
  if they have children there , they are not going back . 
  i think that it would be reasonable to use the flair of the country you are currently living in , and changing text so that it would explain in what relations you are with other countries . 
  this is useful because you are probably well-aware of the situation in the country you are living in . 
  what if we only leave the politicians in ? 
  can we have warsaw limited just to the city and surrounded by a big wall and angry dogs ? 
  well * technically * i can only pay more for disposal . 
  with segregation it 's twice as much as it used to be , without - quadruple . 
  in poland there was recently a change in law which moves the responsibility of rubbish collection from individual households to the municipality . 
  as an effect the cost rose , in case of my household , twice . 
  and the city has been unable to provide containers for segregated refuse for more than a month now . 
  i guess it will increase segregation ( at least at individual households , some companies throw everything on one pile anyway ) significantly . 
  well , at least in some eu countries . 
  poland first of all , we have 3 types of contracts : 1 . 
  umowa o prac\u0119 , a job contract under which you are under protection of the labour code . 
  umowa zlecenie , a contract protected by civil code . 
  no employee rights , basically . 
  you have to perform job leading to a given target , but you do n't actually have to accomplish the target . 
  example might be maintaining a computer network . 
  umowa o dzie\u0142o , another contract protected by civil code . 
  you have to achieve given target , for example write a website . 
  is a trade union required for temp or part-time workers ? 
  no , it is n't . 
  is there a minimum income requirement ? 
  nope  3 . 
  is temporary or part-time work allowed ? 
  yes , but rules vary depending on type of contract  4 . 
  is temporary or part-time work common ? 
  quite common , especially among younger and older people ( on their pension )  5 . 
  what are the minimum and maximum allowed work hours per week ? 
  no minimum i 'm aware of , maximum depends on the type of contract - job contract ( umowa o prac\u0119 ) does n't allow forcing people to work more than 8 hours a day and on average 40 hours a week ( over the period of 4 months i think ) . 
  overtime , on average , ca n't be more than 8 hours a week ( extra paid of course ) and there aresome other restrictions which could easily exceed the character limit of this post . 
  what are the taxes for employers and workers ? 
  let 's assume umowa o prac\u0119 ( job contract ) . 
  i 'm going to copy my older entry . 
  types of insurance : - `` emerytalne '' ( retirement ) - `` zdrowotne '' ( health ) - `` rentowe '' ( disabilities ) - `` chorobowe '' ( if you are sick that 's from where the money is taken ) - `` wypadkowe '' ( in case of accident ) legend : - zus - that 's the branch of government taking care of your insurance ( or not ) - ofe - that 's a private account from where you ca n't take out your money ; it is going to be used to pay your pension . 
  you can inherit money from there , unlike from the government account . 
  9.76 % of your salary ( including bonuses ) is spent on `` emerytalne '' . 
  in fact , your employer pays another 9.76 % - but you do n't have to care about it as long as he pays it . 
  it adds up to 19.52 % of your salary . 
  2.3 % of your salary goes to ofe , and 12.22 % , goes to zus . 
  you might 've noticed that we 're missing 5 % .

lol, 
  did n't have enough coal today , mr. \u015alunzok ? 
  hahah murderous regimes and failed ideologies : - ddddd, 
  people celebrate killing their oppressors . 
  always have , always will . 
  plenty of countries involved in ww2 had resistance movements that carried out violent hits agains nazis and these are all seen with utmost pride today , just as an example since this could apply to pretty much every conflict ever . 
  this one just makes you feel icky because you specifically ca n't handle turks being seen that way , i guess . 
  2/10 , better get ready for mourning trump tomorrow instead of dropping shitty baits, 
  do you get triggered when people celebrate resisting nazi invasion and occupation as well , or do you have a specific thing for turks and the ottoman empire ? 
  nothing offensive or immoral whatsoever in cheering when invaders and occupiers die in violent ways . 
  build a time machine and tell your ancestors not to start this whole empire thing if you ca n't handle the thought of people being happy to see them gone . 
   all these discussions are full of people from `` europoor '' , who feel insulted that someone who has a de facto choice where to live chooses one of the rich ( er ) countries over theirs . 
  you 're misunderstanding the reactions here . 
  i do n't feel `` insulted '' at all ( i doubt anyone does ) because the immigrants do n't want to come here . 
  could n't really be happier about that . 
  what i 'm actually not happy with is how much time , energy , good will was wasted on the `` eastern yuro you have to take refugees because of solidarity or we cut off western funding '' talk while the immigrants do n't want to come here just as much as we do n't want them to come , and we could n't really do anything about that but keep them in locked up concentration camps . 
  the guy even agreed with you and you put him down like that , cold, 
   i 'm afraid i ca n't return the favor of knowing who you are that 's fully intentional . 
  as for the police , yes , it is completely unreasonable to expect that cops will willingly lay down their lives because of failed political decisions that make the danger involved in their job completely disproportional to their equipment , training and resources . 
  no amount of attempted sarcasm in your posts will change that . 
  i have to say , the tendency of leftists to treat cops like disposable meatbags is curious ( especially when they actually shoot some charging axe-armed abdul and you start crying how they should 've called his mom or offered him cookies instead ) but i guess it comes with the political beliefs . 
  hilarious how `` solidarity '' in this context seems to mean `` we get to make bad decisions and then everybody pays for them '', 
  just the right amount, 
   realistically speaking , once you think of all your friends , cousins and ex-neighbors living there , not with the `` neener , neener , i 'll say yes just to prove you wrong '' response . 
  this might just be the defining / u/vernazza post - you ask a question and then try to invalidate replies that do n't fit your views before they even come . 
  you 're quickly rising to be my favorite leftist shitposter on this whole sub , ever since you claimed french police should be happy to go get set on fire in muslim zones in paris because that 's their job , keep it up !, 
   it probably was a bad idea to hang people on trees : it did n't add legitimacy to this movement . 
  that 's funny , seeing as all legitimacy russian communists ever had came from murdering lots of people in many different ways . 
  why are the standards different ? 
  if no one was punished then it effectively was n't illegal ( or are you trying to tell me they spend 14 years hunting for gays and never managed to catch a single one ) , poland had much better things to do right after regaining independence ( like dealing with the soviets ) than designing a new code of law to replace a mostly functional one in order to remove every nonsensical law left there by the occupiers, 
  no , it was n't , since not a single person was ever punished through these inherited laws with the exception of homosexual prostitutes who were treated equally with heterosexual ones anyway . 
  look , i 'm not disagreeing with what you 're saying , but you understand that you 're wasting lots of time on replying to a troll account , right ? 
  i thought behemoth ( the band in question ) was straight up death metal but apparently they 're `` blackened death metal '' which is supposed to be a mix of both . 
  these genre classifications really go wild sometimes . 
  i still do n't see how behemoth is anything like venom or burzum but i 'll accept it, 
  these may be your worst comments yet and that 's quite an achievement . 
  heil national agrarianism !, 
  seeing as they were right and the opinion elsewhere is likely to catch up with that ( if it has n't already ) , i 'd rather still say visionaires, 
  true visionaires, 
  was i supposed to apologize for real ? 
  well sorry for not refugee welcomeing hard enough for your standards , oh enlightened western overlord . 
  more enrichment for you . 
   and those countries are just going to accept our navy ships in their waters ? 
  throw them some scraps and they will . 
  european economic superiority is such that we can make them do what we want at a fraction of the costs of the current mass immigration `` project '', 
  \\  do n't want mass immigration from third world countries \\  radical anti immigration views, 
  i actually went down to check and successfully bought a delicious sterni in one of these just now . 
  maybe they do n't give a shit here ( brandenburg ) ? 
  germany give back rightful west slavic land immediately , everything east of elbe would be a good start :\\ ^ ), 
  even the small places staffed with turks are closed today ? 
  are you writing that as a negative revelation about / r/europe or about muslims ? 
  out of curiosity , would you accept the same sentence if we replaced `` men '' with `` minorities '' in it or does it become haram then ? 
  the authors of this piece of crap are undeniably very far left , their `` credentials '' ( former stasi , holy shit ) were posted above . 
  either way i do n't see how the things you wrote here invalidate anything at all ? 
  they could print it on toilet paper for all i care , the content is still the same, 
  is anything in the summary actually misrepresented or is this your attempt at going `` blah blah ca n't hear you nazis '' ? 
   which quote exactly do i just paste the whole thing here ? 
  if you ca n't see the whole theme of the article to be just that , i ca n't help you . 
   they still kill immigrants , bomb fast foods , beat people up for being black . 
  and are blonde , cheerful and unobtrusive , do n't forget that . 
  i hope your local antifa squads can fuck up all these happy blonde kids before they can do some serious damage !, 
  if you kindly scroll up and press the posted link , you 'll find that it 's just a nice synthesis of the actual article , and unless the authors there pulled the biggest spin of all time or outright faked quotes ( which i assume is not true because one of you would 've called it out by now ) it ca n't be called anything but a guide on hunting for people of the `` wrong '' political orientation . 
   storm in the water glass here i did n't read the actual article ( if you mean the actual leftist publication , not the article linked here ) but i saw enough quotes . 
  you seem to be missing the point , the article is just completely absurd regardless if they meant to include the `` blonde '' part or not . 
  it 's a guide on hunting for people of the `` wrong '' political orientation for fuck 's sake , but then i have you tagged as `` king of leftism '' so i can imagine why you 'd consider it well written . 
  yes , let 's kick hungary out of the eu and bring 10 million muslims in instead , because hungarian culture just does n't work xd, 
  smug leftist greek abandons ship as all the faults of his complete drivel have been exposed !, 
  now who could 've expected that ? 
   countering 3 paragraphs our of 4 in that comment of yours are arguing against something i do n't support and i mentioned that very clearly , if that means `` countering '' in your circles then that explains a lot . 
  you might think that throwing around shit until some of it sticks is a good idea , but you will always end up handling much more shit than me this way . 
   of course i mock the brits for doing `` whatever they want '' aww , look at that . 
  have n't you just said `` we '' ca n't handle disagreement ? 
  and here it turns out your entire position is based on being angry at someone making decisions you disagree with . 
  i understand that being fully controlled by your emotions is pretty much a prerequisite for having your political views , but consider being slightly more coherent in the future . 
  maybe you 'll actually manage to convert someone to your revolutionary ways . 
  do you actually prewrite these responses and then paste them in when you feel they might be slightly applicable ? 
  or did my post , containing a single short paragraph , really manage to trigger you into such a massive revolutionary leftist rage that you managed to miss the part where i mention that i , too , think brexit was a bad decision ? 
  because neither my post nor the original polish guy you mentioned ( in your words ) say that it was a good choice . 
  you 're mocking that guy for thinking that brits `` can do whatever they want '' , that 's it . 
  keep backtracking more and maybe you 'll manage to backtrack yourself to the soviet union , comrade . 
   this species is known for insisting that this time round , they 're totally right about everything . 
  that 's incredibly funny coming from a leftist . 
  how is that wrong ? 
  i think brexit was a pretty damn bad decision but it 's not a decision to be made by me or a random leftist greek . 
  the fact that you find the whole concept of independent countries making independent decisions so negative tells a lot about you . 
   the borders of our neighbours are closed because what the immigrants want is not that relevant ? 
  the ones in calais also do n't want to live in france apparently but look how fun it 's been for the locals and the truck drivers there lately, 
  that 's nonsense that somehow spread itself during the years when shitholes like / r/atheism were in the spotlight on reddit , `` christian dark ages '' is probably the most ridiculed maymay at / r/badhistory . 
  you should post [ the chart ] ( http://pictures.mastermarf.com/blog/2009/090330-dark-ages.jpg ) the next time to really drive your point home, 
  \\  nordicgirl42 \\  a short fap session with hd pron, 
  how did they manage that , since there 's literally an infinite amount of porn sites ? 
  the graph is titled `` negative attitudes towards immigrants of a race or ethnicity different from most natives '' so i guess that would take ukrainians out of the equation here ? 
  i 'd like to think that the conclusion from this is just that all the other `` fascist xenophobes '' in poland base their rejection of mass immigration on the cultures and attitudes of immigrants instead of their race ( just like me :d ! ), 
  thanks for the contribution , / r/polska, 
  care about what ? 
  the 11 non-white people killed in the uk during the last 26 years ? 
  might be true in the balkans , but certainly not for poland . 
  [ actual historical analysis ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/angus_maddison_statistics_of_the_ten_largest_economies_by_gdp_ ( ppp \\ ) ) shows pretty well what the glorious communist experiment did to us ( note the complete disappearance of poland from 1950 ), 
  as soon as they tried , all leftists of the world would let out a single , terrifying scream , and the local police would finally wake up and deal with these awful vigilante xenophobes . 
  the locals are screwed no matter what they do,

  also primary school in poland had 8 years then . 
   on 16 . march old ss soldiers honors their fallen friends how is honoring ss soldiers not pro-nazi ? 
  why not multiply by 2 , square , divide by four ? 
  i considered asking them for kosher food , 
  i can only speak from my experience as a tourist in germany . 
  many of them changed their attitude when they hear polish . 
  uk or ireland , actually . 
  germans do n't like poles , and everybody know english , only some poles know german . 
  it 's funny how people have different rights depending on when they migrated to the country . 
  good to be a german minority in poland . 
  they have special priviledges in polish elections - their party do n't have to pass support level of 5 % to be in parliament , like regular parties , and now they can vote in german elections too . 
  cause they are not nationalists , or at least not all of them ( and not all nationalists are hools ) . 
  they can be easily faked , of course ( and i admit i 've quoted the most outrageous comment ) . 
  on the other hand people express more openly when using pseudonyms , so you can get pretty good idea of public opinion on some matter by reading many online commens . 
  of course this is english-language article so it 's skewed sample . 
  i 'm interested . 
  see comments under the article for russian opinion  my favorite :  ukraine is headed towards reunification with russia !, 
  same people , religion and mentality command this , and no bought off western crooks will changr that !, 
   ps : belarus and kazakhstan will reunite with russia too , either voluntarily or with brutal force !, 
  well , my bad . 
  this is about eastern partnership and not joining eu . 
  `` civilised direction '', 
  great , but we will celebrate after it 's signed . 
  no , because you can export outside your currency union . 
  countries outside currency union with other countries are currency unions on their own , and some of them are more competitive than others . 
  according to your theory they would all have same competitiveness of 0 . 
  yes , but only if we can develop at our pace for next 20 years , and we deal with demographic problems before they get serious , and there 's no crisis that actually touches us in the meantime . 
  that 's many conditions , and entering eurozone in next 5-10 years will make it all much more risky for us , as well as make it hard to keep competive advantages we currently have ( being cheap so we could export , and having small prices so we have reasonable internal consumption ) . 
  if we enter eurozone and there 's another crisis we either do internal devaluation like baltics ( internal consumption goes to hell , and we take 10 % gdp drop ) , or stop doing ok with exports . 
  that 's why almost nobody in poland wants euro in the short term . 
  if euro was only in green countries there would be no problems ( or only in countries with the same color ) . 
  and people still advocate for poland to join eurozone : /, 
  russian : czaj, 
  never heard that you should do that . 
  but some people say it 's better to take the cold water for drinking , because the hot has some chlor added ( if it 's transported hot from the city powerplant i mean , if you 're warming it in your house it makes no difference ) . 
  the water is safe to drink in poland as well ( except in warsaw  ) , and we have mixer taps . 
  the obvious solution is for eu to mandate that all sinks should have 3 taps , 
  first we speak about culture , and now it 's about ethnic cleansing ? 
  that 's 2 different things imho . 
  regarding forced assimilation of occupied people : poles also have their own culture too , and we endured over 100 years of russification and germanization . 
  actually we must have had it better than irish , cause almost nobody speak irish in ireland , and practicaly all poles speak polish . 
  people there think you only need too cold or too hot water . 
  how would you call what english did in ireland then ? 
  if you want real politic pov , there you are : `` good relations '' and `` bad relations '' does n't mean anything in politics . 
  especially with russia . 
  you do n't `` do sth to show your good will and benefit later '' . 
  that does n't work . 
  their negotiators will laugh at you afterwards . 
  you can negotiate , and trade , but every time you get something from russia , you must give something else . 
  that 's the first rule . 
  so giving up on something for free is just stupid . 
  you lose possible trading material for nothing . 
  you do n't need this small country in the middle of nowhere , but they want it ? 
  you do n't give it up for free - you trade it for as much as you can . 
  now - is the thing we want from russia more important for eu than ukraine is for russia ? 
  imho no . 
  according to these http://trade.ec.europa.eu/doclib/html/113459.htm data from 2012 : as a whole , european union is ukraine 's biggest export ( 21.8 % ) and import ( 39.9 % ) partner , followed by russia ( 20.7 % and 10.1 % respectively ) . 
  however if you add kazakhstan and belarus to russia figures it 's slightly bigger export market for ukraine than eu , while still being far smaller import partner . 
  in poland you ca n't cut a tree without local government agreement , even if it is on your property : / regarding the forests most are still national ( meaning you can go there and pick berries or mushrooms ) , and surprisingly the national company that manages the forests is doing well - there 's more trees each year , and they are very profitable for a national company . 
  not worse than lenin , that 's for sure , 
  maybe you should ask ukrainians instead of deciding for them ? 
  i mean as a german you should know well how it feels to be `` given '' to another country because of geopolitics . 
  she was jailed because of politics , but she probably is guilty ( at least all the ukrainians i 've spoken with think so ) . 
  hard to decide . 
  regarding galicia and volynia - it was a consequence of the treaty semen petlura ( as a leader of ukrainian people 's republic ) signed with poland in 1920 in exchange poland was to help him defend ukraine from soviet russia with which ukraine was at war at that time . 
  soviet russia annexed the rest of ukraine shortly after , btw . 
  more here : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/semen_petlura#1920, 
  not at all . 
  russia is actually good at real politic - it uses both carrot ( cheap gas , small tariffs , no controls on the border ) and a stick ( ban on exports , high prices for gas ) . 
  just like eu do ( but we 're much less focused on ukraine , and much worse at the real politic than russia ) . 
  imho eu is better option for ukraine than russia in the long term , but i can understand ukrainians not being sure about that . 
  yeah i know the math . 
  i just had 2 ways to reason about this , that were contradicting each other . 
  my 2nd ( wrong ) reasoning was : - at first country a has bigger absolute growth - bigger absolute growth means country a remains bigger than country b after the growth - which means absolute growth will be still bigger for country a - by induction country b will never catch up 3rd point is not true of course - at some point country a will still have bigger gdp than country b , but the absolute growth will be bigger for country b knowing that something should work , and being persuaded are 2 different things , 
  that 's very nonintuitive , even if you know the math , because for example with countries : - a ( gdp 1000 , growth 1 % ) - b ( gdp 100 , growth 2 % ) at first absolute growth will be smaller in country b ( +2 vs +10 in country a ) , but it will eventually turn around . 
  i had to check for myself , even though i knew it should work that way , 
   it would turn out german cars are 90 % made in eastern europe and china, 
  everything is `` epickie '' ( epic ) now , while polish had this word for a long time it was used in different sense . 
  it changed from a word only used in discussions about literature to one of the most common words in less than 10 years . 
  nothing is `` wspania\u0142e '' anymore . 
  `` pathetic '' false friend ( patetyczny ) is used incorrectly - in polish it means roughly `` too serious '' , `` pompous '' and now it 's often used like english pathethic . 
  we have proverb `` z deszczu pod rynn\u0119 '' ( [ to hide ] from rain under the drainpipe ) . 
  it 's basically the same as english `` jump out of the frying pan into the fire '' , and the polish idiom is even shorter , but still i 've heard people using translation of the english idiom ( wyskoczy\u0107 z patelni w ogie\u0144 ) . 
  we also have `` zamieni\u0142 stryjek siekierk\u0119 na kijek '' ( uncle swapped an axe for a stick ) which is similar and rhymes . 
  '' [ by\u0107 ] mi\u0119dzy m\u0142otem a kowad\u0142em '' ( [ to be ] between an anvil and a hammer ) is basically `` to be between a rock and a hard place '' , and i 've heard this literally translated to polish too as `` by\u0107 mi\u0119dzy kamieniem a czym\u015b twardym '' and it sounds stupid . 
  i 've seen people write sarcastically on internet boards in such way : '' \u015awietny pomys\u0142 . 
  nie '' which is direct translation of `` that 's a great idea . 
  not '' . 
  nie '' ( you 're such a hero . 
  not ) . 
  in english it 's common , in polish it sounds completely off , `` nie '' does n't work that way , all words would change if there was contradiction at the end , but still people do it . 
  other phrases : - `` dom modowy '' , `` pokaz modowy '' ( fashion house , fashion show ) , 10 years ago it was `` dom mody '' and `` pokaz mody '' - `` wyprzeda\u017c '' and `` przecena '' are almost extinct , it 's `` sale '' now, 
  to all the poeple saying `` ukraine you 're welcome to eu '' : talk is cheap . 
  there 's this eastern partnership initiative going right now , and many countries ( especially the `` old eu '' ) oppose it , because ukraine is keeping tymoshenko in prison . 
  it 's stupid - it allows ukraine president to say to ukrainians - `` they do n't want us , our only choice is russia '' . 
  tymoshenko is just a pretext and it benefits current government of ukraine to keep her in prison exactly because eu is making problems because of that . 
  besides - regular ukrainians are affraid that after hypothethical accession their industry would be overrun by eu , and they would be reduced to `` colonial '' state - huge market for eu and source of cheap labour that western companies will use . 
  they know they can sell stuff to russia ( if they `` behave '' at least ) , but they do n't know whether they can sell to eu ( will eu allow their goods or ban them using one or another silly excuse , and are their goods even good enough to sell on eu market ) . 
  we should address these concerns if we want ukraine in . 
  polish - it 's not overrun ( everybody speak it rather than english ) , and language rules are intact ( or at least develop independently of english ) .

  this is the same thing , short sighted policies , under the pressure of big corporations , massmedias or politicians . 
  unresolved issues will always come back and hit you even harder . 
  it was all about the colonies . 
  britain was not interferring much on the continent before or after that , it was the `` holy '' alliance led by russia which ruled in xixc europe . 
  was n't it tony blair who found the `` weapons of mass destruction '' in iraq ? 
  in my opinion he should be put on trial , next to george w. bush and that drunker kwa\u015bniewski , also for the secret cia prisons . 
  it 's a shame we took part in it , we 're all partly responsible for the current situation in iraq . 
  uk was kinda isolated from continental politics , it was about the colonies which were challanged by france . 
  dude , i do n't know what 's your point . 
  why ? 
  i 've said it already that we have no agreement which oblige us to tolerate illegall migrants . 
  the countries which ca n't or refuse to protect their borders are breaking the intrnational law . 
  it is a matter of power , or money , which we can and should use for keeping these immigrants from being smuggled ( illegally ) to the schengen area . 
  there 's just no political will to do it . 
  yes , is n't it pathetic that oh so powerfull eu ca n't track these smugglers or protect its borders ? 
  becouse noone even tries to do anything else about it . 
  this is not the only , but the easiest solution for these `` elites '' and it 's not temporary since they do n't even consider the future problems that will surely come after . 
  it 's so easy to label every opposition by some insultive slogan and just force your ways upon everybody . 
  call me a `` racist '' or whatever , i do n't mind it anymore , i just do n't want intolerant , muslim fanatics in my country , i could however accept the christian people which are being persecuted by these muslims in the middle east since it 's a matter of their survival and not just their comfort . 
  pick them up and send back to the smugglers . 
  we can help these countries and `` convince '' them to take these people , even for economic help , it would be cheaper and less problematic for europe . 
  lybia is a war zone for a reason and i hope we can all agree that was a bad idea for europe to depose gadaffi ( even if he was a dick ) . 
  i disagree , it 's just the easiest solution which does n't involve un and the other states , but makes europe responsible . 
  also , i do n't see anybody talking about it , as usually i do n't see any long term solutions proposed by the european `` elites '' . 
  [ here ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polish_haitian ) you have a wiki article about them , i remember some french and polish docus on our tv also . 
  read about prince [ j\u00f3zef poniatowski ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/j%c3%b3zef_poniatowski ) , marshall of france . 
  also a one uncle of mine is kozietulski , a relative of a [ jan kozietulski ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jan_kozietulski ) known from the charge of somosierra . 
  borders are as well on the waters . 
  they just needs to be protected . 
  there 're another solutions . 
  we could have agreements with the countries that the migrants are passing by , help them return on our boats from international waters , but most of all ... we could help these countries they 're coming from , or at least we could stop destbilising them . 
  migration is not a solution , the real problems are deeper in these countries and we should adress that . 
   with an emperor elected by the people , mind that napoleon did n't just usurped the title . 
  back where they came from . 
  if they have no evidence of citizenship , that 's the problem of a country which allows them to pass its border . 
  so is europe obliged by some international law to take them , or is it just about emotional compassion ? 
  just that it was either france or the `` holy '' alliance , mostly russia , which could set the `` order '' in xixc europe . 
  in poland he 's admired by many , even our current [ national anthem ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nmfhubvqta ) ( yugoslavia borrowed this melody ) comes from these times and napoleon is mentioned there . 
  personally i 'm a bit confused , since he was an allie of russia at some point of time and gave them bia\u0142ystok , attacked spain and used our troops , which were quite cruel in the siege of zaragoza , or sent them on santo domingo ( haiti ) where they joined the rebels and stayed . 
  napoleon was a great man , not a perfect one , but even his enemies had to respect him . 
  poland accepted thousands of greek migrants in 1940s , i think we should take christians from middle east since they 're in danger , muslims are n't , they 're dangerous and people do n't want any problems here . 
  the question of russia and ukraine may looks `` funny '' from a greek perspective , from here it looks very serious , especially if we 're helping ukrainian immigrants . 
  btw . 
  we contributed with 40bln $ for the fiscal pact to help $ zone , even if we 're keeping our currency . 
  greece should be never admitted and should leave it a long time ago to devaluate its currency , it would be better for you . 
  slightly problematic ... 
  remind me , which treaty makes all of eu members to accept portions of ( illegal ) migrants that arrives in some country . 
  do n't get so much dramatic , i 'm not talking about attacking and sinking the boats of migrant smugglers , but there 's no law which forbids rescuing them and sending back . 
  bismarck was later , read about the congresse of vienna and the `` holy '' alliance . 
  not to mention the revolutions of 1848 and pleanty of others in france , belgium or poland . 
  wwi was more about domination on the continent and in colonies , not about the political regimes and national self detrmination which were `` acidentally '' results of it ( thank you pres. 
  wilson !, 
  if it would be just possible , unfortunatelly the nature hates void . 
   weed all i know is that most of it in warsaw comes from chinesse plantations in suburbs , not vietnamesse . 
  in general i think the asian immigrants are not misbehaving and they 're peacefull , in opposite to the muslims or gypsies and this is why people are `` intolerant '' or just have their ( negative ) opinions about them . 
  it works both ways and it 's just annoying how `` tolerantionists '' pretends like there 're no problems with migrants , but rather with the locals . 
  yeah , i 've seen the arguments against deportation of illegal ( underline ) migrants , but still they 're not convincing for many . 
  i see no reason why australia can do it and europe ca n't . 
  than maybe it would be better under french `` hegemony '' . 
  we 'll never know that , europe had to wait until wwi for the final demise of these absolutist monarchies and the establishment of national states . 
  was europe under russian , prussian and austrian hegemony a better place ? 
  pity that napoleon lost to the colaition of absolutists . 
  for the whole xixc this un-holy alliance was keeping `` order '' in europe until wwi . 
  i wonder how many of them are displaced becouse of religion , especially in syria and iraq . 
  we have quite a bit of vietnamesse in poland as well , never heard people complaining about them , lots of people likes their food . 
  in my primary school there were two black guys , kacper and masele , kids were more interested about them than `` intolerant '' . 
  thanks for the coffee anyway . 
  so how 's that `` intolerance '' manifested ? 
  i see just a survey about `` negative opinions '' , is it not allowed anymore to have opinions ? 
  good question . 
  i 'm not so sure about that . 
  recently , in presidential elections , there was discussed the subject of christian refugees from syria and as far as i remember , noone opposed it . 
  people are afraid of muslims , it 's not about the unemployment . 
   poland is taking a different stand brace yoursleves , elections are coming . 
  i just hope these 500 christian families from syria , which applied for help , will not be left alone for the `` islamic state '' . 
   private company gazprom is not a private company . 
  this is , as well as north stram , not an economic , but a political project organised by the state controlled gazprom . 
  there 's no other reason why to build a pipeline bypassing poland , which is not even taking any fees from the gas transit along jamal pipeline . 
  construction of south stream is the same , irrational from the economic point of view . 
  i hope that former chancellor schroeder gets not just bashing , but criminal charges for corruption . 
  half a million in a country of about 70 million population ... 
  in opposite to germany , three and a half millions polish jews had exactly the same citizens rights as everybody and somehow nobody considers their citizenship when it comes to casualties . 
  do n't know how would these jews feel if they 'd be considered `` germans '' suddently , like you 're sugessting , i hardly doubt they 'd like it . 
  anyway , it 's not the subject of this thread , the policies of german goverment were n't the same in every place of this continent they 've occupied , not to mention the allied and collaborating goverments , which were quite independent in their internal politics . 
  what germany did in general government is not comparable to anything and it should be never forgotten , or excusesd by putting the blame just on a one party . 
  what collective guilt ? 
  everybody knows that germany then was ruled by the national socialist party and that germany now is nothing to be compared . 
  it 's about history and i do n't like poland to be confused with germany just becuse present germans refuse to accept the history of their country . 
  and millions of slave laborers exploited and abused by germans . 
  listen , this is going nowhere , i have no idea why it 's wrong to call these camps `` german '' and why it 's right to call them `` polish '' , why you feel offended and why we should n't . 
  this is not just about double standards , but it looks like germans are ashamed of national socialists ( quite rightfully ) and you wants germany to not be connected with them , which is unfortunatelly impossible . 
  unfortunatelly these camps are being connected with poland , which has nothing to do with them , except of their preservation and commemoration of victims . 
  this is about history and by no mean related to post war generations of german people . 
  yes , i can imagine this is just a `` creative '' journalism from rt , but given the experience of north stream and gazprom , which is a state controlled company , it sounds kinda suspicious . 
  why is that not `` fair '' if that was the name of the country recognised by everybody , including germans , then ? 
  it 's not about `` fairness '' , but about the truth and i 'm not suprised that germans do n't want to be `` confused '' with national socialists . 
  ok , so the jews , homosexuals etc were germans , the national socialist goverment of germany was n't german , now i get it ... as for the jews , there were very few of them in germany , which makes the national socialist propaganda even more ridiculous . 
  the first plans were already in 80s , they 've started construction in \u017barnowiec , but abandoned it . 
  later from time to time this issue was coming back in some political discussions , but now they 've made a `` company '' for that , put some guys in the offices and gave them handsome salaries . 
  as for the lithuanian power plant , i 'm not even sure if we 're still invsting into that or how 's that going .

  if you are not seeking attention , you are doing it wrong . 
   van rompuy did his job excellently without seeking credit for it in the media van whatwashisname might have done everything in his job description * correctly * , sure , but if you want people to treat european union seriously , and not as a weak , powerless institution which do n't have much say anywhere , because that 's the role of germany ( and sometimes france ) , you need to have recognizable people steering it , not some random bureaucrats . 
   idiotic things sure , you would much prefer someone with a stance `` why wo n't we all just bend over to russia ? 
  who cares about the fucking war in europe they just started . '', 
  unmemorable and flavourless . 
  clay 4 times poorer than the poorest parts of poland and not even having much poles left because they were all expelled in 1946 ? 
  seems like a shitty deal . 
  the only thing being a net gain would be having our lw\u00f3w back , but considering that its original polish population was replaced by ukrainians it kinda misses the point as well . 
   i just state my opinion . 
  i also state my opinion . 
  this is my opinion on anyone holding such opinion . 
   but i 've never met any western-european who has said that polish people are westerners . 
  they usually see you as eastern-europeans . 
  well , that was one of the most disastrous results of the soviet occuppation , and i know perfectly well it will still take decades to diminish this insulting and false misconception . 
  does n't mean i 'm going to play along with it while it lasts , further perpetuating it . 
   culturally `` i do n't know anything about history and the world was created in 1950s ''  linguistically western \\  using languages as a geographical indicator poor welsh , being an island of non-western subhumans in the sea of germanic-speaking master race must be hard for them . 
  stopped reading there . 
  i 'd rather see us buy some more land stuff or airplanes than invest in navy . 
  we never were , nor never will be a naval power ( even if our navy had some moments like fights with sweden in 17th century , or north sea operations during the ww2 ) , as baltic sea is hardly different from a large lake . 
  i also do n't recall any such cases of kidnaping . 
  on the other hand , when police catches some atm skimming groups ( happens once every few months ) , they usually turn out to be `` romanian citizens '' . 
   they say `` albania '' in that short video , not poland . 
  the butcher guy quite clearly tries to speak polish with a heavy american accent at the end of video though . 
  yeah , you were our most frienly neighbour in the interwar ( other than the brief period in 1939 when a polish-hungarian border existed ) , and during the ww2 our government evacuated to romania through zaleszczyki , and i think our gold reserves were also sent to your country . 
  we have a long tradition of cordial relations , and i hope to see even more development on it . 
  i know , i got it the moment i realized that he meant `` cudzy '' . 
  yeah , i realized it right after i wrote my post , so i deleted it and hoped noone seen it :d the root was different enough i have n't made a connection immediately . 
   wtf polan why you no use word for `` stranger/foreigner '' with common slavic root '' \u010dudan / stran '' like all others ? 
  we also have `` cudzoziemcy '' , which have similar meaning to `` obcokrajowcy '' - i think it might be connected with `` czudan '' . 
  japan is on similar latitude to europe so i do n't really think mercator is at fault here . 
   hungarian claims are not justified by anything except literal imperialism it was entirely possible to divide transylvania in a way where one part of it would have a hungarian majority , with quite significant romanian minority ( something similar to 1940 borders , but more advantageous to romania in the western part ) , and the other part would be almost exclusively romanian . 
  instead it was decided , in order to permanently significantly weaken hungary , to assign the whole territory to romania , resulting in 1/3 of total population of ethnic hungarians suddenly finding themselves in foreign countries . 
  of course , it was n't as extreme as the completely disgraceful border with slovakia , which was moved far into hungarian ethnic territory in order to obtain more arable land for czechoslovakia , but still - i can see why hungarians are so dissatisfied and remember this unfair treaty even after 90 years . 
  i 'm quite sure if poland never recieved eastern germany after ww2 to compensate for similar loss to our country , our attitude towards lithuania , belarus , ukraine would be comparable to the one hungarians had and still have . 
   we do n't have one single political entity in parliament that is even close to the level of nationalism and fascist accents that is the hungarian mainstream . 
  that 's because you have won , and hungary have lost . 
  if transylvania would be controlled by hungary nowadays , the situation would be reversed and you would have irredentist romanian parties in the mainstream . 
   sugar til we are importing sugar . 
  all those sugar factories we had to close in poland because we were producing more than eu limits allowed would surely be delighted to hear that . 
  japan , canada , austria , switzerland , denmark , monaco ... 
  i already like the team white-red . 
   we can live with russia highly debatable . 
  higher proportion of my family was killed by soviets than by germans during the ww2 . 
   but the last time westerners have literally tried to exterminate us i also recall more than half of the west , including poland , fought against them . 
  while russia diligently collaborated with those who tried exterminate us until they themselves got invaded , and got their fair share of exterminating poles as well in the meantime . 
   both the east and the west are threats to us in the long run , how exactly the west threatens us ? 
   they 're both inhumane and imperialist . 
  you could make such comparisions in 1940s ( and you still had the anglo-saxon part of the west , which while not flawless , was indubitably visibly superior when compared to either german part of the west or soviet russia ) and they would kinda made sense , but not nowadays . 
  not even mentioning that it 's assuming that russia is an equal opponent to the west , while it 's nothing more than glorified petrostate with a rusting nuclear arsenal and delusions of former glory . 
  still dangerous to us in a short run , that 's why it 's important to us to be in nato right now , but certain to become marginalized in a long run . 
  even assumming both sides are equally shitty ( which is not true ) , siding with a certain loser is a bad move . 
   for me it 's more sensible to placate the one neighbor that wants to be placated , ... and become a belarus-level shithole . 
  in the * best * case scenario . 
  na , thx . 
   and ignore the one 's who 's drastically unpredictable . 
  \\  implying it 's not russia which is drastically unpredictable right now  look at the rise of fascism in europe - and yes , in poland and ukraine as well . 
  and the rise of fascism in russia !, 
  shit , what now ? 
  but seriously , is there a widespread wave of movements in europe following mussolini 's political philosophy ? 
  i seriously doubt it , so stop using such buzzwords . 
   i 'd rather suck russia 's dick than america 's that 's exactly why i dislike you . 
  i just ca n't imagine someone sane looking at polish history so far , and then concluding that out of the two * russia * is a better option . 
  that 's just targowica-level absurdal to me . 
   and communism was only one of many things which demonstrate we 're eastern europe the only thing communism demonstrates is that we got occuppied by ussr in 1944 . 
  if franco had lost in spain , you would consider spain `` eastern european '' too ? 
   large jewish presence to religious tolerance . 
  religious tolerance in russia ? 
  the same russia that forcefuly converted unites to orthodoxy ? 
  kek . 
  also , usa as a epitome of `` easten europe '' confirmed . 
  if that 's your definition of `` eastern europe '' , the more i 'm surprised by your anti-americanism . 
   they 're cementing western dominance over eastern europe ... and us troops in germany or uk are cementing `` western '' dominance over germany and uk , right . 
  oh , i forgot that you were that ridiculous `` 40 years of gomunism were the single most important thing in polish history that nullified 950 years prior to that and made poland permanently leave the western civilization forever , also let 's keep sucking russia 's dick just in case '' guy . 
   they receive an order to shoot civilians they will do it . 
  and why would they receive such order ? 
  how could usa possibly benefit from estranging one of the most pro-american populations in the world ? 
  such situation is exactly as probable as polish army receiving an order to shot * polish * civilians . 
  knowing you , you would much preffer having a contingent of ivans in legnica once again , because this way we avoid confronting russia , would n't you ? 
  a self-contradicting empty slogan ? 
  i think our definitions of `` truth '' must be vastly different then . 
  `` czechy '' also means `` bohemia '' in polish . 
  guess we just never bothered with inventing the new name , and use the same name we used to reffer to the medieval kingdom . 
  it 's like using `` polish republic '' all the time instead of `` poland '' . 
  sounds really silly and pompous to me . 
  we call you czechy instead of `` republika czeska '' in polish anyway . 
   so when leftists say that neoliberalism is all bad it 's subjective but when neoliberals say left-wing politics is all but it 's objective ? 
  there are numerous examples of implementing neoliberal policies having a positive effect on the country ( there are many negative ones as well , of course ) . 
  there were * no * instances so far where artifically choking off a capitalist economy ( which i presume is your goal , as a self-declared `` anti-capitalist '' ) brought positive results . 
  that 's the basic difference . 
   among people who suffered under the soviet union . 
  conversely , people who suffered under neoliberal regimes do n't view the term very positively . 
  oh yeah , all those * terrible * , terrible neoliberal * regimes * . 
  life there was literally as bad as under the soviet occuppation . 
   it is a negative label if you are anti-capitalist well , if you are anti-capitalist it basically means your idea for the future of your country is turning it into utter shithole , so it might be negative to you in such context , sure . 
   what 's that supposed to prove ? 
  that different ideologies appeal to different peoples ? 
  that your ridiculous and absurdal viewpoint is fortunately not commonly shared . 
  glad to see i 'm not the only sharing such opinion on this subreddit . 
  you are the one who i 'm seeing all the time trying to promote use of `` neoliberal '' buzzword as if it somehow was a negative label . 
  it 's not .

  programmers who work for non-local clients can often earn as much or more than in several western european countries like germany , belgium or italy . 
  you should have mentioned you were talking about a room . 
  but yeah , a room is doable outside of warsaw , especially if location & quality are secondary concerns . 
  you wo n't find a flat for a 100 pounds per month this is not 1998 . 
  a room , sure , but even then it 's stretching it . 
  i replied on my mobile phone and thought you were responding to a different comment . 
  it 's not that it 's a point of pride , but people are more likely to be exposed to english vocabulary in their written , rather than the spoken form , so they might not always immediately understand the words unless they are spoken to in their native language 's pronunciation , so in poland * wi-fi * becomes * vee-fee * , in france * chewing gum * becomes * shwingum * , etc. 
  another point raised in a different comment also applies to polish :  it 's just that in order to properly pronounce an english word in the middle of a greek sentence you have to completely change your cadence and speech and it shows , it 's slightly jarring in conversation , it does not flow naturally . 
  fwiw , i noticed similar things happening in a few other countries such as france , poland and india . 
   so if you do n't do it you can be perceived as lazy or that you are leeching your parents . 
  ... as opposed to leeching from the taxpayers . 
  * smuggled * implies illegality , but what optimus did was perfectly legal .

   i put / r/polska as the official polish sub . 
  i think it 's fine . 
  / r/polska is also a geo-default sub unlike / r/poland . 
   poland - / r/poland is for english-language posts , / r/polska is for posts in polish . 
  the latter has 42k subs , the former has only 7k subs . 
  english posts on / r/polska seem to be allowed . 
  / r/polska mod here while we wo n't outright delete non-polish posts , they are generally discouraged as / u/gbursztynek noted above ( below ? 
  ) , and those users are often redirected to / r/poland . 
  on the sidebar we have :  * for english language posts try / r/poland . 
   i wonder what the longest ( realistic ) polish word means/is . 
  i googled and could n't find anything . 
  there are too many ways in which it is possible to lengthen many words , many of which are at least very occasionally used . 
  if someone wanted to `` cheat '' they 'd just use names of very long chemical compounds , e.g. 
  the full name of the titin protein which measures 189819 letters . 
  there are longer words , e.g. 
  automatics are still in a minority : http://www.statista.com/statistics/204123/transmission-type-market-share-in-automobile-production-worldwide/, 
  * masakra * can be translated to * massacre * but in today 's usage it mostly means `` terrible '' . 
  300 rounds is n't that much really , and does n't take that much space . 
  someone participating in dynamic shooting may easily shoot this amount in one visit at the range . 
  i do n't know what 's the black market rate for 9x19 ( i 'm assuming the guy was using a glock chambered in 9mm - as most are ) , but on the legal , regulated market , 300 rounds would cost him like 80 eur or less ( at least that 's the going rate in poland for non-bulk quantities ) . 
  what happened to the ` journalist ' ? 
  did he end up in prison ? 
  are n't the guns which find themselves in belgium originating from the balkans ?

  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/genocide  genocide is the intentional action to systematically eliminate an ethnic , national , racial , or religious group . 
  the word is a combination of `` genos '' ( race , people ) and `` cide '' ( to kill ) . 
  the united nations genocide convention defines it as `` acts committed with intent to destroy , in whole or in part , a national , ethnical , racial or religious group . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polish_operation_of_the_nkvd_ ( 1937 % e2 % 80 % 9338 )  it was ordered by the politburo against the so-called `` polish spies '' and customarily interpreted by the nkvd officials as relating to `` absolutely all poles '' . 
   in order to speed up the process the nkvd personnel reviewed local telephone books and arrested persons with polish-sounding names . 
  poland has had and still maintains diplomatic and business relations with north korea , this is not a first time nk lends its people to other countries ( poland , russia ) for cheap work . 
  when was 900 euro/month upper middle class in hungary ? 
  15 years ago ? 
   it 's applied to people worldwide uncovering corruption . 
  true . 
  last year in poland an ex-building inspector was released after 8 years of internment in a mental asylum for refusing to participate in some corruption scheme . 
  i wonder how many more cases like his are out there . 
   75 % lower than the eu average i think you meant it was 75 % of the eu average . 
  if it was 75 % lower than the eu average , cornwall would be poorer than bulgaria 's poorest region ( and bulgaria itself is the poorest eu country ) . 
  you 're right that price is the primary reason why manuals were always more popular and this is what people got used to , but that does n't negate the fact that clutch-wearing is a non-issue even for relatively novice drivers .

  til me and everyone i know is a professional driver . 
   ~ ~ most people ~ ~ clueless americans wear out their clutches ftfy it 's not an issue if you actually know how to drive .

  take it with a grain of salt , the poll does n't seem to discern between countries and ethnicities . 
  most people do n't have anything against ukrainians but may perceive the country as poor and backwards , hence the negative views among some .

  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0qguw3xxsk ), 
  median wage after taxes is around 2400 pln . 
  legal owners very rarely commit crimes with legally acquired guns , it would n't change anything apart from making the society even more restrictive , and providing a false sense of security . 
  ignoring how impossible that sounds , that still would n't prevent people bringing guns from outside the eu . 
  same with people making their own guns ( there are detailed manuals freely available ) . 
  so far it seems it is n't known where he got the guns and grenades . 
  if he got it where he probably got the grenades from ( dark web or the balkans ) then no stricter anti-gun laws would have helped here , unless you are advocating to turn france into a dictatorship with random house searches , leaving schengen , armed border patrols , etc. 
  even then there 's always enough demand on the black market for people to want to risk smuggling arms . 
  there are no eu countries where an underage non-resident could buy a gun without holding a french gun permit ( which he obviously also would n't get ) . 
  we can and after jumping through a few hoops there are very few restrictions on what we can own aside from the fact that full-auto is almost impossible to get , but so far it seems our government is n't going to do jack shit to protect us from this new directive , even though they call themselves right-wingers/conservatives . 
  i hope you succeed .

  in poland people also shoot those during competitions , though we prefer not to draw unnecessary attention in public . 
  no , it 's just no longer given for free to keep at home , people can still easily buy it themselves . 
   kgb men like putin took power from them that 's debatable whether he managed to take power from the oligarchs ...

  taking aside if they are rebels or terrorists that guy is one sick puppy . 
  i 'm sure he joined only to merry shoot at people while pumping up his supremacist ego . 
  i can only wonder what atrocities he committed during that chaos . . . . are n't rebels/terrorists to be pardoned for any crime they might have commited during these fights ?

  and humanitarian help ca n't be cut off just like that as agricultural system is inefficient . 
  squaring the circle ... ' not whole africa but whatever '' not really freebies but whatever, 
  no bydgoszcz no point ... 
  it 's just eloquence . 
  lots of people are thinking like him but they ca n't put it in such neat-o words , maybe because of emotional load . 
  also it is not about believing what ukrainian or russian media says as this comes out from separatists themselves . 
  if they are lying the question is why they do so and what they can gain from that . 
  we do n't have reason to love them , do we ? 
  and they are giving us even more reasons to be edgy about them . 
  it 's like someone kicked you in the balls the other day and today is boasting how shiny boots he has . 
  r/russia says that people do n't actually feel effects of embargo beside prices getting bit higher . 
  i am soooo full of aples right now . . no room for cheese ... 
  are you sure ? 
  i do n't know ... 
  i must say , that was harsh ... 
  unless poland . - . 
  i would put in right place one , huge , oil spitting leech . 
  if we want go back to `` glorious '' times of cccp, 
  hehehe ... wait , * what ? 
  that probably would work . 
  too bad none of the sides is willing to let go even an inch , otherwise it would be settled long ago . 
  what is sad is that i can see people on both sides having right . 
  many israelis are born on these grounds , generations already so this is their land , same as palestinians . 
  palestinians are repressed , israelis are harassed by terrorists , or as some calls them partisans ( during armistice , yeaa . . ) . 
  this is how things end when you let such conflicts drag on the span of decades . 
  i do n't know how it will end , but it should be lesson for everone . 
  pains of having thousands years worth of history ... 
  but some other country managed to fit in 200 years of history slavery and civil war . 
  anyway , technical question , how do you imagine stopping settlement construction ? 
  by force or by voice ? 
  one wo n't work , other one would end in bloody mess . 
  maybe israel-palestine conflict has such big coverage because europe wants to play ball and sing songs with israel . 
  i suppose israelis would n't be happy if their country and sphere of influence would be somewhere between congo and india heh ? 
  in chechnya , crushed by military force lol . 
  this war was slowly * bleeding out * both sides . 
  second war took 9 goddamn years , it was rather slowly squished rather than crushed . 
  some islamic insurgency fighters ( these are fuckheads of their own brand btw ) and controlled government is far better than what it was . 
  problem of israel and palestine ... with their back and forth dance it might not be enough . 
  people are tired of this but it looks like ruling parties have different goal in mind rather than well-being of * everyone * . 
  you are right , both sides are animals deserve nothing more than these bullets they are sending both ways ... ... wait , this does n't sound good , let 's try something crazy . 
  let israel pump lot of money into palestine to provide better living standards for these people rather than repressing them ... nah , it would n't work , it never works . 
  it did n't work in chechnya ... * oh wait , it did !, 
  what is `` white guilt complex '' anyway ? 
  i can google that , yeah , but how it really works there in us ? 
  nobody can choose in what family one is born into but feeling guilt for getting better start ? 
  wa . . whaat ? 
  these assholes . 
  there is n't worse thing that cutting someones tree . 
  it is like killing someones dog , these things wo n't come back in next year !, 
  no , it is n't that i do n't like dogs , i just love trees . 
  why would they do that ? 
  nah , i do n't say you ca n't be angry about this problem . 
  that conversation was interesting but the last part really did hurt your argument , that 's the only problem here . 
  aaand here it goes , yellow card for * reductio ad hitlerum *, 
  for poland in this year we have new rules concerning segregation of trash . 
  i expect that in this year we will go up in numbers to the rest of europe . 
  nobody is stealing my jobs ... nobody to blame ... 
   ( unfortunately , the same thing can not be said about the men ... ) okay , * sniff * , okay ... 
  bydgoszcz is quite clean now . 
  durning these years of modernisation lot of things changed . 
  10 years ago from now i can remember fields of plastic bags rolling on the wind and other trash in forests but now everthing is keept clean and shiny . 
  of course you will find some trash here and there , but just like everywhere . 
  yeah , `` a plaything '' is quite a light way to call a plan for exterminating poles and jews and all in between and lots and lots of other nationalities . 
  this is the worst part . 
  you ca n't say anything or you became one of them , one of them . . one of us . . one of us . . one of us . 
  but belarusians do n't likes us so much anymore , mostly because of us booting into their internal affairs , or it 's just propaganda , or politics ... 
  if we are at this well ... everybody loves poland but poles . 
  seriously , my friend was so happy with rome because it had a traffic jam at 3am . 
  frekkin traffic jam `` only in rome  . 
  for the love of god , if this would happen in warsaw she would be like `` fuck that city and all '' . 
  or this other girl saying `` i ca n't work in polish company anymore . 
  everyday looking at these sad , tired faces '' . 
  congratulations girl on your new job , now you will be the only sad and tired face in a company . 
  i do n't really judge where they want to live or what they enjoy but i ca n't stand when these people come back here and say that everything is so shitty here ( they call it literally `` shitty '' ) . 
  but we do have these kind of laws . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hate_speech_laws_in_poland what do you think is lacking there ? 
   explosives diarrhea hehe , too much binding of isaac for me ... 
  just as glados said : `` the best solution to a problem is usually the easiest one . 
  and i 'll be honest . 
  killing you ? 
  is hard . '',

  church does n't ` accept ' evolution in the sense that it tells all it 's people it 's true . 
  catholics have different views on this matter , and so do priests . 
  okay then , if this is true . 
  that 's fear , not hate . 
  becouse it would be much more profitable than current situation , for everyone and no , nato does n't need ukraine , nato has no intention or interest in going so vast into eurasian land mass . 
  besides , us and russia are not enemies as you 're suggesting , the main geopolitical competitor for us today is china , russia is a 10th-14th world power that could be a partner as 1 ) us seeks agreement with russia to counter china and 2 ) russia is needed in the new global security architecture becouse it 's stabilizing central asia . 
  both sides want that agreement and all the fuss is about on whose terms , russia does n't want to be just a junior partner in the new global architecture . 
  the stupidity of putin is about him thinking that russia can be something more and even if there were chances for that , all that potential is being wasted right now on a war that profits nobody . 
  almost every professional geopolitical expert will tell you that , from stratfor to european institutes . 
  how do you know that ? 
  are there any polls made in hungary about hating brown people ? 
  ... to spend tonns of money and damage your economy becouse of an assumption that nato will control crimea ? 
  i see this as a lost becouse everyone with sense of reason knows that ukraine wo n't join nato anytime soon and ukraine would n't have to even look at nato if was n't attacked . 
  as a matter of fact , ukraine would n't even had to turn it 's back on russia and just trade goods and deals as partners if russia would accept that ukraine wants to make it 's own decisions as a sovereign state . 
  cutting ties with russia was a reaction after green man landed on crimea and then war in eastern ukraine stareted . 
  not the cause . 
  that 's natural . 
  when western europe was bordering warsaw pact , they were bordering a danger and as they were weak after war , seek security in us and did n't mind that it may have made their hands tied in some way . 
  now they 're free from that threat as russian influence ends on belarus , so they start asking why do they actually need nato becouse the danger they 're meeting is rather a job for counter-terrorists than an army ( for now ) . 
  at the same time , today it 's the north-eastern europe is the one bordering the threat that comes from russia , so this part of the continent is calling for more nato . 
  this is going to destabilize poland completely . 
  however now they 're only checking ground . 
   if not fast-forward membership that 's not realistic . 
  yeah , all that 's going in the world was to be pretty much easly predicted . 
  at least it does overlap in a big part with what i expected as the relative power of us compared to china began to get smaller . 
  the only thing i 'm surprised with , is that it was so fast . 
  in 2007-2010 i thought we 're going to be at this point around 2025 . 
  oh , he did n't shot himself in the knee . 
  he shot russia in the knee . 
  bigger territory does n't have to mean bigger power or prosperity . 
  sometimes big territory is a burden . 
  and this is exactly the russian case . 
  when you have a vast territory , that 's sparsely populated and sparsely used in economic sense , then you need to spend a lot of money to protect something that does n't create income as most of that territory is n't used economically . 
  also with those distances and with that climate , having than population density , keeping the infrastructure costs way more ( fewer people to pay taxes , but longer distances to cover with that money ) . 
  it 's much , much better to be a small , but populated island , like britain , where distances are small ( so smaller are share costs of keeping the infrastructure in shape , and smaller is the territory you need to protect ) , but where most of the land is and can be used . 
  in a similiar way , annexing crimea brought more costs than it could create income that could be transformed into power . 
  annexing crimea and attakicking ukraine was a mistake that will only generate more and more costs in the future . 
  and what for ? 
  for 100 000km2 of land ? 
  putin did shot russia in the knee with involvement in ukraine so far , so ... if something seems stupid that does n't mean it wo n't happen , people make mistakes . 
  false . 
  i knew it will happen . 
  and many others too . 
  russia was open about their imperialism since early 2000 's and everybody with any idea about geopolitics knows that there ca n't be a stable russian empire without ( most of ) ukraine . 
  russia is running out of little green men in ukraine . 
  they 're unable to pretend that they 're not in a war with more dead soldiers and they 're unable to get more people into fight under these conditions . 
  if they are willing to invade the baltics , they will be open about it . 
  false !, 
  there would be . 
  the old power balance set after ww2 between pro-russia regimes and pro-us regimes was failing after ussr collapsed . 
  it has to be messy . 
  if it goes for cuisine , it 's pretty close . 
  why ? 
  edit : do n't answer , i know why , it 's just your stupid shit-talk . 
  yeah , in london it 's muslims cutting off white english heads off for a change , like in 2013 . 
  what about the art nouveau of budapest ? 
  you do n't like beauty ? 
  you do n't know what 's in their heads and meanwhile the facts are that wyborcza was criticizing ` their ' side while niezale\u017cna is n't and it did n't start now like you 're suggesting but it always was this way so your claims are not true . 
  you 've changed state from my argument into society . 
  i 'm not going to play that game . 
  i clearly meant states . 
  small 10-200 primitive groups from early human times can also be called societies but those were n't states ( no defined territory for example as they were nomadic ) . 
  however they knew religion and we know that from cave drawings , or burrying customs , like leaving things in early graves that might be handy for afterlife . 
  this is really a complex long topic but religion is known to man long before 4000 bc when first city-states began to develop . 
  as i said , those differences that can be found , are not so important for me becouse it works the same way in all those cases : you 're forced by someone else to spend money on something that you do n't agree with . 
  and it does n't matter at all to me , if this is a matter of religious faith , war & peace , form of government , form of financing things or building a road in a forest . 
  so even if you would be right ( but you are n't ) about categorizing religions in an alienated from other ideologies box , even then , in the context of the topic - where my money goes - there is no difference . 
  no matter what 's the nature of the ideology , i 'm forced to spend money on something i do n't agree with , and if i 'm not a religious person , those things are even more important than religion . 
  but overlaping is far bigger than you 're trying to suggest in the first place . 
  besides , these mentioned idologies may have been around earlier than mentioned religions , but not religion in general which is older than any existing state in history . 
  for me those differences are not important . 
  i thought it 's clear having read my previous posts . 
  besides , it 's not true , political , ethic and religious ideologies overlap each other . 
  there are lots of sugestions of how a powerful man should behave in the bible and where does the power come from , islam is openly both , a religoius and political ideology and at the same time communism is full of suggestions how the ideal homo-sovieticus should cooperate among other people , european monarchists are also openly setting their ideology in christian values . 
  your sectioning is simply untrue , there are more and less complex ideologies , but it 's not the secular-religious barrier that 's telling which one is which . 
  the same way monarchists have to pay taxes to keep the democratic government and that 's against their beliefs . 
  the same way as anarcho-capitalists have to pay taxes at all . 
  pacifists have to pay taxes for u.s. wars around the globe . 
  ekofreaks have to pay taxes for which a road is being built that will devastate some woods . 
  it 's also unfair . 
  but that 's life . 
  and this happens on all fields , but somehow religious ideologies are to be trated differently . 
  well , not for me . 
  every society has a dominant , leading ideology and for me it does n't matter if we 're talking about religious ideologies or secular . 
  minorities should have their rights to work and live in a given place , but they also should accept that their ideology is not the dominant one and that the leading idelogy dominates everyones lifes just like liberal-democracy is dominating our lifes in modern democracies . 
  even if you 're a nazi , communist or anarcho-capitalist , you have to accept that . 
  a sikh has to accept that he 's living in a christian country just like the ecologist has to accept that he 's living in a country full of people that want to have modern roads . 
  easy as that . 
  europe will be run by right-wing populists anyway , they 'll get along . 
  copernicus had n't had trouble with the church becouse of his theory ( and this stayed de facto as a hypothesis until xix age when the parallaax effect helped proving his theory ) , but becouse he was living with and fucking some chick without marrying her and becouse of that as a church official he had become conflicted with other church officials . 
  it wo n't happen ever . 
  you can already forget about it . 
  creationism is a bible-protestant thing . 
  catholics are rather ok with evolution , but of course not always . 
  well , in the world of european stereotypes , ` english ' is the synonym for hypocritical anyway . 
  that 's 1991 . 
  things look different now . 
  i 'm not guessing . 
  i know that but that does n't change what i 've said . 
  i do n't believe in secularism .

  beside the size of them makes them a different logistics challenge . 
  you barely need to supply even one division there ( based on the falklands as the largest engagement of this type ) the main difficulty is the range . 
  compare it several hundreds of thousand soldier the us supplies overseas . 
  two airmobile brigades that can get to the baltics in 6 hours would work just the same for protecting all those territories . 
   this is exactly why i oppose an eu army , you people only live for yourself . 
   an eu army , if there ever was to be one , should solely be based on western europe . 
  nice , here have a pretty [ dutch high horse ] ( https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/564x/38/92/48/389248829f7eb57eb1926c172c5b1079.jpg ), 
  the 1/3 that 's left of europe is russia , ukraine and belarus and i do n't think it is the place of the eu army to protect them . 
  ukraine should get some significant support though but not in the form of a defense treaty . 
  the eu force does need to only cover 2/3 of europe in operational capabilities while the us has global power projection . 
  poland did n't get to choose the us . 
  still bitter . 
   another german company whose history mysteriously started after 1945 basf existed 60 years before ig farben, 
  the whole lv has technologies that are strategically important . 
  starting from the independent access to space . 
  high performance avionics and materials are another . 
  an laser gyroscope for a lv works just the some for a cruise missile or ballistic missile . 
  you can develop those things strictly for the military but that not only is unpopular in europe it 's also very expensive . 
  beside the company was making the slbms when ariane 4 was flying ( and solid boosters for the it though smaller ones ) . 
  til the end of the cold war the manufacturer did not need to worry about lack of work in the military . 
  it 's only since it 's end that keeping expertise needed to support capabilities became a problem . 
  everybody faced it with different solutions . 
  russia just funds their rockets directly paying a huge markup vs gdp , france subsidizes arianspace to keep the solid production going , and in america the manufacturer of the motors spends it 's time since they built the minuteman and trident , building the shuttle srb 's and soon sls srb 's , after that ( late 2020s the us dod will have to think hard how best and cheapest to keep that capability ) . 
  china and india also use their space programs to test and expand their military capability . 
  even japan built the m-v and now epsilon to have the ability to quickly build ballistic missiles if they ever need them . 
  ariane 5 solid boosters , ariane 6 solid boosters , and the vega 1st solid stage is based on the french slbm and built by the same company . 
  the strategic reason to use them is slbms need replacement every 15-20 years and you do n't want to build a company from the ground up each time you want to do that . 
  solid rocket motor of all kinds are used by the military and having the know how to build them is of vital importance . 
  that 's one of the reasons why thoikol ( now orbitalatk ) will get contracts from the us as long as they retains the crucial knowledge how to build motor for trident and the minuteman missiles . 
  he already has some traction in swedish elections, 
  fuck yeah no communism . 
  you block the communication channel of the people involved . 
  after the day has passed and everything is done they do n't care . 
  that 's how it works in the east , no strong feelings one way or the other . 
  should n't it be \u0420\u0430\u0448 \u0431e !, 
  not really popular here ( peda\u0142 would be used ) though i think i read somewhere it 's more in style in the east . 
  that would be still 20 % cheaper then ukraine 's price . 
  usually it is mothers being sex workers or about their orifices so i think i had that covered, 
  but what 's the problem with the current laws ? 
  there are almost none legal weapons used in crimes , so any more restriction will no help if anything what is lacking is enforcement of the current ones . 
  well i ca n't dispute that . 
  but that 's out of contest of online insults or general insults . 
  yeah i tried reading it as the cyrilic x but that did n't really fit in cxtirsto cxerez ucxijte, 
  that `` cx '' for `` cz '' 0_o this one is more south slavic and for me in poland harder to understand ( though i know a bit of serbo-croatian ), 
  like as a general insult ? 
  never really seen that to the levels seen in english where everything is `` gaaaay '' . 
  slavic cursing mostly concentrates on sex workers , orifices and genitals regardless of gender or sexual orientation . 
  poland would also be happy to pay eu prices, 
  i do n't know looks like the moroccans and nigerians have it closer . 
  they are funded by their trust but it seams they need more of an endowment to keep up . 
  actually for example the washing powders ( and other home cleaning supplies ) are already produced in poland , reckitt benckiser has their biggest and most efficient factory in poland . 
  the problem is that since they have a very efficient system in poland now so any competition ( internal or external ) has a hard time to justify investment to to come into the market for marginal gains . 
  not mentioning that the brands and their contents are almost interchangeable and the real fight goes on in the marketing departments . 
  the facts are quite scarce and do n't really add up from what i 've seen . 
  the song is even older since it was written during napoleonic wars by polish legions fighting with napoleon in italy against austria and later the rest of occupants . 
  i was camping once and one of the girls i did n't was going around with a plate offering cake , she came to me and one of my friends almost screams `` do n't offer any cake to him , he will take it '' o_o, 
  even if the copyright holder withdrew all the licenses and forbidden publishing then the reproduction as part of news article should be covered by fair use . 
  hmm i read the uk factsheet on fair use and photographs seam to be explicitly taken out of fair use for news reporting https://www.copyrightservice.co.uk/copyright/p27_work_of_others, 
  maybe tic-tac-toe . 
  or maybe a match of [ robot jox ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0102800/ ), 
  well victoria was n't queen of just northern ireland . 
  it 's the english empire not the rump united kingdom of has been . 
   this picture is forbidden in the u.k. , copyright withdrawn , may not be publicised , how does that even work ? 
  5 in 25 years is not really frequent . 
  but the 2 proposals ( with 3 questions each ) in the last 2 years both proposed as a way together votes before the election are really infuriating . 
   of course it 's not an opinion poll . 
  a non binding advisory referendum with poor questions that are answered because of other reasons is even worse . 
  a poll is at least useful instead of being done one a self selected group . 
  a referendum like that is just a tool for political fighting . 
   did they know full well in advance that they had 0 % chance of success ? 
  there was no referendum , what was proposed was a law change ( you need 100k citizens to propose a law to the parliament ) with hope that they could get majority in the parliament . 
  my point was that you can easily get a similar level of support for proposals of measures that are widely unpopular so the threshold is too low . 
  in poland you need 500k ( which is proportionally less then in ne ) to propose a referendum but the parliament needs to ok it and it has a 50 % turnout threshold to be binding . 
  so far we had 5 : * 2x question about the rules of privatization of state property during the transformation from communism to capitalism * implementation of a new democratic constitution written from scratch . 
  * joining the european union * one as stupid one brought for by political maneuvering . 
  the questions were about single mandate constituencies ( a question worth a referendum but with weak support in poland ) and two added-on questions about financing of political parties and and the general rule of decision making in tax cases ( in favor of the tax payer ) . 
  the last one had a whooping 7.8 turnout , of course it got 80-95 % support for changes it was proposing . 
  it was a wasted 72 m pln ( 15m $ ) . 
  another proposal was to have one asking about lowering the retirement age ( might as well ask about lowering taxes but that is fortunately forbidden by the constitution ) , when to send children to primary education and functioning of the state forestry company . 
  unfortunately our politicians saw that referendums are a great way for whipping up support so they will probably try to use them again, 
  and you just wasted a couple of million euro . 
  this limit is too small and the 30 % limit is too small again . 
  referendums are a tool for legitimizing large changes in the state of the nation not expensive opinion polls . 
  maybe `` your proposition has value . '', 
  maybe that should be a question on the next dutch referendum . 
   it has a hefty requirement of requiring 300.000 signatures . 
  that 's not hefty at all . 
  in poland ( which has about 2x the population ) the project to make abortion more illegal got 450k and it was opposed by 85 % of people ( about half of them content with the current situation and the rest wanting liberalization ) . 
  did n't you see the news about the multi million dollar heist of syrup from the strategic maple syrup reserve . 
  i do n't care if its winter or summer time as long as there are no changes . 
  you do n't get more sunlight with it . 
  the 7 h in the winter day wo n't stretch over the working day 8h how ever you try cut it . 
  gmt is astronomical time and depends on the speed of earths rotation , utc is atomic time adjusted to be within 0.9 s of ut1 , ut1 is the successor to gmt in that it gives mean solar time at longitude 0 just now based off of observation of quasars , tai is the same atomic time as utc but without leap seconds putting it currently utc +36 s. 
  if you do n't need sub second accuracy gmt is either equal utc or ut1 . 
  gmt does not have a scientific definition with high accuracy anymore since it got supplanted by ut1 . 
  edit one more accuracy, 
  for the ones tested the problem was cost , it 's plain old expensive , maybe when oil is 300 a barrel they would make sense . 
  beside i thought it was mainly new zealand all other places are some local municipal laws that nobody care about . 
  ca n't find anything about other places forbidding nuclear power or nuclear weapons in a binding way ( estonia might be one but i do n't think anybody even tried to get a nuclear powered vessel there since the fall of ussr ) . 
   they do actually .

  just like the language . ), 
  with latvia and estonia you makes festival about them . 
  - beautifull lakes and `` golden summers '' as well as grey sky and soviet buildings . 
  - there is a lot of empty houses , especially at villages . 
  - as you mentioned pagan stuff . 
  as far as i know you can buy some pagan souvenirs there . 
  there are also some beliefs related to paganism . 
  - history and national heros but we learn about these here . 
  oh and that `` foch line '' was n't named like this because of lithuania and poland `` had focha '' on each other - in polish were angry at each other . 
   after christianity not after paganism ? 
  they pay for it in taxes .

  guy religion can not just leave it like society can not leave paedophilia and liberty can not discriminate lgbt . 
  rules are different there , otherwise they would n't care . 
  shh we need more polish death camps xd, 
  ok thanks , your explanation was the best one here . 
  oh sorry my english is pretty bad :p but it was nothing important at all . 
  so if it comes to that guy idiots are everywhere and being gay or anything can be just official reason . 
  but as far as i know there are laws in europe that makes everyone equall and protected by law so any discrimination can not be outlawed . 
  but yeah rest of world can be different ... 
  no it does n't forcing anything but it makes lives of lgbt people in eastern europe harder . 
  of course it 's not reason why they should n't do it . 
  few whiles ago a guy explained me that reason for that is discrimination of lgbt people there . 
  okay if so , everything is cool ... ( i just did n't know that they are still discriminated at west ), 
  that sounds really nice and makes sense but religion is bigger deal at all . 
  ( at least here ) , 
  it 's called cultural portal . 
  i do n't mean `` just be normal '' but being gay could be easier accepted if it would be just being gay ( not gay parades in fancy outfits with didlos ) . 
  you are not going to accommodate ? 
  oh that 's your problem now ... poland is becoming more tolerant but you can not just force it to most catholic country in europe in so short period of time . 
  edit : yes religion is bigger deal than sexuality ( at least for us ) . 
  what is more important : why do you live , will you live in future , what should you do or who should you fuck ? 
  it 's called cultural portal . 
  i do n't mean `` just be normal '' but being gay could be easier accepted if it would be just being gay ( not gay parades in fancy outfits with didlos ) . 
  you are not going to accommodate ? 
  oh that 's your problem now ... poland is becoming more tolerant but you can not just force it to most catholic country in europe in so short period of time . 
  of course that the do in poland , but i can promise you that it 's not a way you can fix it . 
  things like that make homo look even more different , so it 's harder for poles to accept that . 
  and yeah as i said religion is much bigger deal than sexuality . 
  but there is difference between festival of religion and festival of `` what you like '' . 
  marginalisation of lgbt in western countries ? 
  okay i did n't know about it . 
  marginalisation of lgbt in western countries ? 
  okay i did n't know about it . 
  but love and especially sex should be private no matter who they involve . 
  so homosexuals still have not the same rights ? 
  ( on west ), 
  so why is n't it normal festival then ? 
  i 'm sure that homosexuals are n't discriminated at festivals especially on west . 
  relevant username . 
  okay but it 's nothing to be proud of or try to show to everyone . 
  it 's like i would make parade for people that favourite colour is green . 
  yeah it makes homo look like different `` nation '' , not like people that like something different . 
  also sexuality is something private / hidden , it should n't be treated like that . 
  for eastern europeans it makes them look like bunch of crazy/mentally illed strangers . 
  yeah it makes homo look like different `` nation '' , not like people that like something different . 
  also sexuality is something private / hidden , it should n't be treated like that . 
  for eastern europeans it makes them look like bunch of crazy/mentally illed strangers . 
  but please this time without italy ... 
  but please this time without italy ... 
  yeah . 
  germans think that they eat lithuanian food , but it 's brought in poland . 
  damn lithuanians !, 
  lithuanians do n't make crimes more often than others , but they are the only that organize it . 
   i would not ask americans to spell ma\u017eeikis . 
  and that 's the main difference between poles and lithuanians . 
  and kickass . 
   estonia -43.5 \u00b0 c  latvia -43.2 \u00b0 c  lithuania -42.9 \u00b0 c  belarus -42.2 \u00b0 c, 
  there are 3 armies next to kaliningrad oblast . 
  i feel that poland is not afraid of being attacked through belarus . 
  we trust them but ya know ... just look where we put our units . 
   we do not invade countries out of tradition . 
  heck , that 's what i feel about russia now . 
   our catholic church loves to voice their opinion on certain topics discussed in the parliament here you always know church 's opinion . 
  it always support pis . 
   mol\u0117tai - `` clay city '' that clay is clay !, 
  your coal gave me a cancer !, 
  yeah i wrote it on phone , so it did n't mark that stuff . 
  yes i know that you were n't forced , you would n't make union with us , if you would n't want to accept christianity . 
  teutonic order was stronger than lithuania , that was one of reasons for union .

  to add to the others , afaik there 's a clause in the contract forbidding you from reselling to us . 
  especially as it would be cheaper for us to do so , even if you marked up price quite a bit . 
  do n't let them fool you . 
  the result product of this reaction is dihydrogen monoxide , which * is * a greenhouse gas . 
  until you realize people will still wear socks with their sandals , even though that they 're otherwise nude . 
  mosaic , mosaic everywhere . 
  one is closely related to the other . 
  you build up tolerance after time . 
  it tastes nowhere near as close to life as coffee does . 
  i do n't know about other poles , but i have a strong resolve to complain about poland no matter the government , economy or whatever else . 
  still not as versatile as `` kurwa '' . 
  if the small minority is n't stopped it does n't matter that it 's small . 
  you only need to be harassed once or twice to feel unwelcome . 
  i too want wroc\u0142aw out of this madness . 
  this place does ring a bell . 
  it just screams of jolly cooperation . 
  they control bosphorus , which is crucial to containing russian black sea fleet . 
  he 's a different kind of beast . 
  paranoia vs narcissism . 
   you do n't know my goals . 
  i gave you benefit of doubt that you 're not just an internet troll , which is the only reason why you could want to write emotional messages and without having a goal of being understood . 
   people reacting emotionally in here and then attacking me for being emotional are hypocrites . 
  i could n't care less . 
  i 'm not talking to them . 
   i do n't feel the need or duty to change anybody 's mind . 
  so , why are you posting at all ? 
   that 's not true everywhere , in the us and some countries speech like this is perfectly allowed if there is not immediate threat of violence . 
  that 's description of what `` banning hate speech '' entails , without saying where or if it applies . 
   all your doing is demanding people use the words you like . 
  that 's not me demanding anything , it 's the people from the article . 
  being for status quo is not demanding anything at all . 
   what the hell are you talking about here ? 
  that a desired property of law ( and that includes customs ) is that it 's reasonably parametric , so subsituting one group of people for another in its text wo n't make you anxious for its consequences . 
  that law is supposed to be for * everyone * and not only your in-group . 
  are you saying this standard is still too high ? 
  words are cheap . 
  that way i support fight with global warming , even though i commute to work by car . 
  60 vs 65 in poland . 
   look at the insane reactions here . 
  whataboutism . 
   why would people me ignore me when i speak emotionally ... generally that 's what people without solid arguments do and that 's how people treat emotional reactions in debates . 
   and why are you attacking the way i speak , while decrying this form of censorship . 
  i 'm not saying not to do that , only that it 's counter-productive for your goals . 
   then the listen to students , and then they become autocrats . 
  i am extremely wary of any group who claims to have monopoly on being just . 
  this has never ended well in all of history . 
  in the end my biggest ( but not only ) problem with the policy that it 's not generic enough and targets specific group . 
  hate speech as a concept is very simple and applies to everyone . 
  nazis ca n't say you deserve to die , but also ( in theory ) you ca n't say that nazis have to die as well . 
  this is good because you never know when you 're going to be labeled the bad guy by a rabid bunch . 
  this is specifically about being for non-men . 
  how 'd you feel if groups in it were reversed and it called for using `` gentleman 's agreement '' to be more inclusive for men ? 
  that kind of problem does n't exist for hate speech , if you take two groups `` everyone '' and `` everyone '' and swap them it 's still the same . 
  * that * is what equality is about . 
   8 \u00a7 who lays with a mentally ill woman , shall be sentenced to four years in the punishment room . 
  once upon a time , `` do n't sick it in crazy '' was a law . 
  you are being too emotional . 
  nobody is going to listen to messages written like this . 
  i 'm not saying what you wrote is not true , but also it 's not a good argument . 
  autocratic people often say that you do n't have to be afraid and then prove it wrong . 
  so , restricting hate speach is no go , but disciplinary action for saying `` mankind '' is okay ? 
   so you fine with banning radical speakers ? 
  if they 're advocating violence and claiming that all jews should be killed ? 
  yeah , i am . 
   suggestion now it 's a suggestion , tomorrow it 's `` racist '' to not use that and day after that it 's law . 
   more inclusive it 's also more orwellian . 
   banning ideas like you seem to be advocating not sure where you get that . 
  it 's not `` radical muslisms '' ban , but `` extremist speakers '' . 
  hate speech is not a good thing . 
   towards more equality it 's not more equality , it 's echo-chamber word-wanking . 
  what if it was a group of people who decided that words refering to wealth were bad and decided to ban all of them ? 
  there 's no more `` wealth of knowledge '' , that 's anti-poor people !, 
  or maybe we should ban the term `` black gold '' , because there 's word `` black '' in it ? 
  why are they concerned about what letters the words are made of ? 
  should n't they care about meanings of words instead ? 
  it 's about shifting [ overton window ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/overton_window ) , not explicitely immidiately disallowing certain ideas . 
  it 's the long-run goal . 
  good luck stopping any invading saracens from coming through the windows . 
  just heating that would be enough to put a lot of people in the red . 
  if you 're doctoring photos for agenda reasons you 're not going to bother with copyright anyway . 
  and i 'm pretty sure there 's already a law against saying that you 're esa and `` the following is true '' publicly . 
  i do n't get where you got that . 
  typically people do n't mean the most extreme interpretation of what they 're writing . 
  and the context is that nasa 's materials * are * in public domain . 
  it 's almost as if you can turn everything into absurd if you take it too far . 
  what 's wrong with that ? 
  it 's funded by my money as well , i feel that i should have the legal right to use it as my mixtape 's cover . 
  i find it weird that things funded by public money are n't in , you know , public domain . 
  if `` they '' are the rich fucks and `` the other side '' is everyone else then yeah , the other side has no means for something like that . 
  to provide funding for gay orgies , of course . 
  you 've got a point . 
  it 's morally indefensible , but it would solve the problem by disincentivising this kind of behavior . 
  just enough to not cut myself with superior yuropean langmesser . 
  for me the funniest part is how his stance is ridiculous and the plan he describes would not work by any chance . 
  even if he stabbed a guy he could n't rotate the blade like that without you know ... pulling it out . 
  not sure about other countries , but at least georgia is seen as being opressed by russia . 
  that gives plenty of sympathy . 
  just depressing and vulgar . 
  goddamn poles ruined poland . 
  i 've got a bad feeling that if anything happens to him macierewicz would fill the gap .

  our governments is sending money to ukraine , but among ordinary people nobody really supports that anymore . 
  i 'm not saying about this particular incident , just how things are . 
  no it did n't . 
  most of these people were unemployed or had a shit job , not needed from the economic point of view , they were needed in uk . 
  it took a couple of years until polish economy became attractive to other people . 
  for the most of that time , with few exceptions , business owners had no problems with finding people . 
  could you paste the data on secularism growth ? 
  why ? 
  those poles contributed to the ukish economy , hardly any pole in uk is unemployed . 
  it was n't a mistake from their perspective . 
  those high emmigration rates took place only in the first 3 years . 
  after that it was rather stable . 
  nobody says they will . 
  one of the reasons it 's more likely to happen , if you ask me . 
  nothing that you posted is changing what i 've said . 
  if you ask me about my personal experience , then not much changed after i visited france the last time ( few months ago ) compared to few years ago . 
  the only thing that changed is that police with guns was standing in front of a mall and they were checking bags of people entering , me included . 
  besides that , everything looked normal . 
  i do n't have any living experience in france , i was just visiting for few days . 
  that 's true , that people should include statistics in their decisions , however there are better and worse neighbourhoods and if you do n't have much outside this neighbourhood then you can as well emigrate to another country . 
   fillon 's tactics are pretty alien to modern french politics it 's a good thing in my opinion becouse with current politics you are n't going anywhere near ` fine ' . 
  maybe , but economic perspectives in quebec are much better than in france so at this point moving from france to quebec is a rational decision . 
  the second factor might be explained becouse they had a burglary done by some muslim youth few years ago . 
  i 've also got a family in other parts of france ( thionville , paris ) and they are saying that they feel less safe with every year so the stance of my friends is n't schocking to me . 
  where did all the germans go ? 
  i have french friends who are moving to quebec becouse they think it 's easier to run business there ( they had a restaurant in france which they closed last year ) and beside that they think that france will have a civil war with their muslims in a 10-20 year perspective which they want to avoid . 
  the civilisation of islam is expanding . 
  the western christian civilisation is shrinking in this part of world . 
  yes , i 've seen disabled measures even in places far away from large cities where air is n't probably that polluted . 
  i know , i just like being grumpy . 
  a tail ca n't wag a dog . 
  it depends who 's looking . 
  the geographic context of the observer is putting deciding about the geographic context of the place . 
  for example , for the anglosphere , iraq , saudi arabia , iran and so on are in a place called middle east , in polish it 's bliski wsch\u00f3d ( near east ) . 
  for a british , poland will always be in eastern europe . 
  these conceptions are much older , pretty much as old as the roman empire fall , the medieval christainistas was also a way of unifying europe , we even had european ` peace missions ' in the middle east  . 
  politicians in the medieval times tried to unite europe in different ways , with the use of the influencial papal state , the carolongian dynasty or the ottonian dynasty . 
  all those roads were closed dead after reformation happened and stayed that way for a short brake ( napoleon and the french empire ) and then xx age happened . 
  among modern , but pre ww2 ideas , you had this for example : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/paneuropean_union, 
  it depends which course will france take after elections , 
  old habits die hard , but they have to die if france wants to avoid that concrete wall ahead . 
  maybe portugal is n't but in many western countries the political landscape is changing which proves that fear is spreading . 
  you already know the language . 
  bruxelles has 2 official languages and the second is french . 
  a terrorist attack is n't adressed to the dead ones , but to those watching news . 
  ** the goal of terrorism is n't killing ** , but changing the mindset of those alive . 
  if we 're comparing terrorism to burglary , then let 's have that in mind , becouse eventually , we 're all victims of terror as the terrorists achieved what they wanted . 
  agree , i hope fillon wins , in my opinion he 's the exact thing france needs right now . 
  it saddens me , that french are so emotionally connected with wrong ideas which are only bringing more and more mess and growing chaos in france . 
  the acid test will be the negotiations results . 
  empathy ( which has nothing to do with the case ) is not enough to maintain such society . 
  lol not among species living in societies where they need access to resources that society provides . 
  this would solve the problem if ` everyone wants to learn valuable things ' condition would be true , but it 's not . 
  of course society is natural , in fact , in this context there is no such thing an unnatural , yes , that plastic bag is also a product of nature . 
  we 're part of society becouse being part of it gives us lots of different profits and automation is n't changing that . 
  someone has to maintain robots , someone has to do do work which robots ca n't do , and besides that , there are also multiple uneconomic reasons . 
  nature abhors vacuum in many different ways . 
  all life on this planet ( and this is also something that automation wo n't change ) is competing with each other on many different level to gain access to the resources it needs , that 's how life works . 
  societies are competing with each other , countries are competing , organisms are competing , persons are competing , animals are competing . 
  effectivness in rewarded , solutions that are not effective are being wiped out when hard time comes . 
  that 's why our tails are gone , why we value education , that 's why neanderthals are gone , that 's why autiomation is happening . 
  and now , a society that 's giving free money to people who are n't giving anything in return but are having access to resources is having a burden which makes it harder to compete with others . 
  the more there is useless people , the bigger the burden is . 
  that 's why it 's impossible in the long run to have a society that looks like that . 
  i do agree that there always was a place for people who did n't do anything valuable in their lifes , but it always was a margin and becouse of mentioned above reasons , it 's going to stay that way in the long run . 
  the vacuum is created when you 're not sharing anything to get the access to the resources you need o have a decent life . 
  and i did n't say it has to be work . 
  it can be knowledge ( that 's why i mentioned that the specialists will dominate even more the job market in the future ) . 
  in fact , i agree of course , that future economy will be based more and more on knowledge , less and less on manual work . 
  but the things you 're exchanging can be various , it also can be just information , it can be art . 
  but you have to have something which you can share with the society to get access to the resources in return . 
  without that you 're useless , vacuum is created , the society will start to ask why are we giving you money if you 're not giving anything in return . 
  and yeah , if it was 10 % of the society , then it 's not a biggy , but if it 's 40 % or even 70 % then these voices will really be getting loud and again , nature will abandon uneffective solutions and reward those effective . 
  people who have nothing worth sharing with others ( nor their time , work , art , knowledge , information ) will die out in one way or another . 
  if it comes to highly specialised work , in my opinion it 's useless now to think about it being taken away by robots becouse we 're really far , far , far , far away from creating a real ai , medicine would have to make a huge progress in how a mind works before that will happen . 
  besides , autiomation is n't the only consequence of technological progress , there are also other aspects , like stopping aging process , extended reality or more and more faster communication that maybe will lead us to telepathy or maybe even the definition of person will get blury when we 'll be having instant access to each other heads . 
  let 's just stick to what 's ahead of us in the first place . 
  temporarly , maybe , but nature abhors a vacuum , useless life is a vacuum . 
  how is it done in practise ? 
  at some point specialists that are doing some productive work will start asking why are they spending money on people who were n't doing anything productive for decades and those will have their benefits taken away . 
  i agree on that , but as i said before , large numbers of people are fit only to do simple work and there wo n't be much demand for it . 
  these people will be sooner or later taken out from the society , more or less brutally if they wo n't catch up and learn something to become a specialist at some field . 
  that 's only a temporary solution . 
  nature abhors a vacuum and in the long run society that consists a majority or big groups of people who are useless and who 's only life goal is to consume just ca n't happen . 
  people who wo n't fit to the new reality will just vanish in one way or another , just like hunters , nomads , gatherers went away in civilised countries when the neolithic revolution happened . 
  there 's going to be plenty of work for all kinds of specialists and we 're going to have much more money to educate more specialists but the sad fact is that large parts of people around the world are just not fit to become a specialist . 
  sad to hear . 
  i was visiting vienna in 2014 and enjoyed it . 
  however , there was something symbolic about one big , old , church located in some dense urban area which looked closed , neglected and abandoned while immigrant kids were playing football in nearby city field . 
  i do n't want to say `` how dare they '' , but it shows changes that are happening in austria today . 
  you do n't know nothing about anything . 
  expect ? 
  oh i expect it , mate , it 's my fuel !, 
  so many downvotes ... so i 'm going to repeat myself to get even more !, 
   his language is rude , but he 's right , ethnic tensions are only going to grow in western europe , also in germany . 
   as long as they are good people it 's no matter and most muslims that i know are good guys . 
  and where did i say you should care ? 
  if you do n't value your culture , you do n't care it 's being replaced with muslim culture then i 'm not going to make you care . 
  if you do n't value your church towers over minarets , you do n't see any reasons why it 's better for you , then it 's your lost , not mine . 
  maybe it is a good-bye time for germany after all ?

  two sternly worded letters ? 
  well , the ideology itself is not evil , just stupid . 
  the implementation of it , however , was plainly criminal, 
  probably some drunk guy who could n't get on the bus . 
  or , as russia today will soon report it : estonian government sentences all russian citizens to death, 
  maybe ... or maybe ukraine 's old news , now it 's time for putin to score some tzar points on estonia . 
  tell me , do you have a large russian population in estonia ? 
  and if so , why are you repressing them so horribly ? 
  do you want putin to go in and defend them ? 
  do you ? 
  stop eating russian babies you estonian nazi !, 
  except for germans . 
  for germans two 's enough, 
  quality of life is not the problem in russia , it 's that putin made his career on propaganda about the horrible west which sold russia out , how great russia can get up from its knees . 
  the only way to even try and attempt to fulfill those pipdreams is by flexing figurative muscles . 
  russians got crimea ( and for free ) , they pretty much have eastern ukraine , think they 'll want to stop now ? 
  that should be their tourist strapline : not as bad as the mongol hordes, 
  lithuania is being very ornery lately . 
  poland has their backs though , i 'm pretty sure, 
  most of the media in russia is state owned , so they do n't really need to beat their journalists . 
  foreign journalists better be careful though, 
  in poland that would be a problem , but that 's because in poland you ca n't have just one . 
  and we do n't have beer in 0.3 l cans generally, 
  i 'm surprised you have n't already , since putin clearly does n't consider the baltics sovereign nations , more like little scamps who want to be part of russia really , but are just going through their rebel phase, 
  ron swanson used to be in the kgb !, 
  but they 're still dependent on westminster , and the feeling i got was that independence would solve most of their problems . 
  my point is that they 'd probably be disappointed anyway, 
  that 's true , but you 'd be hard pressed to find a country where people do n't complain about their gov ' t, 
  true , but recently they became much more active . 
  if scitland did leave the uk , this would be a precedent for other nationalist movements, 
  a lot of glaswegians probably forgot not to get pissed . 
  to all the sad scots - at least you 'll be spared the disappointment of finding out your own government is shit - you know , like every other government in the history of all the world , ever . 
  maybe this will put the growing separatist movements in other european countries to rest . 
  danish guy has the best music by far . 
  shame , the russian clergy was always badass . 
  like norse clerics who fought in wars . 
  by the way , kaliningrad used to be yours , no ? 
  sounds like some norwegian beer or something, 
  only if he 's hungarian http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/stephen_b%c3%a1thory, 
  germany should get kaliningrad, 
  tells you something about the scottish - the roman empire conquered everything in its path , got to scotland , decided to build a wall instead ( do n't remember who made that joke first ), 
  they 're still nukes . 
  i very much doubt the rest of the world would be interested in the `` tactical '' bit, 
  brace for incoming poles, 
  shhhh !, 
  i 'd like like to see the results for `` hell no ! '', 
  um , well it is linked to europe , in that they tried a couple of times to make forays into it . 
  good job someone was vigilant http://wordwarriorsandiego.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/husaria.jpg, 
  hmmm , ok , but still , those countries are quite liberal , and rarely , if ever , do churches interfere in matters of state . 
  in the case of the uk it 's actually the other way around , with the church having to adapt to the 21st century . 
  my point about turkey was that they really do take their religion seriously , and it 's not just the muslim clerics , but government as well, 
  ironically , the most secular countries on earth, 
  i do n't know , is there any eu country which is n't explicitly secular ? 
  and i mean constitution-wise , we do have rightwingers in poland who want to make it a theocracy, 
  separation of church and state , abiding by human rights and eu trade standards . 
  if they can pull it off then yes , but i do n't see it . 
  turkey seems much more middle-east than europe, 
  you 've got me . 
  why is it that it 's usually not the british who get the qi puns ? 
  i 'm polish and i would n't go there, 
  * hail , savage !, 
  we seek passage through your land !, 
  i shall give you one pierog for a bucket of gas , how 's that sound ? 
  i read the title as `` us . 
  army captures surprised polish village '' . 
  well that would be friggin surprising, 
  zakopane in poland . 
  the mountains and vistas are nice and all , but the town of zakopane itself is purely a tourist trap . 
  so avoid that if you want to see tatry, 
  this was to be expected , poland has been too vocal in its deficance of russia . 
  i 'm sure we 'll manage , and if anything , this might push the idea of an energy union forward . 
  about time we reduced our dependance on russian gas, 
  good , they need to learn that they 're in europe , a country founded in many ways on enlightenment values . 
  you want islamic law , go to an islamic country, 
  i 'm worried that this might me an increasing trend in europe , with right-wing nationalistic parties on the rise . 
  so can we start calling russia soviet union again ? 
  i think it 's time to end the charade, 
  well since there does n't seem to be any war because of independent kosovo , and the citizens want independence , then i support it . 
  i wonder if lukashenko will leave office before he dies, 
  i 'd like to see putin or lavrov try and spin that psycho as a valiant defender of the motherland against the nazi aggressors, 
  does finland know that they want to join russia , or are they about to be volunteered ? 
  a pixar film !, 
  `` wojtek the bear finds the meaning of friendship by mercilessly mauling nazi soldiers with his paws '', 
  well i 'm guessing 1.0 would mean everyone has a positive opinion of that country , -1.0 everyone has a negative opinion and 0 means equal amounts of positive and negative . 
  so something like 0.5 should mean that for every negative there 's 1.5 positive . 
  or something , i 'm not very good with numbers, 
  '' ... on russian territory '' watch out estonia , putin might be sending a message pertaining to your borders, 
  please remove your cameras from my house, 
  i actually have a bit of a weak spot for danes , because during the floods in 1997 , danish firemen were helping out in my city . 
  thanks for that < 3, 
  they 've integrated very well . 
  a family lives next to my house , and they 're doing quite well , their kid speaks polish and has polish friends . 
  and whenever the polish football team plays on tv they always cheer the loudest, 
  nah , man , czechs are nice , laid back people . 
  i 'd actually thought czechs do n't like poles for being too dramatic with our historical grievances towards everybody, 
  we do n't get to meet that many latvians . 
  i 'd guess our attitude would be the same as towards estonians . 
  i 'm more surprised about how low lithuania did, 
  prophetic ? 
  bring bacon !,

  pepper spray , illegal in : belgium denmark finland ( you need a licence ) greece hungary iceland ireland malta the netherlands norway sweden uk https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pepper_spray#europe do you see how absurd this shit is ? 
  the only legal self defense weapon in uk is rape alarm . 
  lol, 
  no i was n't , op said there were more right wing shootings than islamic terrorism shootings which is laughable . 
  i do n't understand german but it looks like the last one was in 2012 . 
  lets compare that with islamic terrorist attacks in the last 3 years ... 
  i 'm here temporarily for work , back to europe in december . 
  if you bothered to go through my posting history to find something on me then you should have read it all . 
  ^ ^ this, 
  lol, 
   and simple pistol ownership is legal in european countries , but you 've got no clue what you 're talking about , have n't you ? 
  which ones ? 
  not in uk where i live . 
  i 'm a 5 ' 2 tall petite woman and i ca n't even carry pepper spray lol . 
  yeah just like they are n't happening in europe now . 
  if jo cos murderer was motivated by right wing politics then im happy to accept that . 
  no you 're not to blame for terrorist attacks but that kind of lenient approach and refusal to get strict and allow people to defend themselves is partially to blame ( when it comes from leftist leaders ) for the disarray europe is in today . 
  link, 
  plenty mass shootings stopped by gun owners too : http://controversialtimes.com/issues/constitutional-rights/12-times-mass-shootings-were-stopped-by-good-guys-with-guns/ fyi , i am not advertising for assault weapons , simple pistol ownership should be allowed . 
  i never said i want to be an american , i have simply compared how peaceful things are in armed texas . 
  if you think that it 's a good idea that a female in europe is n't allowed to carry anything for protection then you and your way of `` thinking '' is precisely the reason we 're in this shit . 
  as for the media there were plenty attempts to censor things ( such as attacks in cologne ) . 
  how many shootings have right wing extremists committed in the past 5 years ? 
  no , i will not `` wait '' for innocent people being shot again . 
  i am not talking about aks but at least a pistol for protection . 
  banning all guns is not going to make it harder for them either . 
  there is a reason why things like that are nipped in a bud or barely every happen in places like texas . 
  most people have guns and are n't afraid to use them . 
  furthermore , as more and more of these situations are happening in europe i think people should have the right to be able to defend themselves . 
  here we go again . 
  if this guy is muslim i wonder how the media will try to censor it this time or blame it on lack of gun control . 
  if anything , europe needs more gun access . 
  it 's scary to think that in many eu countries you can face jail for possessing pepper spray . 
  then the private religious schools need to be outlawed . 
  great decision . 
  as a pole living in the uk i totally support uk 's government right to withdraw their benefits to people who are newcomers in the country . 
  personally , i only know one polish person who has moved to the uk to give birth and milk the system but i 'm sure there 's more and these people make my skin crawl . 
  nationalism is on the rise everywhere in europe , not only poland . 
  it 's a knee jerk reaction to regressive leftist policies of ultra liberal governments and uncontrolled immigration . 
  after what happened in cologne on new years eve , after rotherham scandal , charlie hebdo , danish cartoons , thousands of western born and raised muslims joining isis and many other violent and rapey incidents that plagued europe people do n't want any more muslims in their countries . 
  the change you see in people who were once neutral is a reaction to all that too . 
  i hate how conservative , catholic and right wing poland is , but when it comes to being against immigration from muslim countries they are right . 
  and just because we joined the eu did n't mean there was no nationalism . 
  there are thousands of polish people in the uk supporting ukip , for many nationalism has shifted from polish nationalism to european one . 
  poland after fall of communism was in fact just as a nationalist as it is today if not more . 
  we were less exposed to immigration and nationalism was n't talked about especially on an international scale . 
  while i lived abroad i still go to poland about 5 times a year to meet with my family an my cousins who were skin heads in their 20s and now as 40 something year old men remain non aggressive nationalists so i probably have more knowledge about the subject than you do, 
  poland has always been nationalist regardless of government . 
  what do you mean `` syrians should be . . '' ? 
  we have accepted christian syrians and they left for germany . 
  did you miss that part ? 
  as for muslima i 'm sorry but even though i 'm a liberal i 'm with polish government here ( and the rest of v4 ) . 
  muslims have turned counties like sweden or germany into hell holes . 
  i lived abroad for years , ithese people do n't assimilate , most remain on welfare and spread their cancerous pseudo political ideology of usurpation and control in their free time . 
  poland does n't need this shit . 
  and you are out of your mind if you think ukrainians are gon na be scapegoats . 
  polish nationalists see other slavs and eastern europeans ( apart from russsia ) as theit brothers . 
  sorry but what are you talking about ? 
  i 'm saying canada is more strict . 
  uk is n't and it shows . 
  uk is notorious for accepting illiterate uneducated unskilled migrants who remain on welfare . 
  i lived in uk and i currently live in canada . 
  canada has a very strict point system when it comes to refugees/immigrants/asylants . 
  canada experiences very little to no problems with its migrant population because it 's not only very selective but also very careful as to whom they are letting in . 
  even the syrian refugees they accepted have been cherry picked ( most educated from upper middle class , families only , no single males , priority given to christians , gays and sexual assault victims ) . 
  for those reasons canada is doing the best in my opinion . 
  poland has large se asian population too . 
  these people never cause any problems, 
  let me remind you that poland has a very large se asian population . 
  several years ago polish government issued amnesty for those who were in poland illegally and gave them indefinite right to remain . 
  poland happily accepts ukrainian , vietnamese , chinese , korean , cambodian and thai immigrants . 
  poland simply said no to muslim immigrants and rightly so . 
  we have few hundreds syrian refugees privatly sponsored and fuckers escaped to germany, 
  liberals are n't but neo liberal leftist social justice warriors are . 
  the most self sufficient , hard working , money and education oriented people on the planet . 
  and they come free of religion and ideology . 
  that 's why muslims assimilate so much better in the us . 
  americans are non apologetic and do n't bend over backwards to accommodate these people, 
  that 's why these conventions need to be amended . 
  no law , no rule , no constitution is written in the stone . 
  there are also other options . 
  i wrote about it here : https://www.reddit.com/r/askeurope/comments/4n576v/should_eu_adapt_australias_refugee_policy/ also , countries like denmark managed to have an opt out when it comes to these conventions and many rulings do n't apply to them . 
  european court of human rights is n't an eu institution . 
  it 's part of european council which has 47 members . 
  european court of justice is an eu court . 
  i think countries need to sort themselves out internally and stop bowing to these institutions . 
  liberal leaders are the problem , not the eu itself . 
  which is silly because leaving the eu wo n't resolve that . 
  eu members can also work and live in non eu countries which are in eea . 
  and i do n't see how possibly could uk not be in the eea after brexit . 
  it would be economic suicide . 
  haha i love saurkraut, 
  sorry yes i meant uninhabited . 
  and dude i lived in london . 
  perhaps you can find this in richmond park and photoshop it a little bit but it 's still not a sandy beach and blue water . 
  do n't get me wrong , i fucking love london , but it 's not a pretty city . 
  poor sweden . 
  everyone 's bashing swedish food, 
  of course we have our problems . 
  i 'm inclined to blame rampant catholicism as a source of most of them .

  yeah , i just wanted to know where you found it . 
  understood , thanks . 
  is this you , or there 's a sauce that goes with this ? 
  [ been there , done that ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vistula_land ), 
  i realise that . 
  i wonder where is the line we 'll inexorably draw ( and we will draw it , because the migratory pressures will not lessen , they will increase ) , beyond which the immoral will become the moral , i.e. 
  where refusing to accept more will be the right thing to do . 
  also , please do note , i very consciously use the word `` refugee '' . 
  economic migrants , as understandable as their dreams of a better life may be , will have to increasingly sit this one out , are we to fulfil our current moral duty and accept the real refugees ( who also , however callous it may seem , will have to be screened ) . 
  that may be in accordance with the letter of the law , but is it accordance with the spirit of humanity ? 
  they remain refugees until they find themselves in a situation that bears a semblance to normal life - life you or i could lead , if need be ; i 'm not talking about luxuries , i 'm talking about a life in dignity . 
  one mpe yesterday , following juncker 's speech said it aptly : dublin ( the agreement , not the city ) is dead . 
  it is impossible to expect hungary , greece , italy , spain to house all those people . 
  a redistribution scheme is an inevitability that is preferable to a collapse of the eu , is it not ? 
  to me it is . 
  it 's a terrible solution , but it 's better than many other alternatives . 
  why are n't other alternatives pursued , if better ones do exist ? 
  i suppose some alternatives are being pursued , even if it 's with the same kind of limp conviction the eu , when working on a divisive issue , has been mustering for the past months/years , [ edit : but it 's taking time . ], 
  it 's a shite game to continue to play the way we have been ; something needs to change , but taking it out on the refugees is a shite way to go about it . 
  i totally lost it !, 
  wonderful , thanks . 
  what 's the source for this image ? 
  can some swedish speaker shed some light ? 
  okay , thanks . 
  i do n't remember these threads and i suppose they must have simply slipped under the radar , considering there was little to no discussion in two of them , and i do n't always check the `` new '' tab , or `` controversial '' or however people find those threads . 
  apologies , i take back what i wrote earlier . 
  * doublon * the thread away !, 
  it does n't seem to have been posted previously , though ? 
  perhaps it 's the awareness of finding himself in [ the kind of place the eu is ] ( http://gutenberg.spiegel.de/gutenb/brant/narrens/bilder/0004.jpg ) when taking into account the actual level of agency he has that stands behind and colours his behaviour ? 
  oh , do n't worry , there is a rotation , as they are no strangers to burn out . 
  no , nowhere have i stated that it ( i.e. 
  the idea of employing the best employee available ) seems hard to me . 
  i really do n't know where you 're taking this from . 
  i am sorry , but no , that does not explain it . 
  i 'm not sure if i understood you correctly - but are you currently , or have you previously been , an interpreter ? 
  if not , then i dare say you may not have developed a good enough comprehension of what being in that job entails . 
  rest assured , i can say with total confidence that these interpretations are in 99.999 % of cases ** not ** being carried out badly on purpose and that those interpreters there are striving for performing to the best of their abilities . 
  do you agree with the sentiment of the now deleted comment ? 
  that the politico interpretation was lacking ? 
  i only listened to it for a brief moment and it 's really difficult for me to judge , the interpretation overdubbing the original on both channels and me not knowing french ( was it french juncker was speaking ? 
  ) ; from the brief moment i had listened to it , though , i was not struck with an impression of a glaringly broken message . 
  for the eu official stream translation i was not struck with such an impression either , but i really am in no position to judge between the two interpretations . 
  if politico 's interpretations are , indeed , crap , then , yes , they ought to reconcile their economic capacity with a desire to present the original message as verily as possible . 
  that 's a given , is n't it ? 
  but will you agree with me it is taxing and difficult and mishaps are inevitable ? 
  would you also agree with me that there are various circumstances that can vastly affect an interpreters performance on a given day and it requires tremendous mental stamina to perform consistently on a high level for extended periods of time ? 
  i encourage you to learn a foreign language and conduct a simultaneous live interpretation , flawlessly . 
  then do it for one , two hours non-stop . 
  have fun . 
  you will have noted the disclaimer present on the [ official stream ] ( http://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/news-room/content/20150831ipr91005/html/state-of-the-union-statement-by-president-of-the-commission-09-09-2015 ) . 
  bottom line ? 
  simultaneous live interpretation is a very taxing and difficult thing . 
  what ? 
  i thought it was pretty amusing , 
  moderation is needed , of this there can be no doubt . 
  i am of the opinion , however , that we should be careful about discretionary banning . 
  every such instance should be afforded heightened scrutiny . 
  i am ready to say that , from what i 've seen , there have been cases of unfounded de-listing by the mod in question . 
  two conclusions , at this stage : * the rest of the mod team need to get their collective rear into gear and participate , especially in these contentious examples ; * if shills are such an issue , limit absolutely new accounts ( gestation period up for debate by the mods ) from submitting new links/self-posts and append a `` new user '' flair to post submissions within existing threads ( like , for instance , / r/russia did ) . 
  perhaps introduce a requirement of activity during the gestation period to make shills jump through additional loops for inconvenience , so they ca n't just register batches of new accounts for future use and would have to at least invest the effort to accrue some activity record on the account . 
  maybe it 's a sort of a reverse charade ? 
  get everyone to come to europe , while sneaky-sneaky europeans grab hold of the entire africa and middle earst all in one fell swoop , ta-da , cha-ching !, 
  that is not entirely true , is it , though ? 
  yes , there is a lack of vigorous effort on the repatriation front , and a huge disparity between the professed will for reunification and actual effort . 
  yes , the government can and has to intensify its efforts - and someone with their head screwed on right ought to sort out a comprehensive pipeline from the top down and bottom up : how to inform these people about the legal possibilities ( karta polaka , etc. 
  ) , then some work ought to be done on how karta polaka works in practice , clerks should get a move on in processing applications , yes . 
  `` does n't care '' is a bit of an unnecessary exaggeration , though , i think . 
  something is better than nothing and it ought to be a starting point for further efforts . 
  and polish . 
  i wish someone up and wiped that scum off the face of the earth !, 
  / * s *** s *** s *, 
  i think you are confusing me with someone . 
  i 'm not getting worked up . 
  quite the opposite . 
  i am very , very calm . 
  my first sentence was a joke ( ha-ha ) . 
  the only person that seems to be working themselves up is you . 
  easterners , in my view , do n't usually act as if you should thank them on your knees ; on the whole , they act as human beings who would like to be treated as such by their fellow human beings ( i presume this applies to you ? ) . 
  i implore you to take a minute , calm down , think about your feelings for a moment and understand that you 've gone off on a bit of a tangent , perhaps spurred on by some internal frustrations of yours , the way it looks to me . 
  do i want a good life ? 
  yes . 
  does being in the eu ( whilst staying in my native country , mind ; i do n't believe in the mass migration and do n't want to be part of a problem ) allow me to improve my life faster than it would be happening outside the eu ? 
  yes . 
  am i taking things away from you ? 
  i do n't know , you tell me . 
  tell me how much you 've lost because of me ( figuratively ) being in the eu . 
  then think about whether there is any benefit of countries other than yours being in the eu ? 
  if you ca n't find any , maybe it 's time to clamour for a change of the situation to your politicians . 
  or perhaps it 's a time to try and find out more why we 're together in the same house now ( figuratively ) . 
  peace be with you . 
  i know , hence i wrote  a mixture of a range european nations ** that was subsequently being added to ** i apologise for oversimplifying , as , yes , initially there was more than the purely european elements . 
  i also wrote that comment in a hurry , early in the morning . 
  we can count on your total and absolute understanding , as usual , of course , no ? 
  bitter sarcasm aside , levelling differences what everyone was signing up for when the eu was extended , sorta kinda , would n't you say ? 
  i 'm not sure it has to entail a `` deterioration for you '' , as you put it . 
  maybe it will , sorry . 
  the world is not fair , humans tend to be shitty to each other , nature does n't care , life goes on . 
  the end . 
  i will have to whole-heartedly agree and say you aptly enunciated a few important points . 
  the questions of how many more refugees are to be expected , how many more europe ( collectively ) will be able to shelter and what is being done about the root causes come to mind .

   no protection from the provision of goods and services it 's illegal to ** not ** sell stuff/provide services for people with exception for alcohol ( when you 're drunk , though , no one care ) / certain medical stuff ( pharmacologists/medical doctors can say they wo n't do/sell you something , like for example day after pill becouse of their beliefs ) , other that people ** have to ** sell you stuff/provide services , that 's the law here , so there 's no special treatment for lgbt + people becouse they are already included . 
   hate speech well , our penal code says it 's illegal to insult/beat other `` person '' / `` human '' i do n't see how we ( lgbt + ppl ) are legally not enough protected , we are not a special snowflakes and last time i checked lgbt + people still were people/humans so as such were protected by polish law . 
   did n't pretty much all of britain endorse fighting a war over some rocks in the south atlantic dude , you can attack uk for many things , but falklands are n't one of them . 
  that 's why i like freedom of speech so much . 
  it 's not `` like '' the reader was mocking christians , he did mock them , he openly denied something that is foundation of christianity . 
  imagine going to mosque and giving speech about how mohammed the desert pedophile was n't actually a prophet but just a scam , pedophile and murderer . 
  such things are matter of local government and it is generally accepted , since there 's no law about how you should measure distance between school and store with alcohol licence sometimes it is measured from school fence , sometimes from school doors , sometimes from school gate . 
  when it comes to freedom of speech central/eastern europe is better ( more free ) than western europe , we had communism , we actually know how it is to not be able to speak what you think . 
  you are aware that those far right dudes protest was about what happened in cologne last year . 
  they are not trying to impose nazism , they 're pretty much saying `` sexually harrasing women is not ok , we are not ok with that , we are pissed '' . 
  do n't they have a right to their own opinion ? 
  is sexually harassing women ok ? 
  or is defending women wrong when you are far right ? 
  it 's good for their ( chinese ) economy , why should n't we invest or as you may prefer `` invest '' in africa ? 
  bull , you really can get plane ticket nyc-eu for like 500-600 euros . 
  he like guns and he is not leftist , therefore literally neo-nazi and probably hitler . 
   they still are , fuck off with that shitty argument . 
  why is it shitty argument ? 
  refugee is a person that seeks refuge , in few words ; shelter , peace . 
  refugee is not a person that seeks german euros instead of liras or forints . 
  so what you are saying is we should give them access to our market , give them money and hope they will take their citizens back ? 
  are you sane person ? 
  that would hurt our economy badly . 
  traditionally it 's fat based cream that keeps your skin from drying , cracking etc. 
  in low temperatures . 
  proper ushatka and you are good to go . 
  eu statistics are nowadays strawman ` couse they do n't portray those slavs as backward people ? 
  good one . 
   classic east-european racists that 's xenophobia my friend, 
  actually eastern/central europe is safer for woman than western, 
  more liberal , in good sense of that word , than rest of former eastern block countries . 
  i 'm complaing about coloured models advertising ** clothing ** in poland just becouse it 's difficult for me figured out if those clothing will look good on me , but that 's me . 
  i 'm mean , what 's the point of using coloured models to advertise clothing in a country that is literally 99,9 % white. , not 9,99 % white , not 70 % white , ** 99,9 % ** white . 
  i 'm centre-right guy ( for polish standards ) and i 'm voting razem next time since there 's no centre-right/libertarian party that would satisfy me and there 's no leftist opposition in our parliament atm and razem will probably be better leftist opposition to pis/po - . n than sld ( ex-commies , caviar left ) . 
  no it is not , are you aware that same colour look differently on different skin tones/colours ? 
  and hungary , romania , moldova, 
  everywhere where somalis live they couse damage socially . 
  40 % alcohol can easily freeze in those temperatures ( it freeze in -30 c ) , that 's why 70-80 % moonshine was invented . 
  in that case self defense would be moving to normandy/brittany/s, 
  unluckily it 's illegal here , it 's either range , hunting or not shooting at all . 
  your are right , but but generally speaking cypriots are of greek origin in the same way poles are slavic or estonians ugro finnic . 
  not really , nicosia is capital of cyprus , inhabitants of cyprus are cypriots , people of greek origin , using greek langauge , having european culture . 
  so nicosia , geographically being city in mediterranean island close to continental asia has very little to do with asia , like , for example mersin , southern anatolia , just by the fact that it is in allegedly european country , in my opinion due to their culture , language , history etc. 
  is not european . 
  it really depends on a country and on source they 're using , in poland for example according to catholic church ~ 96-8 % of our population are ** members ** of catholic church , and legally , becouse of baptism , they are , however when it comes to census collected data ( state runs censuses , they 're very accurate ) only 87,6 % ( and 96 % of believing ) population consider themselves members of catholic church ( 7 % of population did n't answer question about their faith ) . 
  that 's why when it comes to poland you get ~ 90 % catholics . 
  `` what does it have to do with europe ? '', 
  from pole  more seriously though , mersin is in asia , it has as much to do with europe as damascus or almaty , kazahstan . 
  and you ruined everything . 
  as `` cheap '' , not low quality , you know , croatia is not pricey place , though it is very nice country , such places as diocletian palace in split , dubrovnik , those beautiful lakes near bosnia border are wonderful . 
  not worse , just different from `` made by polish person '' . 
  polish chavs , not skinheads . 
  where ? 
  it 's not like it has something to do with they 're cultural background , not skills . 
  only 650 ? 
  that 's progress , in 2014 they burned slightly over 1000 cars, 
   ethnic groups no ethnic groups here , just foreigners with completely different cultural background and local chav . 
   we 'd be talking about the heroic polish shopkeeper who stopped a muslim terrorist from blowing up his business . 
  was lethal force necessary ? 
  maybe , maybe not . 
  would it be viewed as necessary or even brave if the shopkeeper was a polish catholic and the guy with the firecracker was muslim ? 
  quite likely . 
  however it did n't happened . 
  what happed is : one ( probably drunk ) young ( 21 ) idiot threw firecracker into kebab place , four ( 4 ) muslim foreigners stabbed that idiot to death . 
  what that young pole did was stupid and inappropriate , however actions taken by that four guys are completely unacceptable . 
  in poland if those immigrants just beat ( as couple bruises , not few broken bones ) that guy to teach him a lesson whould be seen as inappropriate , however somehow acceptable . 
  but killing a guy over firecracker ? 
  that 's completely overreaction , especially when we 're talking about four guys on one . 
  so just stop making it the other way around . 
  good ale . 
  known for their `` shitty '' roads in netherlands , though that 's more of stereotype . 
  they 've got many statues of leopold ii , kongo owner . 
  2 main ethnic groups , flemish people and the other ones / s. 
  a lot of non europeans , especially in brussels . 
  good fries . 
  chocolate . 
   this is not really a conversation i wish to have . 
  i understand and respect that , have nice day mate . 
  you know , hitler erased assimilating minority and many people who had for example jewish grandparent , people who were fully asimilated , like polish of jewish origin/poles of jewish faith . 
  stalin changed our borders and that 's how we got rid of problematic minority . 
  in my opinion what hitler did was way worse for us as a country and as a nation . 
   more like the exact opposite . 
  slovakia and the czech lands did not have a `` shared history '' until 1918 they did n't ? 
  what about austria and later austria-hungary ? 
  you forgot hitler , it 's not like he got rid of our 3rd biggest ethnic group . 
  though having homogenous country is not that bad after all , to be clear i 'm not talking about how that homogeneity happened , i 'm talking how it is with homogeneity and it 's pretty good , no religious minority problems , like with before wwii , no separatists movements/terrorists , like ukrainians in poland before wwii , like kurds in nowadays turkey , no `` opressed minority '' claims . 
  homogeneity might be boring , but i prefer boring over dangerous and you have to agree that poland is actually quite safe country . 
  polish hools are fighting without `` tools '' , exception for cracow area , when it comes to hools killing is extremely rare , beating is usually all . 
  source : i grew up in rough neighbourhood . 
   nothing to do with morons demolishing someone 's else property and getting stabbed in the process . 
  dude , polish guy literally threw firecracker , he got stabbed . 
  it 's like wearing short skirt , walking thru muslim naighbourhood and getting raped , but hey , she asked for it , at least that 's what you 're trying to say . 
  guess what , stabbing is not accepted in our culture . 
  you know , when those muslims just stubbed someone over the firecracker then they are , well , not welcome . 
   all i 'm saying is that the ubiquitous baldness/buzzcut was very noticebale in my few days i spent in poland . 
  yes it is , you know you 're in poland when you see all those bald people , kebabs and ugly `` bilboards '' everywhere . 
  i 'm 21 and a lot of my friends ( and i ) are bald/have realy short hair becouse they naturally lost a lot of their hair . 
  i have no idea how it is in austria though in poland if you 're loosing hair it 's completely fine to have really short hair/be bald , no reason to shame/make laugh , and trust me having really short hair/being bald is comfy as hell , i had really long hair and now i 'm bald . 
   tell that to the americans dying from the gun culture over there . 
  tell that to swiss ( 45/100 ) , scandinavians , germans and french with their 30guns/100ppl .

  just look at canada . 
  that would be admiting vatniks are in government , 
  good pr stunt , but still . 
  i 'm originaly from small village in eastern poland . 
  it shrinked considerably , and is still shrinking . 
  it 's 20 km from w\u0142odawa , 60 km from lublin . 
  big cities ( like lublin and bigger ) shrink in favour of villages that are up to 30 km from them , because people prefer to live in suburbia , but work and educate their kids in cities . 
  small cities and villages far from big cities shrink because young people go to big cities and never come back . 
  yeah , my bad , we were invited in 1997 , but accepted in 1999 . 
  yes we do . 
  what 's the problem with that ? 
  people prefer to live in cities , why should we force them to live in villages ? 
  nothing . 
  some people would need to adjust their stereotypes a little . 
  i 'd like to remind people that in 1990 poland was poorer and less stable than ukraine ( then part of ussr ) , had russian army on its teritory , was deep in debts , had hyperinflation . 
  in 1997 it was in nato and in 2004 in eu . 
  nothing bad happened because of that . 
  of course ukraine has to solve a lot of issues first , but other countries had issues too , when they started to candidate . 
  also russians would n't start ww3 , get real . 
  - can you blame putin for economic downturn ? 
  meh , he 's either dumb or trolling . 
  there was a great polish movie about such `` declassification '' in poland after 1989 . http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0105185/?ref_=ttpl_pl_tt tl ; dw : security officers got `` verified '' by the vips that remained in power , the low level agents had to go to police or mafia , the archives were burned and there were organized crime and chaos for a few years , after that it got progressively better . 
  we have stalin orders to execute hundreds of tousands of people . 
  before russia went derp again after nineties they opened archives to historians . 
  they do keep archives . 
  if it was all about currency - should n't the countries with euro all have the same prices levels ? 
  it 's a combination of many factors , including how much and how efficiently your country produces daily products like food , clothing , fuels , etc , or how far it is and with what relations with big exporters of such products . 
  also tax law matters . 
  also israeli whatevers . 
  yay we had colonies too . 
  and then we mistreated them , lost them , and became a colony . 
  it is nationalist . 
  why should we treat ukrainians that had polish grand-grand-pa better than ones that have n't ? 
  it 's stupid , really . 
  it 's a relict of wild nineties . 
  and anyway that distant polish relatives do n't mean they are polish culturaly , will integrate better , or whatever , it 's just arbitrary division . 
  not really . 
  poles and romanians are eu citizens co they have the same rights as uk citizens . 
  ukrainians are n't eu citizens ( yet ) so they can have free movement without other rights . 
  depends on the details of that potential treaty . 
  it 's not the same . 
  example - most multiplayer games ( like starcraft , lol , counterstrike ) do n't have language specific servers . 
  you want to speak with the people you play - speak english . 
  kids novadays have as many friends online as offline . 
  the online ones may live anywhere . 
  on the other hand ` learn french to read this awesome poetry in original ' is n't going to persuade many kids . 
  in general countries far from russia want russia closer , and countries close to russia want it far away . 
  i think we should move russia between france and germany . 
  ukraine ( and the ` lands down to the black sea ' ) were part of poland ( the crown ) , not lithuania during commonwealth . 
  polish-lithuanian commonwealth stopped being personal union in 1569 . http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/union_of_lublin or to be exact it was never personal union , it was created in1569 , before there was no commonwealth , just union of 2 states . 
  and in 1791 it become regular monarchy ( not for long , but there were a polish - russian war at that time as well ) . 
  and then we had puppet state called warsaw duchy , there was also so called congress kingdom - both polish only ( at least when respective wars against russia started ) . 
  and btw russian partition of poland included warsaw ( most of the time ) , as did most of the uprisings . 
  this is certainly poland not lithuania . 
  in any case if polish soldiers are in kreml and polish king is tzar i would call poland involved . 
  same the other way - if russian army is in warsaw how is the war ` mediated ' by lithuania ? 
  i really do n't understand your point , and i suspect you are just underinformed . 
  also between ww1 and ww2 you skipped 1920 war between poland and ussr ( i 'm confused if you count ussr or no ) . 
  if you care about names so much - germany invaded ussr not russia , and was occupied by ussr , not russia . 
  so you are wrong even using these absurdly formal criteria . 
  also , using logic and set theory : if poland and lithuania both fought a war against russia - poland fought a war against russia . 
  next you 're going to complain it was called muscovy during some of these wars . 
  at least it 's not discrimination - russians do n't have free media either . 
  this wo n't work . 
  kids will see it as stupid bureaucracy waste of time and wo n't bother . 
  without motivation education is waste of time , and how to motivate people to learn language that allows you to communicate with 0 new people ? 
  wow , we have like 95 % , and people are complaining . 
   what he says is that the ( far ) left and the ( far ) right ( and some other movements ) should unite against their common enemy -- the `` present state of things '' . 
  nothing new . 
  ribbentrop-molotov once again . 
  yes , just like nato started ww3 over snowden . 
  listen to the debate in poland about so called in-vitro or homosexualism , or act against violence towards women ... 
  it 's not the retarded `` earth is 6000 years old '' version , but it is still dumb . 
  is n't it already the case ? 
  we are in one economic union , and military alliance . 
  we work together in many german and polish - owned companies , we are each other significant trade partner . 
  what more do you want ? 
  and people in sattelite states ( and much of ussr ) - would welcome them with flowers . 
  we do all sorts of meat . 
  not our fault you import only the cheapest stuff . 
  i guess taxpayers that bail them out . 
  if you screw up in a company - you got fired , possibly the company go bust . 
  if you screw up as a president ( and it 's much harder to do - you can just smile and do nothing ) - at worst you are n't elected the next time . 
  the whole democracy is based on the fact that politicians are interchangeable and unimportant . 
  milk ( and other ) quotas were one of the biggest arguments against polish eu accession . 
  samoobrona ( anti-eu farmers ' party ) persuaded farmers that they wo n't be able to sell their milk ( and it was true to some degree ) . 
  i remember driving through poland in nineties - every single plot of grass had a few cows grazing . 
  now only big farmers keep cows , 100 or more . 
  i wonder if this change will mean keeping a few animals will become profitable again . 
  we still have a lot of small farmers ( hidden unemployement really ) , if they bought a few cows each - poland could increase milk production a few times easily . 
  so - watch milk prices , 
  we kinda were . 
  pi\u0142sudski organised unofficial polish army , and let powers negotiate who will give poland bigger autonomy if they fight for them . 
  in the end he used that army to free the whole poland . 
  it 's made by tomek bagi\u0144ski studio - platige image . 
  he also did short animation katedra ( https://www.google.pl/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0ccmqyckwaa&amp;url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.youtube.com%2fwatch%3fv%3dlrcn2dlff5y&amp;ei=6l0bvaf-momusagewyp4ag&amp;usg=afqjcnggisembwh_8rupqw9ekazkwy94mw&amp;sig2=0h4yhuwvqvygrkxezo0i6w&amp;bvm=bv.89744112,d.bgg ) that was candidate for oscar a few years ago , and videos for all the witcher games . 
  stalin could stop ww2 by simply not allying with hitler . 
  no need to kill millions of people ( and i fail to see how red terror before and after ww2 helped defeat hitler ) . 
  how easy it is to justify crimes done to other people . 
  i was on mid-tier universities too ( umcs and kul in lublin ) .

  theoretically ; however this does not mean that axel springer is dictating what the polish media are printing , and `` most of polish commercial media '' means also pani domu , komputer \u015awiat or g\u0142os chrzanowa dolnego - magazines or local dailies . 
   media created image that being pro-pis makes you look like coming from poor , rural areas , being ultra-catholic , stupid and clueless about pillars of democracy . 
  ` makes you look ' - is being from poor rural areas is something you should be afraid of ? 
  is being a catholic from a small village something wrong ? 
  but these people do vote for pis . 
   truth is that anti-pis was in power for 8 years , constantly bashing pis which was in opposition , still somehow having 95 % of friendliness in both commercial and public media coverage . 
  and yet po lost . 
  amazing . 
   former government is playing dirty by making unrest , protests and giving poland bad image abroad and pis government is playing dirty by seizing all power against constitution and fighting judges who were elected by anti-pis and today are more like politician themselves . 
  there are people in kod who did not participate in the former government . 
  i know people from razem who joined in ( but did not support kod because it was supposed to be apolitical ) . 
  furthermore , all kod does is demonstrating their opposition ( which is why it 's a failure ) - they did n't even work on `` unrest '' . 
   washington post 's member of editorial board is anne applebaum , pulitzer prize-winning author who is married to radek sikorski - prominent polish politician and former minister of foreign affairs in tusk 's anti-pis government . 
  except that sikorski was also a pis member , and was ousted by po , most notably schetyna . 
   i 'm polish 30yo , living in city , working in it , non-catholic , non-patriotic , non-leftist . 
  i hate all politics . 
  sadly even if you 're not interested in politics , politics will be interested in you . 
  if you 're educated for taxpayers ' money , enjoy stability and peace , you should take interest in your country . 
  if you call all politicians ` mafia ' , why do n't you run yourself ? 
   except those parties and governments are the ones that leave your people in poverty and steal money from the government . 
  the alternatives also did this . 
  orban got to power because socialists basically admitted that they lied to the country for years . 
  the crux of existence of pis is the mythical `` uk\u0142ad '' - the liberal wing of solidarity ( not exactly po ) making a deal with communists to monopolize polish politics ( uk\u0142ad ) , intellectuals and press ( salon ) and the economy ( oligarchs ) . 
  therefore , if you have participated in polish politics outside pis , published in media not owned by pis , or own a business that does not support pis you are in cahoots with ex communists and are therefore a leftist . 
  i was having my student practices at tvp at the time , farfa\u0142 was an ex-neonazi from m\u0142odzie\u017c wszechpolska who got sworn in by pis/lpr coalition and he stayed there for a long time . 
  razem and nowoczesna are the only parties that respect european solidarity , yes . 
  so should i wait until more houses of my compatriots are burned down ? 
  really , when was the last time i trolled ? 
  ask them how should victims of such attacks react . 
  i do n't believe that bending over and being a good little european is the polish way . 
  that 's right , only the brits can insult others !, 
   it 's that they tend to be lazy sure , people do n't work because they 're lazy . 
  it 's like i 'm hearing a 19th century aristocrat . 
   exactly 0 polish people have been deported as a result of the referendum . 
  yet . 
  in a couple of months article 50 will be invoked and the poles will have 2 years to move away . 
   also , remember that 48 % voted remain , and you 're lumping those 48 % with the 52 % that voted leave ? 
  over 15 million people ? 
  that 's how democracy works . 
  is n't it great ? 
  my dad was once working in america in the 80s , he was asked `` if you do n't like this government , why do n't you elect another . '' . 
  same with britons - only your democracy is not a sham . 
  that 's how human mind works , right ? 
  the current events ( and the european and global history ) have created in my mind a conviction : british = = racist . 
  it 's up to britons to convince me otherwise . 
   if i went to university , studied my ass off , got a good job and worked hard all my life , should i then have to give half of my wealth to some slack on benefits ? 
  ... do you honestly think that socialism means that a man will come to your house and live off your money ? 
  or maybe if you went to a state-sponsored university , you should give some money back to society , so that `` slacks on benefits '' could take an evening course and stop being on benefits ? 
   the vast majority of people have nothing against polish people . 
  and yet , the majority voted to throw the polish out of the country . 
  i 've never claimed to be a genius . 
  they judge me based on polish migrants , why ca n't i judge them back ? 
  why would n't i ? 
  i tried being politically correct and i 've gained nothing , while these would-be arsonists won the election and will get away with it with a slap on the wrist . 
   you should bail out back to poland or become brit , that 's they solution they want , innit ? 
  so when someone calls me vermin i should bow down ? 
  again , these `` morons '' decided that all polish people must leave home because they steal jobs . 
  why should i be better than them ? 
  so attacking innocent people is an `` opinion '' now ? 
  in general , yes , if you allow thugs like that to attack innocent people , you share some of the blame . 
  not really , anything is justified as long as you defend your nation from the agressors . 
  being left-wing also means that the exploited stand together against the exploiters . 
  the poor vs. the rich , if you want me to be simplistic . 
  these are the same people - they live in the same country , share a culture , past and background . 
  again , if they want to burn my house , should i give them flowers ? 
  who says i 'm a racist ? 
  if british people attack me , why ca n't i defend myself ? 
  i am serious . 
  if history taught me anything , it 's that hatred and racism are answered only by the equal hatred . 
  so when an angry englishman attacks you with a knife , how would you determine his alignment ? 
  the uk will only benefit from brexit , they 're rich and influential , it 's the weaker ee states that will be hurt by eu falling apart the most . 
  who are encouraged by gaining majority in a recent referendum . 
  the `` leave won , you got 48 hours to pack up '' crowd would n't do it if they lost , innit ? 
  of course it is . 
  it 's in their interest to keep us inferior . 
  yet . 
  oh , now you want to distinguish the good from the bad ? 
  do n't you think it 's a little too late for this ? 
  told you , nothing bad can happen to the western europeans , they always seem to land on their four feet , while the east inevitably bears the brunt of their follies . 
   how about not judging an entire nation based on a tiny percentage of incidents ? 
   there 's a bit too late for that , is n't it ? 
  and it 's not like the leave campaign did n't find out every single misdemeanor by a polish migrant . 
    some of us love you and fight for you . 
  and some do n't . 
   only a complete fucking dipshit would ever attack a polish person for being polish . 
  surprise , turns out that complete dipshits and people who support them are a majority in uk . 
  if i were polish living in britain , i would . 
  you want conflict , you 'll have a conflict . 
  so i should stay silent and bow my head , accepting that the british are allowed to use violence and threats ? 
  why not ? 
  they do it . 
  of course i do , i actively work in razem party which opposes racism and nationalism . 
  i used to think that the brits were our allies , but now i clearly see the truth . 
  they are just like the rest of the west , praising the poles when it 's convenient , and calling us vermin and willing to murder at a drop of the hat . 
  i wo n't forget these attacks , nor will i forgive . 
  i just posted the quote where he says to uproot the poles , and he acted upon them . 
  oh , so you think he did nothing to act upon these words ? 
   while inhumane , you need to explain how they justify the word genocide . 
  the man himself . 
  the same bismarck who advocated genocide of the poles ?

  communists lack of competence killed many more . 
  just think about great famines they caused , ukraine , china , nobody cares . 
  some commenters here seem like they want people from central and eastern europe to be happy about it , while a lot of them lost as many if not more of their family members to soviets . 
  i might be overreacting a bit but when pretty much every person around you have some war story in their family and that is not about fighting but genocide by either nazis or soviets then it gives you some perspective . 
  it 's not black and white like some want us to see this , it 's black and black . 
  when some of your relatives or friends gets murdered , starved or worked to death you do n't exactly contemplate if the person responsible did it because that relative was kulak or subhuman . 
  tell that to hundreds of thousands of eastern europeans who end up 2 meters underground after soviets came and many more who were killed under puppet regimes . 
  both were horrible . 
  philistine !, 
  sejm , pronounced like `` same '' and still has the same name . 
  she looks a bit like an evil crazy disney lady . 
  his look and that blink just says `` da faq is happening right now '' . 
  that is what i meant , they lived next to each other . 
  like european nations . 
  i gave a simplified overview , every rule has some exceptions . 
  in general you will share more with us than with most of the middle east or asia or america . 
  i 'm not against total isolation , but immigration needs some boundaries , integration needs plans if you just let everyone in without hesitation you will end up with a mess . 
  i was n't talking about france or algeria . 
  also , just as a reminder , there were 85k polish troops in france in 1940 and 50k took part in defense , and after the fall of france there were still few thousands left still fighting in the west . 
  thousands of poles fought along napoleon and a lot of our artists and scientists fled to france after partitions . 
  if not for iron curtain you would probably feel a lot closer to us than you do currently . 
  ok , why is homogeneity important ? 
  because it 's easier to understand each other , there are less tensions . 
  even though there are hundreds of different cultures in india they form a one group that lived in one place for a long time . 
  they understand each other , they tolerate each other and as a whole are a single cultural group . 
  just like europeans , yes we might be very different in some areas but overall we 've lived next to each other and understand each other better . 
  if you bring people from the outside with inherently different set of values and principles you might end up in political correctness hell , where you try to be tolerant towards newcomers but their culture stand against everything your own culture represents . 
  you ca n't say anything bad about them or you 'll seem intolerant and you 'll abuse their freedom of culture and religion , but you have to or it 'll stand against egalitarian laws and principles of your country . 
  it creates a loop that in the end leads only to problems , division and discrimination . 
  it 's very hard to create multi-cultural nation without parallel cultural groups that refuse to integrate . 
  you end up with ghettos that are root of crime and radicalism as it 's easy to sway disheartened and discriminated youth that feel no connection to their place of residence . 
  of course this is just an opinion , it might be a bit pessimistic and unprogressive , but this situation is very much observable on europe 's example . 
  but have n't these different groups lived along each other for hundreds or even thousands of years ? 
  it 's like tatar 's in poland , they do not entirely share our culture but they share history and they are culturally compatible , they are european by all standards . 
  you do n't import millions of people from different who may cause problems because a lot of the core principles of their culture stand against yours . 
  i thought i would at least need to understand french but damn , that was some elementary school levels of copying stuff . 
  i know , this is basically what i was trying to say from the beginning , blame the city authorities , not the police . 
  these kind of marches should never take place but unfortunately somebody allows that . 
  i do not know what they did or did not shout at that particular event . 
  they have been given permission , and a police force has been designated to keep peace . 
  i do n't think that the police has a right to stop any march unless there are straight up riots , they can probably arrest a person who publicly spread hate speech but declaring the whole march illegal is a bit too much . 
  i hate these marches , i really do , but blaming police when they are only doing what they are told by higher authorities is not fair . 
  also removing somebody who is obstructing the path is what they are there for , if they were n't there things could escalate really quickly . 
  it 's not united airlines levels of removing people . 
  police has nothing to do with it , these forces were there to prevent riots , the march has been sanctioned . 
  it 's the local authorites that should n't have allowed it in the first place . 
  what a bs , the fact that the scale of this was n't as devastating as in russia does n't mean it did n't happen . 
  selling companies for almost nothing without any public auctions to people who were connected to prl government was a common practice . 
  uk left the union because they went full `` muh sovereignty '' and `` polish vermin '' was only one of the arguments used by leave campaign that as we all know was full of fake news and disinformation , also it has nothing to do with tusk . 
  look , i 'm not saying he was great , he was pretty bad at handling internal affairs and it really felt like these were 8 wasted years in many areas , however what he was and still is good at is creating positive image of poland in europe . 
  he maybe should have taken stronger stance in some cases but he did n't . 
  yet he 's still pretty solid at making us look reasonable and we should use it for our advantage . 
  shit talking him does n't really help anyone , especially poland . 
  you wo n't be able to put him in jail , he did n't betray anyone , you can say he was incompetent , but so is szyd\u0142o and a lot of current gov 's politicians . 
  it looks like it is us versus world . 
  we are offending allies , rivals and our own representatives . 
  if that continues we will end up alone in the time of need . 
  i was talking in general , and you ca n't deny that `` dziadek z wermachtu '' was n't the narrative against him . 
  it was everywhere . 
  right wing here repeats it like some kind of mantra that tusk 's grandfather served in wermacht while forgetting that a lot of people were forced to do so during wwii like other kashubians . 
  they also fail to mention that he was a prisoner in stutthof and neuengamme and later on joined polish forces in the west . 
  as for a traitor there is too much to write but it 's overall german-polish politics during his rule which seemed too , i do n't know , weak ? 
  a lot of handshakes , smiles and award winning with mutti merkel while we had a few pretty huge scandals during that time . 
  also , not much really changed in terms of legislation for a common folk , and people felt like they were being sold to germans and big companies . 
  lots and lots of young people on shitty contracts , amber gold scandal , leaked tapes of prominent politics talking shit and tusk threw it all , left poland and became a president of the eu . 
  it made a lot of people angry . 
  this is a general overview . 
  i do n't even like him he 's not a saint but he is our representative for good or bad and europe likes him , so it really does n't matter if our right wing thinks he is devil incarnate . 
  he will represent us whether we want it or not and i think he 's doing a good job at that so why not stop the childish fingerpointing . 
  it only makes our country look divided and paranoid . 
  if you want something better look for anything from pinta or kormoran brewery , might be harder to get but these are like something between craft and mass production with pinta selling some of the highest rated polish beers . 
  i highly suggest to try their imperator ba\u0142tycki . 
  i 'm biased of course but it 's actually nice to hear something good about poles for once . 
  recently there are only shitty news everywhere i look . 
  also , are we here only to talk about statistics ? 
  do you really need raw data on everything ? 
  good or bad , it 's really nice to hear about experiences and opinions of other europeans , to understand what people from other countries think . 
  is n't it what this subreddit is all about ? 
  bringing europeans closer together ? 
  i 'm not saying we should end up with circlejerk , but i 've subbed here to be able to get news as much as hear out other europeans . 
  i do n't think that it would n't be able to defend itself , but the eastern flank and baltics would get wrecked before there is any counter offensive and an overall damage that kind of war would cause would be devastating . 
  i know that even tough my memory is a total bollocks i still remember plitvice lakes as one of the most beautiful places i 've ever seen . 
  they felt exotic yet familiar , like if you were on some tropical islands but at the same time the plants the language of nearby people and everything felt european . 
  i loved it . 
  now i have to google that ... 
  sabre all the way . 
  only polska and morze ba\u0142tyckie are in polish . 
  there are a lot of people who have problems with vegetable and fruit digestion . 
  me for example . 
  something like ratatouille keeps me from leaving toilet for three of four days . 
  it does n't help that i despise a lot of fruits and vegetables in taste and/or texture . 
  they also never seem to fill me up for long . 
  even when i 'm doing nothing and just sitting in front of pc i get hungry after and hour or two if i 've had some non-meat dinner . 
  if i was working physically i imagine it would have been a nightmare . 
  different people are different and where someone will have not problems with transition whatsoever it 'd be incredibly problematic for someone else . 
  also , cuisines of many countries are based on meat . 
  cuisine is very important part of regional or national culture and a lot of people have very strong feelings about it . 
  and last , plant based food can get pretty expensive in certain places if you want to keep your diet balanced . 
  getting good quality fruits or vegetable in poland in a winter can get very expensive and you 'll end up eating tasteless crap or cereal . 
  so no , meat is not going anywhere anytime soon .

  people got really overenthusiastic about us in years after fall of communism , but came to their senses recently and see that our relation in eu are much more important , even in times like this . 
  having said that i 'd say that it is at least partly mutually beneficial . 
  for example poland has started working on convincing our eu partners to the idea of eu army . 
  i know , right ? 
  as an eastern european one has to have a very schizophrenic view on us politics . 
  republicans and what they stand for is bloody revolting , but they sure are handy once in a while . 
  european tax mean people i guess i got to be nicer ... 
  is it that bad ? 
  i mean poland under kaczynski was a joke but i did n't think to go that far . 
  a bit too chewy for my liking . 
  but i never had an opportunity to try it in spain , so maybe here they are n't prima sort . 
  now we 're talking !, 
   ~ ~ action movie ~ ~ ~ ~ isis style ! ~ ~ every country at some point style !, 
  ftfy, 
  i 've read about it 2 days ago in mainstream polish media too . 
  and cited `` rzeczpospolita '' has n't been right-wing for few years now . 
  i would n't call it `` wishful '' . 
  russia is the devil we know and china of the leash could be much , much worse , especially knowing levels of racism still in their culture . 
  if 2014 thought us anything it is that armies on paper are n't worth the paper they are written on . 
  ukraine and iraq are the most glaring examples but even kurds turned out to be overhyped to some extent . 
  i 'd argue that most of russian army ( save few elite-ish divisions that got properly funded in previous years ) are on the level of pre-conflict ukraine 's army . 
  knowing how fall of communism looked like i would n't be surprised if we 've been shaving with 90 % of those tanks for 2 decades now . 
  after all most of the love for putin comes from the fact , that before him the country functioned about as well as last year 's ukraine . 
  still - turning cities to rabble is an artillery 's job . 
  it 's only fair if rest of europe helps russia in their efforts to help ukraine !, 
  so now both things are somehow true : 1 . 
  suggestion to send troops to help ukraine defend its integrity means one wants the war with russia . 
  there is no russian invasion of ukraine , those are just rebels . 
  yeah , that 's literally hitler ... 
  none of those calls for war with russia . 
  help or even military support does n't have to come as `` boots on the ground '' . 
  and even if then there is no russian military in ukraine , remember ? 
  apparently yhe problem is n't making things up but inability to understand what you are reading . 
  care to link some examples ? 
  i think you are imagining things ... 
   i dunno , i feel like the russians have some grievances that are legitimate . 
  as do pro-eu ukrainians . 
  so for me , to side completely with the ukrainian government is wrong . 
  they are not saints themselves . 
  oh , * some grievances are legitimate * ? 
  my bad then , guess invasion was in order !, 
   the only people who want war are americans and eastern europeans who ca n't wait to get `` revenge '' and start killing russkies and finally get their war . 
  i doubt anyone wants war . 
   all i see everyday is dumb comments from polaks and baltics about how russia needs to be nuked from orbit and how america + eu needs to send its entire military to eastern europe and initiate barbarossa 2.0 do you ? 
  i 'm on reddit arguably too much and i have n't seen one in weeks . 
  sounds like something you pulled out of your ass , just like the `` observation '' above it , to have an excuse for ethnic slur . 
  just imagine we based out opinion of uk on your comment . 
  `` country of brainless nationalists and all around cunts '' would call for an invasion as well . 
  people ( especially ones in the media ) like to simplify stuff . 
  as long as said governments agree that it is indeed an armed attack - yes . 
  but that proven to be problematic as of late . 
  ukrainian shenanigans were mostly imported too . 
  while i 'd still consider invasion of baltic states very unlikely , it is by no means impossible in current situation . 
  poland ? 
  not because of nato ( that has no automatic response clause , just like budapest memorandum ) , but because there is no instability or ethnic minority to exploit . 
  while we learned that list of things eu/american governments are willing to choose to believe is very long , i doubt that pro-russian separatists in eastern poland are on it . 
  so that leaves open and swift invasion as an only option and that would n't be something nato can overlook . 
  i 'm at least 90 % sure . 
  also polish army is probably strong enough to hold on their own in conventional conflict for enough time . 
  none of the above is particularly true for them so if there will be a play for a nato country it will start there . 
  foreign policy based solely on complaining and being offended by everything . 
  kind of isolationism but with farting in all directions . 
  probably anti-russian and a bit anti-german too . 
  as far as internal policy goes it would be anti-corruption hysteria , possibly some back-pedalling on gay rights , abortion laws , in-vitro treatments , transplants and whatnot , but it would be 90 % talk and 10 % doing something stupid . 
  not much more beyond that , till government finally collapses in 2-3 years and current governing party wins next election . 
  yeah , and it 's clearly very deceptive kind of servitude when supposed serfs are reaping most of the benefits . 
  while great eastern beacon of civilisation is driving itself into recession by living some crazy xix century dream . 
  i ca n't help but shake my head in disbelief reading what you write here . 
   only russia is losing land this way , but they can afford it . 
  yeah , i mean who gives a fuck about countries like ukraine , belarus or lithuania anyway , right ? 
  hard to tell at this point . 
  recent polls give pis ( ultraconservatives ) 6 point lead . 
  we all know that it is n't worth a damn , once kaczynski opens his mouth and everyone gets flashbacks from his time in office . 
  maybe it 's a wishful thinking , but i would n't be surprised by 9th ( or is it 10th ? ), 
  pis defeat in a row . 
  you realise that new weapons being placed on our borders by russia is nothing new , right ? 
  it has been happening for over a decade now and we are yet to throw a tantrum or send unmarked militia there . 
  new massive russian presence would be troubling and would require accurate response , therefore being a pain in the ass , but only due to russian track record of invading neighbours and sheer `` massiveness '' of the forces there . 
  none of the nato countries on russian borders have capabilities to invade russia on their own or even together and there are n't any plans involving putting there joint nato forces with strength nowhere near required to do that . 
  therefore your argument that nato is somehow trying to encircle russia only to invade ( ? ), 
  it or w/e is bullshit as long as it is n't amassing forces that could actually do that . 
  and that clearly is n't happening and there is no indication that it would happen or that there is any will do do so . 
  that makes russia the aggressive side in this whole sabre-rattling affair . 
  but believe me , if there will be plans of putting numerous nato armored divisions , paratroopers , artillery and whatnot on nato/russia border i 'll give you the call so we can coordinate protests against stupidity . 
  like the ones against russian stupidity taking place now . 
  edit :  replace them with georgia and ukraine , and suddenly it 's not so stupid . 
   the russians did n't overthrow an elected president and establish an illegal government . 
  yeah , like those have so much in common . 
  idea that cia ( or whoever ) and not actual ukrainians were behind maidan is stupid and has no evidence behind it , while elections in ua and the fact that no one wants the president back ( even his own party ) speak for the different story . 
  and fate of yanukowitch or legality ( or lack thereof ) of his toppling is n't any of russian 's business . 
   as anybody with sense will say about nato . 
  good that nato , unlike russia has n't send any forces there . 
  hell , we haven ; t even support kiev with arms , and we really should have . 
   excellent !, 
  then let us put as many nukes as we can in cuba , and create a powerful russian caribbean fleet !, 
  do n't you dare call it an aggressive action , if cuba volunteers then it is merely a peaceful act of cooperation with no intent to intimidate or leverage !, 
  then maybe we will arm mexico and allow it to attack american soldiers on the border . 
  we mean to do nothing but protect our interests and protect good-ole democracy , this is not aggression !, 
  then perhaps we will fund riots and an illegal coup in canada , whereupon they will immediately begin to integrate into the eurasian union !, 
  nato has no right to a sphere of influence , we in russia are the good guys that know best and everything we do is peaceful and democratic , totally not aggressive .

   burning cars ... is n't a rare thing to see i 've never seen a burned car in my entire life . 
   culture of diminishing crimes hmmmmm, 
   american show australian . 
  today heroes in sweden are handicaped guys on scooters ... 
  these policement are also a simbol of everything that is wrong with `` progressive '' societies , they 're worried not to `` provoke '' the criminals from some chosen minority , but not about the crimes . 
  same way it was in rotherham . 
  that 's really cool . 
  i always loved the idea of parks , forests and wild animals somehow integrated with the major cities and always felt proud that there 's all of that in warsaw , together with semi wild vistula crossing the city and few major forests on the outskirts in almost every direction . 
  good job bucharest . 
  so it 's a conspiracy ? 
  joking ... you 're still attributing some ideology or idea to these people , i say that opportunism is their only modus operandi . 
  their only agenda is power and money . 
  btw . 
  it 's not xixc . 
  anymore , industry was replaced by services and there 's no more `` proletaryat '' , today it was replaced by the `` opressed '' minorities , but nevermind the details . 
  the whole point is that `` liberals '' are used by the leftists to introduce their revolutionary inventions and they 're used by the `` liberals '' for propagandist support . 
  you may call it `` mockery '' or whatever if you 're more radical , but it 's just a fact that these policies are being smuggled and enforces on the european nations by a group of cynical and alientaed `` elite '' . 
  of course we 're different , you seems to be quite leftists and i 'm ... not . 
  as i 've said , internationalism , multiculturalism , feminism and the whole `` sexual '' revolution ... now , as for that `` exploitation '' , many times i was writing why that 's not the rationale of germany ( if there is any ) . 
  it was the last country to allow access to the work market for the citizens of eu member states that joined in 2004 , they did it in 2011 which was the last possible moment to avoid fines from ec . 
  they were waiting until 20014 for romanians and bulgarians , which joined eu in 2007 . 
  now , all of these cheap , but also easier to integrate and employ workers are already in britain , ireland and even spain . 
  which has a terrible unemployment . 
  they could also `` exploit '' ukrainians , that million works in poland just becuse they ca n't get to the richer countries and we let them in to replace our emmigration . 
  again you 're ignoring the policies that i was talking about . 
  you 're still looking at these people through their declarations instead of actions which are neither conservative , nor liberal , but `` progressive '' and socialist , just they 're moderate and not revolutionist . 
  then you should read more because there 's not just criticism of liberal fiscalism or foreign policy ( like that would be rightist / leftist ) , but also conservatism or national identity and there 's clear promotion of `` progress '' and internationalism . 
  ther 's nothing liberal or `` new '' about it . 
  sure , right after turkey will repay for hordes of captured and enslaved people , not to mention centuries of occupation of balcans . 
  it does , or at least some of its member parties in their countires and feminists are not representing women , so do n't equate them . 
  you ignored the point about internationalism , i could also add migrant and `` multikulti '' policies , but nevermind . 
  i know it 's all relative , these factions are composed of quite different parties also and the clear and exact definitions are outdated anyway ... 
  if you wants details about that feminist policies , i 've said i know po of donald quite well , for obvious reasons . 
  so , for the eught years they were in power , the whole party shifted to the left , took quite a lot of high ranking former members of post communist party and endorsed feminist , homosexual and other leftist organisations . 
  they introduced parity in elections , clearly a feminist invention , pm donald was visiting meetings of feminist `` congress of women '' and hired several activists in govermental offices such a ministry of education or some strange ofice for `` equality '' . 
  they sacked a one minister and deputy minister after a whole smear campaign in leftist medias just because they were catholic and actually not ashamed of it . 
  i 'm sorry , but it 's not just my opinion and actions speaks louder than declarations of politicians . 
  these `` christian '' democrates are neither right , nor left , they 're just cynical opportunists without any backbone . 
  they just follow the agenda of leftist medias in order to get their ptopagandist support . 
  no , why are you asking ? 
  simple , but somehow homosexualists fights for privillages instead of declared `` equality '' ... 
  so you wants `` equality '' and privillages ... and why should n't a single person have these ? 
  privillages for everyone !!, 
  i see you still do n't understand ... what 's a `` change '' ? 
  were n't we talking about fiscal privillages ? 
  if that was n't you , then i apologise , but i can only repeat that relations between adult people should n't be sanctioned or privillaged by the state and i mean any kind of ralationships . 
  ok , you got me there , but as for krak\u00f3w it 's still not the same league as paris , rome , barcelona or venice , not even prague . 
   1,385,922 german tourists in 2014 maybe . 
  and it 's cheap . 
  today travelling is easy for all of the europeans , especially in schengen area . 
  were n't we talking about it already ? 
  that was some time ago in a one leftist newspaper ( gazeta wyborcza ) , it could take me some time to find the exact article ( if you realy wants it ) but anyway her husband ( then polish fm ) spent public money for private dinners and expensive wines . 
  he was caught because these conversations were recorded and published by a one weekly magazine , rhen its office was raided by anti terrosists ... applebaum together with the rest of leftist and pro gov journalists was defendimg these actions . 
  she should n't even comment the actions of her husband and his gov , it 's just unethical . 
  no , i do n't think it 's a `` conspiracy '' because it 's quite clear who is she supporting and what 's her agenda . 
  some time ago i also thought that she 's tustworthy and professional , but now i just ca n't read her articles without considering that she 's able to bend even the most basic rules of journalism for private interests . 
  it is n't , but still that 's a good score for quite a `` cold '' country with almost no mountains or world famous historic and natutal sites . 
   not too many tourists in poland 17th most visited country in the world, 
  she lost all of credibility in my eyes when she was defending her husband 's abuse of public money . 
  that 's indeed her agenda , or rather interest . 
  i do n't mind americans . 
   voicing some dissent to germany 's criticism of pis when ? 
  he was always supporting germany in each and every situation , thanks to him the idea of quotas was voted by qualified majority with a sudden support of his party nd its gov , against previous promises on v4 summit in prague . 
  he 's either playing the `` good '' policeman or fighting for his re election , which is doubtful . 
  his party members voted against polish candidates to several european institutions , breaking a non written agreement that everybody supports each other . 
  they even boycoted a project of via carpathia ... 
  i do n't see how donald could be proposed by polish gov for a second cadention in this sistuation . 
  [ we have ] ( http://bi.gazeta.pl/im/4f/95/10/z17387599o.jpg ) . 
  it 's the last line of defence against immigrants . 
  looks kinda [ gay ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kj95aww1t0e ) , but it 's not a drag queen yet and he can sing . 
  i do n't care for this contest anymore , but we should send [ margaret ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5noqvm_62rm ) , no idea why she lost eleiminations . 
  you 've said about a one already , internationalism and i 'd also add support for some feminist and related ideas , political correctness etc. 
  in details i could explain it just on example of po of donald , it 's not ideological , but cynical and there 's absolutelly nothing `` christian '' about these `` democrates '' . 
  anyway , it 's not easy to put these factions in one category , not even the separate parties today represents pure doctrines . 
  epp is run by cdu anyway , while ecr is completely isolated by it and the leftist factions which are gladly cooperating with these `` christian '' democrates and supporting basicly the same ideas . 
  epp is full of `` progressive '' parties or so called `` christian democtrates '' , which are basicly just cynical opportunists slowly pushing the leftist ideas , just in a moderate way . 
  as for that fiscal liberalism , it 's hard to say about any in the countries ruled by the epp members . 
  i 've said about just the state , eu still is n't a one and probably will never be . 
  obviously it depends on your personal opinions , but there 're many unsolved issues in eu and many problems which are not resolved and some are just created by european establishment , which is basicly just epp . 
  democracy , or rather `` populism '' , which is typical for each and every politician . 
  ok , but what kind of things are you talking about ? 
  true , anyway . 
  excuse me , but merkel and her epp stooges tolerates illegal migrants and instead of securing borders , they 'd rather criticise countries which does it and bend to demands of turkey which is obviously exploiting their weakness . 
  no idea what fidesz is still doing in that faction , but i guess it gives them a stronger international position anyway . 
  afaik they 're not preeching the same things , whatever that `` euroscepticism '' is , their approach to eu is based on a different idea of a state and this is a major difference . 
  what anti `` gay '' laws ? 
  i 'm not going to write all of that because it 's not the point here ( unless you really wants to know ) , but there 're arguments against extending privillages on `` non-standard '' relationships and especially against * aborting * humans ... leftys , instead of discussing and prooving their points are usually repeating such slogans as above , fearmongering and creating false martyrology , exploiting emotions instead of rational points . 
  racism or xenophoby these days are usually reaction for irresponsible and again , irrational migrant and `` multiculti '' policies , lacking assimilation and isolation of foreign cultures . 
  national identity will not be replaced in europe by an artificial , internationalist identity , but ... nationalism is not the same as conservatism and is usually misrepresented by thugs and football hoologans , which you 're confusing with conservatives . 
  no , they do n't , it 's just another old slogan which prooves nothing , but at the same time ends every discussion . 
  interesting . 
  this description should be updated after the recent behavior of akp , but it seems that everybody puts interests over sentiments , except that turkey explots the current soft and naive leadership of eu , which is not ecr . 
  that 's great , except that nobody does it . 
  you 're really confusing europe with middle east . 
  paranoid much ? 
   alliance has also affiliated itself with some non-eu parties like turkey 's akp interesting . 
  can you link some source about that ? 
  downvote them to oblivion , that will show them who 's right and who 's left ... 
  i mean wrong . 
  i was sarcasitc obviously and as i 've said it 's hardly any serious criticism here , more like labelling and mixing everything .

  the reasons for the partitions were different ... 
  the empires around the polish lithuanian commonwealth saw the government type itself already as a threat to themselves . 
  finally someone who is actually sane . 
  thank god . 
  seriously , everyone say that nationalism is bad and i tell you , that my country would n't have existed without nationalism . 
  the ones who are at least partially fascist are the leftists , trying to silence the public with either ridiculous rules or `` political correctness '' . 
  by the amount of people being in some `` stasi documents '' i guess they just had documents about everyone . 
  although the traitor letter did n't happen to us ... well , how should one be a traitor to someone , if he never was an ally of him , but instead wants independence ? 
  my father actually had about 300 pages of collected information by msw . 
  the `` polish stasi '' if you want to say so . 
  ( we had to leave because of that otherwise who knows what the bolsheviks would have done ), 
  i would n't have said it if i did n't read it ... 
  it is hard to look it up since the article is pretty old already . 
  ca n't find it anymore . 
  try to search for merkel opposing permament nato bases in poland . 
  it has to be from last year . 
  pis is everything bad . 
  literally hitler and literally stalin and literally darth vader . 
  oh where ? 
  if you had followed politics you would knew from who ... merkel . 
  left-wing populists are n't any better . 
  seriously , you seem pretty misinformed on many matters and are just repeating the same things the leftist media is talking about . 
  and the funniest thing , they did n't even want to let the us troops move on to the new nato front ... 
  it seriously depends on who you ask . 
  people who have some interests in politics will tell you , that this victory could n't have been greater . 
  but it is actually true that most people , pis and po voters alike and especially those who do n't vote at all hold the belief that it will be just another idiot ruling the country . 
  still quite sickening that one would shoot its own citizens for escaping the country ... 
  thank you russia . 
  ( russia because they really seem to have liked the good old stalin days ) my family also had to escape poland ( which was easier ) , since my father did something to become a target of some communist investigations . 
  my information may not be up to date about farage , since i dismissed him immediately , but [ this is where i got it from ] ( http://www.ukipmeps.org/articles_879_nigel-farage-stop-playing-wargames-in-ukraine.html ) although i am not certain what exact video of him it was , but it was from 2014 , after russia invaded ukraine . 
  probably the majority of people . 
  nigel farage was very supportive of russian action in ukraine . 
   right wing populist propaganda i 'm sorry ? 
  far-right or right wing ? 
  there is a difference , you know . 
  which is quite weird ... actually why ? 
  both suffered the horrors of soviet imperialism . 
  in our country only the far left is supportive of russia . 
  our rightwing is hating russia even more then our `` centre-right '', 
  which is sad ... 
  but again , it is only the western european right-wing ... and in case i would n't even call them rightwing . 
  i know ... 
  but still , there is a paywall , even though the `` first page free '' . 
  also private mode does n't work . 
  paywall ... ca n't see anything . 
  i am sorry to tell , but it is indeed propaganda for the enemy to report from the `` pro-russian seperatist '' side . 
  it is clearly mainly a conflict between ukraine and the russian military inside ukraine . 
  they have nothing to do there . 
  and it is actually understandable that ukraine does not let the information flow free in its country at ** wartime ** . 
  every country does that ... 
  primarily to repell the foreign enemy in this case the majority is foreign . 
  only a minority of `` ukrainian ethnic russians '' are helping these bandits . 
  war reparations which should have been given to china , which suffered the most . 
  it would have probably went like it went for the ukrainians . 
  they were promised everything and then betrayed ... 
  although with pilsudski i believe he would also stab them into their own back before they can stab them into their back . 
  no , i am `` another ridiculous pole '' who argues that teheran was a betrayal ... a big sold out to the russians and the exclusion of the then-president-in-exile sikorski , who later on died mysteriously in an plane crash in gibraltar 1943 . 
  the british and french had the power to destroy germany . 
  actually pilsudski recommended to pre-emptively invade germany in 1933 , but the french declined for reasons , we also see today if it is about the ukrainian conflict . 
  the west then was delusioned and thought ww2 was never possible , the west today is also delusioned about many things . 
  #but this does n't change that britain and france betrayed poland in not providing help !, 
  seriously , if you make promises , you should stick to them and not just search excuses . 
   poland could hold out for long and they felt the defensive positions in france were more then favourable . 
  funfact , poland held out for longer then france did ( beginning with the first part of occupied territory ) ... 
  seems like they really * favored * the * defense * positions in france . 
  it is also called `` danzig or war '' . 
  why not just call the whole region gdansk ? 
  i know , that it was about that corridor . 
  but also about the city itself , which a city under the control of the `` un '' ... forgot the name . 
  stalingrad was n't even close to the destruction warsaw saw . 
  neither did czechoslovakia really do hobbit policy . 
  they hoped for help from the allies , in the end they were sold out just like poland . 
  btw , they had actually closer relations to the soviets . 
  i do know , that is why i was talking about the cause of polish inaction when the first two partitions happened . 
  actually , if pilsudski would have lived long enough , i could have seen a german-polish alliance possible ... as long as hitler did n't demand gdansk of course . 
  but the older plans were to invade germany before they even built up an army in 1933 with the help of france . 
  of course , france did n't want to participate . 
  that was actually because of a certain law making the king powerless and the whole country just stagnating . 
  city centers ... 
  but what i am talking about is a whole city , which was the biggest city in that country and was completely annihilated by the poor , bombed germans from then . 
  one could n't care less about the destruction of your opponnent , who firstly started the war and secondly destroyed your cities systematically as well as systematically put your population into concentration camps ... not only jews were targeted . 
  nvm , it was over 90 % warsaw was systematically destroyed by the germans in 1944 in and after the uprising . 
  laying fires and demolishing buildings , no matter if historical or not . 
  they have also tested new weapons like the sturmtiger i believe . 
  well , certainly they have used the ` schwerer gustav ' to bomb the city . 
  i thought it was even higher , but i was n't certain and i was too lazy to look it up . 
  better then communist houses , which were already falling apart when they were being built . 
  pssst warsaw was the conventionally most destroyed big city in the whole of world war ii . 
  over ~ ~ 70 % ~ ~ 90 % of the city was destroyed . 
  and also poland lost the biggest percentage of its population , because of german and soviet occupation . 
  of course you can rebuild a city , you must rebuild your city . 
  still , heritage gets lost ... 
  the germans and soviets were actively plundering ... 
  although the soviets were n't doing it in warsaw i believe ... 
  except for literally stealing whole factories . 
  or maybe you should get less dependent on an enemy ... 
  except if you want to do molotov-ribbentropf again . 
  it is a broken ceasefire and the minsk ** 2 ** agreement is garbage and is n't fullfilled by anyone . 
  and actually it was immediately broken with the attack on debaltseve . 
  as i said , russia is attacking .

  if you want i can call those polish immigrants instead of refugees , doesnt really matter . 
  but are you seriously comparing those two . 
  lets spot the differences - whole families , lots of older people , did not cross borders illegally , did not go to the country with best social benefits etc. 
  but still you did not answer . 
  on what basis are you claiming these are refugees and not immigrants . 
   so poor you ca n't manage more that a couple million ? 
  please ... you waste that much on corruption while i sneeze . 
  ill say this again since you didnt answer last time , i havent heard any discussions about financial aid , have you ? 
  you cant say - ooh , you are not giving enough money , when the topic of money hasnt been raised . 
  the priorities of the eu is to force people to stay where they dont want to be , not how much financial aid each eu country is giving . 
  you really have some kind of polish complex , you keep `` attacking '' the fact im from poland . 
  i definitely would feel bad that he died and earlier would have considered some other ways of helping , for example taking him to a homeless shelter , but not at all for not letting him live with me . 
  it may be sad , but its just not realistic , we cant `` save '' everyone by doing this . 
  using this logic , you should go out in the evening looking for people to help out , because they may freeze in the night . 
  you had 2 options , do nothing or find and save someone . 
  i know this is taking it a step further , but the logic stands . 
  i dont understand this logic . 
  what if a homeless person knocks on your door and asks to live with you , you will have to feed and bathe them . 
  when you refuse , he dies later . 
  are you responsible ? 
  in my opinion , no . 
  you can try helping him - money , a meal , take him to a homeless shelter , but beyond that , your not responsible . 
  agreed , its odd how protecting your borders is something bad now . 
  because it was a 10 year old that drowned in a pond , because he wasnt being supervised by his mother or any other guardian . 
  what if he was just taking a swim and drowned , would that also be hungarys fault ? 
  would you be responsible for a homless man after not letting him into your house ? 
   i wont list any under $ 10 million . 
  point is , pretty much everyone is helping out except eastern-europe . 
  hmmm ... maybe because eastern-europe is poor compared to the west ? 
   agreed , lets start by using the 82.5 billion euro 's being invested in to poland by the eu . 
  yes , because the eu is giving money to poland out of the goodness in their heart . 
  nothing is free , in a huge simplification , poland gets money , eu gets new markets and cheap labor . 
  in the future we will start to put in more money than we take out . 
  have you heard of any negotiations about eu countries financial help for the migrant crisis ? 
  i havent , the loudest demands are to take the immigrants in . 
  the only thing that comes to mind is the threat to pay 250 thousand euro for each migrant not taken in . 
  still thats about taking them in , not financial help . 
   read the third article i linked . 
  would you want to stay ? 
  so why are you mad at poland for not wanting to force thousands of people to stay against their wishes ? 
   safety does n't put a roof over your head so you agree these are not refugees seeking asylum , they are people looking for the best comfort of life - economic immigrants . 
  in that case , why does any european country have to take them all in ? 
  you have got to be kidding me . 
  how in the world are they responsible for that ? 
  i understand if the kid starved because hungary wasnt giving them any food or something like that , but this was an accident , do you expect hungary to have people following the migrants everywhere just in case something happens ? 
   you actually do believe these men are fundamentally different from you . 
  good god . 
  whats so surprising in people from different countries having different cultures ? 
  different cultures and religions cause different mentalities . 
  havent you noticed how many of them have problems assimilating ? 
  why do you think that is , because we are all the same ? 
   do you really think this ? 
  facepalm admittingly i have a limited knowledge on this , but im pretty sure in some muslim countries they are treated worse than men , yes . 
  sharia law differs depending on the interpretations , are you seriously telling me , all of them put a women and men as equals ? 
  havent you heard of things like : a man can have 4 wives , while a women only one husband , a man can divorce his wife even without her consent while she would need his consent for divorce etc. 
  these are just examples and im sure its not everywhere , but it definitely is part of their culture . 
  what can i say , we are a poor country , but im sure the eu would have a lot better results if they decided financial help is more important , rather then trying to force everyone to take immigrants in . 
   http://www.unhcr.org/protection/resettlement/573dc82d4/resettlement-other-admission-pathways-syrian-refugees-updated-30-2016.html poland 900 and how many wanted to stay in poland ? 
  why force these people to live somewhere they dont want to be ? 
   and as for why refugees prefer western-europe/scandinavia , so they are not refugees , as far as i know , a refugee seeks asylum in the first safe country possible . 
  economic immigrants cherry pick and go where there are the best social benefits . 
   no , it does n't . 
  so we need to ask , once again , why there are more male refugees than female . 
  and the answer `` they are cowards who do n't care about their families '' is a non-sterter . 
  well , lets think about that . 
  where are they running to ? 
  mainly countries like germany and sweden . 
  what do they have in common ? 
  high social benefits , this is not a surprise since many of them dont even pretend and shout out things like `` we want money '' . 
  if this was a purely `` run away from danger since we are most at risk '' wouldnt they stop in the first safe country rather then increasing the danger they are in by going so far into europe ? 
  why are there more men ? 
  maybe they just think the same way as you - theres nothing wrong in running away leaving your family behind . 
  also in their culture , arent women worth less than men ? 
  whos going to stop them from leaving ? 
  their mothers/sisters/wives / children ? 
  i do care and you still havent answered my question . 
  you know there are other ways of helping them , not just taking them all in ? 
   luckily it has nothing to do with you . 
  stop personalising ethical decisions , that 's how you end up with ridiculous policies like the death penalty . 
  as an outsider , you should be able to weigh the factors with a clear mind , instead you 're taking it personally . 
  im sorry i have an opinion , how dare i. 
  but to the point , i am looking at this with a clear mind and dont see logic behind your argument - those who can fight/defend run and those who cant stay . 
  even with the fact that men are more in danger , that doesnt change the fact that the rest is also . 
   that 's not possible in this context . 
  you do n't get that option , you get the be slaughtered if you refuse to join a side , try to keep your head down and maybe survive or join one of the group of monsters currently eating each other 's hearts . 
  and what happens to the women/children ? 
  they become these monsters objects , they cant refuse them anymore than the men , they just have other `` purposes '' which are also sick and twisted . 
  why do you keep ignoring the fact that others ( not young men ) are also in grave danger . 
   staying to fight , in this specific context , is not the best option under any circumstance . 
  not quiet what you said , is it ? 
  i was speaking in wider terms , not specifically this situation . 
  sarcasm , right ? 
  but seriously , how is a 10 year old kid drowning relevant to this article that hungary will be throwing out illegal migrants . 
  it wasnt the armies fault the kid died , it wasnt the border controls fault and so on . 
  who is to blame for that tragedy ? 
  hungary or the mother ? 
   that 's exactly what it means , ffs . 
  at a much greater risk . 
  it 's not even comparable . 
  again , i understand what your saying , just that its not a good enough argument for me to abandon my family .

  it 's not like they are religious or have big muslim minority . 
  only kaliningrad oblast , i like the borders neat . 
  w-what ? 
   the parts of germany that poland annexed post-wwii were ( in large part ) not much more polish than k\u00f6nigsberg / kaliningrad was russian . 
  find a map from 1000 ad and educate yourself, 
   europe is a secular , mostly atheistic or agnostic continent not slovakia . 
  russian nationalism often includes pan-slavism , so we are n't really safe . 
   following the 2010 strategic defence and security review , the permanent deployment [ of british forces in gemrany ] will end by 2019 [ 3 ] although some training will still be undertaken . 
  i 'd say it 's perfect timing . 
  merci d'utilisier le megathread !, 
  but you guys enjoy it . 
  if it were n't so , you 'd change it . 
  right ? 
  yes , really . 
  you think that we want green men here ? 
  those borders are the most secure in the whole eu . 
  who is known to be exceptionally corrupt ? 
  russian side might be , but there are always european border guards too . 
  borders with russia are really well secured , no way anyone is getting through, 
  the greek tradition of not giving a single fuck, 
  fuck the retarded megathread, 
  luckily i live in central europe . 
  allowing immigrants is not an indicator of progress . 
  i think it 's not solely our responsibility . 
  we should do as much as us does , ie usaid and red cross . 
  no need to take them here . 
  sweden is n't in nato , so you do n't really have a say in that . 
  treating murderers for ptsd is ridiculous and wrong . 
  the irony is that even sweden , so keen on giving up their identity just to integrate immigrants is falling at it hard and producing ` alienated ' terrorists . 
  god bless capitalism, 
   you do n't have an immigration problem if you do n't take any in that 's what we are trying to accomplish in poland . 
  i wish we were in union with the usa , not those sjws in eu . 
  that 's totally why we do n't have an immigrant problem and only persecuted come to eu . 
  do we even live in the same union ? 
  it 's not , only facts are stated there . 
  yeah , i think getting us citizenship would take an average european 5 years or so . 
  [ meanwhile in sweden . 
  ] ( http://speisa.com/modules/articles/index.php/item.676/sweden-to-reward-returning-isis-jihadists.html ), 
  you are safe because usa actually has immigration policies . 
  meanwhile eu welcomes anyone and everyone . 
  we can protect oppressed polish minority in lithuania and let americans fight russians . 
  send the russians instead , they 'll turn immigrants into russian minority in no time . 
  jews do n't want to come here and there are no atheists in the middle east, 
  they contacted the local church . 
  the dead thread where it 's impossible to discuss anything ? 
  what about it ? 
  i did n't imply that , just the tone of this article seems to say that in between the lines . 
  or not . 
  my german is n't that good honestly . 
  all this discussion about positive discrimination is stupid . 
  they should be grateful we take anyone at all , it 's none of anyone else 's business . 
  if you 're so tolerant , shelter muslim immigrants at your home . 
  that 's harsh but true . 
  nowoczesnapl will probably be yellow , so i would n't be so sure about this . 
   czech republic even does n't have concordat really ? 
  i thought every country has it . 
  you have separate church and civil marriage ? 
  that 's exactly the sentiment in poland . 
  is 2025 sooner or later ? 
  spanish , because germans speak english and you do n't want to do business with french, 
  hopefully not in poland . 
  luckily we managed to avoid most of menaces coming from the outside here ( like black death , etc. 
  ) , so that ` progress ' of yours will be easily avoided . 
  do n't be ashamed . 
  croats are a great nation . 
  where is '' / s '' ? 
  it 's hard to beat komorowski 's awkwardness, 
  how can you be so sure ? 
  democratically speaking he exists . 
  what does n't exist ? 
  believing in the absolute is more of a philosophical nature than religious one . 
  10 commandments in christianity , 613 in judaism , etc. 
   he also warned that the negative income tax , as an addition to the `` ragbag '' of welfare and assistance programs , would only worsen the problem of bureaucracy and waste . 
  instead , he argued , the negative income tax should immediately replace all other welfare and assistance programs on the way to a completely laissez-faire society where all welfare is privately administered . 
  the negative income tax has come up in one form or another in congress , but friedman eventually opposed it because it came packaged with other undesirable elements antithetical to the efficacy of the negative income tax . 
  friedman preferred to have no income tax at all , but said he did not think it was politically feasible at that time to eliminate it , so he suggested this as a less harmful income tax scheme . 
  religion encompasses both organized form and inner spirituality imho . 
  believing in god obliges you to obey certain rules . 
  how is this relevant to this discussion ? 
  not all , but aggressive atheists like him , yes . 
  we would n't want to partake in this ussr 2.0 anyway, 
  stop the boats, 
  where 's that ? 
  your source is minimum wage . 
  also ukrainian hrywnia lost a lot to dollar during last year so the data must be outdated . 
  not enough self-hating, 
  ask / r/germany, 
  swedes should also leave all valuables outside their homes because breaking in may cause injuries to burglars . 
  the same that were razed to the ground by soviets ? 
  thousands of years before the germanic tribes came , neanderthals already lived there . 
  ones that were founded by west slavs and belonged to poland until xi c ? 
  ones that were ruins after 1945 and we rebuilt them from scratch ? 
  well , ukrainian average wage is 120 eur, 
  obolon is really good, 
  few years ago when i was in ukraine , a pint in supermarket cost 0.8 pln . 
  roughly 16p . 
  you can get a pint for 50p in poland . 
  this country does n't need immigrants to be interesting . 
  source ? 
  same .

  ok , there 's one exception - tape with minister nowak , but in that case prosecutors did react and guy is permanently gone from politics . 
  to give you some examples of most famous parts from these tapes ( my own translations of the conversations , non-italic parts are my own addendum ) * sikorski ( minister of foreign affairs ) said that '' * polish-american alliance is not worth a dime . 
  it 's actually harmful , because it gives poland a false sense of security * '' - '' * why ? 
  * '' - `` it 's an * utter bullshit . 
  we 'll conflict ourselves with germans and russia , * and * we 'll think that everything is superb , because we did a blowjob to the us . * '' . 
  * another quote from sikorski conversation that became a classic : '' * problem in poland is that we have a very low pride and self-esteem * '' - '' * sort of sentimentalism * '' - '' * sort of * '' ... now a very difficult to word translate : '' * murzy\u0144sko\u015b\u0107 * '' - being-like-a-black-guy ? 
  * sienkiewicz ( minister of interior ) said that : '' * polish state exists only in theory , not in practice , because it works only with it 's individual parts , without understanding that a state is one entity * '' ( the first part of this quote is very often taken out of context and used as a * proof * of how bad government poland has ) . 
  * belka ( head of the national bank ) and sienkiewicz : '' * or they are able to buy these bonds at some exceptionally attractive prices , so highly profitable . 
  then -- and here is the point in having your own currency , not euro -- then national bank can say this : < < well , i could buy some of these bonds , maybe not directly on an auction in the ministry of finance , but for example in bgk or pko bp   * '' these two are a names the banks '' * , so doing something that 's formally impossible * '' - '' * there 's something in that ... * '' - '' * of course , there is * '' - '' * ok * '' - '' * so i could buy these bonds . 
  but it 'd have to be under some conditions , or something like that * '' ( legally in poland an independent national bank is not allowed to finance national debt , they were discussing possible scenarios of bypassing this law by financing banks that would finance the debt ) that said though - ask anyone from a ( far ) right side of the political spectrum and they 'll say that discussions recorded were a * treason * and will down-vote me to hell ( some of them actually consider it a '' [ jewish coup d'\u00e9tat ] ( http://niepoprawni.pl/blog/6496/tasmy-wprost-zydowski-zamach-stanu ) '' ) '' [ part 3 about nowak ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/39bo14/can_someone_explain_whats_going_on_in_poland_with/cs2124w ), 
  some ministers were spied upon in a restaurant , tapes were published by one journal shouting about `` treason '' and `` coup d'\u00e9tat '' because they did n't liked what they heard . 
  obviously there was no treason , but none the less - government promised to investigate the case and punish these guilty of spying on the ministers . 
  prosecutors came out to be a complete garbage , being unable to come up with anything in any reasonable amount of time . 
  eventually tapes leaked out to controversial businessmen with some shady ties ( arrests on account , etc. ), 
  and he published all of it on facebook as he got it . 
  result of it is basically a total discrediting of state - it was unable to prevent ministers from being spied , ministers obviously said a lot things during these conversations that should n't be leaked to public , prosecutors were unable to finish the case , police was unable to take the guy into custody even though he did broke the law , prosecutors again failed to react on another leak ... overall rather miserable situation . 
  as a results ministers from the tapes decided to `` sacrifice '' themselves to avoid a collapse of an entire government . 
  i see some people think i 'm being very forgiving , well , unlike most : i actually listened to all of the leaked tapes before making my judgement on the case . 
  '' [ part 2 with some quotes ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/39bo14/can_someone_explain_whats_going_on_in_poland_with/cs2124w ) , [ part 3 about nowak ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/39bo14/can_someone_explain_whats_going_on_in_poland_with/cs2124w ), 
  seriously though : this is some amazing science , well done !, 
  it seems to be more fundamental problem related to maintenance in your air forces than anything gripen-specific . 
  though only a results of full investigation will tell what 's the cause for sure . 
  quite amusing considering that in most of european countries , including hungary ( op 's own country ) it 's the opposite of what op said . 
  us is the one that got a lower age at first marriage . 
   your governments are going too slowly . 
  amusing reading that from the `` what we will opt-out from today '' country . 
  no wonder , really . 
  there 's no good reason not to have a referendum . 
  does n't mean they are automatically worse . 
  it 's impossible to make any assumptions about hit ratios in order to make a comparison . 
  even more so if you 'll take into account that systems bought by poland will be a new generation - with new software and a large portion of a new hardware , so previous experiences do n't provide nearly as much advantage as it might seem at the first glance . 
  systems that were battle tested got very , very little to deal with systems that will be purchased . 
  as a result of all these unknowns in terms of possible hit ratios other factors come into play . 
  and that 's where patriot is loosing . 
  that said though it does have few obvious advantages : the fact that us can quickly provide multiple launchers for protection and development of a next generation has a lower degree of uncertainty ( not in a terms of `` if '' it will be build , cause it 's going to be build for all competitors , but when and how much it 's going to cost ) . 
  someone should compile these into one huge pan-european map . 
  [ you can try with that article for the beginning ] ( http://www.defence24.com/analysis_the-tender-of-the-century-a-choice-by-politicians-or-the-military ) - it 's written from a perspective of polish tender , however it also lists numerous drawbacks of patriot system comparing to other competitors , a drawbacks that go beyond issues discovered during desert storm . 
  meads was offered to poland with an exceptionally good contract ( we 'd become an equal partners in development instead of just a paying customers ) , however mod opted for still to be developed variant of a patriot . 
  after that decision there was some worry if meads would have enough funding for future development - i 'm most glad that germany is committed to the project as , unlike patriots , it 's really future-proof system . 
  you 'd want us to talk about german coal in polish ? 
  random interesting fact : new esa general director , johann-dietrich woerner ( starts his cadence on 1 july 2015 ) , is an advocate of the moon base project . 
  this should make it more likely to be build than ever before , though i would n't get my hopes too high , as this concept still has very little financial support outside of very preliminary studies . 
  also [ here is an article on esa website ] ( http://www.esa.int/our_activities/space_engineering_technology/building_a_lunar_base_with_3d_printing ) . 
  ( yes , it 's from january . 
  that 's daily mail for you there - recycling old topics ), 
   no , it 's not forbidden , the law was deemed by constitutional tribunal unconstitutional oh , did they ? 
  that 's a news to me . 
  thank you for sharing . 
  both are right . 
  cities are polluted , but overall picture is n't nearly as bad as it might look from this slice of data . 
  poland really invested a lot in minimizing emission from coal powerplants - effects are clearly visible . 
  burning coal at homes is n't the major factor either . 
  since 2013 it 's forbidden to burn coal in homes in the city of krak\u00f3w . 
  and yet it 's the polish city with largest smog problem of all . 
  topography , meteorological factors , car emission , industry , construction works , or even things like not cleaning streets often enough , all contribute to the amount of fine particles and other pollutants in the air . 
  interestingly enough , poland also got lower emission per capita than many other european countries , for example germany ( [ source ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_greenhouse_gas_emissions_per_capita ) ) . 
  also : [ poland is screwed with renewables ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/36hcyd/availability_of_wind_power_in_the_european_union/cre2cxq ), 
  suckers !, 
  * m\u00ff\u00e4\u1e27\u00e4\u1e27\u00e4\u1e27\u00e4\u00e4\u1e27\u00e4\u1e27 * \u1e0a\u00f6 \u00cf \u1e0b\u00f6 \u00ef\u1e97 \u1e59\u00ef\u0121\u1e27\u1e97 ? 
  it certainly would be great as wikipedia is in a huge need of improving and adding content related to european ( and other non-us ) space activities ( french-speaking editors would be especially appreciated as a lot of information is not available in english but is in french , and french magazines , such as le figaro , do better job in covering european space programme than any other . 
  though specifics are a topic for a separate discussion ) . 
  i 'm sorry , that 's really not what i meant . 
  i was looking at it from purely positive point of view - gerst was really a great guy , knowing him from this little free time he had and decided to share his space adventure with people on twitter and through other media . 
   it strikes me how little there is on the wikipedia pages of some . 
  most of wikipedia editors that write any content related to space are either spacex fanboys or editors from us having a long standing love for nasa . 
  you wo n't find any good content about non-us space programmes on english wikipedia . 
  and even if there is some content - it tends to be filled with links to every article in the internet sharing their point of view on how everything europeans make is an inferior version of glorious us space exploration programmes and rockets . 
  if someone is interested in a topic then instead of reading a text from the editor of christian science monitor i can highly recommend listening to one of the lectures of timothy snyder - he is an american historian specialized in a history of central and eastern europe . 
  [ for example this one ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bey-edbm0k ) , on a subject of war in ukraine and reaction of the eu . 
   the british will not leave the uk i laughed out loud , 
  it 's also the [ longest single space flight for esa astronaut ] ( http://outpost42.esa.int/blog/samantha-beats-esa-astronaut-single-duration-record/ ) . 
  great achievements !, 
  that said though - on purely personal level i found it more fun and enjoyable to track previous esa astronaut , alexander gerst . 
  he was more charismatic and spontaneous guy , even if his mission was n't nearly as unique as sam 's mission is . 
  their list of meps needs an update . 
  andrzej duda is not a mep since 25.05.2015 . 
  i would n't mind to have it cleaner though . 
  posts on white background instead of these gray boxes , links on a right in light blue instead of being huge and dark , also use smaller , non-bold font for the buttons . 
  and the content of right-hand menu should imho stay as it is - it 's quite helpful to have these features there , somehow on a proposed layout some of them are missing . 
  well , [ they could build two ] ( http://www.highreshdwallpapers.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/the-two-towers.jpg ) , 
  it has multiple underground levels . 
  you do n't run around ... 
  * and * germany, 
  `` northern '', 
  i 'm quite sure we already had some discussions about these maps . 
  they are quite inaccurate . 
  i 'm yet to see qwertz keyboard in poland , while [ uk has it 's own keyboard layout ] ( https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/file:kb_united_kingdom.svg ) , even though it 's qwerty . 
  you imply i 'm one of the very few people around here that actually read the articles instead of just skimming through the title and going right down to comment ? 
  well then ... good guess . 
   on the other hand , in a russia-finland conflict , obviously the west would strongly favor finland ; it 'd be painful to watch another winter war without being able to do anything . 
  i doubt it 'd only `` favor '' them - it 'd end with a military intervention . 
  xixth century , here we come !, 
   or remove them altogether . 
  this . 
  i have n't seen a subreddit where they 'd actually be beneficial . 
  i use my sorcery skills . 
  that 's an nsdap victory , parties were on a ballot , not hitler . 
  quite impressive considering a population of 500 000 , 
   people will stop being pissed at their governments and their frustrations will rise against the eu institutions . 
  you mean - just like it happens right now ?

  well in this case it 's minor offences mostly second , unemployment is a huge factor in crime rate third , crime report rate . 
  sweden probably has the highest rate of reported rape and maybe because of that sweden is so high in rape crimes . 
  forth , corruption rate edit : fifth , how well the immigrants are assimilated i have a feeling i forgot about something . 
  basically crime rate is n't only affected by the amount of immigrants . 
  it is temporary but if the conflicts will last for a longer time refugees will have the ability to aquire citizenship in the countries they 're in either by marrying locals , having children with locals or just by staying enough time in the country ( whatever the law says ) . 
  most of the major conflicts , like the syrian one , take years to resolve on it 's own . 
  and the fastest way to end the syrian conflict is to send there army , get rid of isis , keep the army there for the time syria is rebuilding . 
  also do n't leave until most of the infrastructure has been rebuilt ( schools and hospitals should have priority ) and the unemployment rate should n't be high . 
  basically you need to leave a happy/satisfied country . 
  it 's easier to take in skilled people and cheap workers ( unskilled ones ) as asylum seekers and say you 're helping them but the world is still left with an unstable region that 's producing refugees . 
  also it 's worth to note that during/after a war natural instincts are stronger that 's why after most wars there was a baby boom ( bad side : people are more agressive and more keen to lynch because of gossip ) . 
  i wonder how will climate look like in 30 years , cause in 2030 some scientists predict the start of mini ice age due to [ reduced solar activity ] ( http://www.iflscience.com/environment/we-could-be-heading-mini-ice-age-2030 ), 
  in theory they should go back ( not be sent back :p ) . 
  but no one knows how long it will take until syria is safe . 
  and now merkel wants `` solidarity '' with refugees :p, 
  it should be done like that and those that are crossing illegally the border should n't be accepted . 
  basically the message should be : if you want to go to europe you need to go to refugee camp . 
  and not : go and risk your life and you will be accepted in europe . 
  you prefer everyone to go to refugee camps or maybe those who have some money to take the risky trip and either manage to get to europe or die ? 
  i 'm not denying that they 've taken 0 refugees but i 'm saying that at least they 've [ gave some money ] ( https://fts.unocha.org/pageloader.aspx?page=search-reporting_display&amp;cq=cq020315114425txf7osvtrx ), 
  and i 'm also talking about those :p, 
  i 'm not because : 1 ) it 's good only short term 2 ) hard to find a good ruler 3 ) people are easily corrupted also in monarchy there does n't need to be only one person giving `` orders '' . 
  usually the monarch only is needed in urgent and significant matters . 
  with other matters he just oversees the work of `` ministers '' . 
  and if some `` minister '' does his job badly he immediately ends without job . 
  but as there 's hard time finding a good ruler let 's stick to democracy , 
  theoretically in democracy even the most hateful speech should get an answer . 
  edit : i think i need to add this : unless the speech is 100 % dumb and without any point like only insults and nothing more . 
  thruth be told a good monarch/dictator/tyrant is better than any other form of goverment . 
  but the problem is the next ruler will he be good or bad ? 
  at least i know what i can expect from him , 
  well there 's a difference between expected number of immigrants ( opening borders of eu market to new country ) and unexpected number of immigrants ( right now ) . 
  that looks like ussr would be still alive and converted to islam :p, 
  i think someone somewhere here sometime ago linked an article that said that those certain countries fund refugees camps but with all this recent influx of information i may be wrong . 
  the difference is poland , romania etc. 
  can cope with the skilled emigrating to western europe where as syria is basically devastated with only poor and uneducated left . 
  also another difference is in most cases only skilled people emigrate from eastern europe leaving the family where as from syria whole families . 
  dunno about other countries but in poland family ties are rather strong so the probability of those skilled ones returning is quite higher than if the whole family moves . 
  nope he always used such language :p, 
  i do n't agree with him in quite a few things , and the words he chooses are sometimes excessive , but i respect him that even if his views are not popular he does n't change them . 
  at least he stopped talking in broken ponglish, 
  such `` nord stream '' much `` solidarity '', 
  then maybe i should convince my family that lives in belarus/ukraine ( ~ 20 ) to seek asylum in poland ? 
  oh wait our goverment does n't care about poles outside of poland, 
  eastern europe does n't even need to cut benefits :p, 
  do n't forget refugee 's families !, 
   people with skills  fit in with their new country so you 're saying you 're ok with taking and assimilating skilled people leaving the source country brain drained ? 
  then i 'm also a refugee !, 
  i know that she 's not inviting directly economic immigrants but syrian refugees but people from other countries are throwing away their documents and insisting that they 're from syria . 
  you will also have upset refugees if they end up in countries like romania , hungary , poland etc. 
  instead of germany or sweden . 
  also benefits ? 
  if i would lose arms i would n't qualify for disability pension and if i would get somehow this pension it would n't be much . 
  my mother after 30 years of running a business ( you pay more for retirement ) and few years of being employed will get ~ 250 euro per month when she retires . 
  that 's barely enough to buy food and pay the bills and if you need to buy medicine then you have to choose . 
  send them to corresponding camps and stop giving hope that taking a risky route will give access to europe . 
  i do n't have anything against accepting refugees but in this case not only syrians are comming to europe but also people from iraq , pakistan and from africa . 
  how many europe can help on european soil ? 
  how many will be happy to be `` redistributed '' to poland , hungary , romania etc ? 
  also a lot of those refugees are educated people and what if they stay in europe and not come back to their countries ? 
  what about those countries that will be lacking educated people ? 
  do you think you can rebuild stable country without educated people ? 
  there 's shit tonne of problems that arise from accepting refugees/migrants . 
  also people not from syria are throwing away their documents and insist that they 're from syria how do you deport them not knowing where they are from ? 
  it would be way better to not accept them , fund refugees camps in turkey , jordan etc. 
  and help rebuild syria . 
  you would satisfy the left and right , and help people . 
  also do not fund/equip rebels :p, 
  or just do n't accept them and fund refugee camps in neighbouring countries ? 
  you mean the polish girls living in germany right ? 
  so where do you deport someone who does n't have documents and claims that is from syria but obviously is n't ? 
  at least you have the fastest internet in europe :p, 
  as a pole if hungary would start shooting to immigrants i would be still with you , besides i 'm sick with what germany is doing in recent times . 
  fingerprints are unique but ... for example due to allergy for detergents my sister lost most of hers fingerprints . 
  so some people could start destroying their fingerprints with for example diluted acids, 
  and that 's what eu should do . 
  help people outside not invite them . 
  it 's way better to invest in coutries neighbouring the war-torn countries . 
  people would flee to those countries then either assimilate or just wait for the war to end and return to their countries . 
  besides who the hell from poorer countries , that were ruined by war , would want to go back from either germany , sweden or uk ? 
  tbh even romania is n't a bad deal, 
  and now our dear angelic eu ruler angela merkel is inviting economic immigrants from around the world . 
  in serbia people are throwing away their documents and then they 're insisting that they 're from syria . 
  gl deporting them when you do n't know where to deport them . 
  benefits in poland good joke xd i 'm polish and if i would lose my arms at this point i would n't qualify for the disability benefit xd, 
  would n't it be simplier to tell them they will be sent to a penal colony in antarctica if they wo n't tell where are they from ? 
  [ well tbh it should be something like that ] ( http://i.imgur.com/ef6ln4z.png ) . 
  also there 's quite few ongoing conflicts that are more worrisome . 
  like the isis one , the boko haram one or like the yemeni civil war . 
  if you check out the conflicts that are in the table it 's easy to discard quite a few countries from the map . 
  so how many refugees can europe take in ? 
  and i 'm predicting that after the green light from germany even more people will try to reach europe . 
  this is not a grammar error but logical error , 
  well it 's quite simple if most of humans/citizens of nation dies and the only left are : a ) 1 man and 100 women b ) 1 woman and 100 men which option has bigger chances to restore humanity/nation ? 
  i do n't really have anyone to vote :p maybe it 's time to start my own party ? 
  i would n't mind with their fastest internet in europe :p, 
  at least it would n't be boring and people would watch diet sessions or part of it , 
  macierewicz as minister of defence oh my goat . . 
  i need to prepare popcorn if that happens :d, 
  what if he 's talking in terms of non-euclidean geometry ?

  it should be an independent republic , or split in some way between poland and lithuania ( though i doubt lithuania would want much because it would add to their russian minority ) . 
  silesia should team up with krak\u00f3w and ostrava to make a megalopolis . 
  then spread out to include cities like cz\u0119stochowa , tarn\u00f3w and opole . 
  there is no way chicago , nyc and london have more than 750,000 poles each . 
  it 's a myth that i have seen propagated quite a bit . 
  maybe , * maybe * if you include not just poles , but their descendants as well ( i.e. 
  people who 's grandparents and great-grandparents were poles but they themselves either do n't hold a polish passport or speak polish ) , and count not just the city limits but the entire metro area ( suburbs plus the surrounding small cities ) , then you might get close . 
  it 's hard to consider these people polish though , if they do n't speak the language , hold the passport or have polish culture as their primary identity . 
  i still think it 's quite blown up . 
  chicago , which has the most poles of any foreign city , maybe has ~ 200,000 , which puts it outside of the first dozen polish cities . 
  vice has a pretty good documentary about this topic .

  my cousin 's belgian parents in law thought krakow was some soviet-style dump , so you can imagine their shock when they actually came here for a visit . 
  japanese people are huge fans of chopin for some reason . 
  good relations with russia ended and you 're nukeless . 
  russian can join us in the mostly-irrelevant corner . 
  yeah , well you 're landlocked . 
  the air pollution in krak\u00f3w is so bad that you ca n't see the mountains most of the time . 
  not only is the city in a valley , but many people still burn coal and trash in home furnaces . 
  on clear days when you can see the mountains though , it 's quite nice . 
  hopefully new regulations concerning the burning of coal and trash at home in piecyki will drastically improve the situation . 
  the view of the mountains could be yet another thing that adds to the city 's attraction . 
  the distance between the approximate location of where this picture was taken , wawel royal castle , and the foot of the high tatras , is approximately 90 kilometers .

  ( worse than japan 's . ), 
  so japan is n't the only one . 
  [ even asean countries ] ( http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2015/10/27/japan-help-asean-cope-with-aging.html ) are projected to have their populations age and then start dropping . 
  we have our own traditions and holidays . 
  we do n't need any commercialized american holidays , no matter how hard certain multinationals try to make it seem cool or hip . 
  norway : it 's rich , beautiful geography , chance of aurora borealis and has a good reputation . 
  if not , then japan because it 's highly developed , has an interesting history , social cohesiveness , quirky and cute girls . 
  it 's basically sucking out the labour force . 
  while in the short-term it may lower unemployment and bring in remittances , in the long-term it 's quite tragic as central-eastern europe 's population is below replacement level and that emigrated labour force will be missed . 
  every country is exceptional in some ways . 
  to me european means a ) originating from the european peninsula , and b ) having roots in greco-roman and judeo-christian heritage . 
  this whole migrant thing is beginning to look like a game of hot potato . 
  what do you think we are ? 
  american ? 
  i consider europe an extended family , some countries are closer and some farther , but we 're all part of the same civilization and heritage . 
  i consider european cultures to be descendants of and inheritors of the legacies of ancient greece and rome , and the huge imprint that christianity has left on our civilization , and this is something that binds all of us together on some level . 
  we need to research clean coal . 
  i like how this is the most upvoted laugh . 
  wow left its mark on a lot of us . 
  germans moving to poland for work , who would have thought . 
  just wait until there 's enough muslims for them to vote in their own parties . 
  i want to know too . 
  we could take gotland and raid the livrustkammaren . 
  losing over 2 million people over 10 years is n't worth eurofunds imo . 
  top kek, 
  now that 's a flag we do n't see around enough . 
  well hopefully you guys can get your shit together so that we could team up and stick it to both western europeans and russians . 
  i 'm curious ; what is the general feeling of ukrainians towards poland ? 
  i hear that many are very positive towards poland and kind of see it like a `` better ukraine '' , but many also harbor resentment from the historical suppression of ukrainians by poles . 
  has anyone here seen elysium ? 
  country : poland favorite neighbor : slovakia least favorite neighbor : russia, 
  while as redditors most of us do n't have to worry about girlfriends , i do think that most of us have mothers , sisters and other female family members to think about . 
  v4 is the engine of central europe . 
  most important ally is the usa obviously . 
  an american dominated europe is one in which the germans are kept down and the russians kept out , which allows poland to flourish when it 's weak . 
  britain is up there as an important ally too , especially within the eu framework . 
  should poland become very strong sometime in the future , it could make its own alliance structure in central-eastern europe , and then ukraine would be poland 's most valuable ally ( due to is size and resources ) . 
  hungary and romania are bros but too weak to be really important allies . 
  lmao . 
  that design is [ so lazy . 
  ] ( http://docs.sketchup.engineeringtoolbox.com/components/63/rectangular_box_large.png ) it looks like a big shoe box . 
  romania strong do it . 
  illegal immigrants = / = refugees . 
  before ww2 france had 41 million people and poland had 35 million people , so poland 's population was 85 % of france 's . 
  if that same proportion was true today poland would have 56 million people instead of `` 38 million '' ( 57 % of present-day france 's population ) . 
  maybe it 's because he thinks that being a warmer sea that does n't have parts of it freeze over during the winter is better , in addition to being closer to asian trade routes and the suez canal . 
  on the other hand , the baltic sea region is wealthier and more stable , and you only need to pass one set of straits to leave instead of 2-3 . 
  also , without crimea and the separatist-held donbass area , i do n't know if ukraine has more people than poland anymore . 
  theoretically yes , but it 's much harder with the table turned against them . 
  good , the west needs to stop being a technology buffet for china . 
  if they want to be able to buy out western companies [ in order to obtain technology and market share ] , they need to allow western companies to buy out and own chinese companies too . 
  right now it 's basically a one way street for technology flowing to china . 
   i genuinely do not understand people who seek chaos [ chaos is a ladder .

  no , not enough proofs . 
  that 's why they 're always asking us for some . 
   poland & illinois . 
  makes sense because so many poles live in szikago . 
   georgia & georgia lol, 
  ayyyy lmao, 
  good luck telling the greenlanders they ca n't / should n't do business with chinese or russian firms , especially if/when they get independence . 
  a mere ~ 50,000 people sitting on so many natural resources is just asking for trouble . 
  those kinds of predictions are n't really worth that much . 
  perhaps they are just better organized and more politically active . 
   yeah , sorry to have currently all our soldiers and available ships and aircrafts in operation at home and all around the world . 
  oh yeah , you have thousands of troops deployed across your own country to protect public places and jewish buildings from all the muslims you 've imported . 
  what a fantastic way to tie up military resources . 
   yeah . 
  no matter those twin mistral thing that france cancelled for your pleasure .

  in the communist era he left to fight against soviet union in afghanistan , just because he hates communism . 
  he was also a candidate for a nato secretary ( afair ) , or something like that . 
  if you are interested in european politics , you should keep an eye on this guy . 
  he 's probably going places . 
  this is interesting approach . 
  i 'd like to read some more about that parallel . 
  do you know any sources ? 
  thanks for the advice , i really made this mistake all my life . 
  `` portuguese '' from now on . 
  i agree about the protection from unemployment . 
  this is one of the cases . 
  about the `` piigs '' -- i 'm not advocating its usage . 
  i 'm just saying that it is a shorter way of saying `` those european countries that have got fiscal problems '' . 
  and it means just that . 
  anyone who acts condescending towards people of these countries because of this is a moron . 
  every thinking person in europe knows that working peoples of piigs countries did n't decide for them to be like that , nor in any way consciously agreed to this terms , in which their countries suffer now . 
  i 'm using the piigs acronym , because it sounds better than sigip and also goes with a story , that you dislike : `` countries that take advantage of the eu are unfair pigs '' . 
  this is just a story and no one takes it seriously . 
  about that `` soviet '' thing ... 
  i 'm not really concerned , you see . 
  all post-communist countries came this really long way since then , that saying thing like that is just going to make you feel stupid . 
  no one ( if anyone ) is even going to get offended by that , it 's just too absurd . 
  we 're in the eu together . 
  i respect that . 
  i respect every nation of the piigs states too . 
  and every person in these nations . 
  i just wish that people could accept that their priviledges are not viable and are to be taken from then . 
  umm , piigs is just a convenient acronym . 
  it does n't mean that we think you 're a pig . 
  get over this thing . 
  this is just a label . 
  about lazy -- there are employee productivity charts , you know . 
  i do n't know how portugese score , but italians and greeks -- well , the charts say they 're lazier than germans . 
  so there you have it . 
  this guy is legit . 
  i can confirm this , i am the internet . 
  i am constantly being amazed by how long and evil can german words get !, 
  in this sense this is a great idea . 
  but it requires that all of the symbols are , in fact , hieroglyphs . 
  that makes it a lot harder to learn and difficult to extend . 
  if i coin a new term with my friends and want to propagate it as meme over the internet , how would i caption it in a picture of a cute cat so every other chinese understands it ? 
  phonetical alphabet is the shit , believe me . 
  it comes at a price of having multiple national written languages ( instead of just one ) but it 's better . 
  also , english and french ( especially the french , ugh ) fucked the idea of phonetical alphabet royally . 
  you need a fucking another alphabet to be able to pronounce these things . 
  these languages are now nonsense , they are even more inconvenient than chinese . 
  sorry about my rant , this is just a thing that i ca n't understand . 
  french had a fucking amazing basis of latin written language and manages to turn it into this fucking indecipherable mess it is today . 
  what a loss . 
  we did . 
  western world is all latin alphabet and this is what chinese could learn from us ( i mean , symbols representing words ? 
  come on , it 's 21th century ! ) . 
  greece is culturally part of the orthodox civilization , which is dying slowly since the fall of constantinopole and they have they own , highly traditional alphabet . 
  so yeah , we did , but they did n't . 
  we 're still europeans , though . 
  i do n't think you remember how competitive it 's been before the eu . 
  arms race ? 
  you betcha . 
  cold war ? 
  of course . 
  wars of supremacy ? 
  three hurrays . 
  bailing out other countries with minor unrest ? 
  fuck no . 
  thats why i chose this one over anything else that appears when you type `` prague '' into youtube , 
  this will give you a pretty good hint : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zcsahoe4eg i 've never been to usa , but i think you 'll never find a prague , a paris , a budapest or a cracow in there . 
  that 's what us is lacking , imo . 
  from what i saw in movies , closest thing to these cities in the us is san francisco , but it 's still not that level of magic . 
  but maybe you could prove me wrong  . 
  i 'm always happy to learn . 
  which us city is of the type of prague ? 
  why do n't you start with crusader kings in 1066 , then export your savegame to eu3 at 1399 and then to victoria in 1836 , and then to hearts of iron 3 to end your history in 1949 ( i tihnk ) ? 
  paradox grand strategy games are a fucking riot if you like history . 
  yes , that 's what i meant . 
  thanks !, 
  are those charges realistic ? 
  i mean , who knows , maybe she really did conspire with russians to get herself some juice . 
  that is not uncommon in eastern europe , even for the pro-western politicians . 
  but seven years ... is she going to prison , or this ... `` parole '' ( i do n't know the right word ) ? 
  if she 's going to jail over it , it 's more probable that this is simply poliitcal trial . 
  but , if she retains her freedom , she might still act politically . 
  sure . 
  mr. palikot was one of their representatives . 
  he left , disappointed with po 's policies . 
  there are others , though , including po 's outstanding leader , donald tusk . 
  however the liberal wing is hidden , not exposed to the general public in order to gain conservative votes . 
  tusk is now showing himself as more of a centrist leader , in my opinion not to scare traditionalist poles . 
  he 's kind of good at it . 
  despite their conservative/traditionalist/pro-religious rhetoric they were not trying to enforce their views on society . 
  well , not in the gay case , at least . 
  they do not show outright support for the church . 
  on the other hand , they delegalized designer drugs ( so called `` dopalacze '' ) , because of their unknown ingredients and possible health danger . 
  tusk also publicly spoke against the decriminalization of marijuana . 
  not in the mainstream . 
  rpp is considered pretty hardcore in poland . 
  i do n't think that there is place for more social liberal party . 
  the public is just too conservative . 
  my opinions exactly . 
  i did n't want to express them in that summary i wrote , but i 'm glad that rpp scored so high ( i was afraid they would n't qualify at all , despite polls ) and i 'm glad that po continues to rule . 
  i think it 'd be cool if they formed a coalition , but that seems unlikely .

  actually you could argue that it 's dramatically higher or absurdly lower , depending on which year you are looking at , simply because the sample size is so miniscule , that if you 'd say `` noone gets killed by police in uk '' you would n't be far off the mark . 
  apparently since 1920 there 's been so many killings of people by police ( regardless of skin color ) that [ you can list every single one of them on a single a-4 page ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_killings_by_law_enforcement_officers_in_the_united_kingdom ) , and many of them even have their own wikipedia articles ( o_o ) . 
  in 2015 there 's been 3 killings , compared to [ 1,186 ] ( https://thinkprogress.org/heres-how-many-people-police-killed-in-2015-e9e78c890966#.4ybhfzifx ) in us . 
  in the entire year uk got a day worth of us killings . 
  or 1 killing per 21.4 mln citizens in uk vs 1 killing per 0.269 mln citizens in us . 
  so ... sorry , but those guys are wasting their time in uk . 
  it 's actually a `` news '' from may , so ... it came before net neutrality . 
  that 's one of the plans . 
  to be more specific - 1.65 gw powerplant that 's suppose to begin operations in 2031 ( delayed from 2029 by the new government ) . 
  that said though - they still have n't decided on the localisation , even though list was narrowed down to 2 proposals ( \u017barnowiec and lubiatowo-kopalino ) . 
  other than that ... well ... more coal \\* eyerolls \\* . 
  then work for a smaller company . 
  it is more than just corporations . 
  it 's china , they do n't need to get it certified all over the world , they can use it purely domestically and/or for military purposes , no need to sell it abroad ( if you are not aware - certification is required only in you sell planes on a certain market , you can still fly there ) . 
  that 's other than the fact that it 's a pure cargo craft , so i doubt they 'd have a huge problems with certification , these undergo far less strict requirements than airliners do . 
  came in to see how our special-care patient [ jkm ] ( http://www.thinkingabout.eu/topics/janusz%20korwin-mikke ) is doing - scrolled through a grandiose list of 7 entries over 3 years , was no disappoint . 
  mortars are using explosive projectiles , which are `` destructive devices '' . 
  it 's a military plate , these are not available in any public register . 
  but yes - it should have all the proper paper work done . 
  afaik in us it 's legal to own main battle tanks as long as you have a license for destructive devices . 
  on another fun note - you can own front-loaded artillery without a license , as long as it 's using solid projectiles . 
  ( usual variations between states might apply ), 
  i linked it for images more than anything else ... 
  [ ekhm ] ( http://www.armslist.com/posts/4616205/oklahoma-city-oklahoma-nfa-firearms-for-sale--fully-operational-main-battle-tank-with-120mm-live-cannon )  the main gun is registered as a destructive device with the atf and comes with 10 projectiles . 
  more projectiles are available . 
  just to clarify - register plates are painted on armor , but they do look like a proper plates . 
  to give an example - polish [ leopard 2a5 with a register plate ] ( http://www.smartage.pl/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/9-7.jpg ) painted on a lower glacis . 
  you forgot about [ trains ] ( https://warisboring.com/giant-missiles-on-secret-war-trains-cool-concept-tough-to-pull-off-ccef941cb724 ) .

  slovenia with population of 2 million had more submittions than poland with population of 38.5 mln ... just saying ... 
  funny enough r pcmasterrace brought by far more traffic than r europe . 
  so ... good job pc gamers ? 
  of course , nowhere near they are now , but still . 
  they not only can do , but they actually * do * a lot of good stuff . 
  it 's extremely unlikely that these companies would leave , given the fact that ireland still have the lowest corporate taxes in europe , even if taxed fairly . 
  google was borderline meaningless in china . 
  losses were minimal , perhaps they even saved money , given the resources they spent on complying with chinese censorship like a little dogs . 
  just to clarify : this ruling covers only a period between 2003 and 2014 . 
  commission does not have a power to recover money from the illegal state aid beyond 10 years from the initial inquiry ( 2013 ) . 
  which means that still a large portion of money will be lost to irish taxpayers . 
   ireland 's tax system is not only illegal nothing like that happened . 
   the eu competition ministry is not a legal body european commission has an authority to do that . 
   this is not an ex post facto law they broke eu state aid rules which were first implemented in 1957 , so by the time ireland joined eec in 1972 - they were already obligated to follow them . 
  none the less - ruling covers only the period between 2003 and 2014 . 
   just seems like it 's going to get tossed on appeal pretty quickly . 
  of course , even if all-knowing aliens would descend on ufos from space and hover over this paper that established * apple sales international * so-called `` head office '' without employees or premises , announcing hereby that apple is guilty - they 'd still run as soon as possible to appeal . 
  [ here 's an official press release ] ( http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_ip-16-2923_en.htm ) that might clarify the extent of bs they did for you . 
  [ here ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/file:main_players_for_international_trade,_2014_\\ ( billion_eur \\ ) _ yb16.png ) is a good graph illustrating how it shapes in an actual numbers , but that 's only eu-28 , not an eea ( switzerland and norway also made it to the list , including them , eea as a whole , is a number 1 in both : imports and exports ) . 
   from the uk and now the eu . 
  no , they 've been attracting companies from the eu for years , if not decades . 
  there 's no `` and now '' in it . 
  this makes no sense . 
  if they want to trade in eu , they have to have an office * in the eu * , so post-brexit uk is * not an option * . 
  it 's not a loophole , it 's some nonsense you just made up moment ago . 
  just like google is , yet - they get far more criticism , especially on reddit . 
  interesting that we do n't have anyone here strongly defending apple . 
  somehow every time google gets punished - we have at least one guy claiming that google * did no wrong * and ec is * the evil * . 
  i like how the first place this news was posted on reddit is / r/yurop, 
   they want an eu with more external powers at the same time they viciously oppose common defense polity and foreign relations . 
  in fact they even opposed european border guard . 
  sorry , but what they are doing * is * contradictory . 
  we already tried that , did n't end well, 
  united earth ... man can dream ... 
  hm ... so germans use belugas to deliver airplane parts and sperm whales to deliver car parts ? 
  do n't worry , most of the people here are very aware what is the reason for sanctions and do support them . 
  does n't change the fact that it 's a very hard time to be an orchard owner, 
  well , i would n't exactly call him a hero , but this list certainly casts him in a very positive light , even though the headline clearly tries to imply malice . 
  i 'm not in warsaw , but appreciated having conferences organized in places that are easily accessible and somewhere around centre of the country instead of a relatively small city in south-eastern outskirts . 
  does n't have to be warsaw specifically though it makes sense given the fact that space-related companies are far more prevalent in there than rzesz\u00f3w . 
  the same can not be said about big cities in central poland , or heck , even krak\u00f3w / katowice/gda \u0144sk / gdynia all of which got better communication with rest of the country . 
  it 's a citizens debate , so warsaw would be a natural choice . 
  aviation valley is not exactly a stellar location for the objectives of this series of debates . 
  even on the industrial level : if it 'd be about aviation industry - sure . 
  but in space rzesz\u00f3w has very little to offer . 
  sadly none of these are in any location i can reach at that date :( ( also : poland - rzesz\u00f3w , come on , they really went a full on with this `` invest in eastern poland '' meme ), 
  got ta love media which make this a headline . 
  lol come on reuters , you can do better than that . 
  it might be a slow news day , but not that slow . 
  [ pigs are kryptonite ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quqchgqal-8 ), 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vasa_ ( ship ), 
  i have never seen this `` plumber '' thing used outside of reddit . 
  on the other hand : `` can not into space '' is much more annoying given the fact that we 're a members of esa , got few satellites and had polish astronaut ( within interkosmos ) before most of other nations did . 
  and this * meme * is waaay too popular , i even heard it once from a manager working for an aerospace company , and it 's not like he was in a meme-target-group , age-wise ... 
  that 's a huge simplification . 
  economical divide was not nearly as important factor as it might appear for you , and it was n't anywhere near as uniform as you try to make it look , there was no clear western-eastern split on a borders , and a structure of wealth was vastly different than it is now making any such comparisons largely irrelevant . 
  what 's the key to the understanding is the eastern orthodox church vs catholic church split , and a politics of the region which were another important factor . 
  in both cases our region always was very separate from eastern europe , hence : central europe . 
  actually it existed since middle ages . 
  it 's hardly a new invention , though certainly gained in popularity in xix century . 
  having `` eastern europe '' as everything east from germany is mostly a cold war invention . 
  very unlikely . 
  but pis might be up for a surprise if they think that having a new chairman is going to radically change the rulings in their favour . 
  pretty much , yes , though general intend seems to bite it from various different angles , and because ct rules over laws , not bills , every bill passed takes a bite off tribunal , even if the most harmful laws within it are rejected on a constitutional grounds . 
  much like it is on most of the governmental buildings . 
  it 'd make sense . 
  interesting that it stimulates brain every 15 minutes .

  someone summon illuminati , please ? 
  eu did not force anyone to take refugees , eu had no borderguard nor deportation agency until last month , eu did not execute any fines on countries that did not take refugees , eu did not have a permission to defend external borders .

   the values of western civilization - humanism , liberalism , the rule of law out of the three values you have mentioned only the last one is what i would consider an universal western value . 
   the eu is nowhere near that level , it 's less than 0.4 % . 
  it would be good if it stayed around that level then . 
  after all we would n't want eu to end up like lebanon . 
   it 's no harder to be scared of the euro than of the zloty . 
  people are always reluctant to change . 
  people would have to be scared of known and local z\u0142oty much more than to be scared of unknown and foreign euro to warrant such change . 
   not really because , again , the current stance of the uk with regards to the euro is n't based on particular events . 
  neither is the current stance of polish public opinion really . 
  it was very divided on that matter even before fiscal crisis , and the 2008 events only tipped the balance in favor of people favouring z\u0142oty . 
   and despite you claiming the zloty helped you survive 2008 , he sure seems to disagree with it . 
  did he ? 
  i though he have clearly said that `` the zloty fulfilled its goal in the time of that crisis '' . 
  the second part , which is the one you are referring to was `` should we have another typhoon in europe , similar to the one after the collapse of lehman brothers in 2008 , we would n't be able to survive '' , which are the words one would expect from a heavy supporter of euro adoption . 
   plus the fact you were planning to join in 2012 supports that indeed he 's right . 
  the fact that we were planning to join in 2012 indicates that 10 years ago there used to be support for adopting euro in poland . 
  nothing more . 
   point is despite you claiming support for the euro being political suicide , your pm sure doing it . 
  ... and his party is going to heavily lose the 2015 election . 
  and they try really hard to do n't openly claim support for joining ez in publications targeted for domestic audience . 
   any such abrupt change that affects the zloty in a negative manner , could trigger support for the euro . 
  i 'd say it would take hyperinflation to shift support heavily enough and had it happened , we would n't be allowed to join the eurozone in such circumstances anyway . 
   we 're going around in circles . 
  this is not true at all because unlike the uk and sweden , poland 's current stance results from a reaction to recent events , and as such is much more likely to change . 
  i would n't say it 's more likely to change . 
  convincing the population * for the second time * that perhaps euro is a good idea after all will be an extremely hard task for anyone attempting it in the future . 
  if it can happen in poland it can happen in sweden well enough . 
   exactly . 
  right now . 
  precisely . 
  i 'm glad we agree for once . 
   and major unforeseeable changes to global economy happen all the time . 
  so you are saying that there 's a chance that uk might join the eurozone after all ? 
   here 's what your pm had to say : what current government says in regard to euro adoption is not really relevant , because it 's extremely likely that the government will change the next year . 
  and position of the potential future government is heavily eurosceptic . 
  all i said that in forseeable future poland joining eurozone is about as likely as uk or sweden doing so . 
   and when i noted you were about to join , before so likely to join once all is more stable that 's now how it works . 
  since 2004 public opinions on euro have heavily shifted . 
  when we were about to join , public opinion was a bit in favour of joining ez . 
  right now , openly advocating joining the eurozone would be a political suicide for any party . 
  even the heavily europhilic ruling ^ ( ( though not for long ) ^ ) party avoids the topic even though just few years ago they were , exactly as you described , so eager to join that we were indeed about 2 - 3 years from it . 
  that wo n't happen anymore in current political climate - at least not until some major unforeseeable change happens to the global economy . 
   in other words , you appeared to be supporting a decision in the long term based only on a recent current event . 
  no , i supported that decision long before said event and for different reasons . 
  all i said was that very event was another thing confirming that my prior reluctance to changing pln to eur was a correct choice . 
   because context always changes , and if arguments on adoption are based on feelings about recent events then positions will change too . 
  precisely . 
  in current context joining the eurozone would be a grave mistake to our country . 
  if context changes ( polish gdp per capita becomes equal to the german one , and all the fiscal problems in eurozone are resolved ) i will be the first to support my country joining the ez . 
   i agree it has to be long term thinking , which is why talking about the recent crisis is pretty much irrelevant . 
  it 's relevant , as it shows that in case of crisis ( which is bound to happen from time to time ) it 's beneficial to have your own currency when compared to being a part of the ez . 
   your argument appears to be , it 's normal for currencies to fluctuate therefore any fluctuations are bound to be good . 
  my argument is that fluctuations in certain range are neither good nor bad , they just are a part of the system . 
  saying that `` we have to join eurozone , because our currency have weakened by 0,7 % today '' is something totally absurd to me and exactly what you have described as `` arguments on adoption based on feelings about recent events '' . 
   if anything would be a reason to believe you will adopt it . 
  how ? 
   this kind of short term thinking , and change of opinion depending on the present context , not adopting euro will be beneficial to poland both in short and long term context . 
  so i 'd say it 's actually a long term thinking as once you adopt euro , leaving it is near impossible . 
  and personally , i was against it even before the 2008 crisis . 
   if you wanted it weaker you would have chosen to weaken it beforehand . 
  [ oh , but that 's exactly what happened 5 years ago and what have saved our economy then . 
  ] ( http://www.xe.com/currencycharts/?from=eur&amp;to=pln&amp;view=10y ) compared to that , current fluctuations are minor and are exactly what one would expect from a currency with floating exchange rate . 
   why ? 
  poland was meant to have adopted it in 2012 already . 
  it did n't because of all the eurozone trouble , thank god the eurozone trouble came before we have adopted euro , else we would n't have avoided recession . 
   but the plan has always been to do so as soon as the situation stabilises . 
  that 's the plan of the current ruling party . 
  which i do n't really see winning the next years elections . 
  quite the contrary , the elections are most likely to be won by a party that is anti-euro adoption . 
  and while they are mostly utter nutjobs about most issues , this is one of the few things where i agree with them . 
   poland 's currency weakened 0.7 percent today to trade at 4.1896 per euro as investors fled to haven assets . 
  weakened currency is good for exports . 
  z\u0142oty is already undervalued by about 20-25 % . 
  taken your pills today ? 
  i 'm pretty sure we 'll join eurozone right after uk and sweden . 
  then in us it 's pretty much the same as in poland though . 
  is the term `` socialist '' really not percieved negatively in the rest of europe ? 
  i reckon it has something to do with you littering the comments on this subreddit with your constant monotematic whining . 
  had intermarum succeeded in the interwar , europe would be a much better place . 
  given the geopolitics , we are natural allies . 
  current latvia is the same country as pre-1940 latvia , it was just occupied by ussr between 1944 and 1991 . 
  hence russians ( and other people ) who have immigrated to latvia in that period have no right to automatical latvian citizenship . 
  that 's how the international law works . 
  the metro stores are called makro in half of the countries . 
  probably that 's why not everyone recognizes it here . 
  what 's the * actual * difference between say some gays being attacked because they are gays and some football club supporters attacked because they are supporters of that particular club ? 
  why the punishment should be harder in the first instance instead of being equal ? 
  what should matter is that someone * was * attacked unprovoked , and not * what * could have been the attackers motives . 
  and while i kinda understand where are you coming from it still strikes me as putting rights of some people above the others . 
  is it still legal equality when some people are protected more from the same crimes ? 
  because it was not * the * parliament building , just the place where sejm of the commonwealth met , but it never was its primary purpose . 
  it 's the royal castle after all . 
  after we regained independence in 1918 it was decided to build a new sejm building , designed to host a parliament , which is the one we are still using today . 
  castle was completely destroyed by germans in 1944 along with most of the rest of warsaw , and was rebuilt in 60 's and 70 's . 
  now it hosts a museum . 
  that kinda proves the point though . 
  more hours worked per worker means that there are too few workers employed . 
  subscribed , did n't know about that subreddit . 
  from the way you describe it , seems like a good place for people who are not radical progressive liberals ( in the american meaning of the word ) . 
  [ you forgot poland .

once you are north of italy 's border , do pack a coat and jacket . 
  also , gloves . 
  * miserably failing at our language ( everyone except maybe the czechs and slovaks ) . 
  mad props for trying , though . 
  * looking weirded out upon seeing people with socks and sandals ( everyone ) * looking weirded out upon seeing `` ersatz '' pizza with yellow cow cheese ( countires with good pizza ) * thinking the communist party is still in power , thinking we pray to saint reagan everyday for liberation ( americans ) * failing at nasal vowels unless french or portuguese , in which case you 'll fail at everything else * expecting good roads ( germans ) * shpreching very fucking loudly in your native tongue ( i witnessed two germans doing this today ), 
  hershey 's is known to be essentially margarine with cocoa .

  do n't know why you 're getting downvoted , all of this makes sense , especially the alternative vote . 
  imho eu should globally have `` common sense '' gun legislation like the us left , that is only small arms and a required permit . 
  though reviving cornish is really something of a pipe dream . 
  and you forgot manx , which is doing quite well . 
  revive latin ? 
  divide us up into lingustic groups and assign slovianski to the slavs and a reconstructed proto-germanic to the brits and dutch ? 
  they are n't late as often as people make it out to be , but when they are ... oh boy . 
  how conservative people are , especially in the formerly austrian and russian parts .

  i think he meant nationalist . 
   annexation of israel to the eu assuming turkey finally fesses up to the armenian genocide , we 'd still need syria and lebanon to have a land connection with israel .

  europe ends at the ural and kazakhstan 's east border . 
  in poland , antyradio in silesia ( which you 'll be passing through if you 're going to slovakia or eastern czechia ) gives out good music , but the djs spend a lot of their time laughing like retards ( `` hwyhwyhwyhwy '' ) , so try to only listen to it in the morning , it gets worse afterwards . 
  you could try eskarock or rmx ( or was it rmf xx ) if it 's available in the area . 
  i never thought i 'd see a comment abotu production and economics from someone named `` shitcunter '' . 
  according to wikipedia , yes . 
  this is to annex prussia , of course . 
  we 're evil nazis , and nazis are germans , and germans want konigsberg back . 
  true . 
  poland had `` nasza klasa '' which was geared for finding schoolmates . 
  nowadays it has degenerated into a place where very old people and very young people post chain letters and creepypastas on the `` little herring '' , an in-site twitter knockoff .

  best part ? 
  our internet is radio-based . 
  same . 
  it 's not that bad , there 's still competition and different offers . 
  it 's just that it 's possible for your local government to pretty much stop any development or sanction a monopoly . 
  really fucking late edit : besides , i get my internet by radio from the datacenter , so i 'm kind of independent of wiring laws on that level . 
  it 's still sad . 
  yeah , well , when i moved here it was a bit better . 
  about 2 years ago , some bullshit bill passed that basically allows your municipality to manage the isps and throttle them . 
  14.3 eur for the 60 mbps .

  uh , prussia was a part of poland back then .

  punishing racism by summary execution ? 
  that 'd just be swapping out the bully and the bullied , how srs sees the world .

  the average ukrainian soldier is a conscript who probably will either desert or shoot his commander if ordered to fire upon a countryman . 
  ca n't link source , but someone in one of today 's ukraine threads linked to an article where soldiers on some base were reported to be happy to have all their roads blocked , because they could n't be ordered to go to kiev that way . 
  country sliced in two or the east defecting/given to russia , crimea possibly independent or given to russia . 
   eyes destroyed podbite oko = `` black eye '',

i think that every price shown there is +30 % less in poland . 
  prices like that are when you would have tried to overpay for everything . 
  at least from my point of view . 
  sticking to this sanctions , and isolating russia for real . 
  eu just played an exemplary theater role . 
  also eu should support this countries that were countersanctioned by russsia , then it would have been successful . 
  instead russia blackmailed whole europe one by one , country by country . 
  and they won . 
  north korean card make no sense . 
  it was ussr friend , and they did wellish until it colapsed . 
  syria did well before usa messed there , belarus does well tbh . 
  germans and russians allways wanted to get rid of poland or suck the most of it , it will not change . 
  although we have a lot of allies tbh , minor players but it does n't matter , 
  kind of my bad , i still still belive that any allience mean nothing . 
  and their only usefull role is to make escalation of conflict unlikely , but in case of conflict they most likely wil be used as toilet paper . 
  still 2 countries did failed to deliver their support . 
  looking at you gb and usa ( 5th and 1st military power ) . 
  * if you can count , count on yourself * , 
  nato as far as i remember gave the warranty that they will protect ukraine , if they will shut down nuclear arsenal . 
  i do n't need to explain a history from last 3 years . 
  exactly !, 
  you are really naive . 
  explain it to dead ukrainians ... also i would ` nt mind anti-ufo shields . 
  if we could have defend from galactic force , russia army would be a joke then :d, 
  it was used against ukraine - ukraine = europe . 
  with military it works more like % gdp * numberofpeople than economic status . 
  i think pis wasted our chance to become relevant force that stands between russia and western europe . 
  if they would make us around 6th/7th army , we could completely reorganise eastern europe ( ukraine + belarus + poland would be unpassable for russia ) . 
  also china desperately want a trade conection with europe ( aka xxi century silkroad ) . 
  usa will go nuts to stop it , they will go for deal with russia to block china from overstepping them ( probably they will bring a card to let russia consume eastern europe ) . 
  and our politicians instead of using oportunity - are blowjobing usa which should be our greatest enemy in intrests . 
  we should make allience with v4/turkey/bulgaria & romania/xxxstans & china etc. 
  ( aka silkroad alliance ) and leave this blefalience nato asap . 
  germany . 
  kind of . 
  people care less about history of european conflicts , as countries have few in common with their historic ancestors . 
  we 're being teached this though . 
  70 ~ ago they did n't need to use passport to enter a country . 
  50 years `` people still know you as a best politician ! '', 
  actually your right :( , but what i said i meant exactly that you must have only old friends . 
  cause definitely my friends do n't get poorer . 
  most of my grandparents live and are doing fine because they live with younger generation . 
  but i feel sympathy for those who do n't have such good position . 
  anyway there is evidence for the previous post . 
  you must have had really specific kind of friends i must say . 
  \u201e cora '' , \u201e podhale '' , \u201e predom-polar '' , \u201e unitra-tonsil '' , radio production by . 
  kasprzak from warsaw , stocznia p\u00f3\u0142nocna w gda\u0144sku , \u201e pafawag '' and like countless others ( around 600 ) . 
  most of them were sustainable , or still did well but why care about them and their know-how , when stoping could be beneficial . 
  1 ) our pre 1989 industry being sold to western capital and then intentionally destroyed by them to reduce competitiveness . 
  2 ) as already said bad constitution . 
  3 ) that you can avoid going to prison for rape . 
  he 's not dead . 
  he made up his death , most likely he made a plastic surgery . 
  he prepared his son for for his accidential death in one of the best clinic - . - only russian propaganda could prepare better bullshit . 
  easy to say when you made people to act for decades on your rules . 
  i would bet that you would have become irrelevant , when europe would act on for example german rules and act passively or even aggressively against you . 
  im feed up with the incompetence of europe thats falling into blackmailing skills of cameron . 
  im back , a loooooot of people there . 
  every single street attached to market looks like in ny . 
  i have made some photos . 
  the shittons of feathers in market made a stunning view . 
  highly recommend to visit wroc\u0142aw this year , 
  have serious doubts this would n't change if they had majority . 
  they are just hired by financially sector that finally wo n't be able to avoid hiding their gains and avoid taxes . 
  that 's 6kkk per year . 
  so they funded them . 
  so name 1 single legislation they offered . 
  listen to their answers in sejm . 
  that 's just pathetic . 
  i could be more rhetorical . 
  me like it . 
  investments in eastern poland are insane scams . 
  could felt that on my parrents job . 
  can not name a single succesfull investment . 
  keep ur dirty hands away . 
  do educate yourself about democracy in poland . 
  we had early consititution , elections etc. 
  when rest of europe took their forks into other asses in religion wars . 
  and for everyone that follow politics know this fight for democracy is western bullshit . 
  divide and rule , we got to united that we actually can change something and finally poland bad propaganda escalated . 
  they are also increadibly incompetent and just act like oposition , instead of giving arguments why . 
  so efective but , em they do n't even know what they fight for . 
  im really suprised that incompetent guys got into sejm , beside ryszard petru ofc . 
  i suspect it got so much upvotes cause my handsomeness is in this photo , 
  ha , ha ha . 
  not even fucking funny , you are either ignorant or stupid . 
  in my family company we 've been fucked up by remote companies twice . 
  my grandfather with bunch of people from my village started making first aid stuff . 
  it went well , they has been growing it for years . 
  but it has grown too much . 
  commies , , natinalised '' company because it was to successfully and employed to many people , so they renamed it and set their people on managerial positions . 
  then there was a free market scam , so they just renamed company 3rd time . 
  set a fucking dog that just copy decision s from muricans . 
  lowered wages and fired my parents that in normal fucking country should inherit company from grandfather , and as the company became one of the most successful pharmacist companies in the europe . 
  parents got fucking kick out and they did n't even paid out their 3 years paid after getting fired and we just need to go to court for years . 
  that 's why pis , is the only reasonable option , once they corrupt we will kick them again . 
  and finally will be able to feel progress our country had in last 25 years on our skin . 
  oppressors scream loud , but majority of polish people were right . 
  they have majority , they can do whatever they wish to do . 
  nobody complained when previous party did so .

  one night they attacked my grandpa house and partitioned the farm . 
  hans killed 5 members of grandpa family . 
  ivan killed only one but ivan kidnapped another two and resettled into the swamp where one died . 
  two years later hans attacked ivan . 
  uncle from us helped the ivan and the ivan at the end beated hans . 
  but ivan stayed in my grandpa home for the next 50 years and announced as a head of family . 
  ivan treated the whole family badly and had strange ideas about farming and do not let my grandpa work by his own . 
  grandpa several times was trying intruder to leave but it did not work . 
  whole farm was ruined . 
  comparing to other farms in the village , house of my grandpa looked very bad . 
  finally ivan left the house . 
  sometimes he drops in to my grandpa house and is trying to hear how my grandpa is greatful . 
  i am polish , and i became curious about your statement :  no , they were liberating the ukrainians and belorussians too from pseudofascist that joke aka the polish republic . 
  before 39 ukrainians and belarusians lived both in iirp and ussr . 
  that 's why i asked for an explanation where , according to you , this population lived better and where lived worse . 
  and whether the word ` liberation ' used by you is used in the right context . 
  do not take it offensive , i am just curious . 
  please also explain what do you mean writing : ` jews were segregated ' , ` ukrainians were discriminated ' ? 
  could you give some examples ? 
  could i ask what is your nationality ? 
   they received a nation you mean kind of independence ? 
  could you please compare what was difference for ukrainians living in the ii rp and in the ussr before wwii ? 
   only significantly less shitty . 
  are you trying compare ii rp and ussr ? 
  in which criterion ? 
  amount of victims ? 
  ukrainian was ` liberated ' by ussr communist paradise responsible for example for [ holodomor ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/holodomor ) ( 3 -- 3.5 million victims ) , kgb and gulags system . 
  thank you . 
  hope our politics will never do that . 
   introduced tax from loss have you got any materials about it ? 
   chrysanthemum flowers are used in the same way in poland - are associated with funerals and cemeteries , and it is also faux pas . 
  the ` all saints ' day ' ( 1st november ) is in poland a day off from work . 
  the tradition is to light candles and visit the graves of deceased relatives . 
  all cementeries light the night sky - it looks awesome - especially in a countryside without city lights . 
   they called themselves '' \u0163igani '' in poland we used to call them ` cyganie ' which sounds like '' \u0163igani '' . 
  but due to political correctness it is not used officially . 
  instead we use romowie . 
  there is polish proverb :  boys are born . 
  it will be a war . 
  next step is to let turk germans to vote in turkey elections . 
  if i would buy a property in greece , which taxes and how much i have to pay ? 
  who kill jfk ? 
  they formed together with the poles , lithuanians and ukrainians rzeczpospolit\u0105 . 
  i met some belarusians - they all were nice and kind people . 
  greetings from poland !, 
  a nation that often and successfully fought for independence . 
  very good cuisine . 
  famous wine . 
  invented holography . 
  they have a great contribution to the development of science - 16 nobel prizes in a nation with such a small population is impressive . 
  they are trying to become independent and to repay debt to the international monetary fund . 
  greetings from poland . 
  they look very skinny - maybe it is because of war . 
  or we are just much more fatter nowadays . 
  where are you from ? 
   there are still those among us , admittedly very few , who think that germans placed their death camps in occupied poland for some reason other than transportation . 
  there are still those among us , admittedly very few , who think that ii ww was about jews . 
  and all their monopoly for suffering . 
  maybe your granpa is too young to remember \u0428\u0430\u0440\u0438\u043a . 
  - edit - maybe i 'm too old to remember all the stuff . 
  maybe it is all belong to you - next generations . 
  fight now . 
  be gently . 
  anyway , without tanks you are welkomed , 
  tomorrow ? 
  kurwa is just the beginning . 
  if you exceed this thin line - you can expect of great reward .

  imho - beauty is not so important for men . 
  but maybe i 'm wrong . 
  you can always look at the ddr swimmers women ( ? 
  we like every single russians very much - come here - we can drink a lot , talk a lot , sing a lot - but we do not like all the stuff concerning the ` matushka rossia ' and all the crappy siblings like judeobolshewics ones . 
  hmfcalltheway means ` democratically ' - not under the soviet occupation . 
  maybe this is a good move , because i heard a rumor that most traffic fines in the uk were issued for polish man named ` prawo jazdy ' , which literally means ` driving licence ' in polish . 
  if you like kayaking and sleeping in tents , i will recomend you ` internationale kanu `` brodnica lake district - drweca - weichsel '' ' .

  stadiums of hate . 
  for me it 's ernest rutherford . 
  there is the old polish joke from the communist era concerning the trade between poland and ussr : `` we give them the coal and they in return take from us corn '' . 
  too much noisy and rude tourists there . 
  you are comparing absolute numbers . 
  i am convinced that the greatest number of arrested in the criterion of nationality is among the native britons . 
  you should divide the number of individuals arrested by the population . 
  poland here . 
  from history i know that we were part of commonwealth ( i do not know how you find it today ... ) . 
  during the last days of ussr it was great to see that you had created your own country . 
  some years ago i red the book titled ` man who crossed the street ' ( something like that ) wrote by the latvian author , and i liked it very much . 
  i do not know any latvian personally and we have no stereotypes about you . 
  at the beginning i was sure that you were talking about 17 september 1939 . 
  after checking - it was about 1944 campaign . 
  it is better . 
  our national day during communist time was 22 july - at that day in 1944 the ussr puppet , provisional government of poland exercised control over polish territory . 
  it seems that belarus did not cut off their communists time .

not necessarily , there 's still plenty of american `` savoir vivre '' , only it 's different than european - always smile , ask about family , show patriotism ( well , pro-us , do n't show patriotism if you 're not american ) , show off your car , drop brand names you use . 
  well , my university building was one of the oldest in warsaw ... because it completed in 1948 and only renovated a couple of times . 
  i do n't understand how 15 yo polish guy can hate russia , especially that they have free healthcare and university thanks to soviet union, 
  so what else 's new ? 
   the 9 billion euros were just to show that its not like only germany benefits of the euro , if you look for example at west poland , i would say they have improved immensly , thanks in part to all the money that gets send there for improvement of infrastructure etc. 
  poland 's not in the eurozone and all the previous governments built that too . 
  and of course eastern europe is not europe . 
  i 'm not sure when this was recorded but there 's a war in europe right now . 
  he wants to have his cake and eat it too . 
   i have never met a single person who uses that type of phrase and uses it to mean their citizenship citizenship , ethnicity , nationality are all different things . 
  in america a ` nation ' is a state , in europe it 's an ` ethnic group ' . 
  when you say i 'm irish you do n't mean ** anything ** . 
  you do n't claim connection with the irish people , their language and culture - you simply say that one of your ancestors was irish . 
  guess what , all my ancestors were polish !, 
   why should i not be allowed to consider myself a part of that history ? 
  3 out of 30 of my family generations have been outside germany and i 'm suddenly no longer of german ethnicity ( not that it really means anything ) ? 
  did my ancestors not fight the romans next to yours ? 
  fight in the great war next to yours ? 
  if an american came to me and say `` i 'm polish '' , i 'd smack him hard . 
  you 're not polish , you 're contributing nothing to poland 's growth , your ancestors betrayed this country by fleeing , probably in the hour of need . 
   national governments should compete between each other with better laws or taxes son , the government is not the same as business . 
  when a new right-wing government wins democratic elections completely legally , prepares new laws to protect their citizens suddenly all europe is like `` hurr , durr , evil nazis '' . 
  but when the left-wing dictatorship actually falsifies elections , rules poland for 40 years , shoots workers and murders catholic priests , the so enlightened europe does nothing . 
  where 've you been in 81 , / u/ajuc ? 
  highest assembly lol european parliament is worthless , it ca n't even propose new laws . 
  it is a forum for representatives and as such it must allow freedom of expression . 
  yanks go home !, 
  death to nato occupants . 
  barely , the eu does n't want it to happen . 
   so fuck of you racist cunt and try to keep poland from becoming a fascist authoritarian half-dictature . 
  why do you think poland is becoming this ? 
   i was afraid you would bring that argument up . 
  in my understanding , people who adapt the language and culture of a nation are also a part of this nation . 
  what made the jews different from the rest , except for the religion ? 
   the very fact they did n't . 
  isaac singer , a great jewish writer had said `` polish was as alien as chinese to me '' , despite his family having lived in poland for centuries . 
  poland is a catholic country . 
   the jews that died in the warsow ghetto were mostly polish people , so i think it is kinda obvious that this apology was mainly directed towards the polish victims . 
  jews were n't polish , they were polish citizens , but they were never part of the polish nation . 
  the ` victims ' were mostly dead or have emigrated to israel . 
   and besides that , signing the treaty of warsaw was also a way to apologize to poland . 
  just giving up a huge part of former german territory was a really big thing back then . 
  the former german territory was given back to poland by the soviets . 
  why do you think he would n't want to argue with the greatest world power at the time ? 
   brandt `` just '' apologized for the polish victims with that move then why did he kneel in front of the jewish monument ? 
  what did he do to apologise to poland ? 
  they have n't apologized for wwii 2 . 
  they still try to control europe via banks and media 3 . 
  they have no respect for the weaker nations . 
  in general they should never have been permitted to reunify . 
  how is saying `` everybody is a rapist '' not pro-rape ? 
  also fun fact - if the other person says `` no '' or does not say `` yes '' , and you go with it , it 's a rape . 
  does this sound nazi to you ? 
  sure thing , ahmed . 
  nevertheless they exist , and they consistently portray polish people like idiots , not unlike nsdap propaganda or the american jokes . 
  there are plenty of examples of europeans mocking poland , from the german stereotypes of car thieves or `` polnishe wirtshaft '' to polandball memes . 
  poland has always been the laughinstock of more `` enlightened '' nations and pis is fighting back to change that image . 
   pis is going to have a field day with this since it 's founding principles are based on anti - communism quite an easy feat in 2010s , especially when you redefine `` communism '' as `` everything kaczynski does n't like '', 
   any journalists forbidden to work ? 
  some of them have already been fired ; not even sure what do you mean by ` forbidden to work ' , but pis had in 2005 the project of lustration which would indeed forbid many people to work as journalists . 
   yeah , but germany started 2 huge wars was gavrilo princip german ? 
  that 's a typical german name ... 
  why do you think so ? 
  both eu and ussr called themselves democratic after all ... 
  yet the germans were comfortable judging millions of jews and poles . 
  i think you 're not entirely objective here . 
  not by all poles . 
   the eu 's first reason to exist is to prevent that this bs will happen again . 
  that poles are now comparing the eu with the third reich has some special character to it . 
  that was the exact argument on why poland must remain in the soviet sphere of influence . 
   european ( ruling ) left cdu is left now ? 
   the fascist extreme far right in poland which just gained power has no right to lecture present-day germany on nazism . 
   they are not extreme far right , i can name at least 3 parties even more right then they are , and one of them ( kukiz ) is in the parliament . 
  they have also gained power in a democratic election and unlike the previous , pro-german government they are n't shooting polish people . 
   that 's horrifying , but these germans are n't those germans . 
  they inherit the guilt . 
   those germans were tried , convicted and executed depending on their crimes . 
  no , they were n't . 
  that would be an entire generation of males . 
  they built and supported that criminal system . 
   their country was broken in half for half a century and one of those halves had to deal with soviet hard rule . 
  poor east germany , the highest standard of living in the whole eastern bloc . 
  in the meanwhile , the first ally to fight them , was prone to systemic looting and high contributions to stalin 's ussr . 
   today 's germans have n't wronged you in any significant way what is nordstream ? 
  what is charter of fundamental rights ? 
  who controlled donald tusk ? 
  who controls 80 % of media in poland ? 
   not any more than they have other countries or other countries have wronged them . 
  how is germany controlling france , for instance ? 
   imagine the criticism they 'd be subjected to if they were mentioning the russian raping of german women every other week , for instance . 
  imagine the criticism they 'd be subjected to if they were presenting the poles as idiots ... oh wait , they already do in their hilarious comedy shows or memes like polandball . 
   i will stand with germany every single time in cases like these . 
  where do you live if i may ask ? 
   excuse me ? 
  did you see any german tanks rolling through warsaw ? 
  did n't think so . 
   i 've seen nato tanks in my home town some months ago . 
  how are bikes or vegetarianism multi-culti ? 
  so you 're being an idiot for not understanding what waszczykowski said . 
  could you explain it with your own words ?

  we know how and when the human life begins , it 's not subjective and should n't be in question here . 
  what we 're discussing is more a justyfication to terminate that life . 
  i keep hearing about that famous `` progress '' and still i do n't know what 's that ... sure i must be blind to not see the `` bright future '' predetermined in accordiance to some ideology . 
  i guess i should be shoving ideology instead , prefereably the `` correct '' one . 
  that 's your opinion . 
  so it 's not the posession of a skin which makes a human ? 
  or are you sugessting that whoever a human depends on should have a right to `` abort '' it ? 
  should n't it be a father 's `` busyness '' as well ? 
  indeed communism was a `` progress '' ... they actually used this slogan as frequently as you do to advertise their policies . 
  but it 's not a discussion about my simple person , it was just not elegant and unnecessary . 
  i do n't feel offended , but also i know that for leftys `` ultraconservative '' is an insult and i guess your intention was to discredit me and picture as a biased fanatic . 
  is it the `` reasonable position '' that you reserved for yourselve ? 
  not me , i just used a common name for a specie in question . 
  should i write ` homo sapiens ' instead ? 
  obviously it is , which does n't make me wrong in any way . 
  why would n't you adress me personally instead of making up `` accusations '' and stuff ? 
  you 're doing exactly what / u/lupinechemist was writing about and this is not just a one subject in which far left replace discussion with empty slogans or just insults . 
  another brilliant comparation ... 
  if you know a better definition of a human , then please provide it . 
  i was making no definitions . 
  thanks for advice , but i 've studied biology long enough . 
  in this case i think it should be mother 's decission . 
  there was a case in poland of a volleyball player agata mr\u00f3z , she was diagnosed with cancer and she refused chemiotherapy to not affect the baby . 
  she died unfortunatelly , but her baby survived . 
  yes , but we 're talking about our own specie . 
  i 've said it already before , but anyway humans have no self awarness until about 3rd year after birth . 
  besides , consciousness in this context is more a `` philosphical '' idea and its definition can change . 
  you 're obviously [ wrong ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/human ) . 
  would you eat a `` human-shaped clump of cells '' ? 
  i do n't quite get your point . 
   medical exactly what hippocrates thought . 
  it is related to the `` argument '' that you 're making about dependence of immature organism . 
  skin develops between 5-8th week of life . 
  i used to be . 
  from the first mitotic division it fulfills all the conditions of a living organism . 
  every organism is a `` clump of cells '' and not just humans have nervous or circulatory systems . 
  if i 'd be a bacteria , than maybe i would . 
  no , since i was n't talking about just any specie . 
  [ it is ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/human_body ) . 
  mammals are dependent on their parents for a much longer time than pregnancy . 
  i just love that `` progressive '' determinism ... 
  humans have no self awarness until about 3rd year after birth . 
  foetus is an organism during embryogenesis that resembles morphology of a mature organism . 
  obviously it 's a separate body . 
  no idea what 's a `` moral puritanism '' , but first there should be a right to `` aborth '' humans to be taken away . 
  it 's not an extreme example , that 's exactly what unwanted pregnancy is and i 'm not sure if it 's reasonable to punish humans for their parents deeds . 
  i could consider it as an execption , but still there 's nothing `` positive '' about that . 
  and what 's so positive about `` aborting '' humans ? 
  there 're maybe some neogothic elements , but it 's not pure gothic and it 's not medieval at all . 
  i should visit lw\u00f3w someday and \u0141yczak\u00f3w is obviously a one place to see , but also [ pow\u0105zki ] ( https://www.google.pl/search?q=powazki+cemetery&amp;biw=1652&amp;bih=956&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ei=jmahvz-gpmm7ovkwgogc&amp;ved=0cayq_auoaq ) in warsaw are not bad . 
  there 're also two protestant , one judaic and even a little muslim graveyard there . 
  in the same neighborhood there 's also an orthodox and karaite cementary . 
  in xixc , after partitions , russians did n't allow monuments and sculptures to be rised , graveyrds were the one exception . 
  so if it 's about the brain , then i repeat that many animals also posess it . 
  are they ... humans ? 
  dude , first you start some pathetic personal attacks and just becouse i 'm ignoring that with sarcasm it 's me who 's `` emotional '' ? 
  you 're also making up stuff , i was never implying such things . 
  still developing , just like in the whole process of embryogenesis . 
  also , i 've said it before that the animals also have these organs . 
  no idea what are you talking about . 
  my point exactly . 
  ok , why then underdeveloped , premature fetuses are being taken care of ? 
  they 'd not be able to survive on their own , actually no human would for many years after birth . 
   i was right . 
  sure , as always . 
  well , the point of every discussion is to proove your opinions and persuade the opposite side , but usually it 's impossible . 
  the `` material '' aspect is secondary and the whole discussion is about a definition of a human , at least i hope nobody justyfies killing becouse of material or mediacal conditions . 
  so the difference is not about survival , as you 've said , but about the developement of medicine ? 
  you 're such a nice guy , my hero ... 
  still it 's all about the money . 
  sorry , you 'll never convince me that it 's better for a human to be `` aborted '' instead of living in poverty or in the orphanage . 
  sure , ecology ( the real one ) is also about social interactions and as for `` justyfication '' , it 's survival as always . 
  there 're defintions of a life , organism or a specie ( human for example ) so lets say that 's `` my '' idea of a human . 
  ... i was born two weeks before the date , without medical care i would n't survive and same goes for millions of others . 
  so if it 's all about survival , why are n't those premature kids `` aborted '' ? 
  and still you do n't see how your argument was false ? 
  you 're just giving example how ridiculous can be some ideology and how the human laws can contradict not just the nature , but a common sense . 
  obviously you may say that i also have some `` philosophy '' and i 'm obviously against `` aborting '' humans . 
  it may be just an inherited empathy , typical for the social species . 
  this is sick ... are you seriously saying that 's a favor for the kid to be `` aborted '' becouse of money ? 
  there 're orphanages for those who ca n't afford a condom . 
  ok , so what 's the `` personhood '' ? 
  are there animals which posess it finally , or not ? 
  i 'm sceptical if it goes for philosophic , ideologic or religious arguments . 
  apes or dolphins are n't humans , so if your point was to define a `` human '' then you should really change those criteria . 
  still i 'm quite sure that many animals fulfill those conditions . 
  sorry , i do n't belive in creationism . 
  survival of the fittest ... what about those premature births ? 
  what for we actually need hospitals ? 
  what 's a `` human being '' ? 
  you just wrote that a human organism is still underdeveloped in the 5th week and you should also know that humans mature and dvelop for many years after their birth . 
  besides , you ca n't say exactly on which day this organism becomes a `` human '' . 
  many other species have central nervous system , are they also `` persons '' ? 
  obviously if the life of a mother is at stake , then she should decide , but this is not the `` human '' right that we 're talking about . 
  ok , so how long a human needs to survive on its own to be granted these `` rights '' ? 
  wikipedia is not a primary source , if you wants more , follow the linked sources . 
  i thought you was talking about the human body . 
  is elimination of underdeveloped or handicaped human organisms `` etchical '' ? 
  what does make a `` personhood '' ? 
  does n't matter anyway , it 's all subjective and dependent on personal beliefs or ideology .

  you got the rest :d, 
  there 's like a billion of remixes on the intenets of an angry rant made by a fring politician called stonoga after an election defeat .

  it 's not that simple edit : if you look at the polls you notice that support for independence did n't move since the last referendum took place . 
  snp needs more support for independence than the slight majority they do n't even have . 
  lots of these folks , that declared they will vote yes , will change their minds in the last moments to vote for safe status quo . 
  besides , scots are n't as open and progressive as they may want you think they are . 
  ukip could have a strong voter base there if it would n't be seen as a party of english nationalists . 
  seems unlikely for scotland to break free now , but demographic trends go against unionists . 
  same thing happens in northern ireland , but slower , more and more people support secession with time . 
  folks also should remember that it 's very likely for queen to die in next 10 years and she plays a vital role in keeping british british .

  african population is about to triple in the comming years .

  sure european muslim have guaranteed rights , that have be protected , but i would like to have a liberal federalist party that oppose immigration from muslim states , to vote for .

  yup , everyone knows finns are mongoloid, 
   just as a cheesy example , the queen is known as elizabeth ii in england and elizabeth in scotland , as scotland never had an elizabeth i ( as her rule predated the union ) . 
  which is confusing considering that unlike elizabeth i she 's not a queen of england or stotland but a queen of the uk . 
  ca n't help it , i 'm polish . 
  when we catch a nazi bait there 's no comming back from offensive mode, 
  quite ironic considering that germans of your grandpa 's generation were raping , killing and steeling here in a scale not seen in europe ever since . 
  any german should check his grandma 's neck for polish jewelry before making dumb `` polish thieves '' joke imho, 
  some europeans have better stereotypes of us than others . 
  if any i think german ones would be the hurtful ones . 
  if you would ask an average hans about the polen he would go on about car thieves , communism and general poverty . 
  it 's probably because of proximity . 
  we are the closest of relatively `` poor '' countries to them . 
  homolobbies , gender ideology , german influence on the union , cyclists and vegetarians ... or at least that 's what our public broadcaster told me : v,

  we were talking about germany not poland . 
  sniff, 
  i 'm eating my breakfast right now @_ @, 
  yeah i know . 
  i simplified it and i think you got my point . 
  i 'm not sure i understand . 
  berlin , dresden and more were founded by slavic ancestor of germans living there now . 
  whole of former gdr was once slavic speaking but it deluded with influx of german colonists from the west, 
  slavic tribes in the east, 
  pis and militant catholics belive in influence of `` gender studies '' on european culture , that gay people are going to destroy traditional family . 
  there is no big political party they openly accuse of `` genderism '' , it 's allways the west as well as media and elites in a broad sense . 
  there is that infamous priest mr. oko , that pis invited for a lecture in sejm once . 
  he explained how the gay sex works in details , made some analogy to exhaust pipe , generally hatefull and primitive stuff . 
  it reminded me of that `` the eat da poo poo '' meme . 
  it sometimes feels like uganda here . 
  damn i 'm sleepy . 
  i [ 'll probably have to edit this comment tomorrow . 
  where do i begin ... all these stuff around smolensk plane crash , grandpa in wehrmacht , tusk being a `` german '' candidate recently , lots of stuff around gender/homo/lgbt propaganda , ...

  i would vote nowoczesna , because of their program and because i still have some hope in them po , because of their politicians and razem , because of their voters i wish we had a liberal party like they have in germany , netherlands or uk . 
  one that is n't watered down and that has something more to offfer than just not being the other `` bad '' party . 
  a pragmatic party standing for freedom and equality .

  not the parliament , but our voting habits . 
  we have low voting turnout in every elections held in the country - therefore no surprise it happened here , too . 
  we generally have low voting turnout . 
  with our parliamentary elections it 's ~ 50 % every time . 
  well , this is actually offensive . 
  just as much as it 'd be with genders reversed . 
  we already heard that once . 
  i think you should doublecheck your definition of ` occupation ' . 
  here , i 'll help you : _ 3 . 
  invasion , conquest , and control of a nation or territory by foreign armed forces . 
  the military government exercising control over an occupied nation or territory . _ ~ [ the free dictionary ] ( http://www.thefreedictionary.com/occupation ), 
  americans left germany [ 25 years ago ] ( http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/treaty_on_the_final_settlement_with_respect_to_germany ) . 
  and they ( & amp ; other allies ) were there because of the war . 
  if there was no war , germany would n't be occupied . 
  no , it should n't . 
  where did you get that idea from ? 
  well , germany should n't had started the ww2 in the first place . 
  dude , if not the link , i 'd think you are joking :d, 
  and / r/askeurope, 
  most of emigrants leave their country because they ca n't have a decent life there , not because their culture is shitty . 
   technically assimilation is blending into the other culture . 
  i do n't see how he is blending into the finnish culture . 
  living by the law is just that . 
  it 's not assimilation . 
  i may not follow the definition of the word `` assimilation '' , but obeying the law sounds like enough . 
  why tell people how to live if they already follow the rule of law ? 
  i 'm surprised switzerland and luxemburg are at poland 's level . 
  thought they 're at their neighbors ' . 
  well , you can be an assimilated muslim , you know ? 
   instead finnish girl is assimilated with arabic culture in finland . 
  to be assimilated does n't mean to believe the god ( or no god ) of the local population . 
  it means to live the way you want as long as you obey the law . 
   perhaps , but i also know a case of polish girl in uk who married iranian guy and was forced to change her name and wear nihab outside of her house . 
  there are plenty of cases like that , and this is signal of lack of assimilation . 
  no matter if the girl is asked or not . 
  it does actually matter . 
  if her husband leaves it up to her decide for herself how to dress ( regardless her actual decision ) and behave , i see them as quite westernized . 
  this extent of the _ my way or the highway _ mentality does n't really help with assimilating other cultures , ya ` know ? 
  surprising or not , it 's completely ok and up to them to decide . 
  they are n't harming anyone . 
  in countries like turkey or bahrain ( where i live ) , it 's up to the woman if she covers herself . 
   burqa is not part of finish culture it does n't mean she ca n't wear it . 
   the fact that finnish girl wear one mean it ** is imposed by her husband . 
  ** how can you be sure of that ? 
  i mean , i 'm aware of the stereotype , but living in a muslim country for three years , most of the girls i know who wore some sort of scarf , covered themselves by choice . 
  i know it 's not always the case , but you ca n't be sure just by looking at them . 
  this way you could simply assume they are terrorists , too . 
   but just last saturday i saw a finnish girl wearing burqa accompanying her husband ( growing that fantastic pubic hair looking beard ) . 
  i can not get it . 
  what is wrong with that ? 
  were they breaking the law or something ? 
  if you ca n't get , does n't mean it 's bad . 
   so according to pure logic they are not muslim . 
  or is islam something where you choose what to believe from the quran and what not ? 
  it does not make sense . 
  does their boss muhammad allow such `` half-belief '' ? 
  i do n't think so . 
  that 's why every single muslim is very dangerous because you never know when he or she decides to start believing in those parts of q that they did n't believe in before . 
  do you realize it 's exactly the same with christianity ? 
  born in / r/poland , live in / r/bahrain , planning on moving to / r/sweden after making my bachelors in krakow , poland . 
  only the biggest are in the parliament , though . 
  link in polish , sorry - failed to find an english list . 
  ok , but why would voters have a right to tell an adult person about who can they marry ? 
  i mean , if both people are adults and want to pursue it , why forbid them ? 
  then what 's the case ? 
  marriage in general . 
  so you ca n't marry because i tell you so ? 
  marriage is a personal matter , gay or not . 
  i 'll just leave that here : _ great minds discuss ideas ; average minds discuss events ; small minds discuss people . _ ~ eleanor roosevelt, 
  why would you want to have an opinion about someone else 's personal matter that does n't affect you in a slightest ? 
  a person 's sexual orientation is n't something worth having an opinion about . 
  _ mind you or anyone who dares to say that as a counterargument - abuse of any kind is n't a personal matter . 
  and no , homosexuality \u2260 abuse . _, 
  this article makes it out to be as if it was all about eu - while it really was n't . 
  people are dissatisfied with the way platforma obywatelska ( komorowski 's party ) governs and want things to change . 
  people are frustrated with internal issues , like beaurocracy , high taxes getting wasted on it , low wages , and lack of jobs .

it was obvious from the beginning . 
  i never understood why my fellow countrymen are so opposed against refugees . 
  95 % of them will leave poland as soon as possible . 
  i had czech neighbours . 
  the best moment was when my 3 years old son was playing hide & seek with their daughter . 
  my wife said : `` wiktor , szukaj bianki '' . 
  her czech mother was crying with laughter . 
   czechia is poor underdeveloped country full of racists , you really shouldnt come here . 
  but you have only 16 % god-believers . 
  dream country to me . 
  if only czech language was less funny  . 
   it surprises me that people do n't want to live in eastern europe . 
  why ? 
  many poles do n't want to live there either . 
  they only want salaries as big as in western europe . 
  everything else is bad and a threat to our glorious christian culture . 
  yeah , we have special day for demolishing our cities . 
  it 's called independence day . 
  i do n't see any problems with arabs in london . 
  i 've been living here for 6 years now , most of this time in middle east neighbourhood ( barking ) . 
  i moved to more white borough last year but i will always remember barking as quite safe place to live . 
  maybe they do n't integrate very well and their culture is different to ours but i would never say they are a threat to our lives . 
  btw i have blonde wife as well . 
  we have a long and rich history between germany and poland . 
  there is something for everybody  . 
  like western ussr  . 
  i prefer * former-east-germany *  . 
  take away german signs and adverts , add some dog shit on pavements and it will look like western poland . 
  ... or education . 
   is n't atheism a form of religion ? 
  of course . 
  like not drinking alcohol is a form of alcoholism . 
  this is how we call our ancestors . 
  give them british postal address , your embassy for example , and problem solved . 
  this is how i buy digital stuff from amazon us where prices are much lower comparing to eu . 
  damn , it was +15 in wroc\u0142aw two weeks ago !, 
  was even prettier before 1945 . https://vimeo.com/67087042, 
  nowadays ? 
  do you think we were better 100 or 500 years ago ? 
  you are right . 
  it 's working , without need of `` english only '' policy . 
  it 's not the exception . 
  he 's got a lot of classmates from different parts of the world . 
  his best 4 mates are from romania , kosovo , england and turkey . 
  apart from english boy , obviously , they all speak english very well . 
  but polish catholics do n't care what pope says . 
  since jp2 died they do n't need pope any more . 
  they live in their own little world and wo n't listen to anybody except local priest or/and radio maryja . 
  it 's not true . 
  we live in uk and speak polish only at home . 
  our son ( 8 years old ) has no problems at school at all . 
  he even won `` star of the year '' award last year . 
  the church is against in vitro , so are they . 
  do n't agree . 
  drivers in uk follow the rules very well . 
  maybe they do n't know what f. . . indicators are for , but they stop at zebra if anyone is waiting to cross . 
  `` jesus christ '' and `` crap '' are in the same category ? 
  i thought we are talking about low paid jobs that do n't require skills and anyone can do it . 
  and they are right . 
  problem is locals do n't want to work for a shitty wage . 
  especially if they can get the same money from benefits . 
  it 's not a polish style bread . 
  it 's how a normal bread looks like . 
  every country in europe have bread like this , except british islands . 
  nothing , it 's the same as polish one and it 's probably cheaper , considering that everything in polish shops ( in uk ) is overpriced . 
  this map is very similar to the one with percentages of [ people in european countries who believe there is a god ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/demographics_of_atheism#europe ) . 
   do you become british just by being born there ? 
  yes , if one of your parents have lived in uk continuously for five years . 
  [ more ] ( http://www.aboutimmigration.co.uk/giving-birth-child-uk.html ), 
  not all muslims . 
  isis killed more muslims than christians , so far ... 
  this explains perfectly why i call my country `` iran of europe '' . 
  they stand on the left . 
  we visited marseille two weeks ago on our way back from corsica and we really liked this place . 
  we stayed there for one night only so did n't have much time to explore the city , though . 
  to be fair i saw plenty of idiots in poland in t-shirts saying `` only god can judge me '' . 
  is n't putting christianity above the law ? 
  from poland : abelard giza from uk : john cleese , ricky gervais , david walliams , sean lock, 
  rather a warehouse or a public hall . 
   forcing people to go home is a war no one wants how one defines home ? 
  my home is in uk . 
  i 've been living here for almost 11 years , my son was born here , i bought a flat ... 
   you wo n't be able to see your grandkids probably this is one of the reasons why they emigrate so far away . 
  i went to lanzarote last december . 
  have not seen a single brit in a spanish restaurant . 
  where is san escobar ? 
  i bet they say the same about lgbt . 
  bonjour , merci and au revoir are the standard words one has to know if he/she does not want to look like an idiot abroad . 
   i remember a polish couple in holidays trying to buy some baguettes in the bakery . 
  they struggled to understand what was saying the waiter , because she refused to speak english . 
  when the couple asked her what was the price in english , she just repeat herself , louder , in french . 
  gosh . 
  we had this problem everytime we went to france for holiday . 
  but one day we learned a simple sentence `` parlez-vous anglais ? '' . 
  i do n't know why but every frenchman becomes suddenly an anglophile when hearing this . 
  they can speak english , they are more friendly ... 
  and still horizon is not straight . 
   the americans before pearl harbour did n't want to go to war and the moment after , they were having too many volunteers . 
  they did n't want to fight for their country or they did n't want to fight for europe ? 
  i guess it 's the latter .

  of course we do . 
  yes , it is a nice thing to have . 
  we have every right to it . 
  poland is also a border country for schengen , but how specifically is italy and greece paying for free movement in europe ? 
   schengen system with common external border works only if benefits ( free movement ) and costs ( processing of asylum seekers in accordance with the international law ! ), 
  are shared . 
  poland wants only benefits ; just let italy and greece handle extraordinary migrant flows ... bullshit , has poland ever refused any sort of aid , other then migrant quotas , which does not solve the migrant crisis ? 
  its not our fault the eu is solely focusing on this instead of other ways of helping italy/greece and solving this issue . 
  additionally , we do n't get those benefits for free , its part of the political/business deal we made , its not out of the goodness of eu 's heart we have free movement . 
  ok , but lets now compare that to one of the groups you mentioned - uk muslims . 
  there are long lists of these stats , but for example [ this ] ( http://edition.cnn.com/2016/04/11/europe/britain-muslims-survey/ ) :  ( 52 % ) think homosexuality should not be legal , and nearly half ( 47 % ) think it is not appropriate for gay people to teach in schools , according to a new survey of british muslims . 
  are you seriously trying to say that the majority of ( for example poles ) not supporting same-sex marriage is worse then half of uk muslims wanting to make homosexuality illegal ? 
   have you ever asked yourself why that would be the case ? 
  maybe if polish people were less hostile towards them , more of them would stay . 
  lets not be naive here - its mostly about the money . 
  its not a coincidence their main destinations are countries with best social care . 
  why else would they be leaving countries like portugal , which afaik is considered very tolerant . 
   but no , let 's blame the refugees , 'cause it 's fun . 
  yes , lets blame europe for not taking in every poor person , for not solving world hunger and poverty . 
  for not assimilating the migrants properly ... 
  that doesnt stop them from doing it though . 
  [ new version ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtwle684jb0 ), 
  any proof of this ? 
  exactly . 
  i agree that the moment they do that ( leave for germany ) they stop being refugees . 
  my whole problem with this is , that most of the migrants are n't from syria ( or war torn areas for that matter ) , but even if you find them/background check them and confirm they are real refugees running from war , there is a good chance they will do something like this . 
  my point was : these are people who were taken directly from syria , some type of background check was done and they still left . 
   real refugees would stay , if told so , simply because they would get help there . 
  there is all there is to it . 
  not really , for example a private foundation went to syria , found and brought back a couple christian families to poland . 
  the first family left for germany in the first days of being here , the rest later on . 
   either way , i can understand poland not wanting to accept migrants but we do n't do much to help solve the migrant crisis any other way either . 
  you cant really expect poland ( or any single country for that matter ) to solve this migrant crisis single handle , its not our fault the eu focuses only on this migrant relocation which isnt a solution to this problem . 
  how ? 
  that would go against eu 's core value of open borders . 
   countries like poland have the advantage of not being one of the favourites destinations so how does that help anyone if the vast majority of these people will move back to germany/sweden ? 
  why play around instead of straight up asking the migrants who wants to live in countries like poland ? 
   but i guess it 's cool to only get the positives from being an eu country . 
  not true , we dont get money from the eu for free . 
  for example poland is another open market for eu businesses and products , we supply low wage workers , brain drain , etc. 
   i think about italy and greece , countries that did n't get the choice of opting out of this situation and really feel for the people who are dealing with this situation in the front lines , when other countries refuse to help . 
  so do i , but we are not refusing to help , we are only refusing this one thing - which isnt a solution to the problem . 
  afaik poland hasnt refused any other form of aid to italy and greece . 
  i definitely think there is more we can do to help , but it is not our fault the eu is focusing solely on this so called `` solution '' and not on other practical aid . 
  there is a bit more to that . 
  the cc ( and courts in general ) dont have the best opinion in poland . 
  for example : when the cc court `` okay'ed '' the taking / `` stealing '' of 150 billion zloty from ofe , people were not happy with that , so many thought a long the lines of - why care about the cc , when the cc doesnt care about us . 
  and just a couple days ago , in a discussion when the topic moved to migrant relocation quotas , people were telling me that this idea has been dead for a long time and no one is pushing it anymore , right ... 
  while i mostly agree with this , i see a big difference between being an idiot and being very intelligent/well educated . 
  additionally , charisma , good looks , speaking skills never were kaczynski 's strong suit . 
  he is a good speaker in the sense that he rarely ( if ever ) reads his speech , but he smacks his lips , which many people make fun of . 
  as much you might dislike him , do you really think an idiot could achieve what he did in politics ? 
   would that be the european values of pay me money and do n't complain about it ? 
  you know what , i like those . 
  how about we change it up and you guys pay us for a change ? 
  this is your problem , you think we are getting the money for free . 
  news flash - we arent , its part of the deal . 
  please answer this - do you honestly think `` your side '' is giving the money out of the goodness of their hearts ? 
   ok , i simply advocate selling out the east to the highest bidder as quickly as possible and continuing with a core-eu , that will actually improve the lives of my citiziens . 
  how progressive , but good luck with that ...  how so ? 
  have you missed all the talks about how the eu cant let brexit be a success , how english isnt important anymore , leaked private discussions , etc. 
   i simply make the computation that poland is leeching of my people , we would be better of without you . 
  again , not true . 
  we are not leeching anyone , its part of the deal `` your side '' offered . 
  plus , looking full picture - it wont be better off without us , if that was true , there would n't have been a eu expansion in 2004 . 
   as a bonus without germany there wo n't even be an eu-around to make problems in the exit negotiations . 
  so the sooner germany and as many of developed western european countries as we can pull along in a say core-eu dump you the better for us . 
  you are delusional , the 2004 expansion wasnt a random event . 
  it was a calculated political and business decision , your side knew exactly what would happen , if it wasnt beneficial for your side - it wouldnt have happened . 
   not better for you , but we both seem to agree that the well-being of citiziens other than our own is not really a priority , yes ? 
  i agree that a polish/german/french / etc politician should first and foremost care about poles/germans/french , 2nd about other europeans , because they have been chosen as a representative of these people . 
  but this is not a 0 sum game . 
  `` poland and the east '' joining the eu is beneficial to both sides . 
  there are pro and cons of this , but in total its win-win . 
  edit : spelling, 
   luckily your support is not needed , only the support of my people , as they are the ones paying the bill . 
  unless poland would want to threaten violence if they do n't get paid . 
  sorry to break it to you , but politicians dont give a rats ass about the little guy , so i wouldnt count on any huge changes . 
  but what wonderful european values you are presenting . 
   i 'm sorry , after reading your previous post i was left with the impression that you wanted to advance the argument you did n't deserve blame for the current state of affairs . 
  if you want to retract that statement i 'll be happy to drop this line of discussion . 
  i dont understand what you mean . 
  we dont deserve the blame . 
  all the rules of us joining were made by `` your side '' , the only thing we could decide was to join or not . 
  so you cant blame us for doing something ( for example free movement ) that you offered us in the deal , if this has negative effects for your low income people , that is your elites fault . 
  that being said , this doesnt mean that both sides arent looking out for their own interests . 
  the old eu did not expand in 2004 out of the goodness of their hearts , it was beneficial to them . 
  the same way we didnt join the eu to be nice , we joined because it benefited us . 
  deals are made to benefit both sides . 
   either way are you sure you want to talk about hyprocisy to me , when poland spend years whimpering like a kicked dog about a pipeline , only to rediscover national interest the moment your own are concerned . 
  somehow you dont see what came first . 
  first countries like germany didnt show solidarity with the pipeline , but now want solidarity when its convenient to them ? 
  thats not how that works . 
   or going on and on about the depravity of the english blaming dirty foreigners ( poles ) for their sinking wages , only to turn around and go : `` victims of our invasions ? 
  in my white , christian country ? 
  i do n't think so . '', 
  im not blaming england for anything . 
  foreigners ( poles included ) did cause wages to go down for them , but this was obviously part of the deal ( meaning it did n't take a genius to know this would happen when we joined with the deal we were offered ) . 
  this wasnt acceptable for them , so they decided to leave the eu , they had every right to do so . 
  your side is the one throwing a hissy fit like a jealous ex-girlfriend .

  sort by immigrants . 
  we were 5th globally . 
  and 1th slavic country . 
  it 's not good , especially if you see who is above us . 
  id did some further analysis . 
  if we divide crime by all immigrants from given country , ** poland is on 29 place **, 
  in uk we can get true 1939 experience . 
  unforgettable memories . 
  yes, 
  fuck i care if somebody believes in god . 
  believing in church and people that lead it seems to be a main issue . 
  it could be wurst . 
  do you think this is how should it be done ? 
  i agree that question should stay on point and be civil . 
  thats all she should be hearing from ytb guy . 
  building your career should n't be main concern in those interviews . 
  it should be clearly indicated when interview is done using prefiltered list of safe questions . 
  but in the end nothing was filtered so maybe it was honest professional advice , given sadly in wrong context . 
  reason `` not to check '' only makes sense for your close ones . 
  it does n't block your future employer from checking what they can negotiate or even if they should consider your for a position . 
  so , you will be blocked personally from checking your colleges paycheck , but i do n't think your employer will care as they will use some hr person to do that . 
  of course , this can lead to rise of new service for anonymous tax checking , where some random person will check what you want for small fee . 
  i would much more prefer if people just become more open about discussing their paychecks within your personal circle . 
  either at you job or just community in general . 
  some groups do that , others do n't . 
  as for tax evasion . 
  maybe it will help detect it . 
  but if it 's only sum of money without any details , then i do n't get the purpose . 
  especially from my experience , i feel more free to share my `` good '' years . 
  but i remember times when i did n't make that much and then i would feel a little bit shame regarding my yearly gross income . 
  it probably is different in norway as they do n't have such gaps as we have here in poland . 
  if you make comfortable amount of money , you are not that envy of people that have more . 
  but it 's another topic when you try to come by , working very hard at low paying job . 
  there are lot of variables . 
  ** edit ** actually my point about negotiation problems with employer are not that valid , as you can check current employees and their salaries , and try to go for something similar or better . 
  as long as you are comfortable doing that or maybe it will just become something that people do . 
  it 's all right  have an upvote . 
  i was joking , 
  it only means that whomever made a chart had some agenda . 
  to be pure asexual , they should randomize order , to not discriminate other countries and ideas / s, 
  yeah , best thing is that actually chart they have shows exact opposite : http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-09-18/more-poles-are-now-moving-to-germany-than-the-u-k both numbers are getting lower but migration to germany was higher from 2012 . 
  it 's not sudden change . 
  i wonder what happened in 2013 . 
  did german promised every pole free beer ? 
  approved !, 
  i sadly went into rabbit hole and watched most of their favorites productions and read some books explaining how poland history is fake . 
  as an example they say that both copernicus parents were german . 
  and that 's why he was so prominent astronomer . 
  they also claim that jews declared war on germany and that 's why they were detained . 
  in general , all survivors that mention gassing were lying . 
  and there was no plan for jewish genocide . 
  in contrary , hitler was jewish nationalist and wanted to move them all to a family farm called madagascar . 
  what else . 
  polish people genocide of germans from their land . 
  polish people showed costant xenophobia and disgrace toward germany before and after ww2 . 
  despite receiving huge monetary and material support . 
  they also mention that germans never showed any sign off hate or aggression toward poles before ww2 . 
  afterwards all hate was due to assumed 50 000 german deaths as part of polish atrocities . 
  in short , imagine how world would look like if germany won ww2 . 
  they also have forum for open discussion about holohoax . 
  and yes , thats how they call it . 
  and what about milf/gilf .

  they detect when someone will have a wank , map incoming connection and blacklist it . 
  as for initial blacklisting , for science they visited each site , tried to wank to it , and if they succeeded , it was blocked . 
  sadly no . 
  the channel is managed by her ~ ~ husband ~ ~ brother . 
  both have similar theory about holocaust . 
  channel is filled with `` brave '' fight against mainstream media opinion about germany role in wwii . 
  they are quite popular among groups like stormfront . 
  another interesting [ video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okcb7u6elu4 ) is about polish death camps . 
  suddenly whole thing moves into topic of refugees for some reason and purity for europe . 
  we are so accustomed to neo nazis looking like punks . 
  but in reality whole group is indistinguishable until they open their mouths . 
  ** edit : some explanation behind video ** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clgjjf9tssa also some corrections . 
  alfred is her brother , not husband . 
  today i learned so much . 
  in addition to poland starting a ww2 . 
  germans used gas on us and jews to get rid of the lice . 
  so caring . 
  https://youtu.be/e0_bzphq7qo?t=227 and she likes to call it , 6 million lie . 
  catchy . 
  she is canadian , so of course , super nice `` abut '' it . 
  no energy , sorry . 
  yeah , red , blue and black shirt guys carry the whole thing . 
  is it about misspelled homogeneous or quality of performance , or maybe both ? 
  it 's deep night , no worries , nobody will see it , 
  i had one job :( it could be worst , homogenized . 
  good album though , listening right now . 
  household debt to income ratio may show more . 
  sadly data for 2015 is missing for a lot of countries . 
  2014 is better but still few countries droped . 
  http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/tgm/graph.do?tab=graph&amp;plugin=1&amp;pcode=tec00104&amp;language=en&amp;toolbox=data you guys like to borrow . 
  it 's probably because you feel safer then us . 
  i was brought up to hate any form of credit .

  otherwise i 'd get something like 900 euro after taxes , which is borderline insulting . 
   the problem is it sounds terrible politically . 
  ... and simply wo n't work . 
  even now common method of tax avoidance is minimizing your income tax , and instead living as one-person company . 
  it 's extended to family . 
  usually that 's enough . 
  i think you severely underestimate importance of embassies . 
  sure , who needs `` ambassador of portugal '' anyway ? 
  let 's get rid of them across the world . 
  and recall all the embassies to portugal while we 're at it . 
  leverage and safety . 
  it usually extends not only to strictly diplomats , but also support personnel as well for the same reason . 
  it would not only worsen international relations , but it would straight up make it impossible to conduct any ( at least in timely manner ) . 
  if countries stopped respecting vienna convention on diplomatic relations we 'd see massive recall of diplomatic personnel across the world . 
  seems they ran out since 2nd and 3rd abrams still had crows in desert camo . 
  `` ireland english '' i guess he 's loyalist, 
  she will be presented with agreement after she invokes a50 , not before . 
  nobody in eu will talk about uk leaving simply because it would mean uk negotiating with itself . 
  part of a50 is exclusion of leaving party from the negotiations . 
  actually it gives exactly correct picture ... only in uk and usa it means more than that . 
  hell , even in finland it means exactly that : senior management position under minister . 
   they could have grabbed a big chunk of the market no , no they could n't . 
  by the time nokia went with windows , they already were gone . 
  they moved away from symbian in late 2011 . 
  even if they went with android devices , they 'd be very much trailing . 
  if anything , they should have switched in 2008-2009 at the latest . 
  well , you 're living in one of the richest countries in the world . 
  i do n't , and even i 'm in statistically privileged position compared to vast majority of world population . 
  people often forget that . 
  thing with used cars like that is you have no idea what 's up . 
   norway has a lot of hydroelectricity though . 
  and you paid for all that with all those with fish export and cross-country skiing right ? 
  30 000 eur in poland . 
  with over 4 times lower average wage . 
  even worse scenario : both sides have money , not taste and do n't talk to each other . 
  do n't think it 's default polish state of being . 
  and yeah , i got it you 're in poland for wyd - also the reason why i 'm not in poland right now . 
  i assure you , you are loud . 
  you think you are n't but you are . 
  also , you smile . 
  family will likely not give a fuck , although there are some extremes . 
  people will stare ( or look away ) , since first you 're exotic and second : american . 
  we 're a lot more reserved and quiet . 
  it 's extremely unlikely you 're going to be harassed though . 
  the worst is likely entire narrative of smole\u0144sk ` terrorist attack ' . 
  our government , on multiple occasions - yes , after they 've been elected and while they are in power , and that includes for example our minster of defense - accused russia of killing polish president and other officials in a deliberate attack . 
  and that 's the high profile politicians . 
  low-profile ones , and media associated with pis , are even better , for example readily implicating donald tusk and angela merkel as co-conspirators in said assassination . 
  it 's top of the iceberg though . 
  pis mp recently ridiculed report that there 's significant increase in racism-inspired attacks by comparing race/ethnicity to socks color preference or soups , as if it was the same . 
  there is no such thing as political correctness here . 
  now . 
  any attack perpetrated by , say , afghani will immediately turn it upside down . 
  the lack of racism in poland , and i really think we 're mostly not racist country , is very fragile state . 
  if you really get into that most people have ` they do n't harm us , so they 're fine ' attitude . 
  if it changes , well ... it 's enough to have minority of violent people and majority of those who do n't act . 
  another thing is our politicians nowadays will happily exploit any attack to further their own popularity , and they have no pc sensibilities nor really any other inhibitions . 
  polish politician is far from what you 'd consider european politician . 
  it would n't be even close to worst thing pis said . 
   intelligence was not aware of any threat at the time given our intelligence is absolute , utter crap beyond any hope it 's not really surprising . 
   the rage if any terrorist attack would happen when pope visits would be enormous to put it mildly ... 
  if catholic event like \u015adm was hit , we 'd have politicians calling for purifying the country out of infidel scum , and probably hinting at modern crusade . 
  well , '' \u0105 '' for example is also considered separate letter in polish alphabet and i 've never seen it used . 
  in fact , i 've never seen listings deviating past the standard latin alphabet , and we 've got even more extra letters than you guys ( 32 in total vs 29 in turkish , at least as far as wiki goes ) . 
   [ \u00f6 ] you use it in the a , b , c , d , ... listings ? 
   there 's 0 % chance of that happening tomorrow ? 
  sure . 
  there 's simply no way of knowing , and there risk is there . 
  there might not be eu anymore for example , it 's a scenario you have to consider . 
  in any conflict finland might also decide to maintain its neutrality , and to do so they might get pressured into cutting any trade like that with nato countries . 
  that is actually very much a possibility even today : when given an option - cut deliveries to baltic state , or be considered belligerent in a conflict - do you really think finnish government would hesitate ? 
  they balance the line of not pissing moscow and not pissing brussels/washington/paris / berlin/london . 
  yes , it is . 
  however , finland is not a good choice for substitution . 
  sure , it 's eu member , but it 's also on border of russia 's sphere of influence . 
  it 's not nato member either . 
  given the time frame we 're talking about here ( decades ) , anything can happen . 
   i do n't see why it could n't be utilized even more because you 're substituting one dependency with another . 
  sure finland has plenty of space , but baltic states do n't . 
  yes , but consider this - i 'll abstract it for easier read - wind farm can produce 10 ` energy per hour ' . 
  you need 10 energy per hour for 12 hours a day , and only 6 for the rest of a day . 
  sounds good ? 
  well ... the energy produced by wind farm is max value : it fluctuates between 0 and 10 , and we ca n't control it upward : we ca n't really force wind to blow . 
  so , when we need 10 it produces 0 , and when we need only 6 it goes all the way up to 10 !, 
  again , sounds good - take that additional 4 and use it during 10 period . 
  except we ca n't store the energy . 
  so , when the wind produces only 4 when 10 is needed , the various other methods are used to cover it : it 's called grid balancing . 
  those methods are anything from importing energy , using stored energy ( which is extremely hard nowadays - with best method being literally pumping water , which in turn takes a lot of space ) or producing energy via other easily controllable means ( for example by burning natural gas ) . 
  oh , and because the storage is so hard now , significant portion of overall energy wind farms can potentially produce during long period is wasted ( as in : not collected ) . 
  finally , because energy is such important thing for a country nobody wants to rely on outside . 
  essentially , france wo n't let all its energy needs be covered by germany , because while it would n't be much of a problem now nobody knows if in 20 years france and germany get pissed at each other over alsace , and germany will have an ability to literally shut down your entire country . 
  similarly , poland wants to cover polish energy needs in its entirety , or at least have the ability to do so in emergency . 
  hydro is only viable in very specific location . 
  you essentially need to create a lake , usually over people 's houses , animal habitats and so on . 
  even in larger countries it 's a very hard to find a place where you actually can do it . 
  nuclear on the other hand seems to scare the shit out of people so there 's that . 
  and how exactly did you think power in turkey might change ? 
  given the faux-democratic character of turkish politics it 's not going to happen through elections . 
   big war is coming big war is coming . 
  it 's unclear when though , so there 's that .

  the first part was n't `` kac w vegas '' ( `` hangover in vegas '' ) but `` kac vegas '' ( `` vegas hangover '' ) , it 's like this special type of a hangover , which should be associated with a place _ like _ vegas . 
  and bangkok is one of those places , where crazy-ass shit can easily happen ( quality time in nana plaza ) . 
  far more nonsensical is `` szklana pu\u0142apka '' , which is a perfect title for the firs die hard movie ( seriously , it 's a great title - that skyscraper ** was ** a `` glass trap '' ) . 
  but with the second one ... also - `` orbitowanie bez cukru '' is pretty clever and `` podziemny kr\u0105g '' sounds better than `` klub walki '' ( which sounds like some lame kyokushin karate club full of five year old kids ) . 
  good translation should n't be literal . 
  in that case we 'd need bulgaria too , then we 'd be v8 !, 
  vroom !, 
  vroom !, 
  just like finland !, 
  it just would n't be relatable for polish customers . 
  if you want to sell tampons , you would n't advertise it by showing both genders equally using them , would you ? 
  98-99 % people in poland are white , half of them men . 
  i bet there would be no problem , if they 've removed white woman and inserted a black girl to advertise it in zambia ... 
   why would anybody eat coal ? 
  digestive issues ? 
  and we gave them cucumbers ( or at least german gurken comes from polish/sorbian og\u00f3rek / g\u00f3rka ) . 
  but they forgot about the new [ british anthem ] ( https://youtu.be/433owxh1pie?t=1m3s ) . 
  in this case it 's po government . 
  taboo . 
  there probably are some nudist beaches , but they 're rare . 
  changing in a locker room ( like getting completely naked in front of other people ) or being completely naked in sauna is something i have n't seen in poland . 
  we cover ourselves with towels in those situations . 
  there is no ofe money ... 
  yyyyrek is the second post-big brother film , the first one was `` gulczas a jak my\u015blisz '' and also was crap . 
  but in an amusing way , i 've seen it multiple times , it 's on par with `` the room '' as it comes for indolence . 
  and yyyyrek is even worse , and not as charming as gulczas . 
  it 's not weird . 
  poland was destroyed after the deluge - and it was also the end of total religious freedom . 
  protestants allied with sweden against poland ( not all of them , but that was the perception of loyalists ) . 
  poland was attacked by protestant sweden , protestant siebenburg/transylvania , protestant brandenburg , protestant janusz radziwi\u0142\u0142 led the anti-commonwealth forces ( he wanted lithuania for himself ) , orthodox moscow has also participated ... 
  it 's hard not to get a little paranoid if every protestant neighbour you have attacks you and destroys the country . 
  after that event we 've never recovered . 
  you do n't drink wine with dinner ? 
  or w\u00f3dka for digestion ? 
  or moonshine for courage ? 
  or beer not to get dehydrated ? 
   i was in there when there was also a group from israel . 
  groups of israeli students are the worst . 
  they have little to none respect both to the place and to poles . 
  half of the polish citizens that were murdered by nazis were ethnic poles , the other half were ethnic jews , yet israelis are in a denial ... as for s-21 tuol sleng in phnom penh - well , it 's pretty disturbing . 
  i have n't been to the killing fields though . 
  they 're buried . 
  even if they were forced and escaped the very next day after arrival - we 'd have to pay for them . 
  not culture , but common identity . 
  look at malaysia , which consists of the same ethnicities as singapore ( in different proportions ) but has higher crime rates . 
  malay supremacism is a constitutional doctrine of malaysia , [ satu malaysia ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4o5un_7jw2w&amp;ab_channel=honey1681 ) and malaysian identity are really weak . 
  ~ ~ satu ~ ~ [ one singapore ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=atzmmtyks7e&amp;ab_channel=ndpeeps ) is far stronger concept . 
  despite singapore being less democratic than malaysia ( look at their legislatures ... singapore has practically one-party system ) . 
  dude , a brigade is a brigade , not an army . 
  it 's as if you 've moaned about 10 bucks being worth 10 bucks ... and cooperation ( especially miliatary , with country that is n't in nato but is fighting against russian agression ) is n't a thing that could be done in a week , we need to create smaller units . 
  moreover - their aim is n't creating a joint army but creating an opportunity to future possibility of cooperation in case of a larger conflict . 
  it 's important to know weaknesses and strengths of your allies and friends firsthand . 
  he describes chauvinism , not nationalism . 
  nationalism argues for nation-states . 
  i 'm a nationalist to some degree ( i strongly believe that ethnic factor is the most important one in setting borders and national self-determination should be a core value in state-building ) but i 'm not a chauvinist , i do n't believe my nation is better than others . 
  matches take place 200 meters from my home . 
  i. . . do n't care that much , i see people going there ( duh ) but i do n't hear people talking about it at all . 
  handball is somewhat popular , but it 's nonexistent comparing to football and even volleyball . 
  czechia is a fine country with good industry and interesting culture . 
  calling it `` poor and backward '' is ignorant - just because their gdp per capita is lower than germany does n't mean it 's a bad place to live ( considering the events of last two years i 'd say that atm it 's a better place to live ) . 
  what mate ? 
  you 're serious ? 
  but ben kenobi was n't a sith , mate . 
  and there 's [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aifdxuro01y&amp;ab_channel=youmalyy5 ) . 
  actually , pre-war syria was a decent place with good education level ( compared to the rest of the middle east ) and okayish literacy rate . 
  situation in countires like afghanistan , yemen , and some sub-saharan states is far worse ( and most of them were british or french colonies ) . 
  http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2013-02-10/s-p-granted-top-grades-to-doomed-lehman-cdo-as-downgrades-rose http://www.reuters.com/article/us-s-p-settlement-iduskbn0l71c120150203 s&p is a criminal organization . 
  they purposefully kept ratings of companies like lb high , despite knowing they will go bankrupt . 
  polish sejm is much more interactive . 
  i 'm sorry for being lazy . 
  got it . 
  that means you 've never been in rural areas around krak\u00f3w or rzesz\u00f3w ... and there are differences between pronounciation in krak\u00f3w and warsaw . 
  kartofle is how you call potatoes in \u015al\u0105sk , grule in podhale . 
  ( source : half of my family is from \u015al\u0105sk and i grew up in zakopane ) . 
  still bordering russia ... yay ... 
  and they may say that without a strainer he becomes unrecognizable . 
  there is no direct corellation between wealth and crime . 
  the lowest crime ratings in poland are in podkarpackie and the highest in warsaw and \u015bl\u0105skie . 
  different ways of internalization of a norm . 
  japanese culture is very oriented on external factors ( losing face ) , whereas polish culture is oriented on internal factors ( it 's a sin , morally wrong ) . 
  very organized social structure and fear of ostracism is why there are so few thefts in japan ( you have to be in an organized crime structure to be a criminal in japan - and it 's everywhere , just read on judo federation and its links to organized crime ) . 
  ostracism is n't that big a deal in poland , we are pretty forgiving as people and societal norms are pretty loose and there are enviroments where stealing is n't that big a deal ( think trailer park boys ) . 
  pis had years to prepare and they did . 
  they are the strongest party in the field of think-tanks and think-tank activities . 
  `` polska wielki projekt '' was probably the biggest event organized yearly by an ngo in poland ( except for charities ) . 
  po had so many fractions that they had to please everyone . 
  that led to completely misearble ministers ( remember `` terenia '' from ministry of internal affairs ? ) . 
  i do n't agree with everything that pis does ( as a lawyer i have different opinions on penal procedure for example ) . 
  but demonizing them is useless . 
  their ideas are n't undemocratic , they 're not going to destroy our economy . 
  gazeta wyborcza 's hysteria has done more harm to our economy than actual doings of pis . 
  i thought that eurodisco is dead . 
  it seems that it 's actually ... undead . 
  my fav is bo\u017cydar - means `` god 's gift '' ( and there 's even a jew in it ) . 
  s&p is reliable ? 
  oh , so that 's why they had to pay 1.5 bln usd for one of the biggest fuck-ups in recent history ? 
  [ link ] ( http://www.reuters.com/article/us-s-p-settlement-iduskbn0l71c120150203 ), 
  yeah , i was thinking about it and i think that sources of terrorism are a crucial point , but i would n't divide them simply as internal/external . 
  bear in mind that leftist terrorism was sponsored and inspired by soviets and their allies ( like financing baader-meinhof group by stasi ) . 
  but yeah , it is worth remembering that some of those attacks were done by jihadists , some by commies and some by nationalists .

  far-left dreams and ideas shatter once faced with reality and dealing with implementation details . 
  i would just set special concessions . 
  like obligatory ** unmasking for identification ** ( = lifting it up or taking out for a moment ) in specific places ( bank , office , metro , airport etc. 
  ) , or if asked by officer of law . 
  which i think is already in force . 
  and if a woman deny it , yes - then i would fine her ( not necessarily so highly , but still ) . 
   a long , thought-out post and a short answer focused on literally 6 words out of it . 
  with some parts i agree , other i mostly answered in other posts here . 
  also , i frequently get short answers to my tl ; dr posts , so ... 
  i 'm used to it . 
   your dress sense is not more important that the country 's democratic system . 
  if freedom of a single person is limited ( as long it is n't something harmful to other people ) , that means there is less freedom ( tiny amount ) in that country . 
   i imagine many people dislike speed limits , but accept them as part of life in their country . 
  riding too fast can be harmful , actually even deadly harmful . 
  niqab is n't . 
  so then we should prosecute e.g. 
  closure monks & nuns . 
  not even talking about plain recluses/otaku . 
  exactly . 
  so niqab bans are n't really helping anyone ( except making xenophobes more comfortable ) . 
  it 's just a red herring . 
   wearing a burqua is always a voluntary choice . 
  not always , there are probably cases when woman is forced into it ( and such cases should be prosecuted ! ) . 
  but indeed , most often it 's voluntary . 
  so like it or not , it 's a personal freedom . 
  but the problem is , it does n't seem to be concerning mostly `` fresh '' immigrants . 
  i doubt if you 're right . 
  first , research ( in france , denmark , sweden ) proved most of them are citizens by birth - * ius soli * , and significant number ( 25-50 % ) even by origin - * ius sanguinis * ( white converts ) . 
  also , iran is actually a one of few muslim countries , where ** face ** veiling is rare . 
  yeah . 
  but fining & prosecuting definitely wo n't help them . 
  what if it ** is ** their country ? 
  sure , i agree such cases probably happen as well . 
  but then we should persecute ** forcing ** somebody to veil , not veiling itself . 
   then their parents born elsewhere and not integrated to the swiss society . 
  actually niqab wearing women in europe are quite often born in rather secularized and integrated families , or just plain converts , without muslim heritage . 
  for some of them it seems to be a kind of `` conflict of generations '' or `` protest against modern society '' . 
  from research made in [ denmark ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/andrewbrown/2010/mar/10/religion-islam ) :  the most fascinating figure of all , though , came from the danish researchers , who actually interviewed some of the covered women . 
  most were young , or at least under forty , and half of them were white converts . 
  i think this makes it entirely clear that in modern europe the burka is not an atavistic hangover , but a very modern gesture of disaffection from and rejection of society , which appeals to a certain kind of extreme temperament . 
  notice : half of those are converts . 
  according to another research , quarter of ~ 2k such women in france were converts as well . 
  so not only born & raised in europe , but with european origins . 
  [ relevant ] ( http://rrj.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/body-image.jpg ) ( from a similar debate in canada ) . 
  they were born there ? 
  still , it 's already working in france and belgium . 
  sneeze ? 
  and what if she does n't ? 
   it may help the situation of female muslims in europe . 
  like those who wear it on their own decision ? 
  which seems to be prevalent e.g. 
  among such women in france . 
  weird , but true . 
  hadiths do , however . 
  but that 's the thing - muslims do n't even agree on the case . 
  we ( europeans ) tend to view islam as a monolyth , but in reality it 's a patchwork of different branches and `` schools '' . 
   i 'm pretty sure it 's mostly a cultural thing . 
  not exactly , actually in europe it 's even contrary . 
  it 's an element of some `` reformation '' branches of islam , which can be roughly compared to e.g. 
  puritans . 
  what 's similar in both cases , is `` literal '' reading of holy book or writings , and extracting precise rules based on it . 
   most muslims do n't wear them actually niqab is worn by majority only in saudi arabia and yemen . 
  and of course da'esh , which is also a single place where it 's compulsory ( just like it was in taleban afghanistan or somalia under al-shabab ) . 
  on the other hand , niqab ( + burqa ) comes to 2 % . 
  lowest of all seven states . 
   same reason we ca n't walk around wearing balaclavas . 
  of course . 
  who knows , there might be a [ nuclear submarine ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/balaklava#underground_submarine_base ) underneath !, 
   yes but not burqa or niqab specifically . 
  hijab , yes . 
  few examples : [ bosnia 1930s ] ( http://image.shutterstock.com/z/stock-photo-yugoslavian-islamic-woman-in-niqab-and-burqa-carrying-basket-in-sarajevo-249572695.jpg ) , [ algeria 1900s ] ( https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/236x/6f/a5/77/6fa57748390a904b66281742c677f9be.jpg ) , [ central asia ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/19/sart_woman_wearing_a_paranja,_samarkand.jpg ) , [ ottoman macedonia ] ( http://images-00.delcampe-static.net/img_large/auction/000/094/319/951_001.jpg ) , [ late 19th c. iran ] ( https://muhajabat.files.wordpress.com/2009/12/iranwomen.jpg ) , [ india 1940 ] ( https://www.google.pl/imgres?imgurl=https%3a%2f%2fupload.wikimedia.org%2fwikipedia%2fcommons%2f2%2f2e%2fworking_committee.jpg&amp;imgrefurl=https%3a%2f%2fen.wikipedia.org%2fwiki%2fpurdah&amp;docid=cjj28e_pgmmqsm&amp;tbnid=0slrusucavelhm%3a&amp;w=458&amp;h=278&amp;hl=pl&amp;safe=images&amp;bih=513&amp;biw=1173&amp;ved=0ahukewivx5kazelnahxcwcwkhvt_b4c4zbazcb4ogzab&amp;iact=mrc&amp;uact=8 ) . 
  and some of these look actually worse ( more extreme ) than `` present '' niqab . 
  and here 's an interesting one : female ** ruler ** of one indian princely state , present at king george v coronation . 
  [ in burqa ] ( http://aligarhmovement.com/karwaan_e_aligarh/begum_sultan_jahan ) . 
   anti-mask laws are nothing new . 
  anti-mask laws with ridiculously high fines are , however . 
   burqas/niqab are rare in the muslim world and their widespread-ness is fairly new . 
  not really . 
  there was a period ( roughly 1930s-1970s , when veil was in ** retreat ** , but it was popular before . 
  however , due to globalization recently ( last ~ 30 years ) it appeared in countries , where it was n't present anywhere in past , like indonesia/malaysia or west africa . 
  and of course among 2nd , 3rd generation muslims and of course converts in europe . 
   we can thank saudi arabia for that sure , but not only . 
  popularity of muslim brotherhood in egypt was also a significant factor . 
  and there are some other organizations promoting niqab , e.g. 
  indian-originated tabligh jamaat ( very active in third world ) - which interestingly , is also rather apolitical and pacifist ( roughly something like jehovah witnesses , only muslim ) . 
  problem is that these laws are done post factum . 
  i said ** converts ** . 
  do i seriously have to explain it ? 
  i mean somebody who is e.g. 
  french , italian , polish by both birth and origin . 
  there are multiple cases of such women , and percentage of converts among niqab wearing ones is probably even bigger , than among `` regular '' muslims . 
  reason is simple : neophytes seem to be more `` zealous '' . 
  also , there is a problem of salafist/wahhabi proselytism , saudi founded mosques etc. 
  veiled women are not a problem , they are ** result ** of it . 
  you ca n't deport somebody to country which she is n't citizen of . 
  also , you would have to strip this person of her own citizenship first . 
  you seriously think wearing a tent is a crime worth it ? 
  my point : authorities should n't mess with what somebody wears ( or does n't wear ) . 
  it 's basic freedom . 
  niqab is very far from european values , but banning it is something ** opposed ** to them .

   commie blocks leave a lot of green area with trees between them i 'm all for proper , big parks for the people , but do n't try to imply that this grass serves other purpose than shitting grounds for dogs . 
  it 's just wasted space . 
  you can have dense cities within a large place . 
  and lack of public transportation causes lack of social cohesion . 
  why tax things you ca n't enforce ? 
  tax other things . 
  woah . 
  is this due to some of tradition ? 
  lol . 
  let 's make jebb as jeb bush . 
  this can continue forever . 
  makes him vp , and resigns . 
  affinity for lawful evil ? 
  german confirmed . 
  john ellis bush -  j. e. b. 
  yeah , that 's so american . 
  is it really drawing straws ? 
  for real ? 
  metro was n't priority for communists at all until they realized they need at least some makeshift public support in the 80s , after martial law . 
  of course , they also did n't destroy all of polish tram lines like they wanted too , but only lack of resources make them keep trams . 
  the developers building outside of cities is retarded and could be stopped by law , but oh well , no one cares at the government . 
  only local communities will suffer , so they do n't care . 
  you posted something taken straight from city main market . 
  was this supposed to be a serious argument ? 
  i 'm taking about modern tenements . 
  on mobile , so ca n't show you examples , but look at german cities , vienna and so on . 
  and fuck cars , cars are the scourge of modern cities . 
  they are the main reason of why us is so shitty . 
   at least the communists left decent spacing between the blocks that 's fucking retarded . 
  how is making everything far away from rest of the city good ? 
  public infrastructure works good only if buildings are dense . 
   and every development had a school , kindergarten and a doctor outpatient clinic . 
  like everywhere else , is your argument `` they did n't completely fuck this up '' ? 
   they did n't make sufficient parking lots but no one expected people having so many cars . 
  that 's the only good thing . 
  last thing we want is more cars here . 
   nowadays the blocks are crammed there is little green space , schools are few and far between , public transport is lackluster . 
  in some places , yes . 
  if you were idiot and bought new apartment outside of city proper in some kind of piaseczno , you have no one else to thank but yourself . 
  there are also examples of good developments , like xix dzielnica , developments in \u017boliborz przemys\u0142owy , and multiple smaller developments in city proper without those problems . 
   municipal planning divisions gave up and most places do n't have proper zoning plans . 
  and that 's the problem with the law . 
  it could be so good if they did n't fuck this up . 
  there was infrastructure - only for cars . 
  trams were demolished in that time , public transportation was getting trashed . 
  new developments were build far from centers . 
  new development varies in quality , but at least fills the gaps left by modernism . 
  also shitty ? 
  the difference is that then urbanism was shitty by design , today is shitty by deficiencies of law : creating monsters like bia\u0142o\u0142\u0119ka in warsaw and whole suburbanism trends . 
  why are you comparing those to individual houses and not normal european tenements ? 
  it 's not some bullshit europe vs us story . 
  100 % truth . 
  fuck modernist urbanism . 
  i do n't mind buildings . 
  the shitty urbanism that came with them was way worse . 
  trains do n't ? 
  wait what ? 
  mcd meals cost from 2.50 $ ( for discounted big mac menu ) to 5 $ for their `` deluxe '' seasonal burger menus . 
  how can it cost so much more in romania ? 
  former kim 's brother was ambassador in poland . 
  i see a one way to do it . 
  are n't stolen cars mostly used for parts ? 
  i 'm not an expert . 
  i do n't follow . 
  obviously , very many audis here . 
  99 % of them are bought used though . 
  beria was georgian too . 
  definitor not here , lol .

  selling higher quality parts for lower price than whole bundle , with less processing needed ? 
  so what now , they have to put some of the awful polish shows ? 
  i 'd pay them to not have any of those . 
  you 're comparing fillets to whole chicken - with bones and rest of the shit . 
  at least compare it to breast . 
  g\u00f3wnoburza is something from wider polish internet , not a / r/polska invention though . 
  next generation is pretty cool , they speak 100 % perfect polish and besides drunk football retards nobody has any problems with them . 
   however , you just stay inside while it 's raining . 
  and then you need to go to work or school or somewhere . 
  if it were as easy as sitting at home , it would n't be a problem . 
  thanks for the suggestion , i 'll definitely try them if i 'll have the chance . 
  unfortunately , they are not present at [ smakpiwa.pl ] ( http://www.smakpiwa.pl/ ) which is the biggest distributor of foreign craft beers in poland . 
  then 13 years of labour rule . 
  and now tories again . 
  brits have a tendency to cling to their governments . 
  yeah . 
  like in every nordic country - danish mikkeler , swedish omnipollo , estonian p\u00f5hjala ... your draconian alcohol policies at least done something good to people in other countries that can drink those great beers cheaper than locals , 
  do you use space after question mark ? 
  that feels so wrong . 
  lervig makes so fucking good beer though . 
  sippin into darkness ba is my personal favorite . 
  nope . 
  lived there for 3 years and public transportation do sucks compared to krak\u00f3w or wroc\u0142aw ( and warsaw is in the other league ) . 
  not even common ticked ? 
  come on . 
  are at most 0,01 of `` polish wealth '' . 
  compare that to 0,4 of russia . 
  not in poland . 
  i was pretty sure there was desert in the middle , [ turns out it 's some kind of drained lake ] ( https://i.gyazo.com/21dca6a9d71b2da9edd32b727405ba32.png ) . 
  why would landlords care about your employment status and how are they gon na check what are you telling them ? 
  well , 4 of those skyscrapers were build during communism .

  depending on the site , they can be rated and commented on by their customers . 
  some advertise from an apartment , some come to client 's houses . 
  see http://www.roksa.pl/pl/anonse/ for an example street prostitutes basically disappeared . 
  they exist but are very uncommon now . 
   [ i live and work in estonia ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4ckrxa/us_to_beef_up_military_presence_in_eastern_europe/d1k8rqn ) * bitching about eastern states * all my [ wat ] ( https://i.ytimg.com/vi/1ikgj5ghgm4/hqdefault.jpg ) do n't tell me your nick is n't totally random and you 're from moldova ... 
  how were you selling them ? 
  just standing somewhere ? 
  i meant that $ 3.3 k is gross pay , not that it 's gross ( as in big , huge ) . 
  without tax breaks only net matters, 
  why would it cost 300k ? 
  is wood 10x as expensive in norway ? 
  i even linked to a site selling finished houses . 
  funnily enough the parts could well be the same , most of wooden prefabricates production is for export to scandinavia ...  you polish people need to get over your prejudices about wooden houses . 
  they have no advantages except a small difference in price . 
  good for a summer house but that 's it . 
  eh , look at price , not appearances . 
  that house costs as much as an apartment 1/2 -1 / 3 the size in a medium polish city , it 's probably similar in croatia . 
  land is cheap if you 're willing to live in the sticks and that 's true everywhere . 
  the house itself seems to be made of wood ( wtf ) and looks very cheap , i guess at most $ 30k to build , probably less . 
  divide prices by 3.5 to obtain euro with vat . 
  including land , something equivalent ( distance to a small city , etc ) would cost about $ 50k . 
  so average wage in poland actually buys more op 's houses than finland 's one . 
  it should n't be too different in croatia . 
  that law seems relatively easy to ignore by driving either foreign company 's or rented/friend 's car . 
  where 's the catch ? 
  that 's gross . 
  do you have some special tax breaks for housing ? 
  it 's a civil war , and ukraine is not really a state . 
  is that really a problem ? 
  modern war is probably not going to be a months-long land campaign , and even if , with current missile technology all these factories are going to get destroyed very fast , even if they are thousands of kilometers away from the front . 
  so there 's not going to be time to manufacture too much anyway . 
  ussr was a world power . 
  russia is the ruined heir that keeps trying to live the high life on the inherited image and scraps . 
  without nuclear missiles they would n't matter and probably would n't exist . 
  they ca n't win , but their suicide attack would be very destructive . 
  they 're very similar to north korea in that regard . 
  `` you can bet ** if ** '', 
  the point of american bases in germany is n't defense * of germany * . 
  it may be easy to forget now , but federal republic of germany is an american creation with the long-term goal of making sure that germany is never going to be a threat again . 
  it does n't seem likely , but you can bet if there 's a nationalist uprising or something like that , 53k american soldiers are going to go out and start shooting . 
  russia 's gdp is 2.23 x times larger , which is indeed less than 4 , but that 's a weird way of putting it . 
  haha what . 
  nobody cares outside of greece . 
  it is n't . 
  the charge should be either automatic ( ie . 
  the prosecutor initiates it , in cases like murder ) , or requested by the victim . 
  there 's no room for the executive here . 
  in this case either erdogan/turkish ambassador or a state prosecutor should start a case . 
  instead it seems that merkel herself has to decide . 
  that 's literally how it works in dictatorships . 
  so there 's no separation of judiciary and executive in germany ? 
  huh, 
  i do n't know anything relevant about italy and romania , but yes , poland is definitely miles ahead of germany in terms of gender equality . 
  harsh laws often mean the opposite . 
  you do n't need harsh laws if there 's no problem in the first place . 
  what in the end matters is the actual social-economic reality , not laws . 
  laws against female genital mutilation are a perfect and recent example . 
  neither poland nor czech republic have any specific laws regarding the matter . 
  does that mean they are worse than ethiopia , where it 's explicitly banned ? 
  36 % of women support total abortion ban , but only 14 % of men do . 
  http://www.stopaborcji.pl/ - scroll down . 
  zero men in the two most center photos . 
  all protests i have seen were also overwhelmingly female . 
  anecdotally , most men have ` meh ' stance about abortion , but many women are absolutely fanatic about it . 
  probably because they see aborted fetuses as children to protect . 
  i guess all these women have ` internalized patriarchy ' and it 's really all male oppression . 
  so i guess you agree that more regulation , ostensibly to protect women , actually hurts them . 
  you ca n't generalize , too diverse . 
  http://europa.eu/rapid/exploit/2012/03/ip/en/i12_211.eni/pictures/10000000000002460000018cb2d8dbf8.jpg poland is practically a matriarchy in social life ( more precisely it 's mother in law with most power ) and equal in economic . 
  now czech republic discriminates women as bad as austria . 
  which is n't that surprising given their shared history , they and to a lesser extent slovaks are germanized , but they are still slavs . 
  on average , real old western culture is much , much more misogynistic . 
  well that 's what swedes wanted and that 's what they got . 
  the may * say * something else , but only actions matter . 
  if you give people an option to live comfortably on welfare obviously the overwhelming majority is going to do just that . 
  do n't worry , the box has wifi . 
  that 's actually a surprisingly small number , it means that about half is more liberal than muslim , ie . 
  they are from a muslim background , but are n't really religious . 
  media reporting is the only way a majority of people have any opinion about any other country , in every country . 
  if it 's not reported about they may know it exists somewhere ( from geography lessons ) but that 's it . 
  historical lessons are usually nearly completely forgotten on average . 
  i remember being absolutely shocked at 13 when during some historical event at school i found out the majority has no idea who stalin was . 
  that 's just how working class families raise their kids , they do n't care about their roots ( if they even know them ) and history . 
  forget about wider knowledge . 
  do n't act like it 's so different in romania . 
  i just remembered a funny situation i read somewhere , some guy on the street surprised that a girl was romanian because she was white . 
  that 's a fast way to educate random people . 
  no , the ` scientists ' themselves just want money and recognition . 
  nobody would care about climatologists without some sort of climate crisis , so obviously they manufacture one . 
  that 's all there is to it . 
  politicians started supporting the idea once they realized that global warming is a great way to sell another tax to the public . 
  co2 limits have the opposite effect , they actually slow transition into renewable energy . 
  what actually happens is that energy heavy production just moves to other countries , where there are no co2 limits and even actual pollution is ( or was ) ok , like china . 
  not only is this production more inefficient due to lower technology , but then you burn even more fossil fuels to transport the stuff back . 
  this in turn lowers energy usage in developed countries which makes additional energy production redundant , decreasing sensible investments . 
  thankfully china now achieved the point where it 's actually economical to use solar panels ( mostly due to actual pollution ) and as such they are leaders in developing the technology . 
  eu and german politics slowed the worldwide transition by at least a decade . 
  [ did you know that import tariffs on chinese solar panels can be as high as 70 % ] ( http://www.wsj.com/articles/eu-moves-against-three-chinese-solar-panel-makers-1433497822 ) ? 
  there are also minimum ( ! ), 
  prices .

  without them the building would be nice but forgettable to many . 
  with them it can be an eyesore to some people . 
  not to me , to be honest although i do admit these two elements could be much shorter . 
  well , it 's not a finished building so it does n't count . 
  swedish !, 
  and portuguese maybe . 
  but swedish . 
  mmmm . 
  poland : pros : i honestly think it 's a safe country . 
  maybe i have a non-punchable face or just mix with the background . 
  i do n't know . 
  but i never feel threatened by anyone . 
  be-a-utiful women . 
  nice nature . 
  people will not consider you a nazi/racist for voicing your negative opinion about immigration or whatever . 
  unless , of course , you are an actual neo-nazi or an ardent racist/antisemite . 
  then people will keep an eye on you . 
  robert lewandowski seems to be getting better and better . 
  cons : not much money compared to countries to the west while having the same prices as them . 
  general rudeness of people in the street , automatic assumption that other people are out to get you/hurt you/rob you in some way . 
  communist-era buildings are ugly . 
  many new buildings are ugly too . 
  the cities are often a mess because of out-of-control advertising that is * everywhere * . 
  not sure if joking, 
  i like it but poland has never been predominantly protestant in any of its parts . 
  also , apparently we are rich now ? 
  cool !, 
  i 'm surprised our number is so high . 
  i 'm being serious . 
  why would they need it ? 
  is there anything bad about going to a school full of immigrants ? 
  i thought denmark is a really progressive country ? 
  why do they have such a racist tool to segregate people ? 
  / s ( or no / s , i 'm confused about this idea ), 
  come to think of it , the worst pubs i 've ever seen here in poland were all flat roof pubs . 
  is this how we can easily spot them all over europe ? 
  certain part of europe . 
  if you do , you should make yourself heard . 
  here in poland there is a vast amount of information about people from western and northern europe who support the influx of immigrants and immigration but those who oppose it are usually mentioned along with neo-nazis and the like . 
  we have both types here in poland but vans seem to be used more often to transport bodies e.g. 
  from accident/hospitals , while hearses are used for funerals, 
  we are above austria , finland , portugal and luxembourg . 
  wow .

  i do n't see why you 're downvoted . 
  in our times mentioning the bible does n't help you at all when discussing social issues in the media . 
  this is insane . 
  you know , i 've always thought that russians know * perfectly * well what is happening in the world 's economy . 
  they do n't reject it , they just do n't disclose it to the public . 
  instead , they choose to go for their long-term image among the society ( which is extremely isolated from the rest of the world if you think outside st petersburg and moscow ) and politics , pretending to handle the situation they know is getting out of hand . 
  this is short-sighted but lets their leaders remain in power . 
  tl ; dr : it is naive to think that people who came to power in the largest country in the world are stupid . 
  this is amazing . 
  i hoped we would be . 
  lewandowski plays against and with the best german players every week . 
  this is bound to influence his playing style and it can come in handy during the euro . 
  wow , this actually looks quite nice . 
  personally i would open it and make some coffee so we could taste them . 
  i would also assume the rest of it is for me to keep and eat on my own . 
  i 've never thought i would feel sorry for anyone living in france . 
  yet 8000 $ is really low . 
  same in poland . 
  at first i sighed since 16983 $ a year is out of reach for most poles but come to think of it 1415 $ a month must be a really low salary in norway . 
  ah , yes . 
  ireland . 
  you do love to write , do n't you . 
  huh . 
  flow . 
  brb moving to estonia, 
  are they heavy ? 
  i 've never thought of them as uncomfortable because of skin irritation but rather because of their weight . 
  and this is a plausible explanation too . 
  still , the opposition she faces could work as an excuse for her to back down which she still does n't choose to do . 
  my guess is she knows something we do n't and feels horribly guilty . 
  maybe german intelligence did something in syria/middle east that made the situation worse or resulted in deaths of many people ? 
  maybe she feels the west owes the east something ? 
  or she feels she needs to assert her dominance in the german government ? 
  all in all , it 's definitely a personal matter for her at this point . 
  country : poland favourite neighbour : germany least favourite neighbour : russia, 
  this just can not lead to anything good . 
  for the record , any kind of terrorism is ** extremely ** uncommon in poland . 
  hence the false-flag theories since there is an antiterrorism law being designed and discussed right now . 
  in poland it 's more about the value of the land rather than the building which is on it . 
  so very often run-down houses from the 70s can cost well in excess of a million z\u0142otys because they are in a nice place .

  it 's one of the poorest polish cities but the buildings are clean and grass is nice .

  i started learning english in a more systematic way at the age of 10 . 
  before that i watched english-language cartoons on cartoon network ( we did n't have a polish version of the channel in the 90s ) and i distincly remember watching sesame street and learning how to count to 12 ( not 10 ) because the numbers were put in a song i liked . 
  after i turned 10 i was learning english in a number of ways in addition to that systematic , school education that i mentioned earlier , at first by playing games , then listening to music and finally adding watching films with subtitles to listening to even more english-language songs . 
  the cure , depeche mode , the smiths were my favorites in junior high and they all put heavy emphasis on the lyrics ( especially the smiths ) so i wanted to understand them .

  refrain from the use of nuclear arms against ukraine . 
  consult with one another if questions arise regarding these commitments . 
  because russia has broken all of the non-nuclear ones , and violated # 3 * long * before maidan . 
  budapest was broken when russia 's puppet regime was overthrown ? 
  please . 
  unlike in crimea , where under military occupation parliament was dissolved and a man who took less than 5 % of the previous vote was put in charge , with yanukovych it was done according to the constitution . 
  he was impeached , including by members of his own party , and the second in line according to law took over . 
  elections were called for , and given ample time to prepare . 
  or should have any say whatsoever in what neighboring countries buy and from who, 
  well , they 've been getting closer to turkey recently , especially with turkey 's frustration with the lack of progress with eu integration . 
  their continued oppression of tatars in the crimea should have turned turkey off to warming relations with russia , but so far that has n't happened . 
  you must not know any ukrainians or tatars , then . 
  yeah , they totally misspelled `` tourists '', 
  meh , i 've gone through agencies . 
  you do get the ease that the flight is chartered , hotels and transportation are prepared , as well as any tours/sightseeing . 
  it 's also all handled in your native language , and you have representatives helping you out . 
  the solid agencies have financial backing and years of experience . 
  the newer ones are the ones that fail , that offer bottom of the barrel prices , and have nothing to fall back on . 
  chill , the gas is probably just on vacation . 
  i do n't recall annexations , champ . 
  plus , if you want to play history , why limit yourself to 100 years ? 
  the ukrainian identity has existed much longer , despite what russia claims . 
  furthermore , the east slavs themselves came out of kiev . 
  if you want to go back far enough , moscow should turn itself over to kiev . 
  but then again , that 's ridiculous , right ? 
  so why not at least keep these current parties beholden to the agreements they 've signed in recent memory . 
  like russia accepting ukraine 's borders as they were , before invasion ? 
  or does russia just get free reign to do whatever they want , whenever they want , because whataboutism ? 
  sure you can . 
  russia and the united states are not peers , let alone russia and nato . 
  russia is an autocratic petro-state with an economy the size of italy 's . 
  i understand their frustration , and their want to punch above their weight in international relations , but they have no justification to do so . 
  crimea is more complex ? 
  no , it 's very simple . 
  russia invaded , occupied , and annexed part of their neighbor . 
  remind me when nato did that last . 
  `` creeping of nato '' . 
  russia has no claim of dominion over their former satellite states , and if they want to join the west , the eu , and nato , they have every right to do so . 
  or at least they should , without fear of military intervention from their former overlords . 
  they 're sourcing [ zvezda tv ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/zvezda_%28tv_channel%29 ), 
  some certainly do . 
  but not all have recently invaded , occupied and annexed parts of their neighbors .

  time for full nato membership , 
  they 've been wanting to for the longest time ? 
  but the west prevented them ? 
  what about the years of voting that said they did n't ?

  you guys are n't even trying any more . 
  recently ? 
  heat ? 
  are you even being serious ? 
  the bbc then asked what it said was a group of russian journalists in the area about the story . 
  `` she [ the 10-year-old shelling victim ] does n't exist , '' one tells the bbc journalist , adding that they `` had to broadcast [ the story ] , '' without elaborating . 
  yeah , of all of the different angles , that 's the hardest one for me to complain about . 
  mom 's doing a good job balancing being the de-facto leader of europe , and kicking russia every so often without provoking them too bad . 
  the sanctions are in response to russian intervention in east ukraine , though . 
  yes , but the comments from people not reading the article are a fantastic insight into various mindsets . 
  that wo n't happen . 
  they wo n't abandon the sanctions . 
  it 's just one analysts opinion , and it 's because the countries in question are mostly economically dependent on russia , or in shitty economic positions . 
   well , hitler was right about danzig . 
  that 's * literally * the first thing he wrote . 
  and during those times , poles were also there . 
  150 years after the teutonic knights took the city , it went * back * into polish hands . 
  but , yeah , good work trying to support hitler 's ideas . 
  are you trolling or do you not see a difference between celts in milan and poles in gdansk ?

  before you whine that it 's euromaidanpress , they address your concerns :  note . 
  everything we publish in the section the naked truth is dead serious and , unlike our usual propaganda and lies , true . 
  it should be taken literally . 
  video showing comparison of two speeches on shuster live tv show subtitled by voices of ukraine . 
  not my losses, 
  it 's just under occupation, 
  it * is * ukraine, 
  that was point one , 
  not according to the ecj ... 
  also , each night costs more than the last on account of the imploding economy . 
  what you just said confirms eu legal supremacy . 
  accept it or leave the union . 
   depending on the constitutional tradition of member states , different solutions have been developed to adapt questions of incompatibility between national law and eu law to one another . 
  union law is accepted as having supremacy over the law of member states , but not all member states share the ecj 's analysis of why eu law takes precedence over national law when there is a conflict . 
  just like us states may complain about federal supremacy , it does n't change the fact that federal law supersedes . 
  [ of course it does ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/supremacy_%28european_union_law%29 ) . 
  the countries can argue otherwise , but that 's the idea of the eu . 
  oh , i dunno  i imagine there is though , or that it would simply fall under freedom of speech protections . 
  because romania is part of the european union , and european union law supersedes national law ... 
  i 'd imagine eu law would nullify that anyway ? 
  [ what can be asserted without evidence can be dismissed without evidence ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hitchens%27s_razor ) . 
  and regardless , it 's all in ukraine . 
  similar laws to russia would n't exactly be a shocker . 
  do n't forget the eu separatism growing throughout the union, 
  what other countries ? 
  [ hurr durr ] ( http://i.imgur.com/idyevdg.gif ) , if it 's not kremlin-funded , it 's propaganda, 
  it 's a great place , but i 'll be moving out into the countryside soon enough . 
  traffic and pollution are terrible .

  he tod us he does n't do drugs , and it is hard to get them downtown . 
  worry not about poland , when putin completes his masterpiece of changing russia into even more shithole than it is , you can go and heil him more . 
  we have a lot of knowledge about partitioning , that is right , what is important is to have the partition with master boot record, 
  likewise mr beaten dog , likewise, 
   you do n't have any facts about belarusians being famous prostitutes in britain . 
  neither you do about toilet cleaning , i hope we settled this  kremlin propaganda ? 
  official un information about refugees . 
  ukraine is close to the default and living conditions is even worse than in greece . 
  saakashvili , former president of georgia , new governor of odessa 's oblast ' said that ukraine needs 20 years to get back to yanukovich 's living standard . 
  ukraine would default with or without yanukovitch , problem with him was he and his lackeys were such thieves they cut the tree they were sitting on . 
  what do you think forced folks out on maidan !? 
  good jobs and warm food at home !? 
  think logically for a second , how desperate one has to be to live on square for month during winter . 
  deal :p, 
  well if you consider that most of this land is undeveloped desert , places around you with roads , factories and , um peapole , start to look tasty :p, 
  hey hey , we expect a fair piece of that cake !, 
  i am sure they will , especially ones from spain or portugal . 
  believe me or not but some of them even end up here for work . 
  pretty funny you are , tehre are certainly more belarusians that stay in pl than the opposite , as for rest of your failed arguments :  and since polish people famous for being good toilet cleaners in britain you need a legal work permit to do that , this is why belarusains are famous prostitutes in britain  and your position is definitely retarded because i am definitely in a position of critisizing such attitude towards this awful war . 
  your position is retarded , because you do not criticize the war , you repeat kremlin propaganda , completely failing to understand why there is war in first place . 
  i do n't blame you tho , after all those years of living under a boot , you all behave like beaten dogs , getting back to same master because he feeds you , to afraid to start living on your own . 
  from perspective of a country that accepts every single of you poor bastards , i will tell you this : you will live in poverty and lie as long as you gladly turn your butts towards east and spread your buttocks , accepting rubles for it to keep your joke of economy afloat . 
  and i will still help all of your funny students around here , to get off your soviet mentality , and get something else to wear than black sweater . 
  you definately are in position to criticize you know . 
  you are not the brightest kid are you ... 
  it seems that you are commentign but you do n't know or understand whta , you certailn good at finding typso howerve , so have fun . 
  yes , yes i am sorry , you can certainly go and listen unbiased opinion on how russia is not fueling the conflict on / r/russia , but regardless to what extent you wish to lie to yourself , if not for russia , whole thing would have been over year ago . 
  there is plenty of press on the subject , so you can go and make yourself fammiliar with it . 
  on top of that , when putin decides to roll through moldova and take a part of romania , i will be cheering with you . 
  please go support russian imperialism somwhere else, 
  pretty funny , reading through some comments , i watch every day in the news here how another thousands of pepole die in donbass cought in the corossfire , yet you post a shell picutre and somehow folks get crescendo of hysteric comments with some hippie crap . 
  what the hell is wrong with you ? 
  do you think they only fight every wednesdey 9-7 ? 
  i also do n't uderstand what is the commotion caused by artillery shell , they fire those at each other since april 2014 . 
  dude just check ones comments before you start discussion , i see your effort is wasted here, 
  better ask all those christian missionaries who teach birth control beyond calendar is heavy sin , if they feel at least a little bit guilty about it . 
  uk gets bad press form trying to reject the eu nations migrants, 
  russia these days is a superjoke with nukes , neither their economy nor the population make them superpower anymore .

  dude , your comments section has 1000000000000000000000 repetitions of words `` russia '' `` proof '' and `` propaganda '' , go earn your dollars on / r/worldpolitics, 
  i honestly do n't see how this kind of behavior is big news , i would not expect them to publicly admit that there is a substitute medicine with the same active substance for 15 % less . 
  this is common practice for big business . 
  damn those polish , so eager to go to uk / s, 
  you know , russia has every mean to end this conflict , stop it if you care so much . 
  whats wrong about it ? 
  do not feed the troll , this is a right-wing anti-everything guy , he will smash you with his blunt arguments regardless the topic, 
  because cameron is in the fight , now first to back off will ` loose ' and the one that stays will ` win ' . 
  what actually solves the problem is not so important . 
  why ? 
  imagine that headline `` cameron looses fight against merkel '', 
  i do n't think that the brain drain is so bad these days , lots of my colleagues ( engineers , scientists etc ) have recently started to return home . 
  bulk of emigration is minor jobs , and it will be years before we can fill the gap enough to pull these guys back in , not to mention that ther might be other nations willing to fill these positions , leaving the emigrants on thin ice . 
  you do [ this ] ( http://culture.pl/en/article/eu-certified-regional-products-from-the-heart-of-poland ) in order to promote your stuff , works like a charm . 
  lol no , i could not find anything on top of my head , then i found [ this ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/poland%e2%80%93serbia_relations ) and it seems we 've been getting along nicely, 
  oh if you go by these standards then 1 ) germans - our earliest arch enemy 2 ) russians 3 ) austrians - partitions ( also see russians ) there would be few more to squeeze on the list , depending on which border are you closer to . 
  western poland hates eastern poland with passion and vice versa , our politicians have seen to it . 
  plese go ahead and list me pis acheavments during their rule, 
  please , do n't be silly , they exorcised the presidential palace . 
  problem with pis that it is their politics , they are all banners , no real deal when they get in power . 
  i am old enough to remember that and i am far from being hysteric . 
  it just seems some young folks need to learn their lesson , problem is they will not bear the costs . 
  nah it is not that bad , pis resembles more of orban and his party than le-pen . 
  their main issue is that they really want to rule , but ca n't really handle the country once they get in power . 
  this is why they only lasted 2 years last time they were ruling party . 
  kukiz is a retard , he only appeals to folks who want to ` fight the system ' without any idea what the system should be once the old is gone . 
  either you are too young or too brainwashed to remember superb trio of pis , lpr and famed ` samoobrona ` directing the non-stop orchestra of hysteria , belief that it will be different this time is naive - there are no new politicians in pis , and they will be eurskeptic if church tells them to . 
   also to pictures opposition as `` anti european '' is a typical , primitive simplification especially if they supported acession . 
  i guess if you have a different opinion on internal eu policies you just have to be an `` eurosceptic '' and just a bad guy overall . 
  [ this about `` different views on eu '' ] ( http://natemat.pl/85321,pis-manifestuje-w-rocznice-stanu-wojennego-nie-chcemy-niemieckiej-unii-europejskiej-koncentracion-lager-europa ), 
  wait until pis wins the elections by the end of the year . 
  well you can have fun paying for duda promises from your salary in the meantime, 
  i am not aggressive , i am simply trying to understand how can you vote for someone who is not only not representing your views , he stated openly he would oppose them . 
  i wish you no harm either . 
  sorry-whom did you vote for ? 
  was that not the ubercatholic lawyer from krakow , who can now veto over everything that would not fit his view of things , because they are different from jp2 teachings ? 
  but he can now veto over every pro-lgbt legislation parliment could pass , becase `` episcopate has told him so '' , but after all , he is saint because he is lawyer from krakow . 
  very good you only listened to that `` right '' propaganda , not the bad one , if you are really atheist pro lgbt , you surely chose the right person to represent you, 
  you are only homophobic , anti in-vitro katholic in that case . 
  not a very different pedigree . 
  not if you skipped your thai boxing lessons, 
  yup , you grasped the sense of it perfectly, 
  given the ongoing presidential elections , i feel obliged to educate you on [ how we vote in poland . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nymiywppql4 ), 
  you are taking this out of context , which streches more than one post . 
  i never said that policeman should not be punished , there msut be investigation and fair trial , it is easy to jump into conclusions having on-side of story and 1 min of video , but i guess you 're just this type of guy . 
  of course guy got beaten because policeman had a bad day . 
  i think it is pointless to continue this argument , so spare me a reply . 
  no it is not my argument , i wonder where did you read that ? 
  you on the contrary claim `` because he is a policeman , he will not hit me '' is plain stupidity , every policeman is human , and can get violent . 
  on top of all that , when you are with 2 kids and elderly dude , you do n't pick a fight with bullies with clubs . 
  i am really not trying to justify this violence , and i do think that police officer should have kept his cool , regardless if there were slurs or not . 
  he should be punished for his actions , which does not mean he does not deserve to be trialed fairly , and all the circumstances should be taken into account ok ? 
  what i find strange tho is the fact that after first hit the policeman shields his weapon as if this was all over , i wander what has happened when camera was showing the boy , that caused this dude to get beaten up seriously . 
  well you must have failed all history lesson at school , you also must believe that all folks are dumb except for your enlightened person . 
  truth about life my kid is that people rarely resort to violence , unless provoked and in all such incidents the truth usually lies between arguments of one and the other side . 
  i become tired by explaining i am not justifying the police , but i really am not , i simply try not to bash or hate anyone , based on 1 min movie without voice , but you know better it seems . 
  i am jumping because you are jumping , my argument should simply being that should the guy not have an argument with police , the incident could be avoided , this does not make this his fault , or takes the responsibility off the police officer . 
  also what is strange , you can see clearly after guy was hit and put to the ground , the police officer is putting his weapon away , so why the guy gets beaten up after that ? 
  so you have n't been in a riot , a tense public demonstration , a football game or any other potentially violent situation , but this does not stop you from being on-sided , completely rejecting all arguments based on your own lack of experience , nice !, 
  ah so you would stand up to a potential 3v1 with your kids at the line ?

  i would give the best government award to `` eu regulations '' , since every government since 93 ' was involved in implementing them they had much less chance to fuck up significantly . 
  this helped a lot with removing a lot of the common corruption and given some frameworks and good examples for laws . 
  well the part in poland is lakes and poor people . 
  as long as it 's separated from brandenburg . 
  all problems started when they joined together . 
  unless you happened to live in chechenya , nagorno-karabach , ossetia , abchazia , tajikistan and that 's just the wars . 
  baltics had some violence too , not mentioning the putsch attempt in moscow . 
   you find people who are already willing to do it , and then back them so they succeed . 
  problem is that usually they do n't succeed and by helping them when they would not have acted alone you are part of whatever happens to them later . 
  the fact that they volunteer does make a difference but does not make the decision clear cut . 
  that is a heavy burden that i do n't see a lot of people in europe willing to take on themselves . 
   we need something we ca n't buy with money , or force with guns : genuine belief and alliance . 
  every intelligence agency prefers agents doing it for the idea :d .  as a civilization , we have left such people to their fate . 
  in ukraine , in turkey , in egypt . 
  simply because we are either unable or unwilling to play the game . 
  we are both . 
  also more vigorous actions will most likely be seen by the regimes and anti-liberal groups there as acts of war . 
  and quite correctly . 
  after all it is meant to destroy their current state . 
  i believe we do need a strategy for the ideological struggle that comes . 
  i also have a sad suspicion that there is not a clear majority that would stand in some unified front to pursue one . 
   liberal and idealistic does n't automatically mean gormless and squeamish i think more in categories `` are your utilitarian enough to sacrifice other people for the greater good '' . 
  and if the answer is yes then why not do it for a benevolent dictatorship since you already compromised on freedom of other people from the start . 
   the weekend protestors and middle class slacktivists that define modern liberalism are a shadow on the wall , compared to the candles that held the fire . 
  truth be told the injustices present today in europe in most places are a far cry from the ancient regime , even the worst places are better . 
  they might turn for the worse and then we will probably see a return of freedom fighters but we are not there yet . 
  never said it was a mistake , just not something easy , and you need to convince other people you need to do it . 
  not mentioning that potential agents having liberal democratic ideals and the talent ( and will ) for turning people in other countries into assets is not a common combination . 
  well part of that is already done through grants for groups promoting transparency , democracy etc. 
  why do you think all the autocrats have a hard on for closing ngo 's . 
  for a more active version of this to make sense you need to offer a lot of help to those people , and by doing that you basically made all the conspiracy idiots theories come true . 
  that 's a big step to take . 
  how can you tell these are good spots ? 
  warfare is as strong word , but you ca n't deny to being a consumer of amarican media a thus having your worldview inadvertently influenced by it . 
  it 's what russia uses on the russian speaking populations in the baltics , belarus and ukraine , they see the world shaped by the views of russian media . 
  it 's what the west was doing during all of the cold war with radio free europe and now with radio liberty . 
  neither unfortunately leads to healthy critical thinking since it 's a skill very hard to develop without ( or even with ) support from the education system and your surroundings . 
  distrusting everything is different from skepticism and critical thinking . 
  basically if everything is equally wrong people tend to believe the last thing they heard . 
   in the form of a far more generous loan to yanukovych i guess people in ukraine did n't expect to see any of it that . 
  russia did n't offer prosperity to them , it bribed their kleptocrat . 
   it was naive to expect that russia would be fine with risking to lose its main military base to an enemy alliance . 
  i do n't expect ukraine being fine with being kept poor by what russia expects . 
   the west threatened to move its military alliance all the way to russia 's border , ukraine expressed a willingness to talk about joining nato . 
  instead of offering better protection for ukraine and better economic terms russia responded with violence . 
  russia is a shit partner for countries unless you are a dictator trying to stay in power against your population or armenia ( god know why they get the lucky straw but nagorno karabah is a rare example of russian positive influence on it 's neighbors that stopped bloodshed instead of increasing it ) . 
  no wonder almost every russian ally tries to get out as fast as they can . 
  personally i think that nato should not have lead ukraine on and developed another way to work with them that included also cooperation with russia for the benefit of ukraine . 
  but neither side cared so we ended up with crime . 
   third hand smoking . 
  what 's that ? 
   by killing them all . 
  i thought they where doing it themselves, 
  you ca n't compare a whole continent divide by 2 mountain ranges with countries whose borders evolved through history to be wholly contained by natural barriers . 
  europe as a whole is also multipolar . 
  look a this map , the us population is also concentrated in a few highly urbanized areas . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:mapofemergingusmegaregions.png just that they are bigger and more integrated between state lines , something only possible in europe recently ( yet they are examples like basically the whole benelux and now kopenhagen-malmo ) the rest of the country is comparatively sparsely populated with state capitals running under 100k . 
  you have to correct for distance to serves, 
  i 've heard the art direction was worse in md , i 've yet to play ( though it is on my list ) . 
  so it 's not the map that 's old it 's you :d, 
  it does have separate signals ( multiple ones actually some encrypted some not ) , it just does n't have the the ability to turn off the open ones anymore in new satellites like they did before . 
   maybe europeans really are infallible and so enlightened they never commit crimes . 
  i do n't think that anybody would argue they do n't deserved to be detained ( and judged ) . 
  just that they deserve the same legal process any other legal resident in the uk has instead of some semi criminal administrative procedure . 
  i do n't really care and did n't read the article i just saw a opening for a joke :d, 
  think of all the east european weeaboos going there . 
  well to be hones de : hr had one of greatest art directions in the architecture and fashion departments in the last few years .

  i would say once all your viable political opponents end up in jail or dead that that you qualify for dictator . 
  the fascist part might be too much , it seemed about 5 years ago that he was embracing it but it look like he just used the fascist and neonazis as cannon fodder and put the rest in jail . 
   his not really a dictator as he has the support of a large majority of the population those things are not mutually exclusive . 
  all of those are so bad that every eurosceptic should think twice because you can negotiate with brussels but the brain cancers caused once these hit mainstream media will be inoperable . 
  they have an authoritarian oligarchy which is safer to live in ( comparatively to the 90 's ) and higher qol then in the 1990 's . 
  i 've seen a quote about taking `` parts of it '' which is not exactly surprising since a lot of it was based on or heavily influenced by the uk but the problem is reviewing the body of laws ( i 've seen estimates it will take the civil service 5-10 years to do that ) . 
  but the quote about leaving whether a deal is struck or not might point to a `` fuck it , we 're doing it live '' solution to that problem . 
  russia had a go at liberalism and and it ended up with a criminal oligarchy and great decline in qol . 
  they are afraid to try it again . 
  only if you take the bulk of eu regulations into uk law wholesale and start removing them one by one over the years . 
  lawyers will make good living with unclear laws or ones referencing eu institutions for years .

  in fact some ( probably many ) poles were anti-semitic , some of them murdered jews because they want to grab their property ( but i 'm not sure that they have done it for anti-semitic reason or for easy money only - if pole had killed another pole in order to grab his property it is simple crime - if pole had killed jew - it is anti-semitic motivated act ) . 
  i do n't want to whitewash criminals but such statements as `` poles murdered jews '' suggest something more than describing that some criminals committed such things . 
  statement of polish government in exile and underground state was clear : supporting germans in their atrocities against jews was not allowed . 
  see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/szmalcownik some people ( also here ) really want to say `` hey poles , what about your nazi history '' - there was no nazi history , only individual persons which were condemned be both government in exile and communist regime . 
   that does n't make a lot of sense . 
  to be honest : all actions of germans then did n't make a lot of sense . 
   let me remind you that poles murdered jews after the war in actual massacres because they feared having to return stolen property . 
  and jews murdered poles after the war because they feared that poles will resist new occupation . 
  the same in poland - some add also `` folkswagen '' and `` folfo '', 
  surprisingly you will fit in 500 . 
  there is no place on rear seats and no trunk but on front seat there would be no problem even for ~ 190cm tall people . 
  that was n't overstatement . 
  usually `` only '' entire family was killed by germans but there were also actions when whole village was killed and all buildings were set on fire . 
  it was done for showing others that hiding jews is not a good idea . 
  brutalism has its lovers and haters .

   but that would make sense if there was a better nutella on the shelves . 
  nutella is generally sugar mixed with margarine .

  in case of nutella-like spreads it is possible . 
  i 'm not expert , but i like e.g this one : https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/99/glass_of_k%c3%b6stritzer_schwarzbier.jpg/220px-glass_of_k%c3%b6stritzer_schwarzbier.jpg, 
  no , no , no . 
  white cheese looks like this : http://www.wrp.pl/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/twarog ^ ^ / s, 
  it 's nothing strange . 
  poles are known for overstay in us and to work illegally there . 
  americans have ( or to be more correct had as illegal work in us after joining common market in eu is not so popular as before ) a valid reason not to let all poles in . 
  the problem is that us guys make everything to disgrace persons which apply for a visa ( questions like ` are you a terrorist ' are mandatory to respond ) . 
  the second problem ( in my opinion bigger ) is that there is consensus in poland ( almost all politicians , mainstream media no matter who they support ) that usa is our ally . 
  usa is not our ally , was n't and will not be . 
  $ 160 per person + about $ 6 per giving passport back ( this can be avoided but you have to go to the consulate once again hundreds of kms ) . 
  i have 3 persons family , so the total cost is about $ 500 . 
  for me personally this is the main point . 
  if they want to have these visas , they could have them . 
  but if i think about getting visas , paying us$ 500 , making hundreds kms in order to meet some guy who does nothing ( as visa is granted based on questionnaire sent before this meeting ) i take another destination as holiday trip and that 's all . 
  in this case they want to have the same level of protection in every country in order to avoid `` security competition '' . 
  in poland we have constant discussion about domination of `` culture and science palace '' on warsaw 's landscape . 
  here i see that this building has dominant place in europe also . 
  nothing to compete .

   for example , if goldstar decides to produce flat screen tvs in europe , it will build a plant in poland rather than ukraine even if wages are three times higher in poland , because it is far more advantageous to produce inside the single market . 
  they build tvs in europe and yes , it is in poland . 
  economic immigrants - yes , we should let them in . 
  ofc only if they accept our culture . 
  do you think that only english has such phrase as `` half of '' ? 
  i will disappoint you - it 's common in other european languages . 
  the term ` austrian ' describing nation exists on a broad scale only after 1945 so german .

  very easy to distinguish / s, 
  of course there is a difference . 
  slap does n't harm child as much as beating . 
  but it harms so it should be banned . 
  it is also other side of problem . 
  in poland in early 80 's there was a case when small child was regularly beaten by father and mother-in-law . 
  as `` light beating '' or slapping was not considered as something bad in polish society then there was no simply possibility to avoid what happened - child was beaten to death . 
   state ownership of corporations is the preferred model of capitalism now it 's normal thing in these socialist western european countries , so what 's the problem ? 
  everybody knows it .

   eventually the polish hairdresser will start earning 20 euros per service just like his german peer , even though his business did n't do much to propell the growth of his country 's economy . 
  every service can propell the growth of economy . 
  it 's only a matter of size and worth ( price ) . 
  productivity is n't independent indicator . 
  it 's connected to gdp , wages , prices etc. 
  as current world economy is based on services it 's meaning is not the same as in industry epoch . 
  simple example : some guy goes to the hairdresser . 
  after 30 minutes polish one gets 20pln , in the same situation german one gets 20eur . 
  who is more productive ? 
  of course german one . 
  what to do in order to have productivity growth ? 
  rise the price - but doing so polish one looses his competitiveness . 
  i remember official polish ads from afair 2015 - we are hard working people with minimum wages so come and use it . 
  no , no , no . 
  ` classic ' potato pancakes are served with sour cream . 
  some people eat them with sugar but it is not so popular . 
  ` hungarian style ' potato pancakes are with goulash alike sauce .

  and from what i hear they ca n't act like that in front of their uk colleagues . 
  my client told me he likes to work with us , because we do n't give too much fucks . 
  can confirm, 
  we 're one of the most homogeneous country in europe . 
  foreign citizens make up 0.3 % of the population . 
  97.7 % are ethnic polish . 
  others are mostly from german , belarus or ukrainian descendants . 
  94.5 % of the population declares to be christian ( while 3.1 % declare to be atheist and 2.2 % did n't declare anything - that leaves 0.2 % for other religions ) . 
  and we 're all white . 
  to the point where me being from small town visiting big city twice in a year i 've never seen a black person before i hit maybe 15th birthday . 
  i did n't move a long way , but i could still achieve the same you 're talking about - independent , transition , avoid nosy parents . 
  i moved 70 km away to pozna\u0144 . 
  very few people would consider moving to warsaw a better idea , because the warsaw unis are n't consider better - it 's mostly at the same level if you take the best schools in biggest polish cities . 
  70 km is far enough if you consider it 's an hour drive by car , 2 hours by bus back then and no train connection . 
  cost of gasoline is much higher than in us and the wages are 3 times less , so parents wo n't bother you too much - it 's too far and too costly . 
  many students back in my years would still go every week or two at the beginning to let mama do the laundry ( not many students had washing machine back then in their apartments , although it 's common in europe to have one at your place ) and bring back food made by parents . 
  i 'd say it was pretty common like that - people from my town mostly choosing pozna\u0144 , some of them wroc\u0142aw , very few something else . 
  reasons same probably - no parents , many parties , leaving with friends or some nice people in one flat or dorms . 
  i had a great time back then . 
  i 've chosen poor specialization , because i was n't thinking about money back then . 
  i graduated , but also started learning comptuer science and got a job as a noob developer , but it paid out well . 
  if i focused on it from the start i 'd start earning money and experience much earlier , but i 'd also miss a lot of student 's life , so i think it 's fine . 
  yeah , 150 km but 130 km/h , right ? 
  if you say 90 km in poland it usually means narrow two-way roads with average speed 55 km/h if you 're not speeding . 
  90 km would be considered 1.5 hours of driving . 
  and for students travelling by shitty bus in poland it probably means 2-2 .5 hours . 
  you 'd take train if you 're lucky to have one nearby . 
  i 'm not saying it 's a long distance in europe though , but for polish standards in many places it 's totally not a distance you 'd want to commute everyday . 
  not to mention cost of it with salaries 3 times less but gas prices at similar level . 
  i do n't know any muslim nor i was able to spot one on the streets ( at least someone who would i think might be muslim ) in recent few months . 
  if that 's a problem for you then i have bad news . 
  what if someone creates counterfeit items in a country and then ... sells them inside the same country ? 
  i bet you wo n't be able to sleep now , 
  leaving eu would n't be sane . 
  oh ... sorry uk . 
  by which numbers ? 
  just because the economy is growing does n't mean we can compare germany to poland , where you earn 3 times more on the same position . 
  median salary is 600 eur and the rent for 2 apartment house in a city is 300-500 eur . 
  for people that do n't earn much kids are a luxury . 
  my salary is good and we still hesitated for many years if we can afford having kids . 
  on top of that the risk you wo n't have a place at your work after having a kid is rather high . 
  all small things sum up to pretty obvious result . 
  i doubt we can compare in any of this to germany or other west european countries that are n't doing bad at the moment . 
   germany and poland wat ? 
  ah , yes , of course, 
  we 're all raging cunts . 
  the further you go east the more you see it . 
  you can see a lot of aggressive driving on the roads . 
  we ca n't understand much of our languages . 
  there 's a lot of similar words or identical words , but it 's still rather hard to communicate . 
  on top of that we have a lot of words that mean something else in both languages even you 'd think they 're the same . 
  back in the days when there were no internet web pages i know a teacher who wanted to take his class to czech republic on a trip . 
  he called the czech guy and they somehow managed to book the hotel . 
  they agreed they 'll show up in april ( teacher said `` kwiecie\u0144 '' , and the czech knew that 's a month ) . 
  the problem is `` kv\u011bten '' ( sounds pretty similar ) means may in czech . 
  of course the teacher showed up in april and the hotel was n't prepared to host 30 people . 
  there 's much more . 
  `` panna '' means mrs. in polish , but `` virgin '' in czech , so after meeting and nice girl , taking her for a cafe you might end up asking if she 's a virgin . 
  113kg luggage in cheap flights will be cheaper ? 
  be careful when renting . 
  i did it twice , once with hertz and once with some small company at the airport . 
  i did n't manage to rent from hertz , because i did n't have credit card when on official polish page they claimed debit will be ok for deposit . 
  the service at the airport was awful . 
  and the second company wanted to rip me off . 
  they claimed i did the damage to the car . 
  i had to use visa chargeback through my bank , because they did n't want to talk with me , did n't show any proof etc. 
  if you rent use only the most known companies and take tons of photos on every inch of the car and make them note any scratches that are already on the car . 
  i read the story similar to mine that someone got photo of a scratch underneath the bumper and they claimed that is the damage and charged the guy 70 eur administration fee , because he was fully insured . 
  maybe send luggage separately using courier delivery ? 
  should n't take too long . 
  i have no idea what the price would be though . 
  quickly googled and it might be 300 eur for 70kg . 
  i envy how well you spread your freedom in the middle east . 
  this is so well written . 
  i have n't been to us longer than few weeks , but when i think if i would like to move there i have similar feelings . 
  so many weird stories here on reddit makes me rather think more about uk or other eu country . 
  i get that it 's a big country , but it really feels like going out at night in the big city is somewhat not too safe . 
  i have n't felt like that in years in poland . 
  and all those stories about drugs and people fighting with addiction ... we have weed in poland , some people take something stronger while partying , but people who genuinely look like addicts who 'd do anything for a drug ? 
  i may see something like that maybe once per few months . 
  well , i 've heard about it , but also , back in the day , i 've heard about some extreme cases on our western border too . 
  i just never had to cross the border at that time . 
  i do n't know how often it occurs now on eastern border , but i found some gov service showing estimates and it looks bad for ukraine , but nothing extreme : https://www.granica.gov.pl/index_wait.php?v=en, 
  uk , because english and money, 
  borders between czech republic - no issues , just need a passport . 
  short stop and you 're ready to go . 
  borders between germany or any other west/east europe border - oh boy . 
  sometimes as quick as with czechs , sometimes you sat there for few hours . 
  i remember coming back from holidays in a bus almost 20 years ago we spent 5 hours on austrian-czech border , because of massive queue . 
  i imagine for non-shengen countries it may still be quite similar to this day , especially when there 's some issues going on . 
  i 've spent 2 hours last year on croatia-slovenia border . 
  hey , / r/askeurope , how about we not feed the troll and do n't reply to it ? 
   because in the 3 room example link , i can count 5 rooms in total , plus a balcony , so the 3 rooms make no sense to me well , i can count 3 , 
   you all have benzes and bmws i remember when crossing the german-netherlands border i noticed the cars were much older and much cheaper . 
  my guess is netherlands do n't bother that much about their cars . 
  why would they if they use bikes so much . 
  what he means is that you do n't need to have some high [ credit score ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/credit_score_in_the_united_states ) or work for it by taking a credit card ( when you do n't need it ) and show that you can pay it on time or take a smaller credit or loan ( when you do n't need it ) to show you can handle it well etc. 
  all just so you can finally be trustworthy when taking a mortgage . 
  you still ca n't fuck up by not paying some installment of your small loan or forgetting to pay off your credit card , because you 'll be put in some kind of register ( for 5 years afair ) and banks always check them . 
  my friend fucked up by forgetting to pay some fee on her not-used-anymore bank account and they put her there , so when she wanted to take mortgage only one bank agreed to give it to her , but at the cost of much higher interest rate .

  not from biedronka .

  yes , their kids are the real tragedy . 
  we ca n't take them from their thoroughly demoralized parents . 
  if they stay with their parents , there is slim chance that they ever break the cycle . 
  really sad . 
  but did n't some companies withdraw from the country entirely due to much lesser deposits than anticipated ? 
  well , maybe they made a mistake , but in the media are constantly reporting that the searches take place and no company i know of confirmed they have found a profitable deposit .

  hahaha , yeah , you 're right . 
  and i suppose you never tried to start a business in poland , or any eastern european country , i guess . 
   crushing regulatory burdens hahaha , a tear was shed . 
  thanks for answering my questions . 
  okay , that 's what my second question was for , as i accounted for possibility of such understood internationalism . 
  if nationalities were to be discarded and russian language adopted only because of practicality , was anything done to prevent russian culture 's domination over the others ? 
  like , i do n't know , including other culture 's literature as soviet own , valuing and sponsoring their art , this kind of thing . 
  because it was done for russian culture . 
  if all what this `` melting pot '' policies was , was to discard all national cultures except russian , what differentiates it from your normal cultural genocide ? 
   but it 's not like it 's working very well for you now that 's interesting , an advice to follow russian socioeconomic model . 
  why would anyone on earth want to make his home more like russia ? 
  i do know about russification . 
  i never claimed to be an expert in soviet internal affairs . 
  that 's why i asked these question . 
   just to be brief , that topic is kind of huge - ussr was formed with an idea of internationalism , no boundaries , no nationalities yes , but how were those ideas represented in real life ? 
  could a person traverse all the educational steps in his native language ? 
  were literary classics from non-russian-speaking republics taught nationwide ? 
  were they taught in their respective republics ? 
  how about other types of culture , could non-russian language art be sponsored by the state ? 
  you see , i do n't know answers to these questions . 
  do enlighten me . 
  what were the policies that strenghtened other national identities to be on par with russian nationality ? 
  what were the policies implemented to dismantle russian national identity and implement a `` soviet '' one ? 
  because these `` melting pot ' policies you speak of looks awfully like same , old russification we know all too well . 
  thanks, 
  the first `` c '' is a `` k '' , `` s '' , or a `` tz '' ? 
  how is ` cluj ' pronounced ? 
  ( i ca n't read phonetic alphabet ), 
  i did n't say communist countries are a better choice . 
  and it is n't true that sweden , finland or germany are pure capitalist countries . 
  the capital there is seriously impended by taxation and social security systems . 
  north korea and cuba are dictatorships and certainly not communist . 
  you are making things up to match your agenda . 
  the democracy is n't an opposite to communism - the capitalism is . 
  somalia is perfectly capitalist country , nothing comes in the way of somalian noble enterpreneurs kidnaping tankers . 
  all i 'm saying that capitalism does n't guarantee well-being of a nation , which you seem to believe . 
  it is not so . 
  and your neoliberal excitement is half-adorable and half-pathetic , please stop . 
   nothing to do with capitalism and everything to do with corruption and a bad economy . 
  are n't you blind ... 
  level up !, 
  now talk your 5 friends into thinking that poland is central europe and you 'll get additional 0,5 l. 
  polish winter is ok if it 's cold and if there 's snow . 
  if it 's above 0c , man ... talk about depressing surroundings . 
  mud-snow everywhere , cold and dark ... you could make a swedish criminal drama , it 's that depressing . 
  sure , i 'm not even saying that tusk is effective administrator ( imo , he is , to an extent , but that 's not the point ) , or right person for the job . 
  he 's just great at being politician . 
  he keeps his party in line , he kept the opposition where he needed it . 
  he controlled the coalition partner to do whatever he wanted and pushed his agenda . 
  this guy is a pro . 
  compare his terms with his predecessors . 
  they lost to their own parties and coalitions . 
  they did n't lead their own people , even . 
  they struggled to stay at the office , ousted by accelerated elections , while tusk is probably going to finish his second term . 
  that 's some serious ` politicking ' . 
  as far as international relations go , i 'd say that tusk and sikorski do a marvelous job . 
  since they took office , the country is getting rid of it 's bad reputation ( anyone here a car thief ? 
  anyone up to obstructing negotiation ? 
  ) , becoming more and more influential within the eu . 
  beside ratting out that poor belarussian dissident that one time i ca n't remember our diplomacy fuckup in a while . 
  they catapulted lewandowski and buzek to the highest positions in the eu . 
  for the internal politics , donald tusk is the most efficient polirician post-communist poland had . 
  he 's the first to be reelected , and i think one of the longest presiding party leaders and his party did n't break up ( yet ) . 
  yeah , he 's one of the best . 
  it 's just that he got a underleveled character to play . 
  you 're not gon na beat the boss with polamd .

  we 've got `` kwas chlebowy ' and `` podpiwek '' , though . 
  it 's great , i recently rediscovered these drinks and i drink nothing else on hot days .

   according to some left-wing polish media everyone who goes out with national flag in polish independence day is a blood hungry nazi nationalist really ? 
  which one wrote that ? 
  care to provide a link ? 
  nobody advocates police beating football hooligans . 
  no one . 
  not that anyone is concerned if that happens , no one will also cry if the bald guy breaks some ribs , because , frankly , they are societal disease and living waste . 
  that being said , every proven police beating is taken seriously -- they just ca n't not do this . 
  and these things happen . 
  so no , no `` policeman can beat the crap out of you on sight '' . 
  as for animal treatment , i think it 's far too mild . 
  the hooligans pratically are animals . 
  they only know aggression and vandalism . 
  their favorite pastime is destroying pubilc property and endangering people .

  judging from viewer hits and comments on this year entries polan may actually have a decent shot this year, 
  discontent = / = hatered, 
   that makes you blind with hatred towards us , russians what ? 
   party names a country that has imperialistic politics , nuke arsenal , huge army , long history of war with the party and has been agressive in recent years invading bordering countries vs  party names countries that do n't fully align with his political likings both argumentation is totally on the same level, 
   i clearly see the rise of nationalism , racism etc. 
  amongst my friends and colleagues . 
  yes , but it 's nowhere near `` existential threat '' to anything though , which is what makes him sound like a retard, 
  someone just went full retard, 
  some trivia - surprisingly overall we got pretty good opinion on those enemies in the end as both ottoman empire and qajar persia ( turkey and iran ) were the only countries who refused to accept the partitions of poland . 
  ottoman empire is said to have reserved a place in its diplomatic corps for an ambassador of lehistan ( poland ), 
   it 's the poles doing the polandballs right ? 
  nope it 's just a name , everyone can makes them about any country . 
  poland is just a `` character '' that started the whole thing,

  fixed, 
  i just love finnish accent, 
   errors & consistency as we are with it - if poland is included in the `` eastern european '' vid thumbail it should also be included in the `` central european '' one ( just like czech , slovakia , hungary ) or just make a thumbail with only countries flags of which are being described also decide whether to use borders with flags ( like central and eastern has ) or flag poles ( nordics ) or a general location on the map ( baltics ) . 
  i would be ok if each was different , but then you made central and eastern in the same style ;p  beautiful capital eeee you would found many people in poland who would not agree ; ), 
  all my polish/history teachers were always correcting when people used eg . 
  `` ruski '' instead of `` rosyjski '' . 
  i grew the habbit myself :p, 
  i guess he just got confused with his own division of the continent or just does n't care for perfect consistency ; ) most people wo n't even notice that it 's warsaw 's old town there anyway, 
   poland is included in the ~ ~ central european ~ ~ flags video .

  it would be really dumb when not being a monarchy . 
  poland was the crown in the commonwealth as it was the state that was a legit kingdom ( lithuania was ** merely ** a grand dutchy ) . 
   i find it being kinda awkward as most of languages made a shift rus ' -  ruthenia -  russia , so many people just think of belarus as of white russia rather than ruthenia of rus ' .

  - [ katy\u0144 ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0879843/ ) ( 2007 ) ( [ trailer ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9drgshijxaq ) )  an examination of the soviet slaughter of thousands of polish officers and citizens in the katyn forest in 1940 . 
  - [ the pianist ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0253474/ ) ( 2002 ) ( [ trailer ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_4nvy3v51q ) )  a polish jewish musician struggles to survive the destruction of the warsaw ghetto of world war ii - [ schindler 's list ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0108052/ ) ( 1993 ) ( [ trailer ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdrgc-w9sya ) )  in poland during world war ii , oskar schindler gradually becomes concerned for his jewish workforce after witnessing their persecution by the nazis . 
  / edit : added trailers ; the americanised trailers are for lols ( the footage is from the movies ) ; added some songs couse they are great ; i guess that 's enough for one post, 
  / r/polska ( polish speaking one ) - i do n't use it that much , hard to say anything / r/poland - it 's basically foreigners asking about poland - language , surnames , travel or explanations of news . 
  i do n't like that the sub does n't have any skin , even copying the one from / r/polska would be ok not to look like some abandoned default sub, 
  that depends where are you from if from central/eastern/northen europen then it 's midly spicy , if you are from latin america or asia then it 's flavourless, 
  that comparison was totally missed, 
  what 's sadder ( for ukraine ) is that we had the same gdp as ukraine not so long ago [ pic ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9c/gdp_ppp_poland.svg/2000px-gdp_ppp_poland.svg.png ), 
  and the thread surely got reported for cultural offence, 
  one thing i heard from foreigners - they are surprised that we always got souce for pizza ( most popular are tomato/ketchup or garlic souces ) so i guess that counts as `` our regional pizza '' . 
  also contrary to traditional italian pizza pizzas in poland usually got much thicker base and often it is n't very crunchy ( but i think that 's the case everywhere outside italy ) as for topping i got no idea which one would be a typically polish or mayby polish spin on pizza - street food [ zapiekanka ] ( http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-7gls1bufri8/vdkrsfdd15i/aaaaaaaajjy/a39rcq8njdw/s1600/zapiekanki%2b14.jpg ) ( typically : baguette , mushrooms , cheese + ketchup ), 
  it 's a bit weird couse wiki says polish h is / x / , which seems not to be the case . 
  i remember that long time ago there was a difference between `` ch '' and `` h '' in polish , but now it 's the same thing, 
  hmm i may be doing it wrong - on wiki polish h is / x / , but it 's exactly the same as h in history or hammer ( which is / h / ) or chark\u00f3w for that matter, 
  hmm what 's the difference between / h / and / x / ? 
  ( example in english or polish please ) they seem to be exactly the same for me / edit : question for somone knowledgeable on the matter - polish ch/h ( modern ofc ) is / h / ( like i think ) or / x / as it 's written on [ wiki ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polish_alphabet#letters ) ? 
  couse bohemia is just one of the regions, 
  source ? 
  at least they would start to pronounce it correctly, 
  i 'm happy they still want to use glorious polish `` cz '' instead of \u010d or english `` ch '' ( and polish ch instead of h ) ; ), 
  couse they picked such picture - there are turist towns on most pictures and some got a standard down the road actual village, 
  we also got those ; ) the `` problem '' is that kr\u00f3l implies that it 's a male gramatically and `` kr\u00f3lowa '' is just female version of that world - which makes the impression that female on the throne would be `` kr\u00f3lowa '' which is not the case . 
  the missconception is further carried by every day use of the word eg . 
  in insect word,

  it were the people living there , who made it the second ( or the third in some aspects ) most important polish city and centre of polish culture , who ran the world famous lw\u00f3w university and polytechnic . 
  and that part of the spirit of lw\u00f3w might perhaps remain in wroc\u0142aw - though i do n't consider wroc\u0142aw to be anywhere near the level of influence lw\u00f3w had . 
  yes , and in fact i even meant to write breslau at first . 
  why i did n't ? 
  i decided that what i was describing in my post was that they were resettled from the old polish city of lw\u00f3w , which ceased to exist with them to be replaced by an entirely different soviet city of lvov , to the new polish city of wroc\u0142aw , built on the ruins of the old german breslau ( the city which defended itself against the red army for a week longer than berlin ! ) . 
  to think of it - is n't it kind of poetic , how citizens of the polish fortress on the east during the wars with bolsheviks and ukrainians in 1920 were resettled to the german ww2 eastern fortress ? 
  well , there 's kinda no point anymore after all the poles from lw\u00f3w were moved to wroc\u0142aw . 
  ah , you mean in pub . 
  you will pay about 1-2 $ there . 
  though krak\u00f3w is famous in poland for ripping off tourists who do n't know better . 
  you mean there are countries where 0.5 l beer * does n't * cost $ 0.5 ? 
  yeah , since 1946 when almost all poles in lw\u00f3w who survived the war were forcibly expelled by soviets . 
  there 's no lw\u00f3w anymore , just as there 's no constantinople and today the city is as ukrainian as szczecin is polish . 
  well , he would have to live until 120 or something for this to happen . 
  it 's not like we have n't been warning for many years that something like this is possible . 
  though until the last year noone outside the region seemed to care . 
   georgia today , tomorrow ukraine , the baltic states the day after tomorrow , then perhaps the time for my country , poland !, 
  - the president of poland in 2008, 
  well , we had to give up sikorski for fa so tusk could become the president of the european council . 
  a shame really , as i would rather have sikorski in europe than tusk , as he is the one that could actually have some real impact on eu , but i guess having a prestigious figurehead from your country is not that bad either . 
  honestly , i was suprised that the whole knp party have n't joined the ukip 's alliance to begin with . 
  though that 's probably because they have found farage ` too moderate ' for their liking . 
  suck it , russia . 
  we beat you again . 
  there is no deep hatred in poland for romanian nation in the same way it exists say for russia . 
  it 's just that there are very few news here regarding romania , and somehow it became ingrained as '' * the * poverty stricken country in eastern europe ( far away from our central europe ) where all the gypsies come from '' in common conscience . 
  not by a large ammount though . 
  seems we have found a proud citizen of western poland with his unjustified superiority complex . 
  there are n't much gypsies in poland . 
  lithuanian nazi collaborants have also commited numerous crimes and mass murders against poles living in areas of poland occupied by lithuania in 1939 . 
  compared to what they did , the * one * massacre by ak , while undoubtfuly worthy of condemnation , seems quite pale in comparison . 
  even [ jan pawe\u0142 having a walk with reagan ] ( http://niezalezna.pl/uploads/foto/2012/08/pomnik2.jpg ) statues . 
  guess we just really love statues . 
  700 million elderly europeans with modern military , high tech and enough funds to sustain prolonged warfare vs 10 billion young and violent and piss poor everybody . 
  africa is also a much bigger continent than europe , so until they reach our average population density the fact that they are more populous does n't really mean anything . 
  \\  either turn into africa2 , or be an old 's people home continent . 
  hard choice indeed . 
  \\  a big eu logo instead of a national symbol \\  name of country in english instead of in its native language \\  flag format which works only if you have broad vertical strips on your flag 2/10 , like my current one more . 
  they surely were n't anymore `` soviet '' than `` polish '' though . 
  and while pre-war poland had its flaws , being kind of a military semi-dictatorship and all , i 'd wager i would still much rather live in poland than ussr even if i was ukrainian or belarusian . 
  or even russian , to think about it . 
  and soviet union took large areas with ethnic polish huge majority . 
  most interestingly , opression against ethnic polish population in soviet-occupied areas of poland during 1939-41 was even more severe than in german-occupied areas in the same period . 
  germans have n't really started mass exterminations until 1942 , at this point soviets managed to send about a million of poles into inhumane siberian katorga ( needless to add , with a very high death ratio ) , and murder 22,000 of allied officers . 
  nice job , managing to be a worse occupant than fucking nazi germany . 
  that surely is an achievement . 
  interesting that you are using the `` they took it first '' argument , as the very same argument could be convincingly made for poland , that it has regained in 1920 what russia has conquered in its war of aggresion in 1794-95 . 
  warsaw has falen to germans over 10 days later , on september 28 . 
  and polish army planned ( not without some chances of succes ) a defending the last resort on polish-romanian border through the winter . 
  unfortunately , these plans were deemed void when agression of poland was joined by nazi germany 's most loyal ally , soviet union on 17th september . 
  and , as i have already said , soviet tyranny was n't any better than nazi tyranny . 
  there were literally people fleeing from the soviet-occupation zone to nazi-occupation zone , that 's how bad it was in soviet zone . 
  your post , along with your post history is so filled with misinformation , blatant lies , and blind russian historical revisionism , it 's hard to treat it seriously . 
  congratulations , you have made yourself look like a parody of the alleged `` kremlinbots '' . 
  still , they are called `` partitions of poland '' by historians . 
  i think it 's pronounced kind of like ` zhech-pohs-poh-leetah ' , though i 'm not really sure if i rendered it in faux english correctly . 
  yeah , it was never the same again after the war with sweden when many protestants were collaborating with swedes and the stigma remained . 
  counting combined , i 'm quite sure sure spain has received much , much more than us . 
  i always knew / int / was right all along . 
  ghost people , some spooky shit right there . 
  maybe if you have actually offered us rafales , we would have chosen them over f-16 . 
  your offer were mirages though , and they were more expensive than f-16s , while not being any better than them . 
  no wonder we have chosen a more favorable deal . 
  and the name of the ruling party makes france socialist exactly how ? 
  last time i checked they were a normal capitalist country ruled by socialdemocrats . 
   when have they ever protected poland ? 
  cia helped the anti-communist resistance in '80s . 
   britain and france both declared war on germany after germany invaded poland . 
  ... and then proceeded to do absolutely nothing until germans got bored of waiting and took initiative . 
  from this point , france managed to hold for the same ammount of time poland had half a year earlier . 
  fortunately , there are no socialist countries in europe anymore . 
  there are still lots of religious young people , even if the percentage is n't as high as in older generations . 
  another thing is that krak\u00f3w is a large city , so even 100k of students wo n't really skew the statistics by noticeable ammount , and there 's also densely populated rural part of the area . 
  no , it 's sosnowiec . 
  post-industrial area which used to be more well-off in the past . 
  krak\u00f3w ( kra ) is dark red . 
  yes . 
  also lpg . 
  not really , it 's quite evenly distributed across the country . 
  but it 's the south ( interesingly enough , it 's also the area of poland with the highest average population density ) , which i would consider the bible belt of poland . 
  [ percentage attending the mass every sunday . 
  checks out . 
  here in poland the only relevant eurosceptics are on the right wing and the far right . 
  see - that 's exactly what i was talking about . 
  3k usd is not a significant difference . 
   and poland is seen here as a place where cheap , low-quality products come from . 
  then i 'm glad our exporters have found such a niche in your country and you are buying our crap . 
   what is the reason ? 
  perhaps poles are less resistant than slovaks to shitty wages , and some of us know some languages other than our native one . 
   how is it possible that all western european countries are infested with poles ? 
  it might have something to do with the fact that even if emigration rate would be the same in every 2004 expansion country , there would be still more emigrants from poland than from all the other 9 countries combined . 
   slovakia is significantly richer than poland lol . 
  you are seen here as a cheap winter vacations resort , with similar to ours wages and standard of living . 
  and the last time i checked statistics , this opinion was n't far from the truth . 
   at a far lower rate would n't be so sure . 
  though there are like 10 times more of us than of you so we are surely more visible wherever we go . 
  pathetic , everyone knows the only legitimate claimants to the polish throne are from the house of wettin . 
  they should fuck off from his lands then . 
  konrad surely was a terrible strategist though . 
  they were granted some lands as vassals .

   secular continent muslims ca n't handle secular country , our european values etc. 
  simply fuck them , if they ca n't realise they 're on christan continent they go fuck themselves and go back to their countries . 
  we ( poles ) 've got this tartar ( muslim , far east asian ) minority which does n't feel polish , they consider themselves polish . 
  so it 's possible , but foreign muslims 've got to push away radical islam exactly as our tartars 've done . 
  we do n't give free apartments to ukrainians , though we have this thing , [ pole card ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/karta_polaka ) . 
  as you may not know we lost a lot of teritorry and population in the wwii you started , so people in former ii polands republic territory nowadays are able to get back to their fathersland ( as long as they know polish and polish tradions culture and they can proove their polish heritage ) . 
  russian ? 
  barbarian language ( for slavic language ) , comparing to polish it sounds like language of handicapped peasant . 
  english ? 
  nowadays lingua franca , it 's easier for us poles to conversate in english with germans than brits . 
  only old people know that language . 
  spanish ? 
  `` yo soy polaco , una cerveza por favor '' , i guess that 's all for most poles . 
  historically ? 
  same as us , poles , great loosers . 
  nowadays ? 
  in one word ? 
  coffee & wine , 
  i guess in next 20-50 years there 'll be an etnically war in europe . 
  i 've had a lot of vodka tonight , it 's time to stop , unluckily i ca n't inherit my great-grandfather usa citizenship , and live in mighty shi-raq ( chicago ) :(, 
  except for katy\u0144 massacre , soviets sentenced over million poles ( not necessarily etnically ) to far away siberia , officially to protect civilians from war , unoficially to break polish spirit , but somehow , even though my family was sentenced to sibieria , and my great-grandparents died there ( i 'm 19 ) i still feel polish , looks like soviet plan was a failure after all , unluckily many poles stayed there becouse bloody ussr in therittory of nowadays kazachastan and southern siberia . 
  i guess you westerns will finally realise why we prefer to get back our people from siberia and kazachstan than muslim migrants . 
  frankly i do n't believe that `` sharing '' both asylum and `` asylum ' ( economic ) migrants will solve africans and middle easterners migration crisis . 
  i believe only stopping their migration ( i do n't care how ) will solve this problem . 
  i believe it 's a problem becouse i 'm afriad our european ( based on mostly christian beliefs and greek philosophy ) culture is best culture and most important culture. , if i 'm wrong correct me . 
  russia still being russia since muscovite grand principality :( edit : our nobles beat you once :p, 
  i 'm definitelly polish ( at least 30 % ethnically , but 90 % culturally , 5 % belarussian , 5 % prussian ) . 
  answering question , i guess there is no other subreddit ( except this one ) with so many europeans about europe though i 'm a little bit drunk . 
  in poland , if you public universities are payed from taxes . 
  at my uni i had to pay 18z\u0142 ( ~ 5e ) for student card and i can have additional insurance for 30z\u0142 ( ~ 7e ) . 
  as a student i also have something like ~ 50 % cut for trains , buses etc. 
  they often are religious , but it 's different than abrahamese religions . 
  skilled : belarus , ukraine ( but very limited ) , vietnam ( we have quite big vietnamese minority ) . 
  unskilled : belarus , ukraine ( but very limited ) , vietnam , china . 
  ` fugees : iran ( but limited ) , they were one of few countries that treated us well during wwii [ vietnamese minority vide wiki ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/overseas_vietnamese#poland ) edit : if it have to be only one country then for skilled belarus and unskilled vietnam . 
  annexation of zaolzie - first of all , czechs stole it from us when we were busy fighting commies in 1919-1920 . 
  when it comes to piece of riga , it is important to remember that when polish-ukrainian alliance fought for ukrainian people republic , less than 10 % of alliance soldiers where ukrainian , pretty much ukrainians fault . 
  so please do n't say it like it 's our fault that ukrainians slaughtered polish civilians . 
  frankly , they not only `` looked '' badass , they were best cavarly in xviith century , they lost no battle for 150 years . 
  in 150 years from the most powerful country in europe to non-existing . 
  partitions of poland , and what led to them . 
  our king was n't powerful enough 2 . 
  our nobles were rich , but state was poor 3 . 
  liberum veto blocked reforms 4 . 
  we saved austrians and they were so thankful they backstabbed us we gave too much freedom and privileges to nobles , our state was n't able to mantain big army , couse nobles said they wo n't pay more taxes . 
  when we stopped commies in 1920 , saved western europe and 20 years later they did n't help us and sold us to soviets ( thanks uk , france ) looks like we ca n't learn from our mistakes :(, 
  swedish death camps , you 'll see how annoying can it be : /, 
  maybe try australian way , simply turn them back ? 
  it 's definitelly working for aussies . 
  i 'm betting on belfast xd, 
  as far as i 'm aware knuckle-dusters are not legal in poland , however you can carry pretty much everything in poland . 
  swords , machetes , knives , buttons , pepper spray etc. 
  can be carried as long as they 're hidden ( eg . 
  backpack , pocket ) but if you 're walking on the streets with bare sword/machete , baton in your hand etc. 
  people might be scared , call the police and police might be asking questions but it 's not illegal ( as far as i 'm aware ) though . 
  you misunderstood , by `` problems with roma '' i meant problems with minority , they 're now careful ` couse of their experience . 
  christanity has big influance of european poganism , so animistic influence ca n't be that bad , at least we have more in common than we do with muslims . 
   all that can be expected of people is that they follow the law , learn the language and get a job . 
  if we 're talking ` bout permanent migrants i could n't disagree more . 
  you know what defines nation ? 
  common values , traditions , history , without it there 's no chance it 'll survive . 
   forcing people to adhere to arbitrary cultural elements like traditions is against the personal freedom that is inherent to democracy . 
  why forcing ? 
  you 'll integrate or get out . 
  we do n't need people who will came to ur country and disrespect our culture . 
  i 'm not saing we need no migrants , ` couse , demographically , we do . 
  but we ca n't afford culturaly to accept everyone , ` couse otherwise in next generations we 'll loose our identity . 
  for me it 's better to work hard and fail than behead someone/blow myself for religion of peace . 
  but that 's just pov of european conservative-libertarian who 's not relativist . 
  okay we misunderstood , ` couse i wrote `` integration '' while i meant `` assimilation '' . 
  i also believe to integrate is to fully * respect * other country culture , traditions etc. 
  becouse europes traditions , old values ( which are still important in central europe ) where built on christian foundations it 'll be easier to accept slovakian culture/values for christians than it 'll be for muslims . 
  yeah , but middle eastern and african christians will integrate better than middle eastern and african muslims . 
  it might be not politically corect , but with slovakian problems with roma people i 'm fully understand them . 
  more ? 
  are you serious , nigroes in africa were tribal-fighting since they exist . 
  aztecs were brutally slughtering other tribes in central america . 
  muslim were fighting with everyone and they were trying to counquer europe . 
  tartars conquered almost all central asia , china , russian states , they attacked poland in xii and xiii century . 
  we could talk about wars in human history for weeks and not finish . 
  history of mankind is history of wars , but allmost all wars lead to big technological progress . 
  we , europeans had better technology , so we were able to conquer more lands and people . 
  if we did n't had better tech we would n't be conquerers , we would be just counquered . 
  unions * can * be good in big companies to * protect * their rights , and improve communication between employees and employer ` couse it 's quite difficult to talk with every single employee when you employ couple hundreds/thousands people . 
  like i said , * protect * their rights , not enforce some `` shit '' that leads to fall of the company like in detroit . 
  just curious , how exactly are they `` fucking over workers & the general population '', 
  at the begging i 'd like to say that i 'm not critisizng `` doing okay '' , ` couse we do , i 'd like to just add that ~ 2mln people left poland , which have some influence on unemployment . 
  same problem here , mate . 
  for me it 's not about the money , if those pieces of shit were put 6feet under by state i would n't have to worry of my own safety , while they 're dead they ca n't kill/rape etc. 
  anymore, 
  they have nigroes , just look at the crime rate [ by colour , fbi statistics . 
  ] ( http://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/ucr/crime-in-the-u.s/2011/crime-in-the-u.s.-2011/tables/expanded-homicide-data-table-3 ) while blacks make less than [ 13 % of us society ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/demographics_of_the_united_states#race_and_ethnicity ) they 're responsible for over 50 % of murders with known offender . 
  when you look at [ those statistics ] ( http://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/ucr/crime-in-the-u.s/2013/crime-in-the-u.s.-2013/tables/table-43 ) you can surely see white part of their society makes more crime right ? 
  well they 're 72 % of the population , so when you look at the population 72 % of it is responsible for ( on average ) twice amount of crimes as black 13 % of society . 
   it brings back to live no crime victim . 
  but also there 's no chance there 'll be more victims of ( dead ) crimal . 
  for the context : in poland only 300k people pay 32 % tax , most of them 're government employees , so raising it makes no economical sense , it 's just pure populism . 
  even with `` shocking 32 % '' we should : a ) make it 10-15 % for everyone + raise non taxable income ( nowadays it 's 3091zlotys per year , something like 766euros ) b ) get rid of income tax in future , it 's better for all citiezens . 
  it 's just not fair to punish people who make ( finally ) good money . 
  i hope never , becouse it 's only one step more to lost the last pieces of independence our countries have .

  hey , i kind of understand what you 're going through . 
  we have the same thing with pis . 
  yes , every pole is responsible for pis just like every individual russian is putin and his alts ... 
  is that google translated polish ? 
   bogadsze : ddddddddddddddddddd also , if the ukrainians are going for richer countries then i doubt they will stay in poland now that they have most of the eu to travel visa-free .

   ian paisley eventually became more reasonable yeah i read about that but then you read something like this :  in 1988 , having given advance warning of his intentions , paisley interrupted a speech being delivered by pope john paul ii in the european parliament . 
  paisley shouted `` i denounce you as the antichrist ! '', 
  and held up a poster reading `` pope john paul ii antichrist '' . 
  other meps jeered paisley , threw papers at him and snatched his poster , but he produced another and continued shouting . 
  that guy was an absolute mad man :d,

  that way , if i need ebay 's consumer protection i do n't have to worry about putzing around with package forwarders or whatever , everything remains the responsibility of the seller until the point of arrival . 
  things would be much better if we did n't have the so-called `` diversity peddlers '' imho . 
  you know the ones , they cite how europe must be diverse and such things like that . 
  i do n't have a problem with people who happen to have different colored skin , i do have a problem when someone tells me that europe needs diversity for diversity 's sake . 
  you do n't see anyone saying how there 's no diversity in the continent of africa .

  so we can not acknowledge that there were some problems left behind by po , who was in power for 8 years before pis ? 
  i am not laying everything at their feet but they did leave some things unresolved . 
  i was just making sure this was n't some '' [ false friend ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/false_friend ) '' thing or something of the sort . 
  sorry if i came off as snobbish or whatever . 
  it * is * odd that for a post with 82 comments there are only 5 upvotes lol but whatever . 
  russia is in a way , though .

  same as czech and slovak . 
  and ? 
  let it be 50 % . 
  so what ? 
  i assume you meant poland . 
  but withhold those funds . 
  no more infrastructure investments for long time . 
  that 's it . 
  country would survive . 
  you forget that those money are n't money for nothing . 
  they are investment in securing `` new-eu '' countries being able to contribute more than receive to eu budget . 
  2020 and onwards will be hell for poland , because eu funds were n't used as they should be , and even with all those funds atm we are still under the line , but that is n't anyone 's concern . 
  if you meant uk - i think they can manage easier then we think . 
   it would be working fine if everyone actually consulted everyone else . 
  this . 
  your post should be stickied . 
  nothing more , nothing less . 
   if they want to go , they 'll go anyways this is the base of whole problem . 
  they should not be able to get in in the first place . 
  not all of them , not at once . 
  why someone downvoted you ? 
  have an upvote for civilised conversation . 
  ah yes , you think that money allows you ( whoever would that be , as i 'm not mean you personally vernazza ) to tell others what to do . 
  here 's the problem - european union is n't buyer-seller transaction . 
  if you want a slave you can look elsewhere . 
  whole of eu will not be responsible of one or few countries doing what they like without having other members agree on those actions . 
  but hey - try to do that . 
   e. except they 'd be headed to poland as a `` second best '' destination . 
  no , they would not , and even if they would they would not be allowed in . 
  do n't try to make germany be local hero taking a burden ( german politicians created ) out of poorer neighbours . 
  sadly german politicians made germany be a bad guy in this story . 
   plus , nobody in poland is starving well ... we are n't somalia , but more than 500 000 kids are under fed to say it at least . 
  there are something like 2 000 000 poles in poland that are between poverty and vegetation . 
  i 'd say those are quite serious numbers . 
  i 'm gon na ignore your gdp comparisons - they say about industry , not about how people are , and at least in this discussion are meaningless . 
  greece 's gdp was at 17,657 in 2015 . 
  poland 's was 12,662 . 
  you still think those numbers mean anything at all in this discussion ? 
   somalian | ... | population exceeds what the current national economy can support stop breeding like rabbits ? 
  if you ca n't feed yourself how can you even think about having kids ? 
  you either will start treating africa like adults or still treat them as retards that ca n't think for themselves , ca n't act for themselves , and make them addicted to international help . 
  this way they will never stand on their own feet . 
  same as it is with free welfare and not-integrating immigrants - they have no need for integration , because , no matter what , they will get free housing and money for nothing . 
  of course some are decent and will integrate , problem are those others . 
  relax , let 's not go that far in future for now . 
   they want automatic and mandatory system of distribution , without need for the countries to agree to each group . 
  that sounds like giving up sovereignty . 
   that 's very very different and a lot more catastrophic i opposed last time , and this is worse , so ...   we needed to show some solidarity of course - send polish soldiers to help with keeping borders tight . 
  send some money for camps outside eu , i 'm fine with that . 
  hell no to showing solidarity to lunacy of few european fell-good politicians . 
  to make it clear - legal immigrants are absolutely no problem for me . 
  let them in . 
  legal ones . 
   it 's much easier to defend yourself why would poland have to defend itself . 
  it was n't poland who brought 1 200 000 `` refuges '' to heart of europe . 
  it was decision of one country , or to be more exact one politician . 
  everybody around was saying that is bad idea , but nooooo i know better . 
   which is some form of comfort . 
  indeed , at least some . 
  we are talking poland here . 
  you seem to forget that some things are obvious in your country , others are not . 
  many times it is exactly the same here , but other way around meaning it would be easy to bring those forced immigrants here but where would they live , where would they work , who would pay for their staying ? 
  next to none communal housing , 10 % atm unemployment thanks to 2 000 000 poles emigrating west , welfare for regular unemployed poles is considered vegetation . 
  how would you see it working ? 
  do i have to say that polish is among hardest languages to learn ? 
  you would have to chain those `` refuges '' to make them stay . 
  it 's is hard enough for poles , and we are considered versatile and easy to adopt . 
  you wo n't feed and pay bills for your family for 400 euro net , and that would be considered next to dream wage for unskilled worker with rather minimal knowledge of polish language . 
  it is being said for months , and yet people do n't want to listen . 
  kopacz agreed on mandatory 7000 . 
  she and rest of po would agree on even more . 
  you know that as every other sane person in poland . 
  but even those christian syrians that came to poland invited by estera foundation are fleeing . 
  from 160 only ca . 
  35 are left , others fled west without even saying good bye . 
   whatever pis will wreck will be able to be fixed pretty quickly . 
  exactly my stance on whole thing that is happening in poland . 
  in case pis will wreck too much and too big they will loose next elections . 
  just say no . 
  what will they do - shout at you ? 
  there 's a difference between agreeing on good idea and disagreeing on some politician 's lunacy ( to think i did have tremendous respect for madame merkel once ... ) - no one signed for backing up self-extermination ideas when joining eu . 
  people should grow a spine . 
  i 'm pretty sure many british may vote on brexit now just to show middle finger .

  you could really stop yourself from being sarcastic . 
  did you see yt video of reporter with protagonist asking mayor why he sent police over ? 
  call me a jerk - i do n't see mark as someone that could incite anything related to hate , that could incite anyone at all . 
  harassment and intimidation of a citizen that may seem to be easy pray . 
  not to mention boring to death , but still so much true - `` seems police have no problem with criminals so they take on them `` twitter poster scum '' '' . 
  of course it is . 
  protagonist is white male , so he is bound to be racist and xenophobe and he should be harassed by police . 
  could you elaborate ? 
  thank you . 
  would first one work only for new immigrants or as well on those living in uk for less than 4 years ?

  we are becoming usa with their two party only system , and in poland both parties are not good . 
   source ? 
  i have none . 
  it is my supposition i am basing on german government actions and thus intimidating local authorities . 
   well , the current statements made by pis members ( claiming that the media is not friendly towards them ) i never voted and would never vote for pis ( thou i voted for duda in president elections ) , but i 'm not seeing any kind of danger . 
  nothing is happening that was n't before . 
  public media were under po rule , subjective to the core , biased even , `` reporters '' like lis , were bending facts to their likings . 
  believe me what is now , for now , it is n't anything worse . 
  pis simply is n't hiding their intentions like po was doing for last 8 years . 
  somehow i find it honest . 
  pis is disliked by european mass media ( and i 'm not defending him ) thus you see all the hysteria . 
  same like it was with orban ( i 'm not defending him either ) . 
   ( see the connection of the topics repeating ? ), 
  you are making a mistake by trying to compare german cc to polish one . 
  but it was government that made it clear for lower authorities how they should treat immigrant topics . 
   swapping out the heads of public media at your will . 
   you tend to put equality mark between your and ours public media . 
  maybe it is correct between radios , but i do n't believe german tv is that much one sided like polish tvp was and probably still will be . 
  seriously - everything that po+psl did was labelled as great in public tv . 
  i think do n't have to add in reality those very very arguable deeds . 
  changing head of public media at will changes nothing in reality - different name , same shiz . 
   i mean the constitutional court which is ( or at least should be ) a major political player in a democracy . 
  its illusory to believe that the office is not political . 
  ah this . 
  if ct judges were nominated by parliament it is n't something that will be neutral , do n't you think ? 
  frankly numerous times it showed it is very much biased . 
  it was always political so any fuss about it simply amusing . 
   this does not mean that they could get worse under kaczynski again . 
  it is a fact that the relations were much better during the time where po held the government compared to the government before that . 
  in first years of po rule , after pis it was this way , but further in time people started to see relation between tusk and merkel . 
   quite funny because eu mps are concieved as powerless in our own country . 
  power of word i guess . 
  if poles would know what you know , about f.e. 
  schultz being powerless , it all would be better for both of our nations . 
   well , and we got somewhat pissed by the recent interviews some of your ministers gave . 
  political merry-go-around . 
  luckily there is internet . 
   a large population ... which is decreasing every year . 
  poland is at the brink of demographic catastrophe . 
  or even past that already . 
   good prospects of growth ... which seems to be hidden from public . 
   a strategic position . 
  ... which we does n't know how to use . 
  as i said it looks like science fiction as for now i see no politician that could lead us to that bright future , at least no one that would be still alive for more than 20 years from now on . 
  oh i meant more about blocking information because of pc , but that does n't make your point less valid . 
   but if a government effectively tames a major political player in the country who or what do you mean by that ? 
  pis have no one to tame . 
  they alone got enough votes to have 50 % + 1 seats in parliament , and have kukiz '15 to back them on some things . 
  pis got elected thanks to po being lousy scoundrels , kukiz '15 for now did n't do much to loose their initial support , nowoczesna is a loudmouth-do-nothing-good party with is considered po-bis , no matter how they are portrayed in germany . 
  others do not count for now . 
  nowoczesna with sld ( post communists that did n't get to parliament ) try to create inner disturbance by saying democracy is in danger . 
  it is in no less danger than it was for last 10 years . 
  pis is just doing everything in 10x pace po was doing . 
  they are doing exactly the same as previous government did but soooo much faster and you can easily notice that . 
  latest polls from some crappy surveying agency portrayed as woohoo serious and reliable source say that miraculously nowoczesna is leader with almost 30 % support . 
  some private media in poland does not even hide with their lies . 
  this poland vs. poland war is disgusting . 
  `` divide et impera '' one could say . 
  but that is for some time now . 
  if pis will restrain itself from being 100 % pis they can achieve quite much ( which is something i fear tbh ) seeing what is happening in europe . 
  constitutional tribunal or public media wo n't be a problem in about month or two - most will forget about it . 
  same as it was before with even bigger issues . 
  as for relations between our countries - believe it or not those are deteriorating for some time now and not thanks to kaczynski . 
  po is believed by , i 'd risk to say , 30-50 % of poles to be party under very big influence of madame merkel 's and germany ue mps . 
  tusk had no spine to say `` no '' for which he received his job in eu structures . 
  very much damage was done by german eu mps like schultz and it keeps on and on . 
  resentment about ww2 is almost gone ( seriously how can one blame anyone for his grandparents deeds ? 
  ) , but with every stupid interview , during which german mps trying to even remotely suggest poland will be forced to do sth , that resentment comes back from the basement . 
  fact that germany is key player in eu ( you actually steer eu , which is obvious considering your global position ) is n't helping in this matter as well . 
  you know `` third reich = eu '' . 
  politicians are doing bad job to keep our neighbour relations at a friendly level . 
  with the immigrants crisis happening and our way different stances on the matter it will be rather hard to meet in the middle . 
  let 's hope for the best . 
   you will be a major player in europe in the future this is something i ca n't believe . 
  i read few reports but still - it 's like reading science fiction . 
  how on earth ? 
  it wo n't happen for itself , so who will lead us to that bright future ? 
  good night . 
   ignoring that these events were n't known until several days after and media ca n't report on something they do n't know abou do you really believe that ? 
  do you really suggest reporters do not use twitter , instagram and facebook ? 
  really ? 
   and no , these laws are not suited to suppress criticism or for general censorship . 
  recent events suggest otherwise . 
   if you think breaking with your own family and community is easy . 
  think a little . 
  if your community is disrespecting , intolerant or even criminal it is very easy . 
  if community says women are to be treated as items , every nonbeliever is your enemy , is is good , women are to be raped , `` this is community area and only community laws apply '' , others should change to community willing , then that community is something barbarian would stick to . 
  think a little . 
  we are n't exactly considering healthy communities . 
  we are n't exactly considering all `` communities '' to be like that as well . 
   it should be perfectly possible to be both muslim and european . 
  your world view is disgustingly black and white . 
  and it is . 
  it is you who try to manipulate here . 
  i have no problem with integrated or willing to immigrants . 
  i have all the problems with those `` abusing hospitality '' . 
   or they can stay where their life is and create a parallel society , which is what they 're going to do if more people start thinking like you . 
  luckily there is no parallel society right now . 
  oh wait ... there are , in every country that gave muslims a chance . 
  every .

  nope , people from places where islam is one of the main factors influencing culture have higher chances to conmit terrorist attacks in europe . 
  i dont have medical degree but what tou suggesting might be true , society and beliefs might have an influence on mental ilnesses . 
   the main reason for the vote is the way that travellers from some eu countries are treated by america . 
  while most citizens of eu countries can travel to the united states without a visa , those from bulgaria , croatia , cyprus , poland and romania must still obtain one . 
  because the eu demands equal treatment of all its citizens in such matters , it says it is legally obliged to fight back . 
  trump has promised visa free travel at least for us , he just needs to fulfil his promise . 
  so it might be just a reminder for him . 
  implementaton of this idea requires approval of all countries , meaning it wo n't be a thing in this decade . 
  but again the timing of this idea is interesting . 
  of course they are ... 
  i would understand american now knowing that but european ... come on [ australia ] ( http://new1.fjcdn.com/comments/this+austria+australia+confusion+just+won+t+die+_bf0e8a9b4a9122276de22f0a47cb76cc.png ) [ austria ] ( https://neverpureandrarelysimple.files.wordpress.com/2015/06/1822_4594_500.jpeg ), 
  the problem is kaczy\u0144ski is not responsible for anything he does . 
  he might not be crazy , he might even have an idea what is happening but he can do whatever he wants . 
  so it begun , the greatest shitstorm of our time . 
  i am so ashamed right now . 
  i know we did not have the best gov , but this is just going full retard mode . 
  one should never go full retard . 
  it 's true and berlin is controlld by reptilians , the real question is who controls them, 
  indeed it is . 
  thank you guys !, 
  i am so sorry , they went full retard this time . 
  one should never go full retard, 
   myspace it must be very old then, 
  before us united they had a civil war , there ups and downs , but if france and germany stay on the right track , everything will be ok . 
  the issue here is mostly the refugee crisis , but syrian war ca n't last forever . 
  eu is preparing ammo for article 50 i see, 
  and this is an achievement how, 
   and polish conservatives sure every conservative is pis follower and hates owsiak, 
  leibnitz biscuits were reported by some news a while back , they had palm oil in poland and butter in germany, 
  possibly . 
  one thing is people here might not be ready for the increase of food prices , but another is that we often pay the same price for lower quality products which is funny because we are a pretty big food producer so the transportation costs are frequently lower, 
  bro you are in serious need of lifting . 
  african tier country, 
  i think you might have mixed countries . 
  you handed poland to soviet union with no marshall plan or any other help in 40s . 
  here in poland if you want to break the ice you start with a smalltalk and few jokes , but i have heard in finland it might be problematic sometimes . 
  the real question is , are we stronk yet ? 
  this , also people who tent to criticise china forget that current goverment and their ` capitalistic ' reforms resulted in milion of chineese living finally ( maybe for the first time ) in proper conditions and tens of milions not dying from the starvation ( which happened in chineese history ) . 
  i say saving people 's lifes is more important than gay laws . 
   video of man getting shot  cant see man getting shot ok, 
  i honestly never got ex-yugo banter,

  trade ? 
  companies in a region , shipping merchandise idk to sweden for example . 
  again , we failed to develop warminsko-mazurskie region , maybe this will help , but saying we wont gain anything is an overstatement imho . 
  but of course this investment might not be good value for money . 
  in your opinion there will be no gains . 
  the canal is intended to increase tourism and trade in warminso-masurskie which is the poorest region afaik . 
  another thing is that it might have a military justification . 
   nice illustration not mine , i am not a professional graphic designer able to perform this kind of work .

  eu has a comon foreign policy , mogherini 's position embodies it . 
  the example of this policy is visible for example in sactions on russia for crimea anexation . 
  so common foreign policy is already here and army is being slowly prepared . 
  so i say , we dont need federation for nukes , just common defense . 
  you can be potentially annihilated by nukes today , what are you talking about ? 
  wew butthurt is strong in this one . 
   permavirgin manlet this is your argument in this discussion ? 
  that is just sad . 
  no wonder you are downvoted here . 
  he is for further intergation , but the question is why is your view of future eu better than ours ? 
  why should we reform in your way ? 
  you dont want further integration , you want your way of further integration . 
  yeah and let 's go back to pre-wwii europe slaughtering ewch other . 
  lets have sum fun . 
  for people who do n't know the guy . 
  he de facto rules poland right now from behind the stage . 
  officially he is a head of our govermental party and normal member of parliment . 
  uk is leaving , france has nuks indeed , but they are french nukes , not eu ones . 
  no it is not , there are cities who want nuclear power plant here . 
  we just have coal which is cheaper . 
  long story , our gov meddles with constitutional tribunal and is heavily criticised by eu for it . 
  left wing want eu reformed into federation , it is also a different kind of eu . 
  our gov doesnt remotely go this far . 
  they are ok with current eu ( except for this contitutional tribunal shitsotem ) in addition they are first in line to support forming eu army . 
  yup and italy . 
  say jaros\u0142aw again , i dare you , i double dare you motherfucker , say jaros\u0142aw one more goddamn time !, 
  just bring your wages along . 
  poland is irrelevant . 
  dont overestimate our position . 
  our goverment is not eurosceptic . 
  they are strong eu supporters . 
  it has been said over and over again . 
  seriosuly , do you think all right wing parties are eurosceptic ? 
  and we have been the biggest benedicient of eu contributions after 2004 and a country which lost the most young population due to eu , who pay taxes in other eu countries now for the benefits we get . 
  if you think those contributions are even remotely comparable to benefits you get from single market ( ~ 45 % of british export goes to eu ) you have to be silly . 
  eu is not a charity for countries , it is a deal you win something , you lose something . 
  the money is in the single market . 
  or this is just a smokescreen for eu/russia to offer bielarus something, 
  everyone knows he is immortal duh ... 
  thanks for the good work with translation . 
  i wonder what does german press say about possible frexit ? 
  pls no, 
  i am afraid putin is also [ resourceless ] ( http://en.tradingeconomics.com/russia/gdp ), 
  good for you guys , i just read in polish press about it , keep on with a good work, 
  it seems \u0141ukaszenka reconsiderd bielarusian position afer crimea annexation , he knows what russian bases in bielarus mean . 
  you were born just in time for internet meme wars if this is what you are getting at,

  they thrive thus they attract people from all over the world . 
  big european cities did n't become rich because of multiculturalism . 
  like their countries , they were virtually homogeneous when they gained global recognition . 
  that made them more and more diverse . 
  what you are saying is effectively historical revisionism . 
   and of course it has a lot to do with being scared . 
  look at the voter profile of right-wing parties . 
  male , white , uneducated , poor . 
  of course these people are scared , they 've nothing to contribute in a world that 's tearing down artificial borders . 
  that 's one way of looking at it . 
  another one is that the poor blue-collar workers are the people who experience most of the negative effects of immigration and thus have the most legitimate reasons to think mass immigration is a bad thing . 
  they are the people who ca n't afford to move to a richer part of town when their neighborhoods start turning into immigrant ghettos . 
  they are the group most likely to see their wages stagnating or even dropping when a lot of migrants start applying for jobs . 
  they will experience a rise in crime rates typical for diverse low-income neighborhoods . 
  their kids will go to lower quality schools that will struggle with an influx of students who do n't use the local language at home . 
  they will see businesses moving out of their , now dangerous , neighborhoods and into the richer parts of town . 
  and so on , and so on . 
  the funniest thing about all this is that most of the pro-immigration and anti-redneck people tend to think they are leftists . 
  they are essentially telling poor native people to stop complaining about their deteriorating quality of life and simply pull themselves up by their bootstraps , thus mimicking a classical right-wing talking point . 
   the thing is that it does n't matter , because we were speaking of europe . 
  if a european country closes its border because it does n't want to take care of refugees , the country on the other side of the fence is european as well !, 
  `` the country on the other side of the fence is european as well '' ... what difference does that make ? 
  are you saying that borders are ok , when the other country is n't european ? 
   the original point was that i debunked your fantasy of impenetrable borders . 
  show me a quote where i 'm saying that borders are impenetrable . 
  i said : `` borders stopped the vast majority [ of immigrants ] and made immigration sustainable . 
  that control over the people who come is what prevents immigration from becoming a crisis . '', 
   i never compared it to the eu and that 's why your examples are irrelevant . 
  if you want to talk about the borders between the us and mexico or between east and west germany , then you have to look at them from the us ' and west-german perspectives , because they are comparable with eu 's situation . 
  the eu is not trying to keep people in , like mexico or east germany . 
  the situation in these states is irrelevant in this context . 
   my example was mexico not really . 
  you said `` the us border to mexico '' . 
  you described it from the us perspective . 
  anyway , you are still mixing up immigration with emigration . 
  the eu is not a state people are trying to get out of , so examples , of poor states trying to keep their citizens from emigrating , are irrelevant . 
   that 's what happened in east germany . 
  is it what happened in the us because of their mexican border ? 
  you know , the other example you brought up and are now ignoring , because it 's convenient to omit it . 
  also , you are conflating immigration with emigration . 
  we are talking about immigration , so we should be looking at the border from a west-german perspective . 
   and you just have no arguments left . 
  sure, 
   neither the us border to mexico nor the berlin wall ever managed to stop people . 
  correction - ` to stop all people ' . 
  the borders stopped the vast majority and made immigration sustainable . 
  that control over the people who come is what prevents immigration from becoming a crisis . 
   i would n't be paying for their poor racist 19th century asses . 
  leftist talking points , stereotypes about eastern europeans , the ` current year ' meme , and not a hint of self-reflection . 
  you 're the full package . 
   closing your border wo n't make them go away but it will keep them out . 
  that 's good enough . 
   parasite states like that need to leave the eu . 
  but ... but ... closing the eu 's borders on nationalists would n't make them go away !, 
   the eu never was nor ever will be a sole economic alliance i think that currently it 's much closer to being an economic alliance than a superstate and i would n't be surprised if the concept of federalization was eventually abandoned entirely . 
  nationalism is on the rise in many eu states and , after brexit , germany probably will gain even more power over the union , further reducing the influence smaller states have over the union 's policies . 
  these factors combined with general eu incompetence , like the inability to solve the migrant crisis , might cause multiple states to seek more autonomy and ultimately reshape the union . 
  we wanted to be part of an economic alliance , not the united states of europe . 
  [ like this guy , ] ( http://i.imgur.com/ogrzeu7.jpg ) but not as sexy . 
  they should send [ fratello metallo ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbiitsic4fo ) to the eurovision !, 
  [ the most official source there is . 
  our parliament . 
  ] ( http://sejm.gov.pl/sejm8.nsf/interpelacjatresc.xsp?key=5ca3b601 ) 922 240 visas for ukrainians in 2015 , that 's 11 % more than in 2014 . 
  in 2015 , almost 650 000 visas were given specifically because polish employers declared they have jobs for the applicants . 
  the rest can search for jobs . 
  i do n't . 
  i brought up the euro for context , to point out we had similar events , that were much more costly , that the general public supported . 
  wyd is n't uniquely expensive and is n't necessarily about appeasing clergy . 
  the latter thing he was suggesting here :  [ but yeah , it 's poland so when one bishop says anything , the whole nation nation falls to its knees . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4uia0v/pilgrims_flock_to_krak%c3%b3w_for_world_youth_days/d5q38zo ), 
  honestly , this does n't seem all that wasteful . 
  when you look at the long-term costs of building and maintaining the infrastructure ( mainly stadiums ) , euro 2012 had a much larger price tag and it was supposed to accomplish a similar goal - promote the participating cities and the country as a whole . 
  the specific pilgrims who will come for wyd may not be particularly rich , but the event will generate a lot of positive publicity around the world . 
  i 'm not saying wyd is a good investment , but it does n't look like a spectacularly terrible one either . 
  the euro probably cost us much , much more . 
  the national stadium alone cost around 2 billion pln ( 500 mil $ ) and it keeps generating losses every year . 
   i can swallow tourists , at least they leave money here . 
  but pilgrims are the opposite . 
  are they ? 
  what exactly are they getting for free ? 
  i have n't been following any of this and i 'm genuinely curious . 
  i thought wyd is comparable to a music festival or some sports tournament . 
  that people will come for the free ... uhm ... let 's say ` entertainment ' , but they will be paying for their hotel rooms , food , etc. . 
   tell me , who supports them and accepts them socially ? 
  yeah , it 's so hard to think of someone who does that ... 
  i do n't know . 
  i 'm not sure who she is , but her [ face looks familiar . 
  ] ( http://i.imgur.com/l5mb2py.jpg ) how many times has she attended their annual events ? 
  nine times ? 
  thanking them for the great work that they are doing . 
  is she an important person in your country ? 
   their believes are in no way socially acceptable in general . 
  no , only the most extreme of their beliefs are not socially acceptable . 
  they do n't want ` their ' land back anymore , but they would n't mind financial compensations and they are doing historical revisionism by pushing the narrative , that all refugees/expelled are equal , that it 's ok to ignore what were the events that made them displaced people , and who caused the events . 
  this soft version of their beliefs is socially acceptable . 
  political figures go to their events and praise bdv . 
  it 's seen as normal . 
  nobody 's outraged . 
   so stop implying that i 'm one of them evil germans who want to claim that germany did no wrong . 
  i was n't saying that .

  lax gun laws did n't prevent 9/11, 
   i can use the exact same argument to say `` do n't i have a right to know if the farmer who grew it was black '' . 
  maybe if ate farmers , but we 're talking about the food . 
  no , racist bigotry is n't comparable to anti-gmo sentiment. , do n't try to muddy the waters with this shit like comparing discrimination against black people to hurt feefees of megacorps . 
  it 's insulting . 
  there 's no argument against gmo labels except minuscule costs suffered by multimillionaire companies . 
  corporations saving few bucks trampling will of the people is incompatible with the premises of democratic society . 
  you 're ignorant about europe but you think you know better if we 're homogenius or not than us europeans ? 
  yes , we 're too poor , please invesrt in eastern poland . 
  they 're not `` highly '' similar at all . 
  lie . 
   you still have n't provided a source indicating that ttip aims to prohibit countries from introducing mandatory gmo labeling the article, 
   i can say that women buy more tampons than men without looking at the data . 
  this would only work if there was undeniable link between melanin and crime . 
  in democratic country people 's fears are more important than corporations losing 0,0005 $ per label . 
  i 'd lose all my scepticism if you commented on / r/cats , / r/pics etc. 
   never said the data does n't matter , said i can make the statement without looking at the data . 
  this statement is self-contradicting . 
  no , you prove black people in poland commit more crimes * per capita * than the rest . 
  i 'll wait some days to see your page again , right now it 's flooded with comments from this thread . 
   right , and people are n't eating any ingredient called gmo . 
  yeah the food containing gmos or made from gmos does n't have an ingredient `` called gmo '' . 
  congratz you proved your discussion skills by pointing out minor semanticist error . 
   organized movements in support of mandatory gmo labeling are funded by organic groups : shove that copy-pasta where sun does n't shine . 
  we 're talking about europe , not your united states of lobbyland . 
  there 's no `` crimes committed by students '' statistics provided by police to public . 
  besides why would i show you the data if you 've already stated that data do n't matter to you ? 
  so you 'd have 18 people shooting each other , just great . 
  the guns did n't end the siege , the professional , trained , experienced elite armed force ended the siege . 
   i think the question you 're looking to answer is do black poles commit more crimes per capita than white poles ? 
  they do n't as they 're mostly students or their descendants . 
   without even looking at the data i am going to safely answer yes . 
  thanks for outright admitting you 're an idiot . 
  that would still be higher than most of europe . 
  you can always come through russia !, 
   well , but that logic we could label the brand and colour of the truck that delivered the produce to the shop . 
  colour of trucks would be relevant if people ate trucks . 
  besides people do n't care about these information or whatever else you 're going to make up , but they care about gmo . 
  will of the people should trump corpo-money . 
  i 'm not arguing about guns in usa anymore . 
  how would guns help in paris ? 
  i know , that 's why i wo n't argue about guns in us anymore . 
  like mothzillas to nuclear reactor . 
  you mean mexico ? 
  is n't the gun flow going * from * usa rather than * to * usa ? 
  nevermind , some american showed me that the 2 ^ nd amendment prevents installing european-like laws restricting private sale between individuals . 
  i ca n't call it a loophole if it 's goal of the law . 
  [ fortunately europeans invented method to prevent such tragedies ] ( http://joemonster.org/i/ab/ruminiya_001.jpg ), 
  ` muricans can have all the rest of reddit , but here we use * our * insufferable memes !, 
   it 's not a loophole as it is a feature of the 2nd amendment . 
  in this case i really do n't see any sense advocating for gun control in usa . 
  i wo n't argue about guns in america from now on . 
  black people in poland commit less crimes per capita than white usians . 
   you can , as a private citizen , sell your firearm to whomever you want ( unless you knowingly sell to a felon ) , but this has nothing to do with gun shows . 
  so there is a loophole , just elsewhere . 
  yeah , i would n't trust that / u/pheyniex guy . 
  thank you for your service . 
  oh well , my mistake . 
  i wanted to tease him a lik ' bit longer and their rules do n't allow it after you posted it . 
  but feel free to do it . 
  there is rational reason to label gmo . 
  people want to be informed about what they eat . 
  we need to enforce strict toddler control !, 
  humans are just the worst . 
  society should be 100 % robots like in switzerland . 
  why would food prices change in greece if we do n't agree to ttip ? 
  ukrainians and russians were considered `` brother nations '' . 
  look at them now . 
  no , they are meant to reduce the number of regular people shooting each other . 
  it worked in australia . 
  gun laws are n't targeting terrorist attacks though . 
  someone 's jealous he did n't land on a comet . 
   how many arent just from europe ? 
  why would this matter ? 
   gmo labeling infringes on people 's rights to sell their product without a meaningless warning label . 
  there 's no such rights . 
  and thinking of corporations as people with rights leads to corpocracy . 
   how about an `` evolution is a theory '' label on science books ? 
  in poland we have `` evolution is a theory '' inside our books right next to definition of scientific theory and vast amount of proofs . 
  besides that 's not comparable . 
  maybe if the sticker said `` this books contains theory of evolution '' . 
  but the books must be sanctioned by government so the sticker would be on evey schoolbook . 
   so if people want to ban homosexuality , that 's okay ? 
  no because that infringes people 's rights in this case right to sexual freedom . 
  do n't make such absurd comparisons . 
  and still have school shootings, 
  no , it 's just you failing to notice obvious non serious smack-talk . 
  [ whoosh ] ( http://i3.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/facebook/000/992/401/e37.png ), 
   because there has to be some justification . 
  there is , will of majority of people . 
  well , they worked in australia . 
  country `` big and diverse '' with very autonomous states and history of spread gun ownership . 
   i would argue that 's a mental health issue . 
  that 's another issue . 
  you could prevent that `` drop in the ocean '' covering loopholes allowing people to get guns without background checks . 
  europe is made of diverse , heterogenous countries most of which have tens of million people . 
  germany and russia are federations . 
  south italian `` dialects '' are different languages to those used in venezia . 
  all balkan countries have significant muslim minority . 
  switzerland has ** four ** official languages , not even counting regional dialects .

  the factories built there also have special deals that exempt them from paying taxes for n years , they also bully their workers and hire only `` temporary employees '' through third party agencies . 
  pemanent `` temporaries '' do not get social benefits , and could be forced to work 12h shifts . 
  they bring workers from rural areas from all over the voivodeship in buses every morning to perform this almost slave labor . 
  this is what i call `` bad foreign investment '' . 
  i do n't care if such inverstors pack up and go away . 
  naah . 
  we need her cash . 
  though , i think we should try to do exactly enough to attract her money , and take no step further . 
  seeing this kind of pean in forbes , of all papers , means she 's got a lot more than we should have given her . 
  that also match my view that poland 's governance is catering more to foreign capital than to their own citizen . 
  meh , 2 years ago i was all surprised when poland started to attract praise from abroad . 
  that was strange , all my life my country only was given shit , and mostly for good reasons . 
  since then i started to notice the good parts of my country - it 's safe , it 's wealth is small but moderately evenly distributed , we 've managed maintain a big chunk of welfare state , like free ( unpaid ) education and healthcare , despite our poverty . 
  it 's also good to take that praise with a grain of salt - here is venture capitalist happy with poland , because she 's going to get a lot of return from investment in our country . 
  that means that profits made possible by us are going out of this country . 
  we should n't make people like her so happy , we should make ourselves happy . 
  or better yet - let 's make polish official language of england . 
  there are enough polish speakers there for that :d, 
  soo , all you wanted to say is that politics is about getting power . 
  fine job citing your political science textbook . 
  why is this a response to any of my posts ? 
  um , actually i was expecting this type of comment . 
  first of all , `` polish leadership '' in my opinion includes more people than just current government crew . 
  leaders of poland include opposition leaders , various newspapers ' lead journalists , businessmen , lobbyists and other people that are often heard by the public . 
  and about this awareness : [ here ] ( http://wyborcza.biz/biznes/1,100969,16366830,szczurek_odpowiada_pis__po_zwiekszylo_zatrudnienie_.html ) our finance minister talks about it . 
  he does n't seem to believe that we 're in danger of stepping into that trap . 
  nonetheless , he knows what it is , and he knows that some other people jugde poland as susceptible to this kind of trouble . 
  third , being aware of the danger and knowing how to defend agaist it are two different things . 
  i never said polish government acts to avoid this trap . 
  i also never said it does n't as i do n't even know what steps would need to be undertaken to do so . 
  fourth , you seem really upset about the ruling party . 
  is it really worth your emotions ? 
  you nervous receptors wear down , you know . 
  still , you take people prisoner - you better care for them . 
  if they could n't feed them or treat them why did n't they set free the prisoners ? 
  i mean , it 's fucking better than letting them die . 
  treatment of bolshevik soldiers after 1920 war was inhuman and inexcusable . 
  i hope poland apologized for it . 
  same thing about bereza kartuska , where polish government kept and tortured firstly ukrainian nationalists and then just about everyone without trial and without release date . 
  our past is not made of saints , either . 
  especially second republic was kind of a dick country . 
  yeah , the so called `` middle-income trap '' . 
  luckily , poland leadership is aware of this danger . 
  i do n't really know what could be done to avoid the trap , but at least we know of it . 
  ahahaha perfect mashup !, 
  actually , recently people have been talking about * republika mo\u0142dowy * . 
  maybe that 's just a copy from english but i 've heard this version , too . 
  um , if nato refuses to help the baltics , it 's done . 
  all parties will start to look for another options to secure themselves . 
  other multilateral alliances will follow between nato countries and non-nato countries . 
  all bets will be off . 
  i know for sure that my country relies on nato fro security and if it comes to an end , we will try very hard to embed ourselves in another security framework , as wide as possible , just to be sure we can deter and/or counter russia . 
  actually , if nato will not defend the baltics i will go out on the street to demand that my country starts a nuclear program . 
  the trianon . 
  so unrevised . 
   turbofolk i. . . that 's ... the perfect name . 
  ah , good uncle ~ ~ stalin ~ ~ putin , always have time for the little ones , when he 's not shoving ak47 's into wrong hands . 
  + wifi, 
  breaking !, 
  conspiracy !, 
  the germans are turks , too !, 
   embassy in philippines whaaa ... can i apply ? 
  i mean ... why such a post is left unoccupied ? 
  this is kind of embarassing , but in poland romania is pretty unknown and only associated with romanian gypsies who often immigrated here . 
  i 'd be grateful if you would point out my errors . 
  i 'm always happy to learn . 
  this is a complex matter . 
  medival and early modern lithuania was something else than it is today . 
  while it started with the same ethnolinguistic group ( the lithuanians ) it absorbed so much of the ruthenian culture that it became basically a ruthenian state . 
  with time , almost all of the ruling class of this state became ruthenian or polish , while the lithuanian people remained in the northern part of this state ( where today 's lithuania is ) . 
  now , lithuanians had a national revival around interwar period and they started to perceive domination of polish culture as a threat to their own . 
  when poles fought them over wilno city - current capital of lithuania - that 's when the relations went sour for real . 
  on the other hand , the ruthenians are believed to be descendants of the people we once had a union with . 
  and guess where they are now ? 
  they 're belarussians and ukrainians . 
  poles support ukrainians most of all europe ( i think ) , and whenever belarussians decide to align themlseves with the west , they can count on similar support . 
  from what i 've found it 's about equal when it comes to deposits , and slightly more bituminous coal is being mined than lignite . 
  i never knew poland mines so much lignite , to be honest , everyone was just talking about bituminous coal in my hometown . 
  we 've got massive deposits of coal in upper silesia region , along with mines , coal plants and all the infrastructure . 
  even as our mining industry falls apart we still rely on coal to produce energy . 
  i know some hungarian also !!!, 
  poland also expanded it 's storage capabilities recently . 
  iirc we 've got one of the biggest gas tanks that could store enough gas for 6 months . 
  i do n't know if they 're full already , but there 's that , too . 
   swylywlsylywlysic \u015awinouj\u015bcie , close enough :d, 
  this is your brain on catholicism . 
  i used to think that komorowski is just another shill . 
  but now , despite his lack of tack and inferior ortography , he seems to me like a respectable fellow . 
  it was a pretty succesful ad campaign by poland . 
  the ads were placed in many highly regarded politcal and economical newspapers . 
  they showed a concerned boy and text : `` what will you say , when your child asks you why did n't you invest in eastern poland ? '', 
  it stuck , the image and the text bordering absurdity spawned a lot of jokes . 
  the stork brings it . 
  well , after mr. motorola delivers we 're going to have some things to study , 
  i do n't know , i ca n't be bothered to check , but it 's very likely . 
  they 're still aligned pro-russia , but do assert their `` independence '' in some cases . 
  well ... recently they 're trying to maintain healthy distance . 
  or to appear to do so . 
  belarussian officials were present on the official kiev government celebration , lukashenka condemns donbas separatists etc. 
  at the same time , they 're firmly in the customs union , but also reexporting shit to russia after an embargo .

  the majdanek camp is just outside the city . 
  at least two million people died in these four locations between october 1941 and november 1943 , and thousands more were shot in the forests around them . 
  `` the logistical operation of the death camps was run here . 
  the organisational geniuses were here , the people that came up with industrial killing , '' says pietrasiewicz . 
  `` the main warehouses of the reinhard action , with millions of shoes , clothes , jewellery and gold , were all here in lublin . '', 
  this guy and his institution is not only working on jewish past of lublin , though this is the main focus . 
  he tries to preserve histories of all the people that lived in lublin . 
  btw , i find it funny ( though not surprising ) that while names like poland , poles , jews , be\u0142\u017cec , lublin , treblinka , etc were used repeatedly in the article , not once were the germans or germany mentioned  it would be rude , obviously , to suggest that this nazi army that demolished whole district of a city and built a death camp there came from any particular country or shared anything else except the ideology . 
  no problem with mentioning poles , though . 
  apparently only nazi germans were killing jews , but all poles did . 
  i especially like the reasoning that goes : 1 . 
  pis is great and much better than po because po was evil . 
  pis can do whatever it does with institutions because po did the same . 
   where were the media there ? 
  covering the story . 
  it was all over media . 
  i do n't get your point ? 
  they would have to admit they put person with criminal past as a minister . 
  now they can pretend he 's clean cause he was technicly never sentenced . 
  it 's another mockery of law , and they are n't even in power for a month . 
   regular seat changes majority in parliament , president , senate , and all the constitutional tribunal judges . 
  thank god they do n't have the constitutional majority , but with all the constitutional judges it 's almost as if they hav that too . 
  refusing to give smaller parliament parties access to some informations . 
  i really hope it 's fearmongering , but right now pis is checking all the boxes of autoritharian government in making . 
  you basicaly say `` previous government used legal loophole to change 3 out of 15 constitutional court judges , therefore it 's ok for current government to create a bigger loophole in law , and change all of them . '', 
  also president duda outright refused to perform his duties ( take an outh from the judges so they can perform their duties ) for over a month , waiting for pis to win elections and change the judges . 
  this is open mockery of law , by the person that should be the guarant of the law . 
  previous governments misdeeds are n't an excuse . 
  last time ukraine tried to help russia by dealing with their volunteers - russian army shelled ukrainians across the border . 
  you suggesting i should do the same ? 
  would be nice if russian state paid for what its `` volunteers '' did . 
  they were volunteers , not fault of ukrainian state . 
  see  ? 
  seems funny to me . 
  ca n't be trusted to do that . 
  if you think insults harm your lady you are expected to defend her ( if possible and if the defending wo n't cause more harm than ignoring it ) . 
  not by honour but because it 's the moral thing to do . 
  what 's more - morality expects you to defend your lady and anybody else . 
  if your lady insulted a homeless drunkard - morality expects you to defend him , honour - not so much ( at least not as it is applied ) . 
  and then there 's the question of the way you defend the lady honour - if you use violence or threaths - imho it 's not really making the world a better place . 
  but it depends of course , verbal violence is a thing too . 
  anyway - it 's not a simple matter , and honour is just a heuristic . 
  why use heuristic when you can derive the correct behaviour from the first principles ? 
  adhering strictly to a heuristic makes people do stupid things causing more suffering than nessesary ( duels , honour killings etc ) . 
  morality is the exact science of what is right and wrong . 
  honour can either make you do the same thing ( so it 's redundant ) , or other thing ( so it 's suboptimal ) . 
  honour is focusing too much on bragging rights and ego to be a good morality system . 
  it ignores many external costs . 
  we have the first principles - we should use them instead of relying on a heuristic designed in middle ages , in a society that was objectively less ethical than ours . 
  honour is simplification of morality for dumb people . 
  local funeral company in \u0141\u00f3d\u017a bribed some guys in ambulance crews to phone them when somebody dies so they can be the first to come and propose the family their services . 
  it was already illegal , but then some of these medical guys made it worse by purposely harming people close to death so that they can get their money from the funeral company . 
  for example injecting them with pavulon which is useful in some cases , but in other can bring death . 
  there was a huge scandal and they are jailed obviously , but the reputation hit 's still there . 
  as for firefighters - voluneer service is one thing , and nobody can blame them for having a second job , but there are also proffesional , paid firefighters , and they have some priviledges from communist times , that make some people jelaous . 
  for example even if you were working in office in firefighting departmen - you can retire at 40 . 
  at least that was the case a few years ago , maybe that changed , i od n't know . 
  you can see the 1939 borders in poland . 
  the underdeveloped west and north , 
   he was n't designed to intimidate anyone . 
  he was shouting `` i will kill all pis-members '' ( or pis-supporters , depending how you interprete it ) . 
  another example of ( prevented ) terror in poland - http://www.rmf24.pl/raporty/raport-udaremniony-zamach/udaremniony-zamach-fakty/news-brunon-kwiecien-przyznal-sie-ale-nie-poczuwa-sie-do-winy,nid,1096316 also we had many cases of violence towards state officials and civilians after ww2 , that would have been called terror , but are n't because it was performed by `` the cursed soldiers '' against communists . 
  and it was after ww2 . 
  it 's the case of `` our terrorists are freedom fighters '' . 
  we had terrorist attacks in poland , they just were n't labeled as such because they were n't performed by muslim immigrants . 
  why not ? 
  at some point threat / cost to avoid is so low it 's best to do nothing . 
  it 's like late 80s , but there 's just one russian soldier in the city . 
  refusing to do what we promised is affecting the diplomacy and economy already . 
  if eu falls because of all the crisises and disagreements poland will be one of the biggest losers . 
  comparing that to the relatively small costs of immigration we would bear is just insane . 
  poverty and political isolation has very real costs , including in human lives . 
  if poland was n't in eu - we would be much less wealthy , and there would be tousand more deaths . 
  comparing that to few hundred people dead because of terrorists - it 's still a good deal , even if we had the same problems france has now . 
  of course people would shout me to death that i 'm unrealistic leftist scum , or that i do n't care for the terrorist victims . 
  but looking at this from strictly rational pov - if you spend money on terror prevention instead of on roads - you are increasing amount of deaths in you country . 
  if you spend money on terror prevention instead of healthcare ( especially the early detection programs ) - you are increasing the amount of deaths . 
  and choosing to be marginalized or isolated in eu is making poland economicaly worse of , in exchange for false hopes of security , in a matter that even in the worst affected eu countries kills insignificant number of people . 
  poland : not really . 
  poland was  99 % polish last time i 've checked . 
  now it 's probably more like 97 % , because there 's many ukrainians there after their currency made working in poland very profitable , but very few people have anything against them ( they are n't that different from poles ) . 
  are you suggesting poles will look at succesfull model of islamized cities and try to immitate them by absorbing their religion ? 
  why do you care how many people will immediately escape to germany from poland ? 
  they escaped to the west ( with some exceptions , like mamid khalidow ) . 
  same thing would happen with these new refuges btw . 
  so the polish media and politicians are making huge deal out of a matter that does n't really change anything for poles . 
  i think in this particular subject you should n't shout `` it 's not us ''  . 
  btw germans were there too . 
  poland is the most religious and the most welcoming of these 4 . 
  czech republic is the least religious and the 2-nd least welcoming . 
  also , at least in poland , it 's the young people that are the most anti-immigration ( and they are less religious than old people on average ) . 
  hard to make it about religion , really , or at least the correlation isnt ' the way you propose . 
  obiviously . 
  democracy is n't the same as tyrany of majority , and being democratc does n't absolve you of the international law . 
  btw , poland is the only big country in v4 , and it has majority supporting the refuges ( taking them temporarily , with many conditions ) . 
  if you added up the populations and counted the votes together it 's possible that the majority would still support taking refuges temporarily . 
   allegedly he wanted the document to be found . 
  how can ministry confirm what dead people thought before death ? 
  i do n't doubt they had the passports and that they moved as the documents show . 
  i just find the explanation `` it clearly was planned to make immigration policy look bad '' much weaker ( and suspiciously convenient ) than `` it means they used that passport '' .

  only later in life i appreciated how common reading list gives everybody in a country common cultural basis . 
  it makes some jokes or analogies possible that would n't work in country without such common base . 
  there was occasional repetition of some aspects of ortography , grammar and style after the first few years , but rarely . 
  it was called `` polish language lessons '' , but it was more about culture than language . 
  also linked heavily with polish history , even though there was separate course about just history . 
  at the final exam ( matura ) there was both text to write , and a test . 
  novadays matura is different and i do n't really know how it looks like - kids have to prepare a speech and deliver it iirc , and there 's still a test also . 
  - polish ( native ) - english - german ( badly ) i can mostly understand ukrainian , slovak and czech . 
  i would like to learn spanish and korean at some point . 
  another 30 % of consumption is satisfied with gas mined in poland . 
  that leaves around 20 % to be imported from others in case russia shuts down gaz pipes to us entirely . 
  not impossible . 
  more important is the adaptability . 
  gazprom signs long-term `` take or pay '' contracts , if you do n't buy the minimal amount each month you need to pay fine . 
  it 's better to buy on as-needed basis , even if it 's slightly more expansive . 
  and no matter what magic russia uses , with more competition i do n't see them hiking the price . 
  it just means gazprom has to take into account this possibility , when it tries to blacmail poland or czech republic , or when it is setting prices differently for these countries . 
  we 're not gon na invade anybody , especially not through sea . 
  ukraine parliament recently recognized upa `` heroes of their nation '' . 
  they were responsible for hundreds of tousands of massacred poles in eastern ukraine . 
  they would come to a mostly-polish village on what they considered their land , and kill everybody there , including these that tried to escape , then go to the next one , repeat . 
  ukrainians would be warned and get out earlier . 
  of course some warned their polish neighbors . 
  most did n't . 
  that happened to hundreds of villages . 
  ukrainians had their reasons ( polish government made some dick-moves in interwar period , and they wanted independence ) , but nobody killed them . 
  i 'm not demanding financial recompensation , but recognizing such people as heroes is kinda bad style , do n't you think ? 
  same with russians building monuments to stalin and glorifying him , when he ordered murders of millions of civilians , russians , ukrainians , balts , poles , etc. 
  he did `` national actions '' in 1937-39 , when everybody of specific nationality in ussr would be imprisoned and most of them killed by nkvd . 
  over a hundred tousand people killed because their last name sounds polish . 
  imagine fbi rounding all irish people in usa and killing 80 % -90 % of them . 
  and then usa says the president that ordered this was `` a little tyrant , but ok '' , and he has monuments all over the country and just married pairs would have photos with these monuments for good luck . 
  imagine germans doing this with hitler monuments . 
  but they lost a war so it 's different . 
  there 's a reason to stop this bullshit . 
  i 'd draw the line at 1918 . 
  or at 1900 for the countries that existed before ww1 . 
  otherways we wo n't see the end of it . 
  i think poland should say sorry to belarus , lithuania and ukraine for 1919-1921 period politics ( annexion of wilno , and selling half of belarus and ukraine to ussr after won war ) . 
  i also think we should say sorry to czech republik and slovakia for zaolzie and 1968 ( kaczy\u0144ski kinda did it , but it would be nice to be more specific ) . 
  i also think czech republic and slovakia should say sorry for their annexion of zaolzie in 1920 . 
  and ukraine should apologise poland for the ethnic cleansing on polish civilians that their newly-made heroes ( upa ) did during ww2 . 
  and of course russia should say sorry for the polish operation of nkvd in 1937-38 , katy\u0144 , the post war murders of polish patriots , and 50 years of occupation , but i do n't hold my breath there . 
  another example : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polish_operation_of_the_nkvd_%281937%e2%80%9338%29  the polish operation of the soviet nkvd security force in 1937 -- 1938 was a top secret mass operation of the nkvd carried out against purported polish agents in the soviet union during the period of the great purge . 
  it was ordered by the politburo against the so-called `` polish spies '' and customarily interpreted by the nkvd officials as relating to `` absolutely all poles '' . 
  it resulted in the sentencing of 139,835 people , and secret prison executions of 111,091 ethnic poles , [ 2 ] as well as those accused of working for poland . 
  [ 3 ]  the majority of the victims were ethnically polish but not all , according to timothy snyder , who gives a conservative estimate of 85,000 confirmed poles executed simultaneously across the country . 
  [ 5 ] the remainder were ` suspected ' of being polish , without further inquiry . 
  [ 4 ]  in order to speed up the process the nkvd personnel reviewed local telephone books and arrested persons with polish-sounding names . 
  in leningrad alone , almost 7,000 citizens were rounded up this way . 
  a vast majority of such nominal `` suspects '' were executed within 10 days of arrest . 
  [ 6 ] in the fourteen months after the adoption of order \u2116 00485 , some 143,810 people were taken into custody , of whom 139,885 were sentenced by extrajudicial organs , and 111,091 executed ( nearly 80 % of all victims ) . 
  there 's no such thing . 
  400 tons and just 5 km ? 
  you can pave them with that gold . 
  and what will they do to enforce high prices for everyone ? 
  gazprom will stop selling gas to the whole eu ? 
  when there 's 28 customers and 1 producer - the producer is the boss , it can price each customer according to how much he is dependent on that producer . 
  this is current situation . 
  when there 's 1 customer and 1 producer - there 's no boss , just partners . 
  try to enforce too high prices and you default . 
  i understand why they try to scare people to preserve the current situation , of course . 
  but israel could sell weapons to ukraine anyway ? 
  there were no ban on this ? 
  yes , and i happen to think it was smart . 
  many people think otherways . 
  still it was n't smart to allow people that were agents of communists regime to perform public functions , especially without publishing the fact about them . 
  they were very easy to blackmail by various factions ( their oponents , russians , their former coworkers ) . 
  probably because you live in france  right now it 's 4 rp all over again , most young people are against po , and they buy into this whole `` round table was a treason '' story . 
  wa\u0142\u0119sa is very divisive figure in poland . 
  in communist security documents he was registered as agent ( could be on purpose to defame him before oposition , could be legit ) , and he got a lot money from somewhere ( he said he won lottery a few times ) in ~ ~ eighties ~ ~ seventies . 
  a lot of people suspect him of being communist agent put in there to control the transformation so that `` the right people '' still have money and power . 
  and after he became president he was very kind to communists , saying poland needs both lft and right politicians ( well , it was true , but at the time left = = old postcommunists that had blood on their hands ) . 
  he also was against publishing who from the politicians in power were communist security agents , and against forbidding them to be in government . 
  they could also use conventional weapons with much more liberty ( for example reacting to artilery shooting through the border by sending own army there ) . 
  as it is - russians were shelling ukrainian positions from russia , and ukrainians could n't finish off the rebels . 
  nukes on both sides would also mean un , nato , eu would fear escalation a lot more , so they would enact harsher sanctions much earlier , and lobby for peace on ukrainian terms much harder . 
  russia knowing this would n't start aggression in the first place . 
   because the cost-to-gain ratio is too high . 
  it 's so because of nukes . 
  take them away and cost-to-gain changes significantly to the favour of country with nukes . 
  which you can observe in ukraine right now . 
   to use them on cities is genocide . 
  to have them is to threaten their use . 
  hence , having them is a threat of genocide and disgustingly immoral . 
  it 's not genocide , it 's mass murder ( genocide is when you are selective about what nationality you kill ) . 
  also if ukraine had nukes a few dozen tousand people would still live . 
  what is better - threathening `` genocide '' , and never having to do it , or allowing people to die in war because of nto having weapons ? 
  i 've read it in some fabular book about xviiith century nobility ( son of a noble had to become a trader to save the palace from debts , but he had to hide he was a nobleman , to avoid losing the status ) . 
  ca n't remember the title right now . 
   in the first rzeczpospolita no nobleman dared to be a trader , it would be blasphemy and would void his nobility . 
  lack oc competition for foreign traders allowed them to dictate much higher prices . 
  nobles had the worst opinion about traders , because they `` destroy the crown , steal from poland and give weath to foreign countries and to themselves '' not very good source , i conceed . 
  not officialy . 
  he 's self-styled ( but probably comes from real nobility from before ww2 ) . 
  also if he 's a businessmen he can not claim to be a polish noble . 
  szlachta ( polish nobility ) honour codex forbidden to work with own hands , being a trader ( or a businessmen i guess ) counts as working so you can not claim to be noble . 
  dumb rule , but so is the whole concept of nobility , 
  if you are public person you should have less protection than normal people ( as in eu ) , not more ( as in russia ) . 
  so for example photoshopped president photo with naked tits should be legal no matter if he agree , while john smith photo should n't be legal if he disagree .

  balcerowicz was still in primary school back then . 
  makes you feel bad you have n't invested in eastern poland in 1990 , eh ? 
   so let me get this straight , everyone who disagree with you or says something you dislike must be a stormfront/european shill spreading their vile hatred ? 
  is that what you honestly believe ? 
  no , of course not . 
  the post i was responding to seems to be deleted , but there was some nasty white supremacist stuff over there about black monkeys finding white girlfriends and getting them knocked up during the one year they stayed in europe while their immigration papers were processed so that they ca n't get deported anymore ... 
  i respect other opinions , but reminiscencing spain `` having the balls '' to kick out all jews 500 years ago is n't something i can get behind . 
   what happened to your empire of `` peace and equality '' ? 
  they went a bit `` too far '' - requiring unanimity voting of every noble to pass any sensible change to law effectively stagnated the progress of entire country , since poor lesser nobles were bought out by neighboring empires to veto any laws . 
  as a result we got conquered and divided by 3 empires we were between - austro-hungary , germany and russia - and disappeared from map of europe for 123 years . 
  i 'm not plumber myself . 
  i just respect hard work and people who do it . 
  `` polish plumber '' was one of faces of pr campaign our government used to ease up the fears of some countries about opening the borders when we joined schengen zone and it somehow sticked . 
  as for your question , i do believe they should be turned back , as the article states . 
  europe currently has enough problems itself , with 40 % youth unemployment in greece or spain and we should focus on helping those people instead . 
  ( not to mention that the people who would really need help from that region and earn 60 $ / mo , simply ca n't afford 2000 $ smugglers ' fee to begin with ) . 
  only once the situation in europe improves enough , we will be able to dedicate spare resources to help people in other continents . 
  i just hate people who use this situation to spew racist bullshit . 
  reducing dude who just landed on motherfucking comet to tears , and forcing him to apologize for wearing `` offensive '' t-shirt on the day that was supposed to be the triumph of his life , is not ` feminism ' i can get behind . 
  professional ` feminists ' making five figures a year , invited to morning coffee show to talk how hard modern women have it hard in current society , while some women in poland earn 300eur/mo for fulltime job , is not something i get behind . 
  trying to pass affirmative action-like laws that give people positions not because how competent they are , but rather by what kind of genitals they were born with , is not something i get behind . 
  promoting sexual education among younger women to help reduce the number of unwanted pregnancies is something i can get behind . 
  encouraging women from poor/village backgrounds to pursue higher careers if that 's their desire , rather than getting molded into `` traditional '' child-bearing role , is something i support . 
  putting pressure on countries where women are really discriminated against ( i mean saudi arabia , india etc. 
  ; no , `` manspreading '' is not discrimination ... ) to change their attitude , is something i can support . 
  and so on ... 
   ehhhhememememememem in 1492 poland and lithuania were two different countries . 
  so you 're wrong . 
  our united country was build on `` mind your own business '' and response to night of saint bartholomew . 
  of course . 
  i do n't see poland as sole remainder of plc legacy . 
  it was an union of two equal countries . 
  i used `` my '' in similar manner to how someone from wales or scotland can talk about `` us '' when referring to uk . 
   now that you 've rescued us , could you please take a look at this toilet ? 
  i ate a lot of indian food recently . 
  wow , so edgy ... has it ever occurred to you that the world simply ca n't run with only ceos and `` marketing managers '' , and without those plumbers you show contempt toward to , you 'd be either drowning in your own shit , or running outside to outhouse and shit into hole in ground ? 
  skilled manual labor is quite regarded profession in poland ( not as high as university proffesor , nurse or teacher , but way above politican , makler or office worker ), 
  sigh ... stormfront/european is leaking again . 
  polish plumber to the rescue !, 
   yeah right !, 
  first the feminists will protest , then all mainstream liberals , the newspapers will call any politician in favor of deportation a racist and a nazi , because they want the west to collapse and will criticize anyone in favor of saving it . 
  put your tinfoil hat off . 
  i ca n't speak for west , but in eastern europe no-one gives a fuck about `` feminists '' ( in western sense of that world , mind you . 
  we 're all for equality ) and twitter warriors . 
   the spanish managed to deport all the jews and muslims from their country almost 500 years ago , but we 're a lot more sentimental nowadays . 
  oh , yes . 
  and my country welcomed them with open arms . 
  soon after , we build empire stretching from today 's estonia to eastern ukraine , built on tolerance and `` mind your own business '' mentality . 
  west in the meantime spent next two hundred years razing villages and burning people on stakes , trying to figure out who 's the real pope . 
  ca n't speak about other countries , but in poland many old buildings got additional insulation in past few years ( nothing to do with russia crisis - most flats have special fund that owners pay a bit of money every month ( 10 $ -20 $ ... ) which is used for maintenance , painting etc. 
  - many homeowners associations put this money to use and plastered each wall with around 5inches thick layer of styrofoam and painted it over . 
  saves money and pays for itself back in few years - when they did it in my old flat , our heating bill dropped considerably next winter . 
  also , newly-built buildings have to meet certain levels of heating energy efficency before the project gets approved and later registered as household . 
  first : brings back memories of cogwheels and rye ears on socialist poland 1st may marches . 
  second : dancing people ? 
  third : actual europa from greek mythology - there 's certain irony in putting her on euro coin in current greece 's situation . 
  overall , the best design out of those five imo . 
  fourth : second-best on the list , but very bland and generic . 
  also , there are only 12 people holding hands there - new eurozone members should get some recognition . 
  fifth : looks kinda like cthulhu tentacle ... 
  anyway , my country is not in eurozone . 
   like if somebody says that ukrainians deserve to have at least one fully-ukrainian tv-channel ( which we still do n't have ) it does n't mean he is far-right , if a ukrainian wants to live in ukraine not feeling like a second-class citizen not being able to find a ukrainian school for his children in his own heavily russified city , or if i have no desire to see the god damn lenin 's face everyday on the main square of my city , guess what , we are not far-right . 
  most of poles have absolutely no problems with desires like that - we had similar wishes during partitions ( luckily we were n't soviet republic , but rather satellite state , so russian culture did n't manage to get strong roots and was quickly dealt with in 1990s ) and fully support the ones you mentioned . 
  however , waving flag with swastika by some voluntary troops is where we have to put the foot down ... ( and yes , i know that russian media blows those cases out of proportion ... ), 
  in some very poor countries ( think sub-saharan africa ) being fat is a cultural sign of wealth - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/leblouh, 
  [ obligatory ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pouco_m6bes ) those regulations about `` standard '' letters ( a - z ) only on official documents are put on for a reason ... 
  while i understand swedish-americans attachment to their `` b\u00f8rk '' , what if some town with large asian-american population decides to rename themselves to '' \u4e2d\u570b\u57ce '' ? ... 
  how will mail be handled ? 
  license plates ? 
  i 've just been hit-and-run by a vechile . 
  his plate was ... uhm ... character that looks like snake raising to attack ... something resembling square ... 72 ... * ... and so on ... you do n't lose your cultural identity by removing two dots , but it makes life easier to everyone who has some business with you . 
  in my country id cards have `` anglicized '' spellings with special characters converted in smaller font , at the bottom ( `` z '' instead of '' \u017b '' in my surname 's case ) , and i do n't feel any less polish because of it . 
  i 'm pretty sure the town in question has bigger problems than dots in their name and you should make politicians focus on those instead . 
  uhm ... 
  if you work or study in europe , you are covered by national health insurances - you pay for it in taxes and it 's `` free '' - no need to sign up with private insurance company , unless you want to . 
  crosses on flag are * passe * . 
  stripes are okay - they just need to change colors a bit - current ones look like some african country . 
  dunno about czech republic , but many people in westernmost regions of poland are buying houses behind the border , as real estate prices are cheaper with comparable commute time , many also set up companies in germany , due to less bureaucracy involved than in poland , and serve both markets . 
  kinda missed the point ... christians , muslims and jews worship the same one god . 
  the differences are only in who was or was n't a prophet and religious dogmas . 
  pierce the ground with aspen stake for good measure . 
  just in case ... 
  in uk ? 
  sure , it had an effect . 
  there were many other countries that does n't have such huge number of polish immigrants where we were in top positions in televoting : austria ( 3rd ) , belarus ( 5th ) , belgium ( 4th ) , macedonia ( 3rd ) , france ( 3rd ) , germany ( 3rd ) , greece ( 5th ) , iceland ( 2nd ) , ireland ( 1st ) , italy ( 3rd ) , lithuania ( 4th ) , norway ( 1st ) , sweden ( 3rd ) , netherlands ( 2nd ) , ukraine ( 1st ) ,, 
  last year we had http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vj920cn2hma , but apparently jury did n't like it ( they prefer their women with beards , i guess ... ) and tanked the score , even if the audiences liked it ( in uk we placed last in jury voting and first in televoting ) , so this year we 're sending bland celine dion copycat in wheelchair ... 
  dunno about uk health service , since everyone i know is visiting doctors for check-ups , dental work etc. 
  while they come back for holidays , but many people in poland are having eye surgeries ( much shorter queues ) and births in czech republic and germany - apparently there 's some eu directive allowing it and polish national health service ( nfz ) is paying for it afterwards . 
  aesthetic surgeries are n't usually covered by national health service insurances , i think . 
  100 years ago poland was absent on europe 's maps . 
  with territory divided between states of germany , russia and austria , each doing whatever they can do uproot polish identity , young poles had to learn their history in secrecy , read smuggled books and gather in conspiracy . 
  at the end of world war i , poland rose again , bruised , tired , but finally free after 123 years of partitioning . 
  there were many problems our country was facing - industry was ravaged , roads were almost non-existent in the middle of country ( it was borders zone for each former occupant - most major cities were n't connected at all ) , railroads were a mess , with two different standards of rail width and so on ... 
  being finally `` free '' , people worked hard to re-build the country and by 1930s , the divides between former partitions were lessening and industry outlook was positive . 
  unfortunately , our neighbors had different plans ... 
  in 1939 we got ambushed by nazi germany , using staged attack on radio station in gliwice as `` casus beli '' , and 17 days later , we got backstabbed by russia who encroached our eastern border with pretense of `` protecting their nationals '' there . 
  hitler announced 1000 years ' reich , communism was supposed to be `` permanent revolution '' according to trotsky ... outlook for my country stuck in the middle was quite negative . 
  events of world war ii should be familiar to most europeans ... let 's fast forward a few years ... 
  in 1945 we got `` liberated '' by uncle stalin - polish peoples ' republic was born ... for over forty years we became a `` colony '' of cccp , with resources like coal and most worthwile produce being sent eastward as `` brotherly help '' . 
  the warsaw pact was created in opposition of nato and if the cold war ever turned hot , we were expected to be turned into radioactive wasteland by nato nukes to prevent soviet armored divisions advance to western europe - politbiuro and moscow generals opinion : `` well , tough shit . '' ...

  i was wondering why i could n't put my finger on that flag , thanks . 
  she 'll feel a slight sting , i reckon . 
  articulately argued , sir . 
  truly expounded on the intricacies of your argument , chapeau bas . 
  drug market exists because a part of the general populace exhibits a demand . 
  i wager there 'd be a smaller potential illegal black market with a smaller circle of customers , making it easier to track , i suppose . 
  verified as true . 
  i am hoping , but as i 've indicated ( `` i do n't think there 's any real alternative ready yet '' ) , i 'm afraid that it may not come to pass . 
  harsh , like siberian winter . 
  come what may , or perhaps must , we 're nearly halfway through the storm , which two years ago i had hoped we 'd weather with much more ease . 
  either way , the election ca n't come soon enough , although i do n't think there 's any real alternative ready yet . 
  i wonder how many decades it will take to heal the divides in the society , and whether it 'll actually be possible . 
  [ if you want to get anything across in this sub , you have to explain until you go blue in the mouth ] ( https://youtu.be/npjoslcr2he?t=2m4s ), 
  yes , i said it 's a joke . 
  mock-rivalry , if you will . 
  that 's why i mentioned denmark vs sweden/norway and finland vs holland . 
  it 's not serious . 
  i do n't see it as serious . 
  it 's not real . 
  it 's faux-fight . 
  it 's a prank , bro . 
  a flight of fancy . 
  it is truth no more !, 
  yes , as posted by a guy with a czech flair . 
  think denmark vs sweden/norway rivalry . 
  or finland vs holland . 
  that kind of joke , i guess . 
  speaking of toilets , i wonder how 're things at that turkish university where they introduced unisex toilets . 
  ( there was a post a here maybe two-three months ago ? ), 
  hmm ? 
  to clarify and contextualise the above statement , which - inexplicably to me - seems to have drawn someone 's ire , here in poland it 's common to call such people who engage in shilling or astro-turfing with the term `` troll '' ; i believe it is the case in russia and ukraine , as well . 
  hence my comment about it being a cultural thing . 
  happy to help . 
  sigh . 
  what about the other great robert ? 
  what about lewy ? 
  i suppose it 's a cultural thing . 
  some say `` shill '' , some say `` troll '' ; the intent is the same . 
  speaking of which , i had n't paid much attention to their map there for a while , but since when they 've been including south ossetia , abkhazia and transnistria ( and crimea , albeit that 's , from their point of view , officially russia ) on their map , with , i guess , the implication that it 's rasha ? 
  in heaven , everything is fine , you 've got your z 's , we 've got ours . 
  ( [ reference ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umyzybegre8 ) \\ ), 
  imma cool cat , so more about plain ole curiosity . 
  but that too . 
  `` he discovered their dirty secret !, 
  poles hate him ! '', 
  ( by the way , to be frank , that news-front website is , well , rather questionable ), 
  i appreciate you taking the time to present this . 
  your second link only talks of investigating links after le pen 's and afd 's funding came into question . 
  poland is only mentioned in the context of starting an investigation into any possible similar ties . 
  your third link refers to a marginalised fringe party that has no representation in the parliament and is not likely to ever enter it , since the polish counter-intelligence pinpointed it as being run by russians . 
  so essentially they 're a non-entity , which means that your suggestion from the initial post ( that there is russian money behind the polish government ) appears to me , in this context , to be unfounded . 
  it is only macierewicz 's questionable connections that may be backed by russian money , even though overtly he 's been lining us defence companies pockets ( who knows about his kick-backs , though ) . 
  nope , i 'm a natural . 
  it 's an impenetrable [ mystery ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/coat_of_arms_of_ukraine ) . 
  i too can make an exaggerated comment that intentionally ignores certain aspects of reality . 
  `` the nerve of this hoi-polloi , the police should be issued gatling guns and given a carte blanche on their use , with an earmarked annual ammunition budget of around 50 mio francs ! '', 
  cheers . 
  sigh . 
  elaborate , please . 
  ( it 's the first part that piqued my curiosity , so you may focus on that in your elaboration ), 
  i supposed so , but still allowed myself a pinch of levity , nevertheless . 
  here 's hoping that we will never see a neo-nazi skin head as the djibouti president !, 
  or the swaziland !, 
  looks like lavrov . 
  i suppose he meant splashing someone 's face with acid . 
  just a wild guess . 
  until it is n't . 
  i 'm curious - what does the italian version say ? 
  ( looking at it , i 'm guessing something like `` you 'll be back home soon '' ? ), 
  dinner plans have changed . 
  got ta have some placki ziemniaczane now . 
   if polish objections to the red army crossing its territory could first be overcome well , what guarantee was there the soviets would leave afterwards ? 
   farsi , arabic , polish should n't they all be capitalised the same way ? 
  is one unlike the others ? 
  how so ? 
  you say that like you 've never heard a drunk irish guy try and explain to you , in that recondite accent of his , the purpose of life . 
  you wrote , to my understanding , about russia initially ( `` russia are the long ignored heroes of wwii '' ) and my comment was about russia ( i.e. 
  the ussr ) , not the individual people . 
  in 1880 the writer boles\u0142aw prus wrote a short story , `` powracaj\u0105ca fala '' ( returning wave ) . 
  in general , the story was about the downward spiral of negative consequences of our earlier mistakes , and the title referred to an image of a wave on a lake : when a stone is dropped into the lake , waves move away from the place where the stone fell in concentrically , only to return , eventually . 
  for someone who likes to throw verbal stones at others , i hope you mend your ways before you have the misfortune to experience a returning wave . 
  while the term `` heroes '' is disputable , the magnitude of the ussr 's involvement in and contribution to the war is n't . 
  literally yes , but the meaning is closer to `` fuck that '' . 
  did you know that english question `` who is tim ? '', 
  sounds like `` chuj z tym '' in polish , which is sorta slangy for `` fuck that '' . 
  imagine that . 
  mind = blown , amirite ? 
  i 'm assuming this is some play on some of the comments made in the animal bridges thread , which i did n't read ? 
  is there any parity between the two ? 
  have recent protests in russia all resulted in massive riots with significant losses due to vandalism , burned cars , etc. 
  and how would a new partitioning benefit poland as opposed to a new sovereign election ? 
  and you 're saying this as a citizen of ... ? 
  s a l t a l t, 
  ah , hell , why not . 
  `` so you see , it used to be like * this * when it was erect , but after this new therapy , i can make it go like ** this ** '', 
  quelle ? 
  not sure ? 
  i do love me a bit of faux naivety myself , i do admit . 
  hmm , maybe i suppose someone argued that it would be awkward to purchase from a potential enemy ? 
  because we 're not buying those missiles to feel safe from the germans , or the czechs .

  sure , i hope you die soon too . 
  the wall collapsed , but the people who lived behind it are still alive and many of them have mindset which is not as omnipresent in the western countries as it is here . 
  you must understand that it is like the first time the discussion pops out . 
  we had much problem in the last 20 years and ideological matters were n't considered very meaningful , at least in the parliament . 
  even now i hear politicians saying that it 's not a problematic issue at all . 
  i agree that partnerships should have rights equal to marriges ; however , i can see why making such a law is an issue in poland . 
  conservatism is not same everywhere . 
  just look at the us republicans and juxtapose it with european conservatives . 
  also , much different historical context of the two countries . 
  chill out . 
  the church has so much say in poland because it built up its strong position in the era of communism . 
  it will naturally drop down in future . 
  because we have a conservative government . 
  protecting `` family values '' is their agenda . 
  as simple as that i suppose . 
  i need you to enlight me . 
  either you are stupid or stubborn . 
  told you already , integration = / = extension of the eu . 
  in other words , i 'd like all european countries in the eu , which would n't be a federal state with one currency . 
  simple enough ? 
  i see integration is taking power from national governments and continuing federalization , which has nothing to do with accesion of new countries . 
  i think that stable confederation of countries would be more than enough . 
  why would i care about these concerns about poland ? 
  i said integration , not extension . 
  ca n't you see the difference ? 
  i would be for federal state , but only in 100 years or so . 
  the integration process is moving too fast at the moment and the eu may one day hit the wall because of this . 
  for now , i would give up the one currency concept . 
  still , it 's not about their ethnicity , but about their culture . 
  they are defending their heritage . 
  i think you should grow up and accept that tradition is very important for some people . 
  what would be that party worth voting for ? 
  that 's only a guess but i think that may be the result of interior migration after the wwii . 
  people living in the east tend to stick more to traditions and religion ( therefore supporting pis ) , while people who left their ancestry land tend to be more liberal . 
  that assumption comes from my experience as someone who lives in the west and has all his family in the east . 
  man , sometimes i wish the ussr gave the communism lesson to more western countries . 
  wo n't you agree that the us in decline since the ww2 ? 
  it 's oviously still the main powerhouse but we know for sure that china will take over this position in the current decade . 
  for me , this is just too much `` solidarity '' at once . 
  i see it as punishing people for their economical success . 
  i do n't see it working not only from the moral standpoint , but also from the economical . 
  in the long term such a measure is a factor which discourages creative , success pursuing people . 
  on the other hand , i may be wrong and it will be interesting to watch the outcome of this whole issue . 
  although i think ~ ~ 37 ~ ~ 75 % tax is a theft , i do n't believe it can be shelved in france . 
  from what i see the majority of the french supports it . 
  yeah , i get it and even in this hypothetical scenario my answer remains the same . 
  the eu is certainly on its way towards a federal state but well , some people , including me , wish it wo n't happen anytime soon . 
  pavlik morozov also held his own opinion , 
  none . 
  why ? 
  you can work on the surface of bilateral treaties . 
  austerity at its finest . 
  that 's like an adverisment of plumbers and house-maids . 
  on a serious note , it is because the eastern school systems are still oriented on stiff principles , while the western tend to be more oriented on encouraging creativity . 
  i find the latter more appropriate in our times . 
  and the oversensitive users should stop bitching every 5 days . 
  also , i disagree that anyone writing regularly on this subreddit should be banned , even this retarded 7500 guy . 
  for example , i do n't know any person eating lunch at noon . 
  it 's 3 p.m. at the minimum . 
  putting cabbage and mushrooms into everything e : letter, 
  yes , i made a generalization . 
  however , it is pretty obvious i was n't reffereing to humans ' inherent rights . 
  i will just remind you that we had here the largest manslaughter in the modern history last year . 
  in a country where guns are banned . 
  why would they ban it ? 
  the guy would do it anyway . 
  you mentioned a chinese who slaughtered similar number of victims and the anti-arms policy in china is very rigid . 
  by the way , i think that calling any measure of control `` progressive '' is an overuse . 
  i wish them to be their last, 
  wow . 
  maybe because the topic in the thread concerns islam believers who are immigrants ? 
  sir , you are a communist . 
  you 've got no bloody idea how economics work , do you ? 
  you must be joking . 
  man , this ceremony is so extremely boring . 
  i wonder how the rest resisted the urge for sleeping . 
  what is the most important , or let 's say popular , policy expcted to be implemented by the winning party ? 
  myself , with different expressions on each note . 
  also , the bigger value , the more enthusiastic face . 
  or just puppies because i 'm fed up with seeing pilsudski and john paul ii everywhere . 
  we need to make it official someday . 
  i see it as a very bad argument for giving up your soverignity . 
  i see it as an evolution vs revolution . 
  in `` evolution '' , small entepreneurships are able to adjust , have more time and well , the middle chain of money transition stays here . 
  on the other hand , what we went throught was `` revolution '' , where everything is quite on the contrary . 
  also , you may not support this belief , but i do : money has nationality , so yes it is a bit of german vs polish . 
  but the worst thing is , it is a great struggle now for polish industries to compete with the western ones . 
  it is important to notice that we gave up this `` evolution '' approach ourselves , nobody forced us to do this . 
  in return we aquire a lot of eu funds , so it 's something for something . 
  that is also why poland will be always like alabama in the us . 
  i ca n't believe you do n't see the difference . 
  how could possibly any polish chain stand up against such a wealthy one ? 
  economics is a very broad term . 
  my friend 's family went bankrupt when we joined the eu and lidl company decided to build 4 of their supermarkets in my 40k town . 
  basically , the eu destroyed polish small business . 
  oh my , kopacz has just motivated me to go to the polls even though i did n't plan to . 
  what a crook . 
   most east europeans are just racists  i do n't think you know what you 're saying . 
  meh , keep living in this fantasy of yours where germans are leaving a trail of flowers and rainbow behind them when they 're walking , while on the other side of the oder live cruel slav orcs . 
   i do n't understand it myself because you never used to hear this air of thing from warsaw pact countries , and yet they too were left-wing .

  hitler was already imprisoned once for excessive violence , almost like his old partner stalin , who was a known criminal who even robbed a bank once . 
  but hitler 's imprisonment was when he already was part of the german nazi party . 
  later on he was made the head of them and even later he grabbed the leadership of germany , because of some events , which were actually planned . 
  the voters also were pressured to vote the nsdap . 
  oh right , because the germans had exclusive rights for being free , while central and eastern europe had to suffer over 45 years of russian occupation , because you , the british have sold them to the soviets , which were as bad as the german in world war 2 . 
  they are in nato now , and they should be treated like nato members , no matter if it is an escalation or not . 
  and russia is already massing its troops on ukraine , this is the main reason , why there should be permament nato bases behind the old iron curtain . 
  to ensure , that nato will do something and not like in 1939 , just standing behind the border and getting conquered by germany in notime . 
  funny , how you put it . 
  exactly that happened in world war 2 , when the polish people thought , that fighting for the su they will be allowed to return to their country , instead they returned and were executed by the communists . 
  they indeed did . 
  in 1936 , the winter war , where the soviet union marched into finnish lands . 
  that 's also the reason why finland joined the germans in world war 2 . 
  and they were actually one of the more democratic countries in that time . 
  finland is n't neutral . 
  it actually tried to join nato , but since it was fighting along the german against the soviets in ww2 , they were n't allowed into nato . 
  finland is also a very rare case , which shows that germany and the soviet union were both the worst and that you sometimes have to pick sides , esspecially if you were attacked some years ago . 
  neutrality is the worst thing you can do , when your country is on the frontline and has bad relations with a risk of a `` stealth invasion '' with a major regional power . 
  british ? 
  that 's new . 
  in my town there is just a very old ammunition depot from the british . 
  that 's everything . 
  the british soldiers left when the cold war ended , the american only partily left . 
  this is pretty false . 
  in poland the people want nato bases , not german bases . 
  there was even a report , that they would prefer other nato soldiers than german ones . 
  germany is just blocking everything . 
  some even say , that a second molotov-ribbentropf will happen, 
  that is n't a maidan . 
  it was actually from what i 've heared a planned coup de tat by the kgb with support of parts of the soviet military . 
  not a maidan . 
  oh finally a map , which does not steal southwestern azerbaijan . 
  they miss the countries which existed in the baltics from 1918-1939, 
   everyone west bordering them, 
  of course , we like our soviet music . 
  well . . why is russia geographically in syria ? 
  looks pretty dumb . 
  and again , azerbaijan lost its southwestern part again !, 
  why are so many maps doing it wrong ? 
  or did iran just took a part of azerbaijan ? 
  oh i also wonder , why are the russians asking why everyone west bordering them hates them ? 
  just noticed ... used the wrong google, 
  good thing then ... you also did n't have to oppose the red army . 
  has collapsed ? 
  and the soldiers at the fronts : `` what truce ? '', 
  [ it was photographed and investigated ] ( http://ukraineatwar.blogspot.de/2016/03/the-ukrainian-border-according-to.html ), 
  well ... first off you have to divide the european values into as many different values as there are states ( maybe 3-5 less different values ) . 
  then you have to assign them to europe . 
  northern europe for example has value a , central europe value b , eastern europe value c , western europe value d and so on . 
  oh and southwestern europe value e and southeastern europe value f-h i also never argue with `` european values '' . 
  in the end i also believe that most people are just using this as a synonym to their own values . 
  tbh sometimes i even use this myself . 
  in the end there are only `` european basics '' , since every culture will value everything differently . 
  although there are some visible groups . 
  but what are all these anthems and symbols doing here ? 
  it is n't about labour rights ... we have actually shown these soviet commies what the worker 's rights are . 
  missed * these cursive * words ... 
  i do n't care if it was the real thing . 
  it was still a terrible thing . 
  communism . 
  what is this doing here !, 
  seems like it . 
  why not just shoot it down ? 
  it is their own fault if they fly their equipment into someone else 's territory . 
  merkel should absolutely resign , but in the end all parties in germany are pretty much the same . 
  and they all collectively try to push the smaller parties , which are supposed to be `` nazi '' parties out of the election . 
  i actually bet that poland would have acted different on this . 
  we also have no turkish minority or at least it is so tiny that it is irrelevant . 
  i do n't think so . 
  frozen conflict is never a good idea , neither are `` cease-fires '' , which can be violated on demand . 
   if russia wanted to invade they would have done it in summer 2014 . 
  and they did exactly that !, 
  in august 2014 several russian army groups crossed the ukrainian border , while being supported by heavy artillery bombardment . 
  interpretermag.com provides more then enough evidence on this . 
  of course it is . 
  and fighting gradually increased since september 2015 . 
  this war will only stop if either ukraine repells the russian invaders or russia fully invades ukraine ... 
  although the latter one could have very bad consequences . 
  the donetsk and lugansk area are both contested territory . 
  between ukrainian troops and russian troops . 
  that would have been a consequence for supporting the wrong ones . 
  i would prefer to see nuclear weapons completely gone , instead of spreading them even more and making their use far more likely . 
  you do know , that there are several military threats knocking at our doors , do you ? 
  russia for example . 
  and you can only talk with russia with diplomatic and military pressure . 
  if that happens you may as well call europe russia in the next 20 years . 
  no eu army ... just meet that god damn 2 % line and we should be safe . 
  but no , instead you all have to decrease your military spending , while isis is active and russian imperialism emerges again ... an eu federation is the ** worst ** thing which could happen . 
  i will make sure it never happens . 
  we do not need brussels , we also do not need someone else dictating what right and wrong is . 
  a healthy human mind can differentiate between these two . 
  well ... 
  i must say , i did hate him for doing this and following merkel all the time . 
  but now since he is in a position of minor power , where he could influence the decisions ... 
  i would say that he should stay . 
  pis should probably do that . 
  tusk actually does something useful for his country , by also objecting merkel 's treaty with turkey ... 
  although he had no power to stop it ... 
  oh i remember those !, 
  vice news , heh ?

  but that of course would n't matter at all of not for our eu membership and so we have to take a look at how we joined . 
  poland joined the eu in 2004 together with nine other countries ( cyprus , czech republic , estonia , hungary , latvia , lithuania , malta , slovakia and slovenia ) . 
  it 's worth noting here that the biggest of those countries has a population four times smaller than poland . 
  when a new country joins previous members have an option to suspend freedom of movement for citizens of that country for seven years . 
  only three countries did n't make use of that : ireland , sweden and united kingdom . 
  there were also internal polish matters which contributed to it , like for example we had a baby boom about two decades when poland was under martial law which caused an over supply of workers , which pushed them out in a situation where the easiest place to get a job simply administratively was uk . 
  also fun fact , republic of ireland is the third biggest foreign nationality in uk , second is india . 
  what we think what should be and why is n't exactly a good way to judge or measure reality . 
  i hope that this will leave you with some impression of how complicated these issues are , since i imagine we barely touched on the matter . 
  and next time you 'll be talking with someone about us job stealers you can maybe mention a few reasons why so many of us are there . 
  as a bit of closing words : if republic of ireland were to match our number in the uk they would lose about 15 % of their population . 
  just the amount of people you have also matters . 
   when the people do n't like it they can vote for brexit and end it like they did . 
  what are you even referring to ? 
  are you referring to uk building an economy on immigration and people not liking it ? 
  leaving eu will probably barely change that , if anything than just the sources of immigrants will change . 
  as ms. may calls it , `` closer ties with the commonwealth '' or something like that . 
   now because of the eu millions of polish kids into the future wont get the chance to go to the uk and eek out a living . 
  ahhh , the wonderfully inevitable attempt at a sting on nationality flair . 
  well frankly millions of polish people got that chance because of the eu , and if anybody or anything is to be blamed for that going away it 's not the eu , but rather the politicians who repeatedly used it as a convenient punching bag whenever they failed their people . 
  regardless of how much eu even had to do with it , as i 've exemplified in my previous response to you . 
  you know , i would n't even be surprised if he were to actually say that at some point . 
  edit cause i accidentally a word . 
  it 's hard for finland to not be a reliable defender of sweden when russia has no other option than to go through finland if it wants to attack sweden . 
  for at least the last twelve years non-eu immigrants were the majority of immigrants coming to uk . 
  you wan na take a guess at who has full control over that ? 
  yup , it 's that uk which had `` no control of immigration '' , lol . 
  another surprise , while everyone is bitching about foreigners leeching off public help programs the eu already has a framework to take care of that and limit their access . 
  uk government built an economy based on immigration and when people did n't like it they found a convenient scapegoat . 
  great , that war was started on a false premise and if there was a referendum than maybe it would n't happen . 
  what ? 
  most stuff is n't decided in country wide referendums ( referenda ? 
  the us election is really better described as a whole lot of small elections rather than a single big one . 
  each state has its own rules for how the voting in their region is to be conducted ( i 'm not sure but i think that even smaller regions can set up their own rules in certain aspects ) . 
  thus you can have a situation where in one region you do n't need an id to vote while in another region you need both a passport and an id . 
  what the fuck are you talking about ? 
   the london wurocrats, 
  the difference is that not destroying indian reservations does n't force california to leave usa . 
  respecting values of minorities does n't mean stomping over values of your majority . 
  it was more equal than it is now . 
  i could agree with that statement back when po was in power . 
  but now under pis tvp is just ridiculous and went much lower than tvn , have you seen their coverage of tusks reelection ? 
  `` win for the germans '' , `` poland unmasks the failing eu democracy '' ( after they lost a democratic vote 27 to 1 lol ), 
  so i guess `` the other side '' should start saying hoplofilia ? 
  britain is not a superior of europe . 
  and yet again you found a way to answer but not address the disregard for the constitution by our current government . 
  i can bet that you 'll do the same here or not answer at all . 
  it seems like that 's the law in france . 
  it 's bullshit , but it 's still law . 
  eu pr guys should borrow that . 
   afsluitdijk that looks like someone slammed their face on a keyboard . 
   as americans started drinking water with lead did they ever stop ? 
  implying there are privacy rights for us citizens . 
  now you 're thinking of russia . 
  nafta is bigger but it 's also a lot less integrated . 
  i think he should have said biggest single market instead of biggest free trade area , there 's a huge difference . 
  does the constitution define how they vote ? 
  because if yes than it 's long overdue for an overhaul . 
  pretty much exactly 1000 years ago . 
  just around 50 years after the polish kingdom was first formed . 
  perhaps you 're right , i just tried it with a different ip and it worked . 
  but why would they block poland from their site ? 
  unless it 's just my ip blocked caus of some botnet malware , in which case ... \u00af \\ _ ( \u30c4 ) _ / \u00af, 
  something is wrong with either the link you 've given or the site you linked . 
  http://imgur.com/kpodwtn or my ip got banned from it , but i think it would tell me that . 
  `` a group '' . 
  whole seven people . 
  i guess they 're technically correct , but honestly it just looks like a few friends fucking around . 
  other methods of putting pressure could also work . 
  which is an acceptable outcome if they do not cooperate . 
  once they start accepting their people back it 'd be brought back . 
  cut the aid . 
  why should it be an empty threat ? 
  threatening to cut aid if they do n't take their people back . 
   russian flair suddenly i feel uncomfortable ... 
  it 's ( supposed , we 'll see whether it 's real ) 4 months until the article 50 process begins . 
  then for the next 2 years ( at least , it can be prolonged ) they 'll still be members of the eu as they negotiate the terms of leaving . 
  so he has at least 2 years and 4 months . 
  what 's the difference between mass shootings and terrorism ? 
  yeah , except they do n't care about demographics , they care about their support percentage . 
  in vitro programs got a lot more population growth than 500 + ever will for a cost that 's barely noticeable on comparison . 
  and guess what , they already cut that program from state funding . 
  i 'm pretty sure that even russia recognizes ukraine as a state . 
  the countries hit hardest due to sanctions are eastern ones , because they 're closer to russia and thus have more trade with them . 
  coincidentally eastern countries are among the strongest backers of sanctions . 
  * i wonder if their proximity to russia has any effect on that ... *, 
   so which is it , were uaf attacked or were they on a `` special mission to reach some destination '' ? 
  those two do n't really conflict with each other . 
  are you going to get fixated on the wording now ? 
  really ? 
  i 've already answered to this and i 'm not gon na repeat myself . 
  lol i 'm not gon na miss you , bye . 
  oh i do n't doubt that he said that . 
  but he 's talking bullshit all the time and a president saying something does n't make it true . 
  it 's like claiming that all mexicans are criminals and quoting trump as your source . 
  it 's a shitty source . 
  if you wanne take everything literally then yeah . 
  but if you 'd put just a little bit of effort into understanding what was said then no , as  no one was talking about `` punishing '' uk for brexit was about people not wanting to punish them , not literally not talking about it . 
  do you claim otherwise ? 
  someone being a president of a country does not make them a reputable source .

  it 's a typical fireplace song that everyone knows, 
  well it 's a stream and it 's live and you got a comment section on reddit, 
  ( [ song ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgw1yecwptu ) ), 
  2 days is minimum , in some regions can go up 4 eg . 
  1st day before church wedding , 2nd standard wedding , 3rd after wedding day ( called `` poprawiny '' ) and 4th for very close family to finish stuff . 
  it can be a really hard marathon sometimes . 
  most standard is just 2 days - wedding day + night and day after ( church stuff around 17-19 , wedding party to around 4-5am ) you sleep to around 10-13 when poprawiny start . 
  people drink less than they used to - they are even alcohol-less weddings , and wedding fights are becoming a thing of the past - it used to be standard attraction to have a fight on a wedding, 
   that is n't often dependent on redditors , but rather inaccurate , yet widespread base maps .

  there 's no south sudan or kosovo etc. 
  just the ones that look as if they are drawn from memory - they are usualy taken from various articles/news sites,

  good way for searching such things is writing it in local languge, 
  data maps for absurd stuff where only one or all countries check the criteria atrocious colour schemes where you can not see shit random things like how many countries fit in something daily reposts of ww1 comic maps maps with super inaccurate borders what if maps how far is something from something / r/shittymapporn has a whole collection of those, 
  it 's quite hard to imagine that borders changed on monthly basis, 
  there 's lot of shit posted there on daily basis though,

  funny thing - georgia has european flags at its border crossing with turkey  [ google ] ( https://www.google.pl/maps/place/sarpi+d%c4%85browa+g%c3%b3rnicza+sp.+z+o.o./@41.5222128,41.5478668,3a,75y,205.98h,99.65t/data=!3m8!1e1!3m6!1s-77nobual9fw%2fu_gkg24dgzi%2faaaaaaaam1c%2f91p2oz6-diyzje3t4wr_hpgu0vdw9flmgclib!2e4!3e11!6s%2f%2flh4.googleusercontent.com%2f-77nobual9fw%2fu_gkg24dgzi%2faaaaaaaam1c%2f91p2oz6-diyzje3t4wr_hpgu0vdw9flmgclib%2fw203-h101-n-k-no%2f!7i4000!8i2000!4m5!3m4!1s0x4716def46cdbff19:0x5f50e0b0b2139136!8m2!3d50.3365254!4d19.3422048!6m1!1e1 ) [ pic ] ( http://thecontinentaldrifters.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/dscn0505.jpg ) [ vid ] ( https://youtu.be/y_ok6woxn1w?t=24m19s ), 
  we are not talking only about spain . 
  also not all reason need to be in all places can not say same for italy/greece, 
  - turists - beggars - crime - unemployment - waste disposal problems - percived expensive live just to name a few, 
  all the unhappy people commit suiccide, 
  do n't be fooled - the small ones are best at herding money, 
  is there even a country in europe where on average job you could support whole family ? 
  last few winters were also `` meh '' here - about 2 weeks of real winter with freezing temperatures and snow and rest was above 0 . 
  most i remember was around -35 at night . 
  tbh such +35 / -35 amplitudes are not so cool, 
  again ? 
  ah it 's just about an even from last year, 
  and that one has translation, 
  use search : https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/51xrjl/professor_of_uw_assaulted_in_warsaw_because_he/, 
  it was already posted https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/51tof4/a_16yearold_british_girl_earns_48000_helping/, 
  each statistic has some goals and standards . 
  counting and presenting random data from which you can not say anything meaningfull is just useless trivia . 
  it also breakes it 's own goal of showing temperatures of europe, 
  yes but the same mountains shield them from eastern winds influence the costal part is not so big anyway the difference is pretty much nothing anyway, 
  and in the same time we got more influenced by eastern climate, 
  pointing out nonsense is overreacting ? 
  it renders the statistic pointless though, 
  with uk it 's understendable , but poland is surprisng to be warmer, 
  continental climate . 
  we got hotter summers , but way colder winters as well , especially when we get eastern wind, 
  you did n't get it russia got asian part counted in to the average and denmark 's greenland does not ( i would assume from the numebrs ) . 
  i did n't mention iceland in any way, 
  for russia i imagine the average is from whole country , not only europe . 
  it 's pretty pointless to use such method for them considering the ammount of barren subpolar wastelands they got . 
  also why is n't dennark treated in the same way with their greenland ? 
  2/10 for bullshit useless methodology / edit ; showing average for few cities would be way better, 
   and pretty awful too . 
  what heresy is that ? 
  that 's the best flavour, 
  3city , poland - [ guide ] ( http://guide.trojmiasto.pl/ ), 
  euros as currency , people or just anything with europe ? 
  that 's also my theory, 
  there are : sweden , finland , poland , germany ... 
  yea as i mentioned - they used wrong shade of red and white, 
  mayby there is no country between them,

  wow that 's a nice start, 
  especially in poland or baltics , 
  having full emplyoment is different from having it as a goal . 
  eg when having it as a goal investing becomes pointless and just a problem to achieving the goal it 's nothing more that populist empty statement, 
   the goal is full employment that is very dumb goal,

  from few days ago https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/503s9q/poland_backs_francogerman_european_security/ in big tl ; dr poland is just against : - refugee quotas - unrestricted entry to eu - joining eurozone - eu where one country rules,

   while euroscepticism is significant among polish could we stop with this bullshit myth already ? 
  different link , but the same thing, 
  kind of but not exactly it 's rational to avoid shitty neighbourhoods , not ethnic minority ones ( some overlap ofc ), 
  mayby they do n't see a difference and better safe than sorry,

  but nobody 's talking about banning those ? 
   they do n't have assigned seats ... 
  seriously , i have to explain this ? 
  i 'm talking about sound coming from different places . 
  if you have two sources ( people in this case ) , e.g. 
  one on left , and other on right , and you ca n't recognize from which one the sound ( voice ) is coming , it means you have hearing problems . 
   if the teachers are unable to recognize these people because they ca n't see their faces and distinguish their voices , its a problem . 
  so in the same time you mean that blind people ca n't teach ? 
   people here are graded based on performance throughout the year is n't their performance tracked in the meanwhile as well ? 
  or does teacher have to remember everything at the end of the year ? 
  imho it 'd be prone to bias , e.g. 
  because somebody slacked for most of it , but become more active during last weeks ... 
  seat , not voice . 
  you know why we have two ears ? 
  spatial hearing , that 's why . 
  are you suggesting niqab comes with ventriloquism ? 
  might be useful . 
  you should just stick to ** wallachia ** . 
  or i dunno , dacia . 
  there would be no misunderstanding then . 
  also , give back chad its flag . 
  *** but seriously , i understand your rage . 
  even in late polish [ poll ] ( http://bi.gazeta.pl/im/00/f7/12/z19887872q,stosunek-polakow-do-innych-narodowosci.jpg ) romanians ended as third most hated nationality , after arabs and - you guessed it - gypsies . 
  of course we do n't hate you , it 's just that gypsies are called romanians in polish colloquially . 
   the alternative will be civil war in the future . 
  muslims are minority in europe , and will be for decades , if not centuries . 
  population of eu is 510 m , so there would have to be at least 200 m muslims here to become a `` civil war threat '' . 
  there is about 20 m of them now . 
  about 3 % of total . 
  even if whole population of syria , iraq and libya combined would move to eu , it still would be only ~ 80 m against ~ 480 non-muslims . 
  ** numbers ** , man . 
   when you 've been indoctrinated so severely , and forced to wear it from a young age , you come to accept it . 
  or you rebel against it . 
   but let 's not go overboard in our branding of muslim women , hijab wearers are not as objectionable as the far right . 
  exactly . 
  i 'd prefer family of muslims with niqab women as neighbors , than our far righters ( like [ onr ] ( http://www.fakt.pl/m/crop/-850/-484/faktonline/635432709114093831.jpg ) ) . 
   there is no way a kid would wear that stuff by their own volition . 
  i 'm sure there would be , and probably are , such kids . 
  still , i agree - it should be banned for minors . 
  like alcohol . 
  over 18 - do as you wish . 
   the thing is that many , if not most of the women wearing clothes like these does n't do it by choice . 
  in middle east - of course . 
  especially in countries , where it 's imposed culturally ( like yemen , saudi arabia , afghanistan ) , or even as an obligatory law ( isis ... ) . 
  but here in europe ? 
  i think we would hear about it . 
  there would be at least some women asking for help , protesting against such domestic abuse . 
  but it seems to be contrary - most of them ( based on news , docus , interviews ) do it on their own , sometimes even against family opinion . 
   the freedom to wear anything you want in public seems like a pretty basic and inviolable civil liberty to me . 
  banning islamic dress is frankly no better than islamic countries enforcing it . 
  ** this ** . 
  you 're welcome . 
   you do n't actually believe this , do you ? 
  of course not . 
  but they seem to . 
  who am i to impose my opinion on them ? 
   it 's explicitly religious . 
  a religion with an openly hostile anti-progressive attitude . 
  like most religions . 
  just come here and listen to our ( polish ) catholic priests . 
   this is not some fashion statement by a youth subculture and you know it . 
  the thing is , that sometimes yeah , ** it is ** . 
  not in middle east , but among muslim minorities ( and many converts - * holier than the pope * applies here ) in western europe - it happens . 
  rebellion against parents ( e.g. 
  being more assimilated ) , against state . 
  like being a part of some weird subculture . 
  of course , there is a religious `` superstructure '' here , but basic reasons are very similar . 
  40-50 years ago it was radical left , 30-20 years punk and other music subcultures , now - among others - radical islam . 
  10 , 20 years from new something new would be `` hot '' . 
  a propos , recommended [ docu ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0hhhad_nzu ) . 
   how do you grade a person you have no chance of knowing at a glance ? 
  basing on what she says and writes ? 
  or we should consider grading based on looks a good thing ? 
  on the other hand , if this school is a ** private ** one , it should be free to introduce such ban . 
   i get fucking angry when i see this . 
  it 's so provocative , and does n't belong on our soil . 
  i 'm sure there were people saying such things about women in pants , tattoos , or punk hairstyles in past . 
  there is in * hadiths * ( tales about muhammad ) , however . 
  explanations differ , depending on `` school '' . 
  general ( majority ) opinion is , that while hijab ( headscarf , hair covered , face visible ) is obligatory , niqab is only `` facultative '' , or even only `` permitted '' ( they use different `` legal '' terms here , e.g. 
  * fard * , * wajib * etc. 
  - look it up if you 're interested ) . 
  and there are minorities on opposing sides , one ( `` liberal '' ) considering whole veiling as unobligatory , and other ( `` radical '' , including both militant/terrorist and non-violent groups ) thinking that everything should be veiled . 
  the problem with islam is , that there 's no `` single '' , `` true '' islam . 
  even well-known sunni/shia divide is just an iceberg tip . 
  it 's extremely diverse and fragmented community . 
  which is kind of good for us non-muslims ... 
  so let 's just make a law , that you have to show your face ( to the examiner ) before . 
  or in any similar official situation ( like testifying in court , being checked by traffic police , withdrawing money at bank , voting etc. ) . 
  btw , i ithink it 's still possible to do a written exam in polish universities for somebody else , at least in some faculties . 
  there were people doing so on mine few years ago . 
  without any disguise . 
   afaik , it 's more cultural/traditional than religious it 's complicated . 
  it was used by pre-islamic communities , e.g. 
  in sassanid persia or ( probably ? ), 
  assyria , but mostly among higher classes . 
  so it could be considered as a privilege ( and equality factor ) among early muslims . 
  however , majority of muslim `` schools '' ( of quran explanation ) ** do not ** consider niqab to be a duty ( mostly because quran says nothing clear about it , so it 's based only on * hadiths * ) , but only accept it as something facultative or voluntary . 
  unfortunately , there are also some nutcases ( minority , but a noisy one ) , which believe no inch of female skin should be shown ... 
  this includes both militant groups ( taleban , somali sharia courts , and of course isis ) and some `` amish-like '' , weird but generally non-violent sects ( e.g.

  no wonder , its internal part of the religion . 
  thank you for the interesting link , but still i couldnt find info which other religion is as represented in religious terrorism as islam . 
  most interesting . 
  would you be so kind and present me the data on religious terrorism in the world , especiallu non muslim . 
  thanks !, 
  look at their past . 
  who will judge whos `` racist troll '' ? 
  you or merkel , perhaps ? 
  by `` they '' i ment the german govermen . 
  the big picture is that no other religion followers will kill themselves and innocent people with the name of their deity on their mouth . 
  i have no idea how one can ignore it . 
  the thing is , that nobody cares what you want . 
  they will do what they want . 
  people dont have problems with islam , because it says nasty thing like `` women are bit better than dogs and dogs are shit '' . 
  people have problem with islam , because apparently it makes people mad and they stab others or blow themselves up ,,

  its interesting , how did you compare gdps of , lets say , xiv century countries ?

  im not presenting the link to educate you , im showing the readers your ignorance . 
  such naiviety belongs in the 90s ...

  its a matter of principles first of all . 
  we took 2000 syrian christians last year . 
  they were all in germany within a month .

  not muslims , not christians . 
  the only way to keep them here would be behind the barbed wire . 
  we are not going to start concentration camps to appease germans . 
  depends on the angela , doesnt it ? 
  apparently .

  then we fight , we are used to it . 
  cowardice walks in front of a disaster . 
  how disrespectful . 
  do you berate everyone you dont agree with ? 
  let me repeat : some things are more important than `` economic benefits '' . 
  if you understood this , you wouldnt be in trouble angela here is desperate to outsource . 
  do not underestimate us .

  funny as it seems , what does that tell us about russian society if the best-selling newspaper in russia sees this as appropriate for their reading target . 
  and see what ? 
  nsdap needed 37.27 % of voters share to start destabilising the weimar republic . 
  well , the nationalists do fear that muslims will take over the state , but i 'm not sure where that discussion is heading . 
  let 's stop judging by the book and see what happens . 
  campaign talk is just campaign talk . 
  i doubt that he really believes that he 's going to fight terrorism with education . 
  but in campaign it might sell . 
   once they have a recession if they have a recession, 
  nobody reasonable judges politicians by what they said , but what they have done . 
  macron presidency is going to be judged based on the situation in the country , not based on agenda point from few years before which nobody remembers . 
  the ` populists ' ca n't screw up in france becouse they 're not in power and it 's them who are proposing the status quo change . 
  36 % of french is lepen 's core ? 
  may i remind you that we did n't even had a social shock that would be on the great depression levels . 
  could you bring closer things that you find most disturbing from these recent leaks ? 
  these people are hating macron already . 
  i 'm talking about the french majority . 
  in that case the left and right parties will have to move further right and further left with their agenda to run away from the hit , not really a good thing . 
  let 's hope it stays this way . 
  i 'm not into french politics that much , but in poland , parties are often entities of larger political-ideological fronts and these fronts get the hit as a whole , but it depends on the reasons . 
  yeah , but these politics lead to certains status quos that are contradicionary one to another . 
  you ca n't have eu and not have eu at the same point . 
  there are no schr\u00f6dinger 's eus , if it 's going to be dissolved at some point , it wo n't come back fast . 
  agree . 
  that 's why i 've said that this time it 's ` everyone but the socialists ' election after a socialist hated president . 
  i was making an opinion that this scenariu could repeat itself when macron 's presidency will be coming to an end . 
  it 's gradual , every succesful politician is a populist in some part , hence the quotation marks . 
  i meant party leaders tbh but now when you mentioned it ... yeah , ordinary people will be having a passive-aggressive laugh . 
  what matters is what the elites are thinking and how effective are their ways of stealing voters hearts . 
  people in power have to partially answer to what people think they need , and partially they have to deceive them becouse the people do n't always know what they really need . 
  agree , you have a point here . 
  i never was a pis voter , but pis is n't even half-way where le pen is . 
  world is not black & white . 
  the 3rd crisis is n't something that would just ` happen ' , it 's also dependent on eu politicians actions , with macron included . 
  these levels of pollution are fall smaller than slmost all average-old cars have on the streets , if they were sold for 3/4 of their price then owners of 10 year cars would buy them and their 10 year cars would be bought by people driving their 20 year old cars , and those would be scrapped . 
  instead , these new cars will be scrapped , and those 20 year old are still going to be on the streets . 
  it 's time to leave that behind us . 
  it 's pretty obvious that campaign talk is jut campaign talk , nobody intelligent in the western world still believes in campaign talk . 
  let 's focus on what he does and what he did in his career till now . 
  you may be right , but there 's still parliamentary elections where people could vote for ` anyone but macron ' , just like currently from what i 've heard people want to vote for ` everyone but not the socialists ' . 
  i agree with your first part , but not with the second . 
  i ca n't see france getting out of trouble without controversial decisions , i ca n't see the guy responsible for the controversial decisions not getting his ass wiped by the public opinion , especially a public opinion with a very strong pro-welfare attitude . 
  i think i ca n't agree with that . 
  things still did n't get really bad in europe and still can go a lot worse . 
  this political crisis we had ( and are having ) lately is n't even comparable to what history got us used to . 
  for example he has to take some of the working laws and social benefits out and make the market more flexible and - scary word - free . 
  the french , with their extremely pro-welfare attitude will going to be extremely mad , but without those changes , french economy will continue to fade in comparsion on other eu power houses and that means extremists in power in few years . 
  if he has balls to stand against the angry working french mob , to hard reply them , to push his changes despite their loud babbling then it 's fine , but if he does n't have those balls , he 's going to make steps back like hollande did , then he 's going to be both , hated for his ideas and hated for his weakness . 
  i 'd wait how macron and the new government will be doing . 
  becouse if they screw up , then it 's the ` populists ' having the last laugh . 
  macron has a lot work to do , and a lot of controversial decision ahead of him for which the french will hate him . 
  but if he does n't do that , they 'll hate him even more . 
  what a waste . 
  me too . 
  why wo n't they just sell them cheaper . 
  it would probably narrow their electorate . 
  besides , it 's not reflect their policy . 
  it 's a naional-socialist party . 
  never heard about monarchs in power supporting socialism ( except communist quasi-monarchies like in nk ) , they 're too good at counting money . 
  but now you 're poor like cee :p . 
  in my opinion k\u00f6nigsberg should be polish or independent . 
  giving it to germany brings back the polish-german geopolitical conflict over land access to k\u00f6nigsberg vs our access to baltic which was one of the main reason behind multiple wars , with world wars inclued and one of the main reasons we could n't get along with germans through history . 
  keeping it russian might cause a conflict between lithuania and russia which could involve nato and lead to a nasty solution . 
  lithuania is too small to take responsability for k\u00f6nigsberg with it 's russian population . 
  lithuanian population is too small and drastically falling . 
  so it 's us or independence . 
  after translation from mendacitic language : `` it 's not whistleblowing when it hits someone we like ! '', 
  ** proportions in this map are wrong ** . 
  for example , compare the 5,5 mln sweden square with 15mln belgian congo . 
  russia has still very high hdi : http://www.nationsonline.org/oneworld/human_development.htm, 
  not an aware atheist . 
  there were no complex non-theist theories explaining the world . 
  if you narrow the atheist definition to just a person that says there 's no god or i do n't know nothing about any god and fuck it all , then agree , but in that case , even my sock is an atheist . 
  i 'm saying aware atheists not without a reason . 
  it was n't my point at all , read more carefully . 
  it 's complicated . 
  it depends on the form and size . 
  imho south-eastern europe has too many contradicting interests to north-eastern europe but that does n't mean a common ground can not be found if there are some potential huge benefits that could come from this unity . 
  another thing is that we 're poor and that makes our elites easy to play from west-european power houses that rather wo n't like the idea becouse they 'd rather see just markets and a buffer zone without ambition in us , so i 'm not sure it 's worth the attempt becouse this would be a struggle - again - it depends on potential benefits . 
  the third thing is russia . 
  as long as there is a semi-imperial russia , it would be a struggle with them as well . 
  tbh , i 'm not afraid of a russian invasion much . 
  but i am afraid about russian implosion which would and probably will bring economic and political chaos to the whole cee region and maybe even further . 
  hard to predict what happens then , but this ` intermarium federation ' would have to probably take some responsability in arranging the political and economic shape of post-semi-imperial-russia spheres of influence and i 'm not keen on that . 
  i 'd rather expect from my country to develop it 's economy quietly , than getting involved ` in the east ' . 
  there 's only going to be trouble coming from that . 
  not quite http://atlas.media.mit.edu/en/profile/country/ltu/ your biggest trade partners are russia , germany , poland and latvia . 
  it 's good that you cooperate with nordics , connectivity is good , however the main source of your economic strength lies elsewhere . 
  and when it comes to safety , whole north-eastern europe should work together . 
  for us , lithuanian security is crucial for our own security , for sweden it 's just important , becouse in geopolitical terms , they 're on an island anyway . 
  how come i missed that , this is so good . 
  however , it 's surprising to me that seagal is generating such emotions . 
  i thought nobody gives a shit about him at this point . 
   nothing good can come from that government . 
  world is never black and white . 
  at this point these meeting are rather to find , what 's the common ground , if there is any . 
  imho countries south to carpathians have many different interests than those north to it . 
  oh god . 
  who cares . 
  it 's for orientantion , not strict definition .

  this is sad . 
  i like how those people seem to be passionate about what they are doing - its amazing to play soldier - but it would be terrible to see them die . 
  and if a conflict takes place - they will die . 
  the only way for organization like that to work is to be completely unaffiliated with a state , focusing not on playing soldier , but on playing guerilla . 
  thats the only way for the baltics . 
  + they have rifles . 
  the rifles are skippable . 
  ( well could be used for defence , but if you have to defend yourself in a guerilla war vs russia , then youre doing something wrong , and are already dead . 
  all they need is is a car and a at , f&f launcher . 
  for example spikes . 
  * grabs popcorn *, 
  there are two comments under this article that pretty much explain the situation . 
   for a guy with a polish name , twardowski displays an incredible lack of awareness of the situation in poland . 
  here is a wake-up for him -- poland , in an exercise of true democracy , and not eu-dictated idiocy , overwhelmingly rejected the po party in the last elections . 
  the po party , however , refuses to honor the choice of the people and is conducting a partisan-warfare style political confrontation in an attempt to block the new government from doing anything . 
  twardowski needs to stop imbibing eu and po propaganda and come to poland and speak with the ordinary people who were tired of po 's agenda after eight years . 
  the real challenge for the eu is to survive as an institution and abandon its undemocratic ways . 
  and one that is even better  corrupt , arrogant polish leftists cynically spread false hysteria in the western media in the hope that western elites join them in the fight against the social-conservative government and help them to regain power ( and of course money ) . 
  absolutely pathetic and disgusting . 
  but we have shit like this article - not the constitutional tribunal affair , but hateful propaganda pieces like this article are making poland look like some backward shithole . 
  go reread it now , and tell me this does n't read like propaganda . 
  all i can think about now is : reddtor arrested in pyongyang for calling it pingpong, 
  the funniest thing is - without all of the corruption that public procurement is - you guys could ( same as us ) have a very well equipped army . 
  with tons of specialist gear, 
   all the jewish people fleeing from nazi germany to the us without a passport ? 
  denied . 
  great system . 
  exactly this . 
  the jewish people had jewish passports , that would - when asking for asylum - that they are jewish , coming from germany and their identity , including the very important date of birth . 
  statistics say that muslim communities support jihad . 
  they just show outrage for 2 seconds and ask people to not discriminate them bla bla bla , and then back to business, 
  the glorious german efficiency , 
  trolling to be good requires you to be logical . 
  the really good trolls are not obvious , they sound normal , they seem normal , but underneath some sinister plot is taking place . 
  yours is pretty shitty , as after like 20 letters anyone will say kek . 
  so i 've said it has to be logical - so how exactly is taking them in and then killing them easier and simplier than locking them out , and then killing them in their countries , when the chance that your target is muslim is like 97 % ? 
  i do n't understand that too - the eu is the perfect conquest , they are the kings , and they want out ... 
  better to rule with no eu than to be in opposition with eu . 
  i would say that fn is not as bad as its painted . 
  the ** newspapers ** ( pro gov , or with other interests at sake , they ** are for profit ** ) . 
  pretty much any goverment is clueless . 
  these people have really not much of a knowledge of running an actual goverment . 
  its like a business that is 10 times more advanced , and usually the politicians are lawyers , polit . 
  science , doctors ... 
  here : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/members_of_the_111th_united_states_congress#education this might not directly apply to europe , but it should be really similiar . 
  poles have recently voted in a [ party ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kukiz%2715 ) of a [ 53 year old ex rock star ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pawe\u0142_kukiz ) . 
  do n't let the far-right shit , speak to you . 
  this is a liberal party with slight conservative ties . 
  its branded right wing , as generally in poland right wing tends to be liberal ( economically , socially often too ) , and left is just left . 
  yes . 
  they have allied with far-right , but only in order to get +5 % votes . 
  wanted to give you an example of a party unfit to rule , but i got carried away ;p tldr ; fn will be as incompetent as currently ruling parties . 
  they simply will have to overcome lack of connections and estabilished brand . 
   does this system work in other war-thorn areas around the globe ? 
  guess the answer  this is one of the things that politicians do with our money that make no sense ( so like 90 % ) - we are paying hundreds of thousands euros for observing nothing . 
  not even the muslims can fix that . 
  terrorists will still be there . 
  just think about the wave of terrorism we will be getting after the isis is defeated - the jihadis will simply go underground or to europe , using links estabilished by current refugees . 
  people are paid to observe from hour x to hour y. 
  they really do n't want to be there , so once their shift ends , they leave . 
  not sure if they even would have protections ( like insurance ) if they had stayed , even 20 mins . 
  also bureaucracy - changing the number of shifts and observers to cover 24/7 ( if we move the observers 5 hours up for example , then the russians will go 12 hours earlier , so they are finished before observers arrive ) takes time , money etc. 
  its a huge decission - concerning dozens of people and departaments . 
  tldr we can do something , but that requires will of the system . 
   not so sure actually . 
  i do know of a case in northern sweden where some `` new friends '' apparently decided the daughter of a a member of the local hunting club was fair game . 
  rumor had it he was stopped on the way out to `` fix '' the problem fully armed . 
  thats personal , thats - while connected - not motivated by supremacism , sense of being in a war or any other vile intentions . 
   point being : at some point people will demand retribution and the current perception of the states unwillingness to `` do something '' is not really helpful . 
  not saying it will be right , but the human condition being what it is , one would have to be a fool to not expect some response soon . 
  it might happen , yore right , but we both know that it would happen as a last cry of some sort . 
   and that is indeed the danger . 
  if the state ca n't uphold its part of the social contract , physical security , people will secure themselves . 
  it 's only a matter of time . 
  so i truly wish the states step up their game ... 
  this is so important . 
  while i think watching a purge would be fascinating - i do n't really think i want to watch one . 
  lets hope that western europe ups their game as you 've said . 
  this is something that we know is happening - but noone can feel that . 
  and so far every time there was a safety assurance - another smack on another cheek, 
  thats true . 
  i have no base to stand on except for my small , limited experience - while you , a belgian man surely have more encounters with french and you might even speak the language  all im saying is that french people will do nothing , because they can do nothing . 
  there might be a few separated incidents , but they will get easily ended by military ( 13k soldiers on the streets ) and police . 
  i have one french friend , pretty reasonable guy from ~ toulouse , and he 's saying that people get pissed off , glued to tv if something happens , but they do n't act . 
  last thing is : i do n't think a french citizen is able to get their hands on a gun . 
  we all know that there are lots of police honeypots and trust involved in illegal markets . 
  what i wa n't to say is that its easier to get guns for 20 yo terrorists from a ghetto , than for a white french dude . 
  fn will win , nothing else will happen . 
  they are harmless lunatics . 
  nothing will happen . 
  maybe one dude doing something breivik style , thats all . 
  so nothing serious . 
  it would take a lot ( like a muslim takeover attempt ) for normal people , for example right-wingers like me to do something . 
  only in self defence . 
  tldr : bs decision in order to be politically correct . 
  exactly this . 
  im trying to explain that here on / r/europe , and im hitting a brick wall . 
  people already know that hurr durr right wing goverment hurr durr dictators hurr durr poland always behind ... its sad . 
  you know they will throw you in the can for that ? 
  you will be bigger news than the terrorist,

  it has been also clear for some time that lybia and isis are sending the refugees at us purposefully , objectifying them and using as an economical weapon . 
  they know that these people will not assimilate and will instead become hostlite to our societies , whilst living around them . 
  they know this , because this is what has been happening for the last 20 or 30 years . 
  many of the people who emigrate are just economical emigrants , seeking better living standards . 
  and if not those , but the actual refugees ; do you really think that after establishing here ( the ideal situation ) and living to their fullest , they will be willing to return to their countries to fight economical problems ? 
  meanwhile , who will be fighting the dictators ? 
  european soldiers ? 
  who will be defending and educating the poor that will remain on site ? 
  you want to evacuate them ? 
  those who reach europe are a fraction of those who live under the reign of terror , i say this again . 
  and they were better off , while also living away from the danger , at least far enough to not be trapped . 
  think world war 2 . 
  people were fleeing central europe only to return there with allied armies . 
  they were fleeing to be able to fight for their freedom . 
  and allies were up for that . 
  is this what is happening now ? 
  these people will stay and become either fat and well off , or hostile to europeans . 
  they leave for better lives , not for the better future of their homelands - because they have no homelands , countries that they are fleeing were forced upon them by us !, 
  and while we do have responsibility for them , we can not resolve the situation by pretty and heart warming means , but with cold calculation . 
  so while you accuse me of being mean , telling people in dire need to go back and fight for their land , with our support , i call myself sensible , while you are naive . 
  because your solution is to take them in and then wait for the problems in the region to magically disappear , while still thousands will die . 
  and then to throw this people back there , drastically lowering their living standards . 
  or maybe you also know some magic way to build economies , without participation of the elites ? 
  do you volunteer to live in the middle east and drive economy of syria or iraq , after the mass murders are over ? 
  but then , what do you do ? 
  pharmacy ? 
  high tech ? 
  social liberties ? 
  who will replace you ? 
  a refugee ? 
  this is a cruel world , and what works is not always pretty . 
  which is hard for me to take as well , because i too was once an idealist . 
  these people are worse off , that 's for sure . 
  but while they are , the solution is not to take them all in . 
  cause in the world there are more people that are in bad situation that there is those who are doing well . 
  the only way to tackle world 's problems is to tackle them locally . 
  bringing all people in need to a single location , will only cause people who already live there to become povert . 
  money does not grow on trees . 
  and that 's also an excellent point / u/vangundysbaldhead is making : wealthy middle eastern states are doing jack shit to help resolve this situation . 
  while they also can be connected to the mess that has been created in the region . 
  which is being brought up more and more by the refugees themselves . 
  people do not need refuge . 
  especially not the well educated and relatively healthy who are elite of their societies . 
  they need to be helped to solve their local problems and secure their countries . 
  we can not suddenly allow to depopulate seventh part of the world , because some very bad men live in the countries the people are running from . 
  and we definitely can not accept more economical immigrants than our economies require , out of the kindness of our hearts . 
  it is the shortest way to make our countries povert , and then unable to provide any help , to the poor that can not afford a boat ticket and will have to remain under assad 's or any other local fuck head 's rule . 
  europe has to get elbow dirty with middle east , and fix the problems locally , remove the cause for mass emigration , not trying to accomodate millions of people , and leave `` bad men '' inside isis 's borders . 
  the thing is that we can not take the wealthy that can reach europe , and do bugger all to help the ones who are left behind - that would be economical discrimination . 
  do you want to bring them all here ? 
  and please , do n't forget about palestinians . 
  it 's high time that the northern hemisphere actually does something , to solve problems that it created during the colonial era , which for some countries , like france or us is not even actually over yet . 
  and this will be a feat , cause for 60 fucking years - pardon me - we were not able to even fix israelian neighbourhood . 
  what . 
  is n't italian meat expensive ? 
  you can earn more on fake internal product than on genuine imported one ? 
  no , no . 
  that was forced upon us by the germans . 
  they brought it along , during the times of the er ... cultural exchage tours . 
  it 's stone mimicry . 
  the north remembers !, 
  wait ... was n't ireland about 6m around 2012 ? 
  oh my god , that burns . 
  seriously though , any country could repatriate 20k people from another  5m country . 
  ^ on ^ a ^ second ^ thought : hum ... maybe not any from any , but lots from lots :p, 
  was n't ussr suppressing the liberty it `` returned '' to you some 10 years after ? 
  anyway , obviously i wo n't be telling you what to do with yours , but when it comes to ussr monuments and `` gifts '' in poland , i 'm happy to leave them where they are , if only they hold a bolded text `` they tried , they failed . 
  better luck next time !, 
  it 's a vicious circle , you know . 
  the fences are bare , so they seem higher than necessary , so they become in need of heightening :p, 
  huh . 
  i must 've been confusing something else with the russian embassy . 
  will investigate on site :p, 
  i always wanted to trigger the american intelligence service with something suspicious and then go back to regular life . 
  have them hear me pee several times in a day for nothing . 
  but i was afraid it operates like the kgb - now there is a case , so there must be some guilt , even if fabricated . 
  thanks :d, 
  yup , also in polish , they are called `` indyk '' , since `` india '' is `` indie '' . 
  does n't work in english though , 
  and turkeys from turkey ... owait , they did come through turkey :(, 
  it 's ironic that everytime i 'm trying to make a joke using the fact that we are stereotypically alcoholics , it turns out that we just really are alcoholics xd, 
  sorry i 've gotten confused by my own rant :p do you mean that people ca n't - tell poland from holland - holland from the netherlands - tell that the netherlands are not a vice den ? 
  stories and plots do n't come out of void . 
  you 'd be surprised how many criminal stories were based - not inspired - on true crimes . 
  people are pretty despicable , it 's what we excel at it would seem . 
  the netherlands , i beg of you . 
  it 's like whenever a pole goes abroad , to the southern hemisphere , and the locals ask them `` where are you from '' , the response is apparently always `` poland '' and the locals go `` ah !, 
  holland !, 
  marijuana !, 
  brothels ! '' . 
  let us let it on the side that it 's incorrect , do you really want to mess with the brains of a whole hemisphere by putting `` poland '' and `` holland '' together ? 
  - edit : i 've read the source afterwards only to find out that it 's polish . 
  now i will burn in ethernal shame :(, 
  well , not entirely daily , but since we require alcohol to get through the working day it 's essenstial to stock up when the prices are lowest . 
  that 's basically how we got through the economical crisis with enough money to still consume like before . 
  i 'd imagine that it 's offensive to imply that a french ( wo ) man does n't know how much a croissant cost . 
  it 's like implying i would have to google current per liter vodka pricing . 
  but before or after the union was made ? 
  after , the dukes were sort of governors ( if i am not mistaken ) , while the lithuanian kings were rulling from poland ( a nifty trick that was :p ) , but before i guess dukes would be the same as kings , just not recognized by the west . 
  either way it seems to me , you had multiple kings :p happy celebration ,

   what the hell would anybody expect to happen ? 
  if not for weapons and army from russia nothing would happen . 
  do you really think eastern ukrainians would start that rebellion if not for russia ? 
  there would be some demonstrations , then there would be next elections with some compromise between western and eastern ukraine . 
  russia had to mess up cause ukraine were escaping its influences , so it 's russian fault . 
  the military stuff happened only because russia invaded ukraine by-proxy . 
  that happened only because ukraine did majdan . 
  becoming part of nato was n't a goal of majdan , so i do n't see how nato membership for ukraine is relevant to the discussion . 
  thanks to nord stream it 's even possible . 
  ukraine is example of the option you advocate ( `` not allowing them to retake the countries but not bringing nato close to them '' ) . 
  it shows that you are in fact wrong , because it 's hard not to allow russia to mess with a country if it 's not in nato . 
  poland , czech republic , slovakia , baltic states , romania , hungary ( the countries you say were wrongly admited to nato ) pose no problem to the world . 
  there is peace there , nobody tries to take them down , they do n't invade anybody . 
  hungary is a small problem recently , but still nothing on the scale of ukraine . 
  had ukraine been in nato there would be no problem there now , too . 
  it was the fact that russians got too much from the west after the collapse that was the problem . 
  the more you give them the more they want . 
  putin got reset with obama and what have he done with it ? 
  his end goal is ussr 2.0 with orthodox relligion and russian nationalism instead of communism as the main ideology . 
  but all the power mechanisms will be the exact same - censorship , militarization , brainwashing , etc. 
  that 's the main problem , not russian neighbors or western politics . 
   also , did you know that poland has a huge responsibility for existence of ussr ? 
   poland ? 
  pi\u0142sudski - yes . 
  i do n't report people on internet . 
   because there is literally no connection betwen how hard russian citizens had it after ussr died and holodomor . 
  literally . 
  but of course there is connection . 
  ussr was supposedly communist country , and its many failures were caused by that . 
  it collapsed because of it , and it forced people to starve because of it . 
  that 's what happens when you pay no matter if someone works or no , and get people property from them . 
  but the main thing i was going for was - it was good that ussr collapsed because it was bad state for its people . 
  so no matter small inconveniences you complain about - it was better that it failed . 
  before it collapsed it forced millions of other people you do n't care about to suffer much worse things than people in moscow did when it collapsed . 
   and what ussr and holodomor got to do with anything ? 
  you were complaining ( in quite condescending way ) that the fall of ussr were hard on moscow citizens . 
  i said ( using your style of conversation ) the ussr was hard on other people , so no big deal . 
  at least the failed experiment is over now . 
  yes obviously russia is trying to make an example of what happens when you protest against russian aggression . 
  some countries like hungary already felt for that . 
  that 's why energy union would be a great thing for eu . 
  and why nord stream pipeline was a bad thing . 
  schreder did eu a lot of harm ( and got bribes for it ) - he should have been taken to court for that . 
  anyway - it 's still not worth to become russian bitch like hungary just to get the gas flowing . 
  we will manage . 
  i do n't get your point ? 
  i have n't said anything about occupation of poland nor katy\u0144 massacre . 
  you were the one to bring it up . 
  i wrote that ussr is responsible for hlodomor in ukraine so it 's weird to complain about a small food shortages when it finally collapsed . 
  it was a reasonable ( if risky ) research - they tried to achieve fusion cheaper than the current state of art , following a theory by prof. kaliski . 
  it would be possible to use it both for bombs and for power generation , so if successful it would be economicaly worth it . 
  and we obviously had the money for that , because we were doing it , and had been able to waste still more money on a lot of useless stuff . 
  2 can play that game . 
  oh poor boy , you had no food for 2-3 days ? 
  ukrainians had no food for months thanks to ussr . 
   russia was pushed back and humiliated so much , after the end of the cold war . 
  yeah , we should just let them occupy half of europe so they do n't feel humiliated . 
  would be much better . 
   also we never had anything approaching enough money for nuclear program . 
  we had nuclear program . 
  during soviet times , gierek tried to get poland nukes independently from russians . 
  ussr got the news , the main scientist http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sylwester_kaliski had accident and that was it . 
   no , when did i ever say this ? 
  you said russia has the right to decide for ukraine which alliances it can be part of . 
   i disagree with ukraine joining nato , that 's it . 
  ukraine have n't joined nato , and it probably would n't have . 
  not that i have anything against it . 
   let me ask you something , what do you think is going to happen ? 
  is ukraine going to join nato and regain all the territory from the separatists ? 
  really . . ? 
  do you honestly think that ?? 
  and if not , then were n't all these lives in vain . 
  ukraine protested on the majdan to be able to : - get rid of corrupt moscow crooks ( like janukowycz ) - change the constitution back ( the changes janukowycz made were slowly turning ukraine into authoritarian country ) - be able to enter partnership with eu . 
  they were n't fighting to join nato - some of them my want that in the end , but that was n't the goal . 
  why you keep speaking about that ? 
  and then it 's not ukrainian fault that russians are assholes . 
  the invader is to be blamed for war victims , not the invaded country . 
  and no - defending freedom is not `` in vain '' . 
   do you think the us would allow mexico or canada to join an alliance with russia/china , and would n't help rebels that might be against that and more pro us ? 
  i am not sure , but even if usa would do something wrong that does n't mean it would be right for russia or anyone else to do the same . 
  `` usa beating blacks '' does n't mean it 's ok . 
  all in polish : tok fm - discussion and news radio - many good debates ( but the bratkowski and pasent ones are often cringeworthy : / ) http://www.tokfm.pl/tokfm/0,130137.html tr\u00f3jka ( polish radio three ) http://www.polskieradio.pl/9,trojka - ok mainstream music , some nice discussions akademickie radio centrum http://centrum.fm/ - a lot of alternative music . 
  funny `` half-proffesional '' atmosphere ( it 's made by students ) . 
  yeah and there were poles and even jews escaping from invaded poland to germany during september 1939 . 
  so what ? 
  civilians prefer not to live on the front line . 
  does n't change the fact that agressor is the one to be blamed , not the victim . 
  so , russia has its sphere of influence so it has the right to force neighbors to do what it wants ? 
  by that logic poland has its sphere of influence too . 
  we want ukraine to be independent of russia . 
  why should russia have its way and not poland or ukraine ? 
  does nukes make russia right ? 
  you essentialy say `` might makes the right '' . 
  but by that law russia should be usa vassal , cause usa is far more powerful than russia . 
  there 's bigger difference between usa and russia , than between russia and ukraine . 
  or if you only count neighbors then china is also more powerful than russia by far . 
  is russia in chinese sphere of influence ? 
  it should be according to russian logic , so china has the right to choose russian politicians and decide their policy . 
  do you agree ? 
  this whole `` spheres of influence '' idea that russia preaches is based on giving more rights to more powerful countries , yet russia do n't want to apply it to themselves , it still thinks of itself like it 's 1980 .

  well fact of the matter great of media in poland is german-owned . 
  it is difficult not to feed pis conspiracy theorists given how media were friendly towards po - the previous ruling party - and is now strict with pis . 
  that said poland is way too sensitive . 
  i mean there 's otherr ways of entertaining yourselves than getting drunk shitless . 
  i do n't think we 'd dig associating ourselves with nazis . 
  catholic vanguard state , maybe . 
  that does n't sound right . 
  kim kardashian was n't even popular in poland . 
  leftists - postcommie sympathisers basically . 
  hopefully there 'll come a leftist party that changes this mentality . 
  supporters of the new leader love their `` a-ha ! '', 
  arguments . 
  objectivity is fairly scarce on both sides . 
  and for polish standards , compared to rest of europe that 's really not very leftist . 
  i think the main difference lies is how the previous government went around it . 
  do n't mean to justify either party , mind you . 
  po at least tried to do its best to comply with the constitutional tribunal , whilst pis does n't play ball at all and dictates its ( ie , kaczy\u0144ski 's , let 's not delude ourselves here ) conditions to how it should work when it does n't agree with them and passes `` reforms '' on it overnight . 
  i think it 's not as bad as you think . 
  entry of turkey would mean more turkish migrants for sure , but would also mean their easier integration since their movement as well as education and exposure to western values would be that much more coordinated and defined . 
  it 's definitely a long term win in my book . 
  the apt counter question is ... which ones ? 
  noted . 
  kurds are a very varied group . 
  i just find it weird how divided they are over the 4 states . 
  yeah , we 're working on it . 
  i think if turkey removes erdogan from power and restores democracy i 'm sure we can talk . 
  supporting kurds seems like the most obvious outcome first and foremost , but i 'm sure the turks here would disagree and the superpowers would n't dare agitate turkey ... unless russia . 
  it 's easy to drown in stereotypes when your country is practically in the middle of europe next to germany and has less than 2 % migrants at the same time . 
  any wave of migrants is likely to leave social repercussions . 
  prevent ? 
  probably not . 
  discourage it , make it frowned upon ? 
  yes . 
  it 's never too late for the market , i 'm more worried about political apathy and current influence of megacorps . 
  aspirations like that are fine ; but you have to earn those by other means than money . 
  it 's just a matter of directing thought processes , that they do not and should not gain power over others with money . 
  i never met a pathological altruist honestly . 
  i am not a psychologist , not qualified to answer this question . 
  a sociopath to my limited knowledge is a person devoid of empathy willing to use and manipulate people and treat his surroundings as tools without any semblance of guilt , they 've no hesitation to use others and usually imitate positive emotions instead of actually feeling them . 
  there was some statistic made that 30 % of big time businessmen are sociopaths and that led to their ill-earned success . 
  perhaps not directly intended , but they work best this way - a migrant has to learn norwegian/swedish and even then wo n't be treated completely like a swede - saw some example from norway of a studied experienced doctor knowing norwegian but being foreign forces him to only be a taxi driver . 
  people just ca n't imagine the same nordic system like in canada working for a large country . 
  it 's not radical , but it works . 
  i 'm not against free market or self-interest , merely against their abuses and that 's a difference . 
  i do n't mean to limit business in any shape or form unless it brings harm to the people , environment or country 's welfare and other factors of a wider importance . 
  i do n't mean to say i 'm advocating the same system , merely that until a better system exists , i advocate for an imo successful system that is currently applied in smaller countries and apply it in a larger scale and see what happens and for now . 
  i do n't mean to promote altruism over self-interest , that 's impossible in this short time period , maybe in a couple generations . 
  what i mean to suggest is to by policies align self-interest with altruistic behavior and make it profittable for businesses to not be assholes . 
  other businesses would follow because that 's the rules and consumers would be more sensitive to what businesses do and take interest that they stay on this track , ideally . 
  politically i have a different idea , imo tweaking the swiss direct democracy system would work best . 
  the more decentralised the power and the closer it is to the people and engaging the people the better it works , imo . 
  a system where less than half people vote shows people 's apathy that nothing can change and people 's engagement in local politics needs to change if we 're to affect our politicians . 
  imo if politicians worked their way up from local city councils all the way up , i think they 'd think 5 times before turning into populism or vote selfishly . 
  your doubts are another reason those long-term measures need to be undertaken . 
  it wo n't solve the problem but imo the more we promote positive behaviors and discourage negative ones , the better for our future . 
  i do n't disagree there 's fishy stuff going on with the current packages and there 's some german interest involved , my point regarded greece way earlier that led to this series of events . 
  i could start from saying greece should n't have joined the eu or the euro in the first place . 
  certainly better than being a pathological sociopath , no ? 
  that was my point as well in some other reply . 
  the point is to take the best out of capitalism like competition and self-interest and take out the bad abuses . 
  i too prefer to regulate it or tweak it and instead of scrapping it . 
  i 'm just hoping it 's not too late . 
  there really is no left wing in poland as i see it . 
  only liberals and conservatives/right wing . 
  that 's why i said no nordic countries ironically ; the problem with scandinavian states is that they are intended to be very closed states based on national trust , something very challenged by the refugee crisis . 
  the other states diminished national identity significance and while they encounter issues as any multicultural country , they are much better states and people as a whole imo . 
  i mean , canada is a walking polite person stereotype - this did n't come out of nowhere . 
  if you can promote people to be brought up in a more positive manner and promote certain behaviors and make altruist principles a voting issue , business and more selfless politicians * will * follow , even if not directly . 
  if nothing else , then greed should halt other people 's greed  even that is good for starters . 
  yay , agreement ^ _ ^, 
  i can understand that . 
  to me there 's always room for improvement when it comes to stamping out and discouraging purely negative behaviors . 
  imo the definition of greed changes and was subjective since people exist , so by your definition it would be stamped out from the very beginning . 
  eh , reddit at least tries to discuss things . 
  when i see forums like onet.pl i only see trolls , strawmans and ad hominems . 
  i do n't think you can because what is natural self-interest now may be outright greed in a couple hundred years . 
  damn , that 's a tough question . 
  i do n't mean to be biased but i personally like the nordic model employed by countries other than the nordics ironically ( think canada , new zealand , iceland ) it 's basically free market economy with regulatory measures that stimulate certain positive behaviors and curtail certain negative ones . 
  i think , for now at least , this could work . 
  really ? 
  to me it 's polish politics as usual . 
  it most certainly can , but it does so rarely compared to anonymous individuals , nor is it as harmful usually because it affects the majority as well . 
  conditions are usually very dire for people to be openly greedy or egotistical . 
  if people decide the current system is fine it 's level of greed that is acceptable to them . 
  i ca n't think of a better solution , it is a lot of people an individual could possibly affect negatively , so it is only just that this majority decides whether whatever the individual is offering in exchange is worth the harm and have the right to accept it or reject it . 
  time frame depends on scale . 
  i do n't believe self-interest can be stamped out , merely greed . 
  i think it is possible to promote better alternatives that are n't as harmful or are actually beneficial . 
  people learn , adapt , can be motivated by and ultimately evolve by different factors . 
  civilization should be about promoting positive behaviors while discouraging the negatives as part of upbringing ; it can be affected in multiple ways , all of them better than `` accept greed as human nature and do nothing about it '' . 
  democracy does , so in this case , the majority affected by the individual . 
  i am representing a proud minority of polish social liberal hipsters . 
  true , i too support a decentralized rule that goes up instead of a centralized rule that covers all the people down in some shape or form , albeit not exactly in those words you described ; i like centralization that earned its way through the bottom of the roots than none at all . 
  i do n't think the whole `` worker unity '' and an ideology `` in opposition '' as most forms of communism and socialism promote are is really catching for modern times . 
  a higher cause requires to cover government , ideology , economy and religion and imo socialism is , while it has good intentions , divisive on many matters and unnecessarily forceful in others , while imo what we need is something that brings out the good out of people and have that influence those things accordingly . 
  true . 
  and i hope those will get patched out as time goes on . 
  we 're no theocracy yet so i 'm content with the small things :p, 
  i do n't see how lack of a plan is a good plan :p, 
  do n't think so .

  it 's the new uncontrolled african/middle eastern migration period we 're against . 
  offical negotiations start after they lose voting power . 
  they 're just making sure to be viewed with contempt . 
  we 've had zero muslim terrorist attacks , france had more than that . 
  general opinion is to play it safe . 
  if richer countries ca n't as of yet figure out how to make muslims not blow shit up and burn cars we ca n't as well . 
  all in all it 's about importing uneducated people from culture that has values incompatible with our own . 
  you either respect women or you do n't . 
  i bet she was going to build a dirty bomb to get at all the british xenophobes . 
  actually , we hate coal with passion . 
  we hate it so much that we want to see all of it burn . 
  it goes back to partitions at least , not world war . 
  we 've hard a pretty bloody history ( on both giving and receiving end ) and it breeds a lot of mistrust . 
  because his main point to distinguish people was n't their economic policy . 
  it was either to curb local dissent or get rid of other races . 
  that 's because of how demographics are . 
  if there 's more retired people per a working person more people will be needed to pay for their food , rent and medicine . 
  whatever redistribution magic you do on paper , someone physically has to do work . 
  you ca n't have your car repaired without a person doing the job . 
  yet i have n't seen many people referring to water as `` plastic ice '' . 
  the problem is not trying to grow population , but preventing it from shrinking . 
  when you get one working person supporting two retired people it 's going to be disaster no matter the money , you physically need to do work . 
  only so much can be imported . 
  next thing you 'll tell me it 's szczecin , wroc\u0142aw , gda\u0144sk and \u041b\u044c\u0432\u0456\u0432 . 
  i 'd think that someone would step back and think hard about what they 're eating when you are calling it `` plastic cheese '' . 
  it changes declension of words around it and this is just general guideline . 
  like elves being in animal category , but wolves sometimes being in human category . 
  there 's a distinction between male humans , male animals and male inanimate objects . 
  yeah . 
  just look at the japs . 
  they 've been doing it for some years now . 
  polish has five grammatical genders . 
  it 's a step closer towards the goal of becoming united with usa again . 
  when will this new age of german terrorism end ? 
   trucks 70 km/h what ? 
  i 've never seen a truck that was n't going 90 . 
  woje ~ voie is warrior ( s ) , w\u00f3dz ~ vod is someone who leads and - two is `` domain of '' . 
  well , it 's better than its translation `` warlordship '' . 
  where do you live ? 
  i 'm a few km from wroc\u0142aw and i 've got 50 mb/s for 50 z\u0142 / month . 
  it 's a stationary aircraft carrier . 
   i guess due to very homogeneous population i do n't think it 's the case . 
  poland has a very homogenous population currently , but our culture is very far from being collectivist . 
  it 's been like that for a long time ( although population was n't very homogenous back then ) . 
   let them be obese if they want that 's a drain on society . 
  increased healthcare costs alone make this a bad idea . 
  not really . 
  just overly territorial people . 
  it 's funny how it 's exactly the opposide of what everyone around has told me for my whole life `` a bad decision is better than no decision '' .

  that 's true , but it 's just how demoracy is . 
  it has its faults , but personally i do n't know a better system of governance . 
  educating people is probably the only way to change the fact that popular opinions are often bad for the country . 
  that 's the way life is , but somehow people keep popping up and saying `` thanks x '' , even if it 's just reading the mood of populace . 
  reddit teaches you about writing in style like no teacher in school could . 
  internet points are more important than grades . 
  whether there is a need for it or not is not something that comes in the picture when it comes to causes and effects . 
  i want everyone living peacefully just like the next guy , but europe is stirring and no amount of good will on our part can change that . 
  either we do something now or it escalates .

  her stance was what aligned with popular opinion at the time . 
  if popular opinion changes merkel 's stance will change too . 
  and it was crusaders , not christians who killed people in middle ages . 
  nah , it 's just his hippie son . 
  bribes are cheap . 
  to be honest muslims have been whipping up fear against muslims quite efficiently for the past few days . 
  in the end , calling european countries people bad guys , because somebody fucked up informing populace about reasons for it and they ended up not supporting it is not really honest . 
  this was the reason used by blair and only reason used as war justification on the tv back then . 
  any more reasons did not reach me and i suspect i 'm not alone in this . 
  for public opinion it was the decision of putting a stick into an ant hill or not for dubious reasons . 
  balts , it 's time to get your own nukes . 
  russians did n't have balistic rocket nukes back then .

  what ? 
  iraq invasion was shoddy at best . 
  everyone was going there based on non-existing or fabricated reports of wmds which were not there after all . 
  it 's a harsh option with political consequences ( it would also make at least polish and hungarian goverments angry probably ) , but it is an option nonetheless . 
  it 's the matter of how much will `` nay , we 're not brexxiting yet '' situation escalates . 
   we wolud be  we should  fund our that 's only consequence of the wording of your previous post . 
  if everyone else decides uk is acting in an undemocratic way ( not honoring the referendum ) its eu membership may get suspended . 
  it 's not outright kicking-out , but effectively works the same . 
  mostly polish in poland do n't really give a fuck about them . 
  if they want to be polish so much they can come and work here . 
  this means nothing if they 've just figuratively purged everyone who is n't a private . 
  it 's easy to divide and conquer , and cut off supply of a disorganized army .

  i doubt . 
  people prefer quiet enviroment . 
  ruralisation happened after 2000 's and when we experienced much economic growth . 
  people went richer and did n't pushed for job that much . 
  people are moving into suburbs and villages , because of cheaper land and more quiet enviroment . 
  you can see the examples everywhere for example tricity - does n't expanding at all , if it is then it 's the suburbs and small cities nearby for example banino , \u017bukowo , szad\u00f3\u0142ki . 
  the same in warsaw general population does not seem to going up , but the cities nearby are . 
  of course there are maybe some villages in the middle of nowhere like near w\u0142odawa , without jobs that maybe are depopulating , but it 's definitely not the problem for a whole country, 
  you actually do n't know situation at all . 
  we do n't have problem with shrinking villages . 
  we have problem with shrinking cities . 
  people tend to move from cities into villages , small cities nearby . 
  this is called ruralisation and it 's noticeable especially where i live . 
  old houses are being wasted and neglected because of empitness , while the suburbs are expanding, 
  read the official stats first . 
  600 thousand of polish slav ( e ) s as you like to call are living now in uk and unemployment has not went up . 
  invest in eastern poland, 
   that 's not easy with a lot of immigrants it 's easy  you for real ? 
  what are you , their spokesman ? 
  i do know some people who live there . 
  i 'm also using internet and see . 
   all european cultures are similar and look how many wars happened in the past . 
  poles and ukrainians have a similar culture , sure . 
  not look up how much killing there has been in the past despite that . 
  yes , ukrainian will kill people , especially those who give them money . 
  do n't make me laugh . 
   all developed countries have this problem . 
  there 's no escaping it . 
  western europe imported muslims and africans to offset it , but they 'll just end up with the same problem 40 years from now . 
  and with crime and unemployment as a bonus . 
  uk , france , ireland , or even germany does n't have it . 
  in uk average polish women have twice as much kids as in poland . 
   or stay and be homeless/work illegally/do crime not gon na happen . 
  they 'd be deported  how am i a hypocrite ? 
  i said `` we do n't need these kind of tensions in our country '' , as in , `` other countries already have them and we do n't want to '' i dobut . 
  600k of poles living in the uk and do n't complain . 
  they even do n't want to move back . 
  they do n't react for `` they took yer jerbs '' comments and so the ukraianians in pl  offsetting population decline with immigration is asking for trouble yes , when the immigrants are from another cultural civilization , unlike ukrainians , which are similar . 
   so what ? 
  we do n't have to open borders to anyone except schengen countries . 
  we have to . 
  because our demographics are abysmal and so the ongoing problem with zus ( lack of people who work , more retired ) also ukrainians working here would pay taxes , which will be benefitial for us . 
   there are not enough jobs for these people if they wo n't find the job , they will go back  they would be willing to work for less than an average pole . 
  you could expect `` they 're taking muh jabs '' in tv every day . 
  we do n't need these kind of tensions in our country . 
  the same in uk , do n't be hypocrite  it would n't cancel out population decline , only stall it . 
  still better than decline . 
  also better ukrainians than muslims . 
  why not ? 
  i honestly doubt the number would be in millions . 
  i expect 300-400k, 
  because poland needs ukrainian immigrants . 
  now we are in pathological situation . 
  ukrainians are working in poland to return to ukraine with money , because they ca n't reside and buy a flat there because of laws . 
  after changes we would have more permanent residents from ukraine that will build our economy and prevent demographical cathastropy . 
  not to mention that our laws towards ukrainians are pretty much very nationalist . 
  only ukrainians that have full right to reside in poland are those with `` pole 's card '' whcih means they have aproved polish background . 
  receiving a visa for average ukrainians is like winning a lotery . 
  i hope for changes . 
  norway is cheaper than switzerland ?

   28 countries , one common language for someone that knows history it does sound suspicious, 
  according to official stats only 1 person received asylum in poland . 
  it sounds familar ... 
  german invasion of poland was catastrophic for germany in a long run . 
  no one sane would want to start a nuclear war with the world . 
  is there any reason russia would attack poland ? 
  i doubt . 
  russia attacking poland would signed a death sentence for themselves . 
  i 'm sick of this warmongering . 
  russia invading poland is an impossible scenario .

  i guess hard-working is a positive feature . 
  i smell it 's somehow biased . 
  i thought it means something like hard/tough guy or something similar . 
  even your surname is funny, 
  i think the main reason are crime gangs from romania that were known in poland . 
  people asociated romanians with thieves , gypsies , etc. 
  also there is lots of people who thinks that romanians are gypsies . 
  we do n't whine about all countries that are south of us and the baltics , except lithuania . 
  were not that bad, 
  as a polish can confirm . 
  warsaw is on the right place . 
  that 's perfect desrption of him .

  hmm  our father , who art in heaven , hallowed be thy name , thy kingdom come , thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven . 
  plenty of christian-majority countries with terrible state of human rights too . 
  additionally , most of the refugees are from syria , which was one of the most socially liberal muslim states before the war . 
  what you depict is islamic extremism . 
  it is an error to claim muslims are by definition extremist just like it is an error to claim christians are by definition extremists . 
  the bible has plenty of conflict-inducing elements and they have been used for war in europe for centuries . 
  i have said all i needed in my first reply to you . 
  you can continue to claim knowledge of a complex future and i am sure you will continue to do so . 
  yes , because obviously there are only ever two extreme choices to any problem . 
  i want a common european agency ( or a coherent framework ) managing refugees in the eu/schengen area . 
  refugees from troubled regions should be distributed across the eu and provided aid . 
  purely economic migrants should be filtered out of the refugee crowd and deported if their countries are safe . 
  whatever you do , many migrants will come and many will stay . 
  you can not keep them out , so they should be managed orderly . 
  they are not managed orderly now . 
  sounds like you have solved planet , humanity and everything !, 
  those disagreements sound exactly like those with , say , muslims . 
  of course they do . 
  climate and populations are very different beasts with different dynamics . 
  you can not just put them next to each other like that . 
  the prediction that africa 's population is going to rise does not say anything how will that population accommodate . 
  believe it or not , but migration is not the first choice of most people . 
  just fyi , your comments got broken at the `` what are your favourite and least favourite things '' part, 
  you have some proposals of that `` non-empathy '' thinking , perhaps ? 
  actually , it is the reverse . 
  remember when syrian war started ? 
  i kept hearing `` haha , stupid arabs are killing each other , let them '' . 
  well , look how that `` non-empathy '' thinking turned out . 
  what do you propose , then ? 
  making a big fucking wall spanning a continent , perhaps ? 
  shipping people into a desert ? 
  yes , it is scaremongering . 
  it is making long-term apocalyptic sociological predictions . 
  i keep hearing `` wait wait , in 30 years there will be no european civilization '' - well , 30 years ago people had no idea how 2015 will look like . 
  neither do we know now how will the situation look in 30 , 20 or even 10 years . 
  i love religious criteria . 
  make me feel like my part of europe really did progress to 19th century . 
   in before this post `` vanishes '' . 
  strawman much ? 
  do people who are not anti-immigrant , in your mind , approve of everything they do ? 
  no one approves of murder . 
  it is just that not everyone brings such tragedies up as a proof of whole groups of people being inferior . 
  murderers are murderers . 
  or do you want to strawman something ? 
  by now , brits do n't even remember that poles were supposed to be a problem !, 
  i mean the crisis in your tourist destination . 
  well , shit happens , that crisis was n't wanted by anyone , including the refugees . 
  you said you do n't want '' ` multicultural ' mess with no semblance of actual culture left '' and provided examples of paris and london . 
  paris and london are not a `` multicultural mess with no semblance of actual culture left '' , not even close . 
  your own reasoning contradicts itself . 
  to be clear , i meant polish tourists doing that  are you certain they were n't polish ? 
  maybe russian and polish tourists behave similarly , slavic pride and all that . 
  calling those outbursts `` politics '' is a bit of an overstatement . 
  usually just insults at this or that group of people . 
  my faith in french ultras is saved !, 
  i have no doubt what polish banners would be . 
  they were virulently racist and xenophobic long before this crisis , i have no idea how can they escalate from that now . 
  of course not all and i would n't be surprised if they are a minority . 
  still heartening . 
  i know plenty of polish tourists go there as well and i do hear horror stories about them . 
  then again , it 's not like they leave the hotel anyway , too busy being constantly drunk and gorging themselves on `` free '' all-inclusive food . 
  no , just do n't be an asshole about a local crisis . 
  what are the sides again ? 
  us vs them , perhaps ? 
  yeah , i suppose . 
  they could also coat all the wood with some non-flammable substance or something . 
   because upon returning to my home country in a few years i want it to be the same country it was when i left , not some ` multicultural ' mess with no semblance of actual culture left . 
  that is not what happens in western europe . 
  paris and london , while affected , are not what you describe . 
  `` no semblance of actual culture left '' ? 
  what kind of fantasy is this ? 
  the fears you outline are idiotic , sorry . 
  you follow an apocalyptic vision that just does n't base on any other thing than emotions . 
  sort of inevitable with wooden churches , i suppose . 
  and now we are hunting a jewish conspiracy ? 
  this sub really went downhill recently . 
  no , it is defaulting back to xenophobic idiocy . 
  for opportunistic `` neutral '' outliers , perhaps . 
  not for the subcontinent main . 
  some countries may leave , the general thing will live on . 
   ( unless you are of the opinion that these people should be sent back to syria or the bottom of the mediterranean sea ) this actually seems to be the predominant opinion in every bigger immigrant thread in this sub now . 
  scary or depressing ? 
  both , i suppose . 
   stop pushing a false narrative . 
  this is especially funny with the comment author apparently claiming to represent `` the people '' and being sure what they think and what they want . 
  sure hope for mature discourse sometime soon . 
  is hard when so many people are frothing in xenophobic frenzy , though . 
  let 's hope leaders prove to be leaders , for a change . 
  seems like there are brigades/influxes in those immigrant threads . 
  i really hope mod team knows wtf they are doing . 
  they just ight be overwhelmed , though . 
  eastern europe , so happy to take european coin but suddenly uncooperative when there is a need to help with some `` dirty arabs '' .

  and yes , the above criticism does include my country .

  someone has to do something !, 
  wtf is with xenophobes and projecting decades into some imaginary apocalyptic future ? 
  2050 is in 35 years .

  august over caesar . 
  get over yourself . 
  it 's fucking 2014 and you are still crying about wilno ? 
  also check when wroclaw was polish last time before 1945 . 
  you would probably reconsider using it as an example when discussing wilno . 
  and based on what i 've heard about poles living around there i 'm quite happy that they are on the other side of the border . 
  i looked into the ranking and it 's complete mess . 
  i compared few countries i know quite a lot about and it seems like half of a data is wrong or made up . 
  apparently latvia , lithuania and hungary are 3 worst contributors to worlds peace and security . 
  there also seems to be no explanation for indicators . 
  this mostly . 
  having our own currency proved very handy in times of crisis . 
  we will probably wait till whole fiscal reform is done . 
  you are right to some extent . 
  policy to boost wages should have been implemented before euro implementation in order to make sure that inflation is under control . 
  still with wages so absurdly low i ca n't see how even a big increase could bring serious inflation problems . 
  euro or not . 
  so what person who ca n't find better job is supposed to do ? 
  invest in their own company with the money they do n't have ? 
  stop working ans starve to death in order to make capitalism work and force employers to rise wages since they ca n't find workers ? 
  and let 's not kid themselves , no one would want to work in walmart their whole live no matter the pay if they had other option . 
  whole concept of keeping wages for jobs like that low in order to make people aspire to a better life is as stupid as ideologies come . 
  kids these days ... 
   no , it is not pitiful . 
  furthermore , minimum wage jobs are mostly populated by teenagers you mean those millions of teenage fastfood and walmart workers protesting that they do n't earn enough to feed themselves or their children ? 
  i was refering to neo-lib wishful thinking mentality . 
  all the countries you mentioned have strong unions , very good social safety nets and/or very low public acceptance of employee exploitation . 
  all the things eastern european countries lack due to troubles of transformation from communist economy .

  let 's assume that 1st half of this post never happened , ok ? 
  to be honest in poland it is in very bad taste not to complain about our national parlament or level of corruption , so anything less than that would probably be considered a lossof national identity :d, 
  i think that uk leaving or at least getting their special second tier eu membership status is a must . 
  there is a will to deepen integration in quite a few areas among many member states and it 's clear that brits wil either be left out of it or make everyones live hell by spewing more and more nonsense for internal political use .

  i people could keep their ... let 's say silly , us-centric view away from ukrainian crisis it would result in much more clarity and considerably less dumb statements about this topic on internet . 
  it all seems logical and stuff , but citizens of baltic states see russian sabre rattping at their direction , rising activity of their russian minorities and very limited responce to ukrainian situation among some western and southern eu states and have to ask themselves if in case shit hits the fan , italians or brits will be willing to die for tallin when they ca n't be even bothered to lose few euro for sevastopol , or they will just keep expressong their deep concern and wonder if russian-speaking militants are indeed local or.imported . 
  in heir eyes some reactions are pure chamberlainism . 
  that being said i 'm not sure if sikorski getting the job would be beneficial to anyone at this point . 
  view on whole affair in london or paris is so much different than in riga or even warsaw that sikorski at helm could just expose.depth of those cracks and plunge eu into yet another crisis . 
  i think that government level actions toward energetic union and eu military are probably better way to go about this problem . 
  sounds about right . 
  poland and hungary are rowing in opposite directions when it comes to ukraine situation , while czechs and slovakia are being passive and interested only in some very minor economical gains . 
  while hungarian situation is quite clear to the point when our diplomats and politicians have hard time not speaking negativly about orban , i wonder what 's the line of thought behind czech and slovak politics ? 
  is situation in ukraine simple considered not serious enough to warrant risking some kind of russian embargo ? 
  are ( in ) actions of governments in line with general public ? 
  whole rise of far-right extremism and pro-russian stance of hungary is cosidered very disturbing and disappointing herenin warsaw . 
  our both countries were likeminded and cooperative for very long time . 
  at first it qas being dismissed as just a phase but lately people worry that it may not only be a temporary shift and if it may spread to other countries in a region . 
  is this falling out with warsaw even considered an issue in hungary ? 
  and if so what is general view on polish stance in this situation ? 
  and sending people into inhuman american prizons for every possible crime is n't creating any socio-economic problems ? 
  few years in max sec for dealing pot if you happen to be black seems ( ussual sentence in us ) sounds like proper punishment and something that resolves issues instead of creating them to you ? 
  and that 's what prison is for . 
  keeping dangerous elements out of society and refoming those who can be reformed . 
  not making some kind of hell on earth in order to feel good about yourself and some karmic justice . 
  now think if this very prison system that makes you feel all fuzzy inside is n't responsible for all those kids learning to kill . 
  how about you tell us about all the statues of everyones favourite belgian king ? 
  it is very simplified and by no means should be used to reach any meaningful conclusions about nations , cultures , religions or else . 
  iq tests are highly entrenched in one culture and require knowledge that people with different backgrounds and/or cultures have no chance of having . 
  second thing is what iq tests it is based upon . 
  i happened to have performed clinical iq test on me . 
  it took place in hospital and lasted about 4 hours . 
  it also produced 3 ( or 4 , ca n't recall and do n't have those medical papers here and it was few years back ) different types of iq scores . 
  it was , if i 'm not wrong , memory iq , analytical iq and something else . 
  i still would n't call that an exact science by any stretch of imagination . 
  nothing in this short article indicates that tests it 's based upon are anywhere near this kind of detailed examination . 
  i 'd say that it 's very , very unlikely . 
  ergo , we have a map based on unknown number of tests , of unknown but probably very low quality , showing very inaccurate and most likely meaningless score . 
  on top of that it is applied to people outside of cultures it was designed for . 
  tl ; dr - this has less cognitive value than average / r/aww picture . 
  i blame polish immigration :p, 
  [ kupala night , * noc kupa\u0142y * ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kupala_night ) - celebrated on 23/24 june night ( summer solstice ) is sort of fertility festival . 
  to this day it 's customary to go to countryside , have huge parties around bonfires , usually somewhere near woods and lake.other activities involve floating wreaths of flowers down the rivers , looking for [ fern flower ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fern_flower ) and having sex in the woods around the main event . 
  drowning or burning an egiffy of [ * marzanna * ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/marzanna ) , slavic godess/demon of winter and/or death .

  aside of macierewicz , most of his people are professors of the american , australian or candian universities which are ranked far , far above any university in poland . 
  ... why do n't you look it up and compare the names of guys who investigated both of these incidents ? 
  then tell me , which of them were present in both of these commissions . 
  ok , i posted zero videos , podcasts or texts promoting any kind of a party , but you already made up a whole legend about me and my bias . 
  so why are you defending this conspiracy theory if all of these `` evidences '' happend to be faked ? 
  it just does n't make any sense , but there 're still belivers spewing this bullshit every time this crash is mentioned . 
  but hey , he was drunk and `` pressuring '' , on the direct orders of the eeeevil president . 
  was n't he ? 
  if you say so , then i 'm delusional . 
  now tell me , which of those `` experts '' is hearing voices of gen. b\u0142asik in his head ? 
  i 'd really like to know who was responsible for this brilliant analising . 
  you must be kidding me . 
  those guys never investigated any serious crash except for some little planes and baloons . 
  yea rite , except they were supervised by the minister of internal affairs and then manned some body next to prime minister just to `` explain '' their great investigation . 
  tvn is as much `` liberal - conservative '' as cnn is and you , my dear redditor marcoos , you are spamming posts to promote a far left podemos wannabe party `` razem '' , but i 'm the biased one here . 
  fear me , 
  ... so this is that `` evidence '' ? 
  what happend to these leaks and recordings of gen. b\u0142asik ? 
  not to mention that this story was made up by russians in the first moments after the crash . 
  really i do n't give a f. . . about how many downvotes i get for saying that , but this theory was just made up for political reasons and it 's just pitful how many people still belives in it . 
  i 've said it once and i can only repeat , president ordered the pilot to land in tblisis when they were on airport in ukraine with all the presidents of baltic states , right after cease fire was issued . 
  this has nothing to do with the crash two years later . 
  not so much . 
  nobody cares about him anymore . 
  you know very well what kind of medias are in poland . 
  i 'm pretty sure it means bullshit . 
  and i 'm sure i can read and so do you , not to mention listening to such `` brainniacs '' like wa\u0142\u0119sa or assholes like palikot picking up every dirt against kaczy\u0144ski . 
  the mythical `` stance '' in georgia was in fact in ukraine , on airport where pilot was questioning the security of landing in tblisi right ** after ** the cease fire was issued . 
  there 's nothing in common between those two flights , unless you really have to make up theories in order to blame someone . 
  i mean especially those `` journalists '' who fabricated and repeated the infamous leaks and even after that was prooven false , pushed this theory just becouse they always hated this president . 
  i guess he means the fanatic belivers of lefty massmedias which created a conspiracy theory of president `` pressuring '' the pilots and actually killing himselve with the others . 
  oh and lets not forget the mysterious call from his brother , undoubtfully ordering to execute the whole master plan of suicide . 
  yeah , it would be good if they 'd open an international investigation with some experienced experts , not those local amateurs or some scientists working with ( currently ) ruling party . 
  unfortunatelly they wants to make the same `` mistake '' as donald and run a gov comission , but this time the gov has no support of lefty massmedias . 
  ok , so how are your relations with those countries now ? 
  are they still in denial and insulting you with some ancient propaganda or excuses ? 
  now look at our relations with germany and ask yourselve a question why we can get along with them and why ca n't we have normal relations with russia ... 
  i guess it must the fault of poland , right ? 
   president of poland might have talked the pilots into continuing dangerous approach and is responsible for the death of all those people ... and again this conspiracy theory . 
  fine , give me a ** single ** evidence which is not a fabricated leak for the use of presidential campaign of komorowski or speculatiuons of some lefty `` journalists '' . 
  just becouse pis would n't let it go and shut up they 've lost all the elections since 2010 until now . 
  the only reason that po was winning was the big bad boogeyman kaczy\u0144ski . 
  it 's just a meaningles label , not to mention that euractiv is sponsored by ec . 
  the current gov of poland is `` eurosceptic '' just becouse it 's criticising some of the eu policies , but this party was always advocating our membership and mobilised its voters when there was accesion referendum . 
  blame your politicians , it 's not like we forced you to enlarge eu and i really do n't think that you see what 's the real problem here . 
  not even all of the western europe countries are comparable , take portugal , spain or italy for example . 
  actually not even western and easterrn germany are . 
  just fyi it 's just your opinion . 
  my opinion is that 's a good move and should be welcomed also by the euro onanists unless they really thinks that eu is better without uk and some other eeeevil member states . 
  you do n't get it , it 's not just about one or the other person , but about the state , goverment . 
  you also admit that present russia , not just becouse of people in charge , is a sucessor of that state , its politics and identity . 
  it serves their nationalism as it used to do , repeats the same propaganda and excuses for each and every criminal policy . 
  excuse me , but eastern germany is still anything but success , the division is still vivid in population , economy or methality and billions of investments does n't cxhange it . 
  your cpomparation is false at least because french and english were real identities which were promoted just like the new identity of russians , in fact created by moscow and spreaded , often in brutal ways , in novgotod and other conquared areas . 
  the conflict of nagorno karabach is actually settled now which ca n't be unfortunatelly said about georgia or absolutelly artificial etchnic conflict in ukraine which is more an effect of current policies of moscow than something which existed before . 
  the reality is that russia deserves alot of criticism , but is unable to face it and review its old communist mythology . 
  i supose there 's no need to do it since that helps the goverment . 
  yes , i agree that could be just to make administrating this `` empire '' a much easier task , but the result was the same . 
  it 's true that by cleansing , expulsions and colonisation they were able to ease some etchnic conflicts , but they created some more of that and we can just watch the consequences of this policy in post soviet areas where still are many conflicts , often promoted by russia . 
  that 's your opinion , i ca n't say what was the real opinion of separate republics about their `` union '' before the referendums . 
  creation of a common , artificial identity is utopic and unrealistic task without already existing nationality so russyficiation seemed like an easier way . 
  if they 'd really want a buffer , they should refuse `` non agresion '' pact and alliance with germans since they 'd not risk a war on two fronts . 
  this treaty not only destroyed poland , but also pushed romania and finnland into the german sphere of influence . 
  beliving in german and soviet war propaganda is foolishnes . 
  both , except that treaty of versaillese was n't dealing with the eastern border of poland , but they 've had a common ground with germans since both considered themselves as `` victims '' of wwi . 
  which `` nationalists '' ? 
  soviets spreaded the russian language , moved borders and millions of people in line with some ancient mythology and also promoted this idea of `` united '' ru\u015b , panslavism or such . 
  and they were far more effective than the german tzar . 
  really it does n't matter what was their reason and who got this idea , what really matters are their murderous etchnic policies . 
  it was , amongst several other etchnic policies , but stalin was neither georgian , nor russian , he was just a communist . 
  i know and it was just becouse they lost elections to srs of kerensky . 
  the ocotober revolution was merely a lenin 's coup . 
  unfortunatelly it all happend and it 's too late to change it . 
  what we can do is to learn from that harsh lesson to not repeat the same mistakes , but unfortunatelly todays russia repeats many of them together with the same propaganda . 
  no , there 's a difference when you take a phone book and search for people with some `` wrong '' names becouse every one of them is suspected `` traitor '' . 
  that was a classic etchnic cleansing , no matter their excuses . 
  yea i know , most of these `` counterrevolutionaries '' were in fact srs or mensheviks . 
  i 've said it already in another comment , internationalists have no nationality . 
  the polish socialists were also divided , the internationalist faction tried to take over the power with the red army in 1919 , you know how it ended up . 
  sure , all of the killed and enslaved people were the `` enemies '' ... 
   communists did n't give two shits about whether you were ... really ? 
  why then they ordered to kill every polish person ( or suspected ) in 1937 and why did they expelled about 1.7 m of them from eastern poland , after they took it over with hitler ? 
  i know i 'm being selfish , but this is just a one example of their etchnic policies , so yes ... they did cared about nationality . 
  in case of collectivisation and the other femines , it 's disputed . 
  at the cost of tens of millions victims and slave labour . 
  yeah , the piles of corpses were the best evidence of this `` success '' . 
  read about collectivisation , kolhoz , `` kulaks '' and so on ... 
  i do n't really care if communists were plain massmurderers or idiots , i 'd say they were both . 
  the effect was horrible , whatever the reason or excuses . 
  the soviets blamed the farmers . 
  no , not at all . 
  there was a civil war in russia for a reason . 
  it 's just now when they mix the nationalism with old soviet propaganda and simbolism . 
  sure , `` share '' with kolhoz means `` give or die '' . 
  mismanagement was the whole idea of that state . 
  internationalists have no nationality . 
  stalin , as every communist was homeless . 
  yes there are , it 's just doubtful if it had etchnic background directed exactly against a one nation . 
   human errors nicely said . 
  this is what happends when you enforce insane ideology despite every reason and when it fails ... you push even harder and blame the people , farmers in this case .

* very quick-and-dirty translation . 
  it actually mostly highlights stuff from paper-version newspaper , but a pretty reputable one . 
  * ** syrians escaping poland . 
  of 160 people that came to poland , only 35 are left . 
  ** of 160 syrian people that came to poland , only 35 are left . 
  they did n't wait to get the refugee status . 
  they left without informing the government . 
  the estera foundation , led by miram shaded , is trying to get another group to come nevertheless - newspaper \u201e rzeczpospolita '' informs . 
  as the article states , in the end of december 2015 there was a meeting between miriam shaded , the estera foundation leader , and foreign ministry officials . 
  ministry asked by \u201e rzeczpospolita '' about the reason for the meeting answered , that ministry listened to the propositions of supporting ester foundation by the government . 
  ministry did not reveal any details about the talks with miriam shaded , but newspaper suggests that government is sceptical about further supporting her actions . 
  miriam shaded was suggested to contact institutions responsible for foreigners integration process - home affairs ministry and foreigners office . 
  miriam shaded describes her success in getting in getting 160 christians from war-torn syria to poland on her web page . 
  but this success is - according to article - somewhat dubious , because most of the foreigners who came to poland decided to leave the country . 
  from 160 only 35 are left in poland - article states . 
  this seems more like economic migration than forced one , since most people who came to poland left the country . 
  i 'd say that there were some problems with selection of people -- phd pawe\u0142 d\u0105browski , leader of the refugees council with the prime minister , told the newspaper . 
  as the newspapers adds , most of the people did not inform the foreigners office about their leave , they also did not pick up the decisions about being granted the refugee status . 
  nah , we will take them with open arms ... ... after all , they are just going to go back to germany for their social payments on their own . 
  it was a different situation , because with the russian sanction thing , they were open about that stuff . 
  with migration , po was first ` yeah , yeah , we 're totally with you on this one ' and then suddenly ` ok , f *** you , merkel said we have to take them so we take them and forget what we were telling you earlier ' . 
  well ... ok . 
  i 'm not the one to tell you how to run your country ( / choose who to run your country for you , as it happens in modern democracy ) . 
  i have n't been to greece yet ( i hope to visit some time ! ), 
  and i do n't know how it really is there , but the article from the op seems to suggest you are not in a very good position now ; and it really does n't seem that it will get better any time soon ( i.e. 
  in the next ten years ) if you do n't do something drastic . 
  as stated , this is your decision , and you are in much better position to take it than i am ( obviously ) . 
  i just wanted to point out that you are ( imo ) vastly overstating the risks of just ignoring the current debt , and perhaps understating the risks of current situation . 
  i find it is always a good idea to be confronted with another point of view . 
  that being said , i take no offence in your opinion of me being severely misinformed , of course . 
   i really hope greece will dig itself out of the hole it currently is in , and i wish your country ( and you personally ! ), 
  all the best . 
  yeah , because raking up debt in the * last * two decades worked just wonderfully for them . 
  first of all , do you realize that greece was in defaulted state for about 50 % of it 's modern existence ? 
  and defaulted at least five times since gaining independence ? 
  * and * there are countries that it a lot more , including european ones ( spain , mostly ) ? 
  second , do you realize just how much money you are trying to repay every year ? 
  i do n't really have time to dwell on the issue , but in poland , with 60 % debt/gdp ration , our interest is actually second biggest position in the budget . 
  with 160 % debt-to-gdp in greece , and after including actual repayments , i would guess it 's a lot more . 
  i have to admit that merchant navy is a major factor to consider here , i was n't really aware just how big it is . 
  but i do n't believe you would get a hit in tourism . 
  if anything , leaving euro and dramatically lower value of new drachma would keep people coming from aboard . 
  if you are trying to suggest that sanctions will stop that ... yeah , right . 
  just like they led to total collapse of russian economy and major civil war there . 
  importing oil would n't be all that difficult , if you had money to pay for it . 
  and you would . 
  what with all that money you are not spending on repaying debt now and oil hitting historically low prices , and foreign tourists bringing hard currencies when visiting . 
  not to mention the fact that you do , in fact , could actually do something useful with those 25 % unemployed people and make some actual product to sell aboard for more oil . 
  you do realize that the link is about the ship that was * released after a court sentence * ? 
  as for the long term consequences ... 
  your debt is totally unrepayable - there is literally no chance of paying it back , and after seven years it seems obvious that there is no will in creditors let greece off the hook . 
  you will be paying those debts for the foreseeable future and nothing good will come out of this . 
  well , at least not for you . 
  you can always unilaterally refuse to pay . 
  it 's rather unlikely anybody will borrow you any more money for quite some time ( as in , several years ) , but it is also equally unlikely that anybody will gather an army to invade greece and seize it 's assets ( since there 's pretty much nothing left to be seized outside of greece that belongs to it ) . 
  it 's been done , and it 's been done many times already , and looking at your current situation , it would be really good idea for you . 
  i will try to sum up ( polish ) parties quickly , but it is absolutely necessary to separate economics and social politics here ; the keyword ` left ' is generally associated with high-tax , social-oriented economy with major state interactions * and * with accepting/promoting things like legalization of soft drugs , abortion , state-church separation and in case of europe , euro-enthusiasm etc. , while the ` right ' is generally associated with free-market , capitalist economy with limited social benefits and state regulations * and * rejecting/limiting stuff that left is accepting/promoting . 
  but to answer your question first : we are usually calling ` left ' the parties that are ` left ' in the social politics sense , without caring about economy ; and those parties just do n't seem to offer people what they want . 
  their communication is pretty clear , i 'd say , but portion of the population willing to listen is just too small ; everybody seems to be center or right on those issues . 
  and economic left is ... well , current ruling party is social in it 's economic views . 
  last ruling part is center-left as far as the economy goes , so that 's pretty much covered . 
  now , to the parties , it might allow you to understand better why asking about our ` left ' is a hard question to answer . 
   so , our current ruling party pis ( law and justice ) is center-to-left in economy ( with social programs , new taxes on banks/shops and earlier notions of protecting state-owned companies ) and right in social politics ( with rather hard stance on drugs and abortion and euro-skeptic leaning ) . 
  major opposition party , po ( civic platform , is it ? ), 
  is center-to-left in economy ( with increasing taxes , moving pensions from partly-market back to state-controlled , but ignoring social spending ) and center-to-left in social politics ( with stress on ` opportunist ' - there was some talk over last eight years , when they were in power , about various stuff here , but it was mostly just talk ; they are pretty strong euro-enthusiastic , though , with plans for euro ( currency ) adoption etc. ) . 
  other opposition party , . nowoczesna ( . modern , i guess ? ), 
  is rather hard to define ; they have been created right before the elections , they have n't really done anything so far , so i will have to base this on their declarations ( they do n't even have any sort of statement , afaik , at least not written/published ) : right economically ( reduction and simplification of taxes and simplification of pensions ) and ... left , i guess , as far as the sociopolitics go ( state-church separation , they are against stopping the in vitro program ) . 
  * please note , they have been created literally half a year ago , so that has been no chance of checking any of that . 
  * yet another opposition party , kukiz '15 ( it 's from the leaders ' last name , so it is impossible to translate ) is rather eclectic collection of people ( it 's not even really a party , but that 's beside the point ) , with mostly right leanings in economy , as far as i gathered ( * this might be inaccurate !, 
  * ) and right in social politics , but mostly they are grouped together by the idea that current political system is broken and in desperate need of repair . 
  last party that holds seats in parliament , psl ( i 'm not even attempting translation ; basically , farmer 's party ) is ... well , i do n't honestly know . 
  their only reason to exists seems to be putting people in various state-controlled positions that pay good money . 
  for the last eight years , they formed coalition with po , and i ca n't really remember single instance in which they actually had any position on anything apart from ritual slaughter of animals . 
  as far as the non-parliamentary parties ( as in parties that do not hold seats ) , we have : sld : this is post-communist party created from the the old commie party which ruled poland after ww ii . 
  they are left in economy ( high taxes , high social spending , state-controlled industry , stuff like that ) , and left on the social policies ( pro-abortion , pro-state/church separation , etc. ) . 
  keep in mind that most major figures in the party are on par with bank ceo 's as far as their money is considered , so this might hurt their credibility as far as defending the poor goes ( * this has mostly anecdotal evidence , but this is the important kind of evidence in politics , so i decided to include it * ) . 
  they were very close to getting seats , but some coalition shenanigans stopped them from passing minimum required amount of votes . 
  razem ( together ) : this is neo-communist party , pretty fresh , created last year ( or at least that 's when people started hearing about it ) . 
  they are left-far left on both accounts as far as i know , proposing greatly increasing taxes , social spending , etc. 
  as well as standard fare left social policies , with all that in vitro , abortion , state atheism , stuff like that ( they seem to be pretty radical ; never really invested much into getting those to know better , as i do n't consider them for my vote ) . 
  they were also pretty close to getting seats ; it seems that rivalry between those two parties made both lose . 
  and our last major party is korwin ( again , the lead guys last name , even though officially it is some kind of abbreviation ) , which is right-far right as far as the economy goes ( low taxes , no social spending , no state control in industry etc. ), 
  and as far as the social part , it 's a mix of what you 'd consider left ( like pro-drug depenalization ) and right ( against gay adoption ) . 
  it does n't seem that they are going to get any seats , though ; they were very close this time , but the leader is rather old and i do n't predict any chances for them to gain major traction anymore . 
  we do n't hate china . 
  we love china . 
  aliexpress , to be exact , but still that 's china !, 
  it 's seventy years since the last attempt to create a single army in europe by germany failed . 
  germans !, 
  are you sure you want to try again ? 
  as far as i know , yes . 
  there is actually a special holy mass on midnight between 24th and 25th , called ` pasterka ' , as in ` shepherd 's mass ' , since shepherd were the first to hear about jesus being born . 
  in general , christmas eve dinner ( which is main meal during christmas in poland ) is meat-less , but as per catholic/christian tradition , fish is not considered meat ( long story ) , hence fish on christmas eve dinner . 
  before ww ii there were many fish , during commie regime carp become widespread as a cheap replacement for stuff like salmon , and it lives on as a tradition . 
  is n't it nicer when we try to talk like rational adults ? 
  would n't it be cool if you could keep it for the entire post , instead of going full strawman in the last two paragraphs ? 
  but well , you could n't . 
  so i 'm not going to continue this thread and talk with a person trying to suggest that i 'm antisemitic conspiracy theorist . 
  that was not _ my _ question ; i 've chimed in later . 
  you got the information ( again , not from me ... ) that suggest who could be doing it .

a lot actually . 
  the act mentioned above should provide enough information . 
  they are not a registered minority . 
  correct them/help them patiently . 
  and with time people will remember/get used to foreign letters . 
  there is also a standardised transcription for foreign alphabets so i see no problem with using double spelling . 
  also in towns with big concentration of minorities there is a big chance that people are already used to it . 
  i agree it can create problems in certain cases but your name is part of your identity and you should be allowed to keep it as it should be . 
  as long as you do n't trip again everything will be fine . 
  i will also keep my shoes tied and watch my step . 
  and it sure did n't help . 
  after ww ii we were n't exactly a nationalistic superpower . 
  wiki : `` to prevent creation or recreation of historical alliances that could weaken the soviet regime , soviet policy was aimed at minimizing the role of the historical ties between those nations , and there were few contacts of any significance between poland and lithuania during that period '' maybe if soviets would let us start resolving our differences earlier things would be better between us . 
  but also possibly worse - who knows ? 
  incidentally it is kind of derived from `` sh '' shell . 
  well , at least you said you 're sorry . 
  i accept it as a sign of good will . 
  i think we and lithuania should look at what can bring us together ( even if it 's a common gas pipe ) and what we both can gain from making new friends . 
  instead we are still arguing and bickering . 
  maybe we are just not mature enough . 
   russia did a `` great '' thing making us argue . 
  `` great '' things are again becoming russia 's specialty . 
  another reason we should work together . 
  we are talking about registered minorities here . 
  and as i stated in other comments it is allowed in poland . 
  let 's just say i do n't always agree with our new president . 
  yeah , i am not proud of that to say the least . 
  but that is history and while we should n't forget it we also should n't base our relations on it . 
  yet it seems some people still do . 
  yeah , he was born in zalavas ( zu\u0142\u00f3w ) . 
  while i see your point here i would like to mention that majority of polish minority ( heh ) live there since we were basically one country . 
  well , this sucks . 
  if our law says it 's allowed i gues it was bureaucrats ' laziness and/or lack of knowledge . 
  things like this should not happen . 
  if we want to improve our relations we should set better examples . 
  edit : oh , and thanks for the article . 
  it shows the problems are on both sides ( for poles in lithuania and for lithuanians in poland ) . 
  i also see no problem with writing my name without polish diactrics but it is nice to be allowed to use them . 
  makes you feel more at home . 
  i looked that up and you are right . 
  sorry for spreading misinformation and thanks for correction . 
   in addition to that , current `` poles '' minority , which is mostly ethnic belarusians , russians , and poles mixed together , keeps electing party that is very pro-russian . 
  i 've read about that . 
  i wonder if that 's because they feel ignored by other parties . 
  i know problems are on both sides and it 's a real shame we ca n't solve them and we play the blame game instead . 
  too bad we ca n't just start over :(, 
  i 'm glad you asked that because i did n't clarify that the act on national and ethnic minorities and regional language is about registered minorities . 
  and although jews are recognized minority i doubt hebrew alphabet can be used on documents . 
  it 's probably latin-based only . 
  edit : typo, 
  here : http://www.iz.poznan.pl/pz/pz/45_05_godlewska.pdf `` their status improved significantly in 2005 when the act on national and ethnic minorities and regional language came into force . 
  the introduction of language rights related to the use of auxiliary languages in public administration and bilingual topographic signs was a positive development . 
  the joint commission of the government and national and ethnic minorities was established and several major projects were implemented to combat discrimination , et cetera . 
  access to education and the media as well as the right to spell surnames and names consistently with their pronunciation in the native language do not provoke much controversy . '', 
  i actually think polish schools should be funded by poland . 
  as far as i know we pay for polish schools in ireland . 
  yes , it is possible . 
  every minority in poland can spell their name the way they want . 
  if i find some source on this in english i will post it . 
  so far i found some in polish only . 
  there are some unresolved issues with polish schools in lithuania . 
  also the `` w '' problem which maybe seems unimportant but i see no reason why a pole named witold should spell his name `` vitold '' just because lithuanian alphabet has no `` w '' . 
  i found an article from 2014 that outlines some of the problems : http://www.rubaltic.ru/articles/professor_o_dowski_in_vilnius_think_there_are_no_poles_in_lithuania13022014/, 
  i think that problem coud be gradually solved if both polish and lithuanian governmets were n't so stubborn . 
  we should talk , not argue about it . 
  with maps and whatnot : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gas_interconnection_poland%e2%80%93lithuania, 
   conservatives win elections in pl yeah , it appears they will . 
  and they like to blow silly things out of proportion . 
  damn . 
  sad , is n't it ? 
  still , the gas pipe gives me some hope . 
  commongas . 
   gimbal locked had to look it up . 
  til . 
  thanks . 
  this went slightly out of control , 
  i 360 degree agree with thee . 
  what if we present the whole angle thing as a pie chart ? 
  then 180 degree split would mean 50/50 and 360 degree would mean nothing in common . 
  i guess it 's open to interpretation . 
  and being vague is politicians ' thing after all . 
  i understood what he meant , what i wrote was just a remark about applying angle measurement unit to differentiate beliefs . 
  if he said it was 50 degree different i would need some sort of reference . 
  tl ; dr : i shot myself in the foot with a joke . 
  not sure what 180 degree difference would mean either . 
  they pray turning their backs on mecca ? 
  i 'm confused . 
  well , maybe we should start learning swedish . 
  ignorance has no age . 
  or gender . 
  or race . 
  and although poles are divided on the whole immigrant/refugee matter i would not think of these three criminals as representation of how we treat foreigners . 
  nevertheless - it is a shameful act :(, 
  i was in kosice in august last year so sadly i missed the exhibition . 
  anyway - here are some steam monsters from wolsztyn on a video i found : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uf6f4j_rpjg, 
  it \u00b4 s always nice to see this milestone in human development functioning somwhere . 
  we had one of the last ( if not the last ) steam engines in regular use that was hauling people from wolsztyn to poznan and back until 2014 . 
  awesome thing . 
  can confirm . 
  tr\u00f3jka is the way to go .

  it requires money from country budget to finance the loses . 
  yet we continue to support defaulting mines , and to make these people go down and slowly die , and to churn all this stuff into air , just to keep a few hundred tousand people working that particular job they already have . 
  because they do n't want to change , and happen to work for boss that is big enough to survive blackmail . 
  it 's absurd . 
  it 's like i came to you and said `` i 'll hit myself with hammer each day , and you pay me compensation for that '' . 
  surely i deserve compensation ? 
  it 's dangerous and unhealthy job to hit myself with a hammer . 
  in poland everybody started near 0 in 1989 . 
  so we still have small inequalities , and small income differences . 
  there was no time for the rich to get very rich . 
  unlike some other post-communist countries we also do n't have oligarchs . 
  amount of millioners per 1000 citizens : https://static.pb.pl/filtered/4e/127310,574065,w_420.jpg in poland the 5 richest poles hold wealth worth 2.6 % polish gdp . 
  in czech republic it 's 9.4 % their gdp , in ukraine 15 % , in russia - wealth worth 21 % of their gdp belongs to 5 richest people . 
  another example - how much times more ceos in each country earn than a regular employe : https://static.pb.pl/filtered/4f/127311,651667,w_420.jpg in poland ceos earn 28 times the salary of regular employee on average . 
  in `` socialist '' scandinavia - 48 to 89 more . 
  in usa - ceos earn on average 354 times more each month than regular employees . 
  i 'm not a free market fanboy , but i also do n't see a need for bigger redistribution right now in poland . 
  free market wo n't solve everything . 
  but trade unions in economy made of a few big state owned companies , and 1000s small private companies does n't make sense . 
  in practice only employees of the few state owned ones can strike . 
  it 's unfair and only hurts most workers . 
  independence movement pretending it 's trade union . 
  at least after first few months . 
  we have tons of old , expansive , indirectly-state-owned mines in silesia , and a few modern private ones , mostly in lubelskie . 
  the private ones ( bogdanka ) did ok , despite the coal price goind down recently . 
  the state owned ones struggled . 
  so miners from the state-owned mnines came to warsaw , made a show , dumb kopacz agreed to everything , including premiums ( state pays the mines for each kg of sold coal , so they can sell it cheaper ) - but only for the state owned mines . 
  now bogdanka is struggling to sell coal in poland because state-owned mines dump market with cheaper coal paid from our taxes : / that 's `` social justice '' for you . 
  bigger blackmail politicians to gain edge over the small . 
  i fucking hate trade unions , they fuck everything up . 
   who 's going to check if they wo n't cross the border into germany for example ? 
  they already can , if they want to break law . 
  tourist visa is easy and there 's hundreds of tousands ukrainians in poland . 
  i wonder if the have pipelines already . 
  `` piwo to moje paliwo '' ( beer is my fuel ) as they say , 
  `` unity before everything else '' is basicaly fascism , 
  people believe what 's convenient . 
   i can as much easily show you statistics that say that poland is economical and political crisis . 
  why are you sure yours are the right one ? 
  i do n't believe your statistics , you dont believe mine . 
  show them , then . 
   poland could have handled the recent rebirth much , much better than it did by their fruits you 'll recognize them . 
  show me a country that managed the transition better than poland . 
  there is also this canal http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dnieper%e2%80%93bug_canal it was economicaly important and ship traversable from black sea to baltic during commonwalth times , and there are some plans to revitalize it now . 
  its artifical parts are mostly in belarus , but to make it traversable from sea to sea again it would require a lot of work on the natural rivers in poland . 
   miracle of vistula was the term used by pilsudzki 's opposition to discredit his contribution to the win . 
  it was n't a miracle and it was n't `` barely '' . 
  his military genius and tactics was what won the battle of warsaw and stopped huge soviet invasion . 
  the invasion in itself was n't by any means his fault , it was imperialistic drive of soviet russia , to conquer and `` liberate '' all the nations and establish communist rule . 
  saying that he was `` barely saved by miracle of vistula '' is just so wrong in so many levels ... military genius of pi\u0142sudski in case of vistula miracle consisted of letting http://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/tadeusz_rozwadowski#rozkaz_operacyjny_specjalny_nr_10_000 to save him from consequences of his adventuring in kiev . 
   back in his time cavarly and infantry was the best possible military , given lack of good design and production capability of vehical unit already in late 20s poles used blitzkrieg-like tactics on small scale with armored vehicles . 
  we had many programmes to invest in modern weapons , airplanes etc in early 30s , but pi\u0142sudski believed in cavalry and only after his death the modernization started on big scale . 
  a few years too late . 
  read more : http://nowahistoria.interia.pl/ii-rzeczpospolita/news-wojne-blyskawiczna-wymyslili-polacy,nid,1061696  while pilsudzki lived , hitler would n't have attacked poland . 
  even he understood his military genius . 
  it 's only after his death that hostilities truly began . 
  more like he was admiring pi\u0142sudski for being `` a strong leader '' . 
  hitler was n't particulary rational person , i would n't read too much in his opinion of people . 
  hitler also admired mussolini , and we all know how useless that guy was . 
  imho pi\u0142sudski was best in international relations . 
  him outplaying germany , tzar russia , austria , and bolsheviks in 1918 was a work of genious - i agree . 
  but his military capabilities was n't that great tbh . 
  he only invaded smaller countries , and when he started a war with ussr - he lost a lot , to be saved by combined : genious of rozwadowski , destroyed communication in russian army , cracked codes of russians . 
  and then he sold belarus and ukraine to ussr . 
  also he refused to support white russians against bolsheviks . 
  made sense at the time , but to think that ussr could have been avoided , if not for pi\u0142sudski ...  real nowadays economic growth since communist ocupation till now is n't better than economic growth since liberation of 1918 to the end of pilsudzki 's rule . 
  please . 
  gdp per capita in : - 1922 - 1382 ( usd 2000 ) - 1939 - 2200 ( usd 2000 ) - 1989 - 6848 ( usd 2000 imf ) - 2015 - 26210 ( usd 2000 , imf estimate ) gdp growth was average 5.24 % in 1920 -- 29 and 0.34 % in 1929 -- 38 . 
  it was agrarian economy with some heavily nationalized industry , and huge militarization . 
  ca n't compare to modern poland . 
   poland right now is in economical and more importantly political crisis , while in 2nd republic poland has strong rule and economy was actually rising steadily . 
  last 20 years ae certainly not the best years in polish history if you really know what is going on in the country and not just listen to propaganda . 
  you do n't believe statistics , so i ca n't show you i 'm right . 
  i 'm just hoping you will realize some day , that it 's just you listening to negative propaganda , and we 're actually doing ok . 
  i mean - what 's easier to do - show that everything is good when it 's bad , or do the opposite ? 
  no amount of propaganda in late prl could persuade people everything is ok . no amount of propaganda could persuade people everyrthing is ok , if it was true what some `` independent '' press publish . 
  btw i 'm not supporting po there - they only rule for 8 years . 
  we 're doing ok since 1989 . 
  this is one of the key factors in the last 25 years of poland - consistent reforms despite changing governments . 
  yes some details are changed ( po did cash-grab from private insurance for example - a huge mistake ) , but overall direction is stable . 
  and without a dictator . 
  scotland and france had this http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/auld_alliance, 
   2nd commonwealth was a much better country than poland is now . 
  they did some questionable stuff , but much less than many other countries . 
  we need someone as pilsudzki right now to repair this country . 
  first it was n't commonwealth , it was republic . 
  commonwealth is translation of rzeczpospolita obojga narod\u00f3w , just rzeczpospolita ( 2nd , 3rd ) are translated as republic . 
  do n't ask me why . 
  pi\u0142sudski was smart and modern poland exists in part because of him . 
  and he was certainly a lot smarter than his oposition ( dmowski was just idiot , i never understood why we count him among such people as pi\u0142sudski and paderewski ) . 
  but pi\u0142sudski also did a regular military coup , kept political oposition in prison , fucked up with kiev expedition and was barely saved by miracle of vistula , was a supporter of old-style army ( cavalry , light infantry , a lot of cavalry manouvers ) vs modern mechanized army , which slowed some polish army modernization programmes by a few years . 
  but his worst disadventage was bad choice of helpers . 
  sanacja was awful , especially after pi\u0142sudski died . 
  they were incompetent , often just stupid , and basicaly threw poland and lives of 6 000 000 people into fire . 
  did you knew that `` kariera nikodema dyzmy '' was a book about sanacja government originally ? 
  written before their worst fuck-up ( ww2 ) . 
  `` jeez , we 're between fucking ussr and fucking 3rd reich - i know , let 's ally with people that are far away and did fuck all when we or others invaded each other few years ago '' . 
  we could did what scandinavian countries did , or hungary or romania . 
  ally with hitler . 
  or even ally with ussr .

i know . 
  it 's in the video title . 
  but i ca n't watch the video because i 'm currently in the ` wrong country ' . 
  `` this video is unavailable in your country '' i do n't know how to comment it . 
  what about ukrainians and belarusians ? 
  all three eastern slavic countries share rus heritage . 
   the need to counterbalance nato military power much more you assume that russia always * needs * to `` counterbalance nato '' . 
  but russia is n't yet north korea . 
  imagine that europe becomes independent of russian resources . 
  what can russia do ? 
  it ca n't go at war with the whole eu , because it 's a suicide . 
  it ca n't mess in neighbours ' affairs because it is to dependent on europe ( for at least a few decades ) . 
  so it can try to live on their own like north korea and face total economic collapse , try to establish some serious deals with china ( which will draw their attention from europe anyway ) , or it can take pro-western direction . 
  fyi : poland pays the highest price for gas in the whole eu . 
   north korea to sell to south korea brilliant idea . 
  kim will finally have an actual possibility to threaten south korea economically . 
   but not actually doing much they started the whole thing . 
  do you think they would have done so if europe were n't dependent on russia ? 
   it 's better to develop a different energy source that 's easy to say but harder to do . 
  we do n't have good conditions for renewable energy . 
  the first nuclear power plant is still being built . 
  another thing is that gas is usually used for heating , not energy production ( we have coal for that ) . 
  you ca n't change whole infrastructure overnight . 
   on a note of `` neighbors liking you '' how much did estonia , latvia , lithuania , poland , romania liked russia before ukrainian crisis ? 
  russia did not grabbed any land for 23 + years or so , so how did the relationship was going before ? 
  trying to treat russia as a partner when it was acting like , well , russia is one of the arguments used by conservatives against 2007-2014 government . 
  random embargoes , georgian war , messing with the smole\u0144sk plane crash , accusing poland of genocide , glorifying soviet union and hiding the truth about soviet crimes against poland did n't help . 
  all countries have crazy parties and stupid parties , but it seems ukraine will have a reasonable coalition in rada ( poroshenko , people 's front , and maybe samopomich or batkivshchyna ) . 
  one could assume that radicalism and populism would be higher in a country under foreign invasion . 
  in poland gathering similar amount of signatures ( in terms of % of population ) is enough to put a proposed law under vote in parliament . 
  i understand that eci only binds meps to hold a debate and commission to comment on the initiative , but does n't start a legislation process automatically . 
  and that 's basically the only way citizens can affect the legislation process after parliamentary elections , since meps do n't have a right of legislative initiative and reaching to your local european commissioner is difficult , to say at least . 
  in polish double negative is much more common ( and proper : / ) . 
  well , at least we say numbers normally . 
  so , basically , it 's just a petition ? 
  i mean , if you need to gather signatures of one million people , from at least 7 countries , for your parliament to hold a debate , then something is wrong . 
  i can assure you that no one starves in poland . 
  200 000 is the total number of poles who lived in volhynia prior to ww2 . 
  justification = / = reason btw . 
  not 100 000 . 
  100 000 poles were killed by soviet nkvd before in 1937-1938 . 
  volyhnia massacre is ca . 
  50 000 victims . 
  policy of strengthening `` polishness '' ( ? ), 
  was ~ ~ even ~ ~ worse but there 's not much info in english wikipedia . 
  imo the main reason was frustration . 
  ukrainians fall into the worst geopolitical location ever . 
  since 17th century until the fall of ussr there were n't any country that would support establishment of souvereign ukraine . 
  instead they received polonisation , russification and sometimes even ethnic cleansing . 
  edit : stylistic, 
   bandera what many people do n't realise though it was n't bandera who ordered the massacre , but a bunch of other guys from his fraction of upa . 
  since the beginning of the `` ukrainian conflict '' there 's a mass influx of pro-russians in polish web . 
  volhynia massacre is brought up in comments under virtually all news from ukraine even when there 's no connection between that event and the news . 
   the approach reasonable people taking nowadays is `` do n't ask , do n't tell '' , otherwise that conflict will be eternal . 
  i wish that someday presidents of poland , ukraine and other countries ( including russia , i 'm idealistic ) would gather and say ' i apologise for all that ethnic cleansing . 
  now let 's move to developing a future built on cooperation between our nations ' . 
  upa was an enemy of nazis since spring of 1943 - it 's a fact . 
  since then they were fighting with virtually all - poles , germans , soviets , and certainly did n't take order from them . 
   at the time the deal was concluded russia was n't as crazy and it would have been hard to expect the ukraine thing . 
  it was like a 2 years after georgian war . 
  1930s for example . 
   except he wo n't , he has no interests doing so . 
  there is no interest for anyone in most wara , including the current one . 
  over 3000 russians died already in eastern ukraine for minimal gain . 
   russia is n't an ennemy of france and we already pay enough for the former soviet bloc . 
  maybe you would n't have to pay so much if it were n't for your constant ' y is n't an enemy ' , ' x has no interests doing so ' or ` how the east benefits france ', 
  also po\u0142udnica - girl who died just before her wedding ; attacks people in field in the summer ; latawiec ( male ) / latawica ( female ) - flying demon , not too dangerous , after baptism of poland considered a devil having sex with people zmora/mara - demon torturing people when they 're asleep , usually by drinking one 's blood wampir/w \u0105pierz ( vampire ) - it 's qute known , is n't it ? 
  if you are in cracow , in the museum under the market there are corpses buried in anti-vampiric manner . 
   hugo simberg just came here to say the album lacks imo the best finnish ( and one of world 's best ) painter !, 
  ( the garden of death has been painted in 19th century ) . 
  if anyone 's interested here 's more of his art : [ album ] ( http://www.museumsyndicate.com/artist.php?artist=800 ) , [ the wounded angel ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/72/the_wounded_angel_-_hugo_simberg.jpg ), 
  yep , there are other solutions , but i was commenting on the lithuanian law proposal , not danish law , which seems to be an example of what is good children protection act . 
  however , some politicians overuse the argument of `` children protection '' to get more votes and try to pass often poorly written laws that can sometimes make more harm than good . 
  `` think about children !!! '', 
  child protection laws sound nice , clever etc. 
  but they also have to be constructed in a way that * wo n't harm * the children . 
  my mom is working in primary school and some of the stories about how `` child protection '' works are horrible . 
  a kid does n't show up in school for a few months , and if he does he 's beaten - that 's ok . a kid that gets a decent care from lone mother , always does his homework etc. 
  but his mother is an alcoholic and is found drunk once - police arrest his mother immediately and puts him in the orphanage . 
   a homophobic culture in western word does have some of its bases in judeo-christian beliefs even when one does not believe in god . 
  idk if you can call modern western world ` homophobic culture ' . 
  in fact it 's the most tolerant culture ever . 
  and judeo-christian beliefs may seem as a base for homophobia when you look at europe , but in global scale christian ( especially western christian ) societes are the * least * homophobic [ see : nice map linked in this thread ] ( http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/worldviews/files/2013/08/lgbt-tolerance-map2.jpg ),

   i know we are all in favour of same sex marriage here in / r/europe how so ? 
   assume that same sex marriage is legal in a country . 
  when christians want to get married there are 2 steps , one is for the state to recognise the marriage , the other is for a priest to recognise the marriage so that the couple are married `` under the eyes of god '' . 
  you do n't need a priest for a marriage to be recognised by god . 
  it 's just a tradition . 
  btw . 
  imo existence of a thing called ` state marriage ' is a nonsense . 
   if two gay christians want to get married then they get the state side done fine but may find a priest refusing to wed them . 
  i assume you mean catholic christians ? 
  some protestant churches allow for gay marriage already . 
   should the priest have the right to deny wedding them in god 's eyes ? 
  yes . 
  that is elementary freedom . 
  you should n't force people ( and gods ) to do what they believe is morally wrong . 
   i wonder if this comes under discrimination in countries with same sex marriage . 
  no , how could you call this discrimination ?

  much things you ignored , just to change the subject , but the worst thing is that you just tried to manipulate me and then called it a `` mistake '' . 
  enough of that . 
  since you refuses to answer my questions , manipulates and even insults me , we have nothing to talk about . 
  i do n't care about your personal life , which is probably as well a `` mistake '' , keep folling around if you wish , but not with me . 
  just look at [ their ] ( http://www.uszwejka.pl/ ) menu and promotions . 
  mind that 1 $ is about 4 z\u0142oty . 
  there 're also two other restaurants of this company in the old town , one at the market square , they 're all more or less in austro-hungarian style and they serve food from all the nations that inhibited it . 
  keep fooling around , but find yourselve someone else to play . 
  you know very well what i mean and if not , then i just overestimated your intelligence . 
  the real `` mistake '' here is to continue pointless monologues . 
  do svidania, 
  there 're few left , but sometimes i can see prof. selim chazbijewicz in tv , he 's a good guy and tries to explain how people like isis are wrong . 
  i think people do n't confuse tatars with some massmurders , or at least i hope so . 
  in statistics it is , but that 's all becouse gypsies are often confused with romanians . 
  some years ago we 've had a real invasion of beggars and they spoke romanian so ... 
  i 'm really sorry , personally i like romania and it deserves some better pr around here . 
  oh come on . 
  i just hate this kind of maps which shows the victors of some elections , but says nothing about the real support . 
  just becouse in some place a one guy gets 55 % , it does n't mean that 100 % agree . 
  that 's interesting . 
  the biggest minority in poland are actually vietnamesse , people confuse their food with chinesse , but there 're viet bars almost everywhere in warsaw . 
  i suppose they came also from germany . 
  you can get in every civilised country where lives some minority , for example in britain . 
  learning your own language is not a privillage , it 's a right and we provide it as well to each and every minority in poland , including lithuanian which is concentrated in just few districts . 
  are you saying that just the polish minority has a `` privillage '' of education in lithuania ? 
  ok , in here it 's not so much better in this matter , but is it the same related to demographics in lithuania ? 
  putin is not a `` historian '' , name a one which excuses german and soviet invasion by blaming poland for its actions against czechoslovakia and lithuania . 
  first time i 've heard such idiotic opinions it was in german war propaganda . 
   after france was beaten soviet cut aid bullcrap , the german-soviet commercial agreement was signed in february 1940 and it was broken when germans invided . 
   the last country to signed a deal with hitler i just love those typical excuses you 're all making to picture every `` deal '' as equal and everybody as an allie of hitler , except of yourselves of course . 
  the big bad `` west '' just forced you to invide and occupy others , not to mention the etchnic policies and slave labour ... no , neither czechs , nor the french were doing that , the only country that soviet russian could be compared to , was nazi germany . 
  except that when they 've invided poland soviets had already tens of millions victims on their account . 
  also i was n't talking just about the expulsion of germans , but about what you 've done in `` western belarus '' and especially `` western ukraine '' , but the same goes for `` eternally russian '' crimea , chechnya and such . 
   march 1940 you did not answer my question just like you silently ignored the mentioned case of soviet pows and how your `` politicians '' use it . 
  the truth is that soviets never declared war on poland , nor did it declared war on the soviets , there was no war , but somehow there was a `` war crime '' ... that sneak invasion was a `` war crime '' , if anything was . 
   the event that brought wwii start with the versailles treaty which ones ? 
  are you sure those are historians , becouse they sounds exactly like goebbels . 
  or is it that just an explanation for german and russian `` reasons '' for their wwi revisionism ? 
  if so then indeed i agree , you just could n't accept the collapse of your `` empires '' . 
  also it 's very funny to dismiss criticism of soviet policies by dismissing the sources , but unfortunatelly for soviet apologists there are documents , historians and witnesses , all of which was of course censored and banned under the soviet occupation . 
  the difference between us is that we 're not under it anymore . 
  what kind of privillages ? 
  when we speak teachers are protesting becouse lithuanian gov is closing schools ... 
  ah , so there was just a one `` stalinist crime '' ? 
  i guess the historians you 're talking about are those that supports your opinion , but there 're others as well . 
  if it 's just about that , why then the case of soviet pows is returning and your authorities even demands some monuments to commemorate it ? 
  the us did not train the german army when it was still pretending to respect versaillese treaty , but most of all they did not assist their army in invasions . 
  comparing those relations and value of these contracts is just another poor attemt at excusing russia . 
  you supported germans when usa supported britain with lend lease . 
  whatever treaties the baltic states signed with germans it did n't matter , the only reason for their existence was riga peace treaty and they got occupied becouse of molotov-ribbentropp treaty . 
   war crime so tell me , did the soviets declare war on poland ? 
  was there a war between these two states ? 
  and as for revisionism , that was the real reason behing wwii , since both germany and russia wanted a revision of the post wwi order . 
  this had to result in destruction of newly proclaimed or reestablished countries , but you both pushed that even further with etchnic cleanisng , deportations , slave labour and general terror . 
  same was here when this clown nergal destroyed the bible on a stage , we have a law against religious intolerance , but he was n't sentenced finally . 
  anyway i do n't know and do n't care if those musicians are really satanists , this is not a serious `` religion '' and nobody takes it seriously . 
  what the fuck is a `` stalinist crime '' ? 
  you 're just making the same old excuses . 
  i think i 've heard exactly that this arrogant putin said `` poland deserved it '' and i do n't care about any churchill . 
  the same excuses you 're making since ages , like the politics of poland towards czechoslovakia or lithuania could excuse the war and genocide conduced by germany and the soviets . 
  the fact is russia collaborated with germany in that invasion and provided them with materials to continue that war , nothing can excuse that . 
  ... the european court of human rights is not russia , your repressentatives there in their usual , arrogant and inslutive manner were accusing families of the victims of `` greed '' . 
  no idea how you won the case in there , but to call it a war crime is just ridiculous . 
  also you 've made up the story of bolshevik pows , as some sort of perversed excuse for katy\u0144 massacre , no matter that a joint commision of historians from both sides admitted that they died of diseases . 
  i 've had this discussion many times as well and there 's nothing new you can tell me about that . 
  all i can say is that your gov builds your national `` pride '' on lies , manipulations and accusations against the victims of your criminal policies . 
  it 's not nationalism anymore , that was xixc . 
  ... we have no russian minority , a bit of belarussians and they all have citizenships , they also have a right to use their original names in ids or documents and in areas that some minority is concentrated they can use their own language in administration . 
  as for baltic states and lithuania in particular , we have some issues since poles are the biggest minority there and lithuania is not making their lives easier . 
  btw . 
  in local elections every foreigner is allowed to vote , you do n't have to have a citizenship , just location ( so called `` meldunek '' ) . 
  we have also declarations of putin which excuse the invasion on poland , baltic states , romania and finnland . 
  nobody says a thing about deportation and enslavement of millions in sibiria , an etchnic cleansing ordered by nkvd in 1937 , not to mention the brutal occupation which followed the `` liberation '' . 
  as for katy\u0144 massacre , russia refuse to accept it as a crime against humanity , but rather calls it a `` war crime '' , no matter that there was n't a war then . 
  ok , but i 'd like to see the idiot who called it the `` ugliest '' capital of europe . 
   anthropologists are you sure ? 
  sure , but this is some showbiz , not a religion . 
  first of all , the question was what they 've done , not how . 
  i assure you i was a faithful beliver of tvn and gw , then . 
  seriously i belived that paranoia . 
  now i think that this `` witchhunt '' was directed against the shady , corrupted `` elites '' and i do n't care about their whineing anymore . 
  currently it 's happening the same or worse , jailing without senteces , invigilation , arresting people for crticising authorities etc. . . with this difference that now just the common people suffers while the `` elites '' stuffs their mouths with meals for 2.000 pln , from public money . 
  fuck it . 
  if you was born yesterday , that was the reform of secret services , creation of anti corruption institution , reduction of taxes , deficite and so on ... 
  happy now ? 
  why do n't you write in english ? 
  no idea what kind of facts you want , grandma . 
  wow , you 're so heroic , facing those terrible downvotes ... and fascism . 
  seriously , you 're just repeating the same bullshit that the ruling party makes up and you sounds like a fanatic . 
  both sides are heating up emotions of their voters with false accusatiuons and slogans , sometimes just insults and to the point in which a one guy murdered another ... you know what i mean ? 
  this is just the image and unfortunatelly people follow it , but when you compare the education of these politicians ... you may be suprised . 
  besides of that , both parties have some think-tanks , associacions of scientists , foundations etc. 
  behind them . 
  the same goes for this presidential elections , more educated people voted for a quite illaterate and not very bright , barely master of history , while most of the uneducated ones voted for a dude which has phd in administrative law . 
  the electorate of civic platform is build mostly on scare of the opposition , if there 're any liberals there , they need to be extremly `` tolerant '' considering the economic policies of the ruling party . 
  never heard a thing about satanists , neither negative , nor positive and the reason is ( i guess ) that they 're virtually non existing in here . 
  ok , but then i guess it 's not cz\u0119stochowa , maybe grabarka or some other orthodox place . 
  nevermind that . 
   used to be called by whom ? 
   frowned upon by the hardcore believers how ?

  it 's a good idea to be careful with taking them at face value . 
   recalling the 10,000 jewish children that the u.k. rescued from the nazi threat between 1938 and 1940 that is one multifunctional tool , the holocaust ... 
  yeah , that message would have been funny in relation to ttip , but it has nothing to do with net neutrality . 
  also something about too many train stations . 
  [ fritz haarmann ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fritz_haarmann ) , the vampire of hannover who together with an accomplice murdered at least 24 adolescents out of sexual motives by biting through their neck , then dismembering the corpses and ( rumored at least ) selling them as meat for human consumption . 
  the famous movie '' [ m ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/m_%281931_film%29 ) '' is inspired by him . 
  edit : oh , and outside my own home country ( i have sort of a morbid fascination for those cases ) i find the case of [ peter scully ] ( http://www.radioaustralia.net.au/international/2015-03-07/australian-man-gerard-peter-scully-formally-charged-with-murder-child-sexual-abuse-in-the-philippine/1422619 ) in australia the most `` interesting '' recently - allegedly trafficked children from the philippines , streamed the rape videos overseas and forced them to [ dig their own graves ] ( http://www.news.com.au/national/crime/alleged-paedophile-peter-gerrard-scully-made-his-young-victims-dig-their-own-graves/story-fns0kb1g-1227243686337 ) before murdering them . 
  sounds like one of the `` bad guys '' from dexter . 
  ( sources seem bad , but unfortunately , i have zero idea what good australian sources are . ), 
  not really , no . 
  i think that was their point . 
  what do you have for christmas ? 
  the christ child like us ? 
  ( not actually baby jesus , an angel like this : https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/christkind#/media/file:christkind_in_struwwelpeter_1845.jpg ), 
   more than half of those surveyed thought spitting could transmit it . 
  in fact , tb is usually spread by close and prolonged contact with someone who is coughing and sneezing . 
  i 'm really surprised it 's only half , especially with something uncommon as tb . 
  not exactly an unreasonable jump from coughing to spitting as a transmission method . 
  you said you `` deny '' such things are happening . 
  your claim is invalidated by one single anecdote . 
  edit : oh great , using `` brown people '' below ... never have i read one single post containing this that would n't have made the user a member in the ` little black book ' club . 
  what kind of barbarian would throw a pheasant into a _ soup _ ? 
  marry them , then divorce them . 
  i 'm afraid that your usual scheme of `` naked -  money '' may not be applicable in this case . 
  does anal count as `` non-traditional '' ? 
  russia might find itself in a bit of a pickle when defining the term . 
  people before were playing opposite day . 
  apparently , / u/rightard thinks that like other subs , they usually allow only acceptable , visual , all-inclusive pictures now . 
  that is kinda true , from my perception - it 's simply become a circlejerk with completely meaningless `` visualizations '' that might seems somewhat `` trendy '' at first glance . 
  just think back , how many `` infographics '' with `` minimalistic '' color schemes that displayed stereotypical stick figures under stylish numbers have you seen ? 
  none of those express more than two lines of text , but for some reason , some people call them `` beautiful data '' . 
  ( yeah , yeah , i know the current submissions do n't reflect it , but i _ tried _ to subscribe multiple times . ), 
  i absolutely _ loved _ the sub when it was smaller - i love visualizing data myself , however bad i might be at it - , but since then so many ignorant teenagers of a foreign culture have immigrated that it 's just not tolerable any more . 
  it 's simply yet another completely meaningless echo chamber now . 
  because it 's just a useless mantra that 's been repeated ad nauseam now - everybody has already heard it . 
  it 's noise , not signal . 
  would have as much to do with `` data '' and `` beautiful '' as half the things on that sub anyway ... 
  to point out that if not carefully designed , your system may be just as subject to dismissal as ours - he 'd obviously take that avenue . 
  i did n't say anything about him , i did n't say anything about norway , i did n't leave it at `` extending his sentence '' - please proof-read your `` corrections '' as often as i do with my comments now thanks to people like you . 
  or just refrain from making them at all , like i 'm beginning to do ... no desire to deal with nonsense like this . 
  i did n't claim either of those things you refuted . 
  that 's been ruled illegal by the human rights court before , unless provisions for extension were set up beforehand . 
  great , just what we needed - yet another civil contributor to this insightful debate . 
  not like we did n't have enough of them already . 
   it 's the topic of the article ; christian virginity checks . 
  it is not . 
  but your demeanor does n't exactly invite to talk to you , so let 's just leave it at that . 
  that 's a single example , not a statistic . 
  oh cute , it appears that austrian reductio ad hitlerum is even more crude than the german version . 
  oh good , tor needed some new relays . 
   yes , they put the burden on the state to solve this no , not just this - all of their chosen words evoke very distinct feelings in this context . 
  they claim that just rioting was the tiny shining light at the end of the tunnel of borderline inhumane suffering for those miserable people , but oh lo , oh woe , nobody cared . 
  that 's not journalism , that 's dreck . 
  ( and i 'm glad to see you adopted that word from us . 
  edit : whoops , not you - the brits . 
  not that you speak much else nowadays . ), 
  i 'm entirely in agreement that the banlieues ( what little i know of them , but any low-down district probably ) need creative approaches by well-meaning people and there need to be practical projects to change the cited `` culture of defeat '' . 
  i just absolutely ca n't stand this kind of `` reporting '' . 
  their wording shows that that is not at all what they meant _ to express _ - it may be is the reason for what they express , but not the essence of it . 
  just look at the rest of the article to put it into context , but that sentence alone would suffice . 
  the number is far from unreasonable if you include a prediction of reunifications ( it 's even ridiculously low ) , but at that point you 're making a prediction based upon a prediction which i 'm not comfortable with . 
  so i did n't factor that in . 
  edit : oh , in case you meant reunifications _ this year _ stemming from the current crisis - that 's unlikely to be a factor at all due to how lengthy the bureaucratic process is here . 
  opinion pieces are opinion pieces - lots of good papers run questionable ones because that 's basically the duty of independent journalism , but they tend to balance things out . 
  the lack of such opposing pieces is usually a problem , not the presence of the questionable ones . 
  oh , well , then you have nothing to worry about !, 
  i wish you godspeed !, 
  and even if you do n't get a reply , which is highly unlikely - they 've never even seen you , so it _ ca n't _ have anything to do with you personally . 
   how are they supposed to track isp network traffic without a court order ? 
  download a torrent you have the license to distribute , note ip addresses of peers . 
  those are evidence of breaking the law , enough for getting officials involved . 
  a child can do that . 
   largely based on a bluff afaik that 's a dangerous myth in germany . 
  my mother had someone abuse her wifi ( damn factory-set wep ... ) and i did some research for her , and many apparently trustworthy people in law ( including friends of mine ) say that it 's at least a gamble . 
  you may not have to pay the fine but you do risk that you 're taken to court as an example . 
  that goes for simply _ ignoring _ it - there are other avenues , such as sending them a modified acceptance of cease and desist , but from what i gather it 's not as clear-cut as it may appear to the layman , either . 
  law that 's as undefined as that of the internet is frustrating even to professionals , and obviously more so to others . 
  ( see how many people still include the `` hyperlink disclaimer '' in their websites , and i saw lengthy refusals with lots of laws and cases of those 15 years ago ... might not want to trust the common man on this . ), 
  then i can only advise you to make the call - or write a letter or go in person and ask to sit in if it 's easier for you . 
  you can either expect someone very friendly and understanding or a bored secretary setting the bureaucratic wheels in motion , but not something that would devalue you . 
  or if that might be easier , handling such cases is social workers ' bread and butter , so they would likely arrange everything for you if you do n't want to talk on the phone ( which is common with anxiety because you ca n't gauge nonverbal communication ) . 
  would n't your people be in general favour of just about anything that changes the political system ? 
  yours has struck me as the most , uh , funny one in europe for quite a while . 
  in other countries you at least know what you have - cleptocracy , democratorship , cronyism - , but i could n't think of a more descriptive word than `` interesting '' from what i see of italian politics . 
   it is 10 years since france 's urban riots of 2005 promised to be the wake-up call that would force an end to the inequalities of ghetto high-rises in the suburban banlieues . 
  sentences like this are why i ca n't take the guardian seriously . 
  if that 's what suits you , it would a good idea as well - you can usually just sit back for as long as you want and not say anything ; there are usually also signals to tell people you want to be ignored entirely ( such as moving you chain [ ed . 
  chair !, 
  nobody gets chained ] back ) . 
  just make sure it 's overseen by someone who 's qualified - without guidance , such groups quickly turn into commiseration circles , imho . 
  plus , there 's nothing negative you 'd have to expect from a professionally guided group - remember , by virtue of their education alone there 's probably nothing about a human that would shock a therapist , and they 'll be quick to cut off people who might unreasonably project their own problems onto you . 
  the only exception i 've seen was fresh from university and probably more scared than her first-time patients . 
  i know those fears - they 're unfounded , but something that will stay with you even during therapy because they are likely an essential part of your problem . 
  do n't let them discourage you , make the first step . 
  if it helps , you may want to abstract your problems as a separate entity within you so you you have something concrete to fight , and the therapist as a mere function instead of a person with feelings . 
  that can help silence many fears at least long enough to make the call . 
  they do n't help much because there probably are no stimuli which they can support . 
  like most other drugs , they make feelings more audible , they just have a strong tendency to support one particular kind of feeling . 
  those stimuli are something someone with a lesser problem might get from slight changes in their lifestyle etc. , but if you 're disabled due to that this wo n't be enough . 
  that 's what a therapist is for - depending on the method , to show you a new outlook on some things or to help you find them yourself .

  if you are interested in this topic i would recommend you the book of roger crowley `` empires of the sea : the final battle for the mediterranean , 1521-1580 '' . 
  he writes about the siege of rhodos and malta and also about the battle of lepanto so it 's very read worthy to read . 
  `` constantinople : the last great siege , 1453 '' by roger crowley is an awesome book about this topic . 
  i really recommend it . 
  rio de janeiro -- the last hope for cameroon to win a 2016 olympic medal arrived in the wrestling arena on thursday night in the stern and determined form of annabel laure ali , a 31-year-old who would vie for a bronze in the women 's freestyle competition . 
  gladiatorial rock music blasted from loudspeakers as ali walked to the mat a few feet behind her opponent , ekaterina bukina of russia . 
  it had been a tough olympics for this central african nation of 22 million . 
  the news media in cameroon belittled the performance as `` operation zero medals . '' by thursday , at 5 p.m. , only ali could save the country from an olympic shutout . 
  `` i win , i lose , '' she had said in an interview about pressure a few hours earlier . 
  `` i do n't want to regret after . '' for all their egalitarian aspirations , embodied by the parade in the opening ceremony , the olympics are a highly lopsided affair . 
  through saturday afternoon , the five most victorious countries had claimed nearly 40 percent of all the medals , and the top 10 owned about 55 percent . 
  most countries -- more than 120 as of friday -- go home with nothing . 
  for them , the games are not so much about tallying up glories as staving off embarrassment . 
  and for this sizable contingent , there is a huge difference between zero medals and one . 
  consider what happened last week with austria . 
  it is a winter sports powerhouse , but when the rio games began , it was in the midst of a summer games medal drought . 
  the problem started at the 2012 london olympics , when the country failed to take home so much as a bronze . 
  the minister of sport at the time , norbert darabos , went to england during this debacle and denounced his country 's athletes as `` olympic tourists . '' he promised a new law that would focus funding on the most promising sports . 
  `` we have to change the structures in time so that we can win medals in rio in 2016 , '' he fumed in a 2012 interview , `` or else we will again be on the same level as luxembourg . 
  they wo n't win anything in london , either . '' the upshot was `` projekt rio , '' a program funded with 20 million euros ( about $ 22.5 million ) . 
  it quickly looked like a waste of money . 
  on the first full day of competition , a well-regarded judo fighter lost in just 27 seconds . 
  the beach volleyball team was knocked out by the cubans . 
  there were injuries and weak performances . 
  a sailing duo in the 49er class that seemed poised for greatness failed to make the medal race . 
  headlines at home were hostile . 
  `` olympic debacle !, 
  we live in the stone age , '' wrote kronen zeitung . 
  \u00d6sterreich went with `` europe laughs at our olympic tourists , '' and got personal and pithy with this one : `` you are embarrassing ! '' when day 13 rolled around , all of austria 's remaining chances resided with three sailing teams . 
  two of them came up short . 
  the last of the races that day was the final in the mixed nacra 17 , a catamaran operated by a man and woman . 
  ( hence `` mixed . '' ) tanja frank and thomas zajac , the very blond austrian nacra 17 team , were hardly considered one of the country 's more promising medal threats at the start of the games . 
  `` we were really not in the small circle of favorites , '' zajac said thursday night . 
  he was sitting on a sofa on the roof of austria house , an event dining room for invited guests as well as party headquarters for brazilians who want to stop by and dance outside to a disc jockey . 
  `` there were three or four favorites and then five or six that were in the hunt . 
  we were one of those five or six . '' they belonged in the circle of favorites , it turned out . 
  sailing has a complex system of scoring that factors in previous performances , but as soon as the pair crossed the finish line , they knew they had won bronze . 
  so they did something that seems hard to imagine : they jumped into the water . 
  `` you win a medal , and you do n't really care about the water , '' said zajac , 30 , his nose sunburned . 
  `` you feel like you 've survived everything . '' the news media in austria announced that the national summer medal drought had ended after exactly 2,923 days . 
  christian kern , the country 's chancellor , posted an exultant note on facebook . 
  the pair received hundreds of emails , texts and messages . 
  frank , who until wednesday had only been asked about her i.q. , which has been reported to exceed 155 , was finally asked about something else . 
  `` the next day , '' she said , `` we were on the cover of every newspaper in austria . '' life for the national olympic committee 's spokesman , wolfgang eichler , has since improved , too . 
  the notion of leaving rio empty-handed , of another four years of drought counting , was hard to contemplate . 
  a single bronze does not exactly represent a turnaround . 
  `` but now it 's easier to do my work , '' eichler said . 
  `` it 's not as though now is all good , but at least we 're celebrating a medal . '' at the olympic wrestling venue , ali was trying do for cameroon what frank and zajac had done for austria . 
  the match was the only close one of the night . 
  at 4 minutes 17 seconds , ali grabbed one of bukina 's legs and forced her to hop backward and out of the ring , tying the score at 3-3 . 
  the seconds ticked down . 
  ali lunged again for bukina 's legs , missing this time , then dropped to one knee and lunged again . 
  but bukina twisted just enough to deflect ali , who wound up on both knees . 
  when bukina swung around and grabbed her by the waist , she won 2 points . 
  it happened at 5:58 . 
  two seconds later , the match was over . 
  ali and cameroon were out of the olympics . 
  it happened so fast that even bukina seemed stunned . 
  ali passed through the interview zone without speaking , looking exhausted and inconsolable . 
  but on her way out of the arena , she stopped to speak to a french reporter . 
  `` i could taste the bronze , '' she told him . 
  `` she is to be celebrated , of course , '' said her coach , dieudonn\u00e9 ebouele motto . 
  `` because in all our delegation , she is the only one to have done something like this . '' motto was speaking in french , through a volunteer interpreter named davide adams , who happened to be from cameroon . 
  she has a radiant smile , but even as it flashed , over and over , she said she wanted to cry . 
  `` so close , '' she said , writhing a little . 
  `` did you see how close it was ? 
  it was like she was going to win and then suddenly , she did n't . 
  i ca n't believe it . 
  oh my god . 
  i ca n't believe it . '' the cosmic unfairness of the games then started to bother her . 
  `` the u.s. gets all the medals , '' she said , finding the seam between outrage and amusement . 
  `` what 's wrong with you ? 
  why do n't you share ? '', 
  if anybody is interested here is a site that is quite good in explaining this complex topic . 
  `` at the first ever joint polish-ukrainian conference in podkowa le\u015bna organized on june 7 -- 9 , 1994 by karta centre and subsequent polish-ukrainian historian meetings , with almost 50 polish and ukrainian participants , an estimate of 50,000 polish deaths in volhynia was settled '' . 
  if it comes to ukrainian casualties `` ukrainian deaths also include those which occurred during the forced resettlement of poland 's post-war ukrainian minority by the communist authorities in operation vistula . '' . 
  i do n't think this can be also said to be fault of the polish government before the war and the government in london . 
  about 60 000 poles killed by ukrainians and about 5000 ukrainians killed by poles as revenge acts . 
  the story of how theresa may , the united kingdom 's home secretary , became the presumptive prime minister is one of tragi-farcical , politico-comic self-destruction . 
  it has played out with slapstick speed since the morning after the nation voted to leave the european union , two and a half weeks ago , and the conservative prime minister , david cameron , who had campaigned against brexit , said that he would resign rather than preside over it . 
  at the time , cameron figured that he 'd stick around until november , and there was an assumption in many quarters that he 'd be succeeded by boris johnson , an m.p. 
  and the former mayor of london , who likes to preen about how disorderly he is . 
  but on monday , standing in front of 10 downing street , cameron said that britain would `` have a new prime minister in that building behind me by wednesday evening , '' and that it would be may , who had his support . 
  she might have been on the job even sooner than that , except that , this being britain , taking power still involves a visit to the palace , and the queen is out of town . 
  brexit has not brought out the best in british political culture , and one can say that even as an american in the age of donald trump . 
  the largest issues have been the careless smashing of alliances , the lies to and the scorn for voters ( by both sides , if more by leave ) that enabled the brexit victory , and the realization by non-british e.u.

   of course it 's a nice place for holidays . 
  i love visiting other ee countries . 
  they 're awesome , interesting , full of history , cheap and safe .

  tougher then the same option in we .

  asz dziennik can be hilarious , thanks . 
  to be honest , i 've seen this protest all over my social media ( fb , instagram ) and we even discuss it here on reddit , so yeah , i think they did a good job at raising awareness about the issue . 
  there are people who earn very well of course , but yeah , average joe is earning peanuts compared to our western neighbours . 
  from my own experience : last summer i worked at the reception desk in a big international company - 500 euro after tax , 2 years ago as a barista 500 euro before tax . 
  pis won in the all age groups in poland during last elections . 
  why not ? 
  poland is more right wing now , when the world `` socialist '' is almost a slur , but during interwar peroid socialist ideas were stronger than now . 
  not all of eastern europeans are slavs . 
  calling romanians slavs upset them more than calling czechs eastern europeans , 
  i think we were always quite nationalistic but it 's quite understandable when your national identity is threatened most of the time . 
  still , one of the most important parties in polish politics history was pps - left wing af . 
  how were we always a right wing country ? 
  do n't tell things like this to romanians , 
  i find not serving someone because he 's spanish/polish/muslim or whatever completely absurd . 
  it 's just too broad category . 
  i would never do that as a restaurant owner .

  your english is fine , i got it  but in theory , what about gay men ? 
  how they can avoid loosing their mind when other men are not covered ? 
  yes , i agree with you . 
  hijab is fine , no threat to security whatsoever but i just ca n't grasp a reasoning behind it though . 
  i do n't know how much this burqa ban is really about the security and how much about pandering to the changing social mood . 
  if you do n't mind me asking what job does a hijab do and why men are not required to wear one ? 
  it depends really . 
  i think we should totally embrace being in eastern europe , there 's nothing to be ashamed of . 
  and this east-central europe thing we 'd like to be associated with ... nah , feels like trying too hard . 
  ok , i will settle for mail order plumber country :3, 
  i really liked latvia , especially the beaches . 
  it was a nice change after overcrowded polish ones . 
  all the baltic countries deserve more attention because it 's absolutely charming and worth-visiting . 
  that 's what i thought too , but i encountered it in real life so maybe it 's more eastern european . 
  mail-order brides ? 
  it 's not widespread stereotype though ( ? ) .

  hah , almost the same for me : modernism  brutalism  neoclassicism  glass & steel . 
  we 're still lucky they decided rebuild warsaw as it is at all , there were some plans to relocate capital city to lodz after ww2 . 
  they put great amount of work into reconstruction anyway and it took some time , for example royal castle was finished in the 70s if i remember correctly . 
  yep , we do . 
  do people know this even in morocco ? 
  that 's impressive :d it 's crazy how many gated communities was built recently and frankly as an inhibitant of this `` quite poorly built ramshackle part of town '' i fail to see a real ( not psychological ) need for that . 
  its pretty safe everywhere duh . 
  well , i see canada , us or even new zealand - all multicultural , and maybe i 'm wrong , but i ca n't recall similar mass sexual assaults happening there . 
  what sweden did : opening its borders to huge amount of people they know nothing of ( they can be criminals or sexual offenders in their home countries ) , not checking if said minors are really minors etc. 
  does n't seem to be very sensible policy , but it does n't mean all men from me are rapists . 
  you 're disgusting . 
  you know that , right ? 
  edit : sorry , was too harsh , it 's been a long day and your comment is giving this `` they had it coming '' vibe . 
  and socialism , multiculturalism = / = accepting sexual violence, 
  yep , we 're here just for the money . 
  congratulations , you 've got us .

  and that 's not enough anyway . 
  the western world believes crimea is a part of ukraine while the truth is that crimea is here to stay with russia and no amount of wishful thinking can change that, 
  colonies of europe, 
  it feels so weird how so many people do n't agree with you there, 
  explain why france is n't a south american country . 
  so let 's start asap, 
  it was but it was n't a sovereign country, 
  4 % is still huge . 
  afterall 16 % was the largest percentage , in poland . 
  getting a parliament that actually represents people 's opinion would be a good thing regardless of some fringe parties getting in . 
  why is the eu fine with uk 's parliament supremacy ? 
  thanks to our voting treshold 15 % or 1 million votes went to the trash and one party got 51 % of the parliament seats with 38 % votes . 
  i wish we switched to sainte-lague with no voting treshold and to mandatory voting with ` none of above ' option on the ballot . 
  history has shown that the more direct the democracy , the better . 
  giving privilege to the biggest one or two parties does nothing good , it only widens the gap between the needs of the society and actual postulates that get proposed by politicians . 
   kwje\u0107y\u0144 holy shit why does this silesian orthography exist . 
  i mean i already think the polish one is bad enough , but there are regional dialects , like northern masovian where it 's pronounced exactly the same as in silesian but they still use polish orthography because they are smart enough to realize that orthography does n't have to be exactly phonetic . 
  some of the features of silesian only exist to separate connections between polish and silesian . 
   russia is simply too large that does n't matter . 
  after all center of europe is in czechia by all means . 
   then almost half of this map is east which does n't make much sense what ? 
  that does n't make any sense . 
  if something is in the middle then it 's not eastern . 
   you sound like one of those guys for whom being lithuanian means , in addition to other things , having as little to do with poland as possible . 
   that was pretty much the basis of lithuanian nationalism in 19th century . 
  unfortunate . 
   russia  it 's complicated pretty sure it 's as east as it can be . 
  and russia and macedonia, 
  clearly not in this case . 
  technicalities . 
  most irish people ca n't say anything in their language other than a greeting . 
  let 's be real . 
  english is the language of ireland . 
  i 'm not happy about it but that 's the truth . 
  the eu is already desperately fighting against it they 're not fighting against english , they 're fighting for other languages . 
  it should n't be mandatory to speak english in the eu . 
   the uk leaving could easily pave the way for formalising english as a european common language , as doing so would no longer represent the eu favouring one member state over another ireland ? 
  i 'm not . 
  he 's a disgrace to the european union . 
  he embodies what many people dislike about it, 
  politics are no place for banter . 
  god you sound so pretensious and snobbish . 
  `` broken version '' give me a break . 
  that 's my point . 
  just because a politician runs a campaign focused of bringing jobs back , does n't mean he will bring every single one . 
  it 's just a ridiculous thing to point out . 
  some jobs are just not worth taking back for anyone . 
  andpeople who make these kinds of articles like to circlejerk how this one thing is totally making those politicians dumb hypocrites . 
  if wwii did n't happen there would be no need for israel . 
  either that or it could be created regardless of the war .

  i bet not even the president knows, 
  exactly no details are known yet . 
   polish president andrzej duda has said that the nation should decide whether to introduce changes to the constitution , proposing a referendum next year . 
  `` poles have a right to say whether the constitution , which has been in force for 20 years , should be changed , '' duda said during events marking the 3 may constitution day celebrations in warsaw . 
  `` it 's time for a serious constitutional debate , not just with politicians but with the whole of the nation . '' duda added that poles themselves should be able to decide on the directions of the country 's development . 
  `` which civil rights , which freedoms must be more strongly highlighted , '' he said . 
  wednesday , a national holiday in poland , marked the anniversary of the signing of the polish constitution in 1791 , the first such document in europe . 
  poland `` should be a country where everyone is absolutely equal before the law '' , duda said . 
  he said the country should be a place `` where there are no unfounded privileges , where there are no better castes of citizens , where all citizens are united . 
  this is a task which , in my opinion as president , must be fulfilled . '' in his speech in from of the royal castle in warsaw 's old town , duda added that such a choice should be taken through a public vote . 
  `` i want to have a referendum on the constitution of the republic next year -- the 100th anniversary of independence , '' duda said . 
  the pioneering 3 may constitution was considered a threat to the european status quo by russia , austria and prussia , especially in the light of the french revolution , and the polish reforms hastened the dismemberment of poland by the aforementioned countries . 
  however , although the 3 may became a public holiday after poland was reborn following world war i , the holiday was banned by the moscow-backed communist regime that took power after world ii . 
  so why do you say  putin refuses to let that happen ... 
  i wonder why ? 
  no sane country would allow that , regadless of it doing the crime or not, 
   putin refuses to let that happen ... 
  i wonder why ? 
  stop saying things like these , it only makes you seem uneducated https://www.reddit.com/r/syriancivilwar/comments/656vk1/russia_vetoes_un_security_council_investigation/dgbpgux/, 
  yes ordering a strike before anyone had the chance to investigate on what exactly happened is such a level headed action . 
  oxens , feets and mices, 
  i 've been there , it 's horribly tacky . 
  arabs are also white . 
  you got downvoted because you sound like a douche in that comment, 
  the guy before said :  after that eu elites would probably try to populate this no man 's land with mahmouds fron middle east , so i 'm pointing out the hypocrisy . 
  yeah but it 's in russia . 
  that 's even worse . 
  they have high ratio of isis volunteers per capita and now want to put gays in camps , no thanks . 
  nationality is about your self-identification . 
  citizenship is about your legal status .

  it is n't and you should know better then call everyone `` backwards '' , because you are going backwards to try to `` save '' the climate . 
  why should you care about renewables as long as they ineffective and you 're sitting a huge pile of coal and actually have the technology for filtering the most toxic gases . 
  oh and again : it was a reference to what is happening in the `` refugee crisis '' . 
  so of course you ca n't mix those cultures . 
  but actually , while yes we could form a country , we are far from having the same interests and the territory of that supercountry would still be populated by the same people . 
  and i can agree with him . 
  the only thing `` cycling and vegetarianism '' is actually kinda ridiculous . 
  since when is pis talking about `` evil western powers '' ? 
  that is normally what the russian media does . 
  and pis is absolutely not comparable with putin 's russia . 
  the only thing which is increased is the distrust in our allies as well as germany , since german politicians are also saying much bullshit without knowing how it works . 
  well zdf actually proved something about itself . 
  you know which something ( nye ) meanwhile ard , i may agree , but if it is about pis they only follow the polish public media , which was pro-po til this month . 
  and our media likes to exaggarate a lot . 
  now foreign media should n't do the same , because they are not in the same position . 
  the same level of stupidity and absurdity as someone opening a cultural centre celebrating hitler in a german city . 
  and no , that did not happen . 
  but russians have a history of being in love with their tyrans . 
  very believable . 
  private media goes on as always . 
  only public media gets affected by it and who does n't use the state 's own media to promote yourself ? 
  this whole hysteria is still completely ridiculous . 
  if our country was ever supporting putin , you know that we 've got occupied by russia . 
  so the way you wrote that comment it seems to say the message that `` pis '' supports putin in some way ... it absolutely does n't . 
  it has an even harder approach on russia . 
  you know that private media remains allowed and independent . 
  so if you know that , then you should also know that heads of public media get replaced everytime a new party comes into power . 
  do n't act as if you knew what is going on in my country . 
  you do know , that poland is n't germany and germany is n't poland , right ? 
  our public media is pretty pro-government , actually they are even going into the extreme with that . 
  additionally normal private media wo n't be censored , instead they will exist among each other . 
  so what is the exact problem here ? 
  what are you going to do about the media ? 
  you can only facepalm and shrug your shoulders about most of our media as well as politicians . 
  there are still traces of white-black thinking in there . 
  but this is truly surprising to see such an article and that from spiegel , which is very biased . 
  thank god . 
  the eu seems to be more controlled by corporates and banks then by the actual people . 
  wow , i wonder why you were n't banned for that comment since it goes against the mod 's agenda . 
  i certainly would get banned for posting such 6 months ago . 
  and this is truly sickening . 
  and it reminds me of the polish communist times where it was normal , that something went completely wrong but somehow it still was `` alright '' . 
  just like communism itself , you have to lie that it works and you just know there is something wrong with it . 
  it 's not even about that . . 
  i could also talk about this `` refugee crisis '' , absolutely no context . 
  it is more likely that the most media critizising poland sounds like official russian propaganda . 
  there are so many parallels in there . 
  including calling them `` fascists '' but i say that ignoring what our fm said , he is truly pretty crazy . 
  seems like another normal year in the eu, 
  i 'm slowly becoming annoyed by such articles . 
  ca n't they finally stop their propaganda ? 
  exagarating about everything just to demonise poland as much as possible . 
  thank you leftists for ruining democracy . 
   but pis seems to be a bunch of paranoid fascists . 
  that 's exactly what the media wants to think of them ... and they are quite succesful in demonising them to the ground . 
  they are no fascists , they are not the catholic inquisition and they are not communists ... at least not less communist then po . 
  also pis is only doing reforms fast and trying to secure the state-media for itself ... something which every ruling party does at the start . 
  so in the end they will have the same influence on media as the former ruling party . 
  and the next party will do the same . 
  ( but everyone will be fine with it , since they do n't critisize germany or the eu ), 
  this one for example : http://www.welt.de/politik/deutschland/article150446293/wer-mit-merkel-sympathisiert-muss-spd-waehlen.html well , actually an interview . 
  and actually it was mostly csu politicians . 
  well , i read a lot about some cdu politicians being criticised by your own media for not saying `` refugees welcome '' even depicting them as extremists ... 
  present time is such fun times , is n't it ? 
  it truley is disgusting . 
  the `` iron curtain '' was made to keep people in and spread the red terror . 
  this is supposed to defend the border . 
  also letting this problem happen in the first place was already idiotic enough . 
  or you could just say : the german media is the next level of russia today . 
  aye these downvote brigades . 
  of course it is ridiculous . 
  complete distortion from reality , almost like a certain country further to the east . 
  well , it has a very clear backing in the german media . 
  ( i mean the german german media ), 
  or maybe they are just overreacting and actually spreading fear ? 
  of course ... just repeat yourselves even more . 
  thank you . 
  exactly what i was saying all the time . 
  thanks a lot . 
  some of the reports from such biased newspapers like wyborcza can remind very strongly from the russian propaganda on rt. 
  i did n't say poland should n't defend its allies , i have actually said the opposite . 
  but since i do not expect to see myself in the military , i wo n't literally fight . 
  meanwhile if a country attacks my country , i will give ressistance, 
  reminds me a lot of the polish word for `` battle '' which is also walka . 
  also the polish `` wojna '' ca n't be from the polish `` soldier '' ... 
  i 'm actually interested how it happened . 
  and better not to buy soda . 
  the hussars were active in the 17th century until the downfall of the polish-lithuanian commonwealth in the 18th century . 
  and we actually had developed a tank . 
  the only reason why germany 's `` surprise '' attack was so succesful is , because the allies in the west , france and britain told us to demobilize our armies again . 
  this is also one of the cases where appeasement policy failed miserably . 
  so no , poland was n't really backwards . 
  our economy was comparable to our southern neighbours . 
  except you do n't mean the winged hussars , but instead the cavalry somewhere in a border city . 
  yes , that was actually a german victory but with very many casualities for the german side . 
  actually a whole german tank division was destroyed . 
  but the cavalary may have only `` charged '' at group of soldiers , never at tanks . 
   polish cavalry , as poland didnt have tanks to combat the germans , cavalry charges with sabres were still a thing . 
  you do know we had anti-tank weapons attached to our cavalry ? 
  so that 's actually a stereotype you are talking about .

  and then you said `` south slavic sub - ** race ** '', 
  i do n't know but ... * sobs * they must have hidden really well . 
  made my morning , 
  with entire * apply * stuck in mouth ? 
  ... or the best !,

  * tym co odeszli - ci co pozostali * `` for those who passed ( away ) - those who remained '' it sounds so great, 
  that 's almost how debt crisis started, 
  checkmate , math rules,

  so what would in reality happen is just changing distribution system to less efficient . 
  some wages would n't be paid , so some taxes would n't flow in . 
  what 's more is that now formerly working `` minimum wage slave '' is now unemployed and requires aid . 
  he receives this aid from a state , which , in turn receives it from employee former employer . 
  and the states get it 's cut , too . 
  in the end , the laid-off worker gets less and is unproductive , the rest has to work harder for the same wage , the employer 's life just got harder , because he has to manage with less resources . 
  and that 's a net loss for a country , too , because who was once employed , taxed and productive , in however minimal amount is now dependent on social aid . 
  it is now the question if the expected profits are not caught into the social security net . 
  i think they would be , and we would never see them again . 
  edit-disclaimer : i am not an economist and may have overlooked many things . 
  if you can think of counterarguments to what i wrote , i would be happy to correct myself . 
  that would be disastrous . 
  and i 'm from poland , one of countries with the lowest wages . 
  it would only fuel unemployment as well as inflation . 
  i see no benefit of raising minimal wage in my country . 
  he meant that the text itself contains grammatical errors . 
  not that he needs a proof of what 's written in it . 
  just saying !, 
  cool story , bro , though !, 
  umm , yeah , it 's been this way through last 6000 years ? 
  i mean , where else to live in this country ? 
  all else is practically a desert . 
  okay then , i got a bit carried away with my rant , sorry about that . 
  it just because it 's really pissing me off , to think of these bastards from the communist party . 
  i tend to get a little angry , especially when i see some sheltered americans defending communism here on reddit . 
   really it 's shooting fish in a barrel listing the millions of deaths caused directly or indirectly by the us . 
  i do n't think you could top ussr 's . 
  i do n't think it would be even close . 
  but that 's pointless , even if one country 's deathlist is longer than the others , it does n't really prove anything . 
  just one more thing : the casualties of holodomor are direct effect of nationalization and collectivization of russian and ukrainian farms . 
  this is n't about authoritarianism . 
  this blood is on communist ambitions alone . 
  read some testimonies , it was monstrous . 
  it depends how to you measure state 's success . 
  i measure it by wellbeing of it 's citizens . 
  by this logic , ussr was a complete and utter failure . 
  if you measure it by how well off are the elites , then ussr is probably as good as the us . 
  `` well you could say pretty much exactly the same thing about the us to be fair '' no . 
  either you will now mention several million people that died directly because of us president politics , or you have to withdraw your statement . 
  holodomor and gulag alone took toll of 10 million people and this just because the party was paranoid about it 's power . 
  where in the fucking history did united states take 10 million civilian lives ? 
  do you even get that number ? 
  this was n't even war . 
  they just murdered their own population because ` communism ' . 
  there is similar group of leftist activists in poland . 
  they have this website , it lists , like , 4 persons in the group . 
  yet , they have already divided themselves into fractions ( and great names of these , too ; cool acronyms , and all ) , given themselves some fantastic titles . 
  lots of commissioners and many of them of the `` high '' variety . 
  pretty cool . 
  they write long dissertation about their ideology , and their friends discuss it passionately . 
  very lolworthy , although it 's all in polish and i lost the link :( . 
  `` i 'm no expert or anything but the ussr existed just fine for decades . '', 
  in which decades has it existed finely ? 
  ussr was all about murdering its own people , preserving elite 's power or acquiring more power . 
  1920s : holodomor , war with poland 1930s : gulag , the great purge 1940s : conquest and subjugation of central and east europe 1950s : forceful suppression of anti-soviet opposition in poland and hungary , war in korea 1960s : cuban missile crisis , vietnam war , prague spring 1970s : war in afghanistan , 1980s : no major crimes against humanity , except afghanistan war continues as well as usual terror against civilians in soviet union and subjugated states . 
  in every decade you have at least one , murderous initiative that is only undertaken to extend ruling party 's power . 
  except 1980s . 
  well , i see . 
  you meant 1980s , when soviet union was on the verge of collapse , had enormous economic troubles that ruined its population and eventually it dismantled . 
  there was never a time , when ussr would exist ` fine ' . 
  it was founded on terror and functioned on it . 
  how about communist revolution in russia in 1917 ? 
  was n't this started as a handbook communism implementation ? 
  the working masses arose and seized power , and such ? 
  then , this quickly degenerated into totalitarian exploitive oligarchy . 
  i think the claim here is that every communist rule will sooner or later end up like that . 
  a valid point . 
  yes , the current crisis is dragging along for too long already . 
  and it probably could have been handled in a better way ( though i must admit , i have no idea whatsoever what ' a better way ' would look like ... maybe you do ? ) . 
  but i do n't think this is a critical set of mistakes that 'll cost dismantling of the eu . 
  and if it 's not , then the eu will recover and remain the heaviest player on board . 
  or one of the heaviest . 
  it is going to be a major player due to it 's sheer weight alone . 
  but i 'm not going to argue about a leading position -- the eu may not be the first right now , in the `` economic best '' ranking , and i do n't even know how to measure `` being first '' . 
  it is most certainly one of the leaders , ** at least ** on par with the us and china and whatever else . 
  yeah , sure . 
  they all used a fork and a spoon to eat their dinners , though . 
  militarily , yes . 
  economically , not so much . 
  the eu has already surpassed the us in the gdp field and still has a lot place to grow -- think all of the newest eastern acquisitions . 
  agreed on the winters . 
  it 's so inconsistent in poland , either it 's -20 c and freezing balls or it 's about 0c and gross muddy snow shit everywhere :( . 
  i 'm all about summers , though  . 
  from wikipedia it seems that summer temperatures in stockholm are 20-25 celsius . 
  i 'm sorry but that 's lower than pretty much anywhere in poland :( . 
  where are all the hot days ? 
  a bold prediction . 
  some nations split . 
  some states revert to anarchy and lawlessness . 
  i think it 's at least as probable for europe to unify eventually as is it to dissolve to the pre-eu nationalist shitfest . 
  this was very hard to read for me . 
  the amount of damage done for my country by soviet russia is astounding and it still affects my everyday life . 
  i even wrote kind of angry post to you , only to remind myself , that you 're only a messenger , and you personally do not hold such beliefs . 
  the worst part is , i believe that russian people do n't really mean harm to anyone . 
  it is just so sad , that they always follow their crazy asshole-ish governments . 
  why every single ruler of russia is always a mega-douchebag and no one calls him out on it ? 
  : / and i do n't even see how it could change , considering how the power is perceived in russia . 
  motherfucking putin not only has any support , but also wins elections even when not really trying hard to rig it : /, 
  sweden . 
  i like you .

  i would rather say they are content . 
  very much so , just instated of the iron fist of oppression it uses the velvet glove of comfort to pacify most of the population . 
  and that 's not even touching deliberately physically and mentally crippling most of the population . 
  the perfect planned society . 
  they 've been adapting it for a film almost since it was written , but it never went beyond a screenplay, 
  synthwave is fine to, 
  are we left with choosing which distopia is preferable ? 
  if so i prefer cyberpunk . 
  the life is harder but at least there is abundant chrome and 80 's heavy metal . 
  they would just sell sprite - sovereignty edition `` say no to thirst ( and unelected eurocrats ) '' it would be hit . 
  something a bit smaller then the sub brands but larger then ingredient labels and in the font, 
  how would it cost more ? 
  and macron is the current prince of andorra so it would be a royal marriage :d . 
  thanks . 
  ok i 've read and he is both right and wrong . 
  your sources actually give the answers to his question on why the proposals where made : http://www.efta.int/sites/default/files/documents/eea/eea-efta-comments/2016/eea-efta-comment-on-contract-rules.pdf the eu consumer agencies ( both beuc and the country ones ) want to keep the current level of protection where there can be while business organization all want a single level of protection for all of eu so it 's easier to do business and sell across borders . 
  is the ( arguably small , vast majority of eu ( and eea and efta ) countries offer only the 2 year warranty period ) lessening of mandatory protection is worth creating and environment in which european companies can do business easier over the whole single market , i 'm not sure . 
  but making every sale only need to conform to one standard of protection seems like it would allow for retailers to compete across borders more easily , and hopefully they would compete not only based on price but also quality and warranty periods since they can still offer longer ones on their own . 
  also another draft proposal from the same imco proposes tying the minimal length to the expected lifetime ( for longer lasting products like the aforementioned fridge ) . 
   kept murdering illegals here the point is they did n't come as murdering illegals ( just illegals ) but they left as ones after their experience in the us . 
  it 's not really americans fault that they created gangs and became criminals that 's on them , but you ca n't find it healthy that the american gang violence problem is so big that it 's now being exported . 
  yep , about the same i 've heard . 
  i do n't think they want to invest the money ( at least in anything less safe the aa bonds ) , just have it there . 
   higher than warzones in countries like honduras . 
  was n't it la gangs ( edit : made up of honduran immigrants but organized in the us ) that the us started deporting en masse that started that murder wave in honduras . 
  i 'm waiting to see how this is the eu 's fault . 
   make something germans want then they want the warm feeling of having money in the bank . 
  competition only works where there is a working market , there are some places where markets barely work or do n't work at all . 
  those are the natural monopolies of transportation and utilities ( the last mile ) or when the payoff is very removed from investment like in education and healthcare . 
  there should of course be procedures in place to allow for the greatest market possible ( like separating the energy delivery company from the energy producing company and requiring fair use agreements ) . 
  are some races more predisposed to some cultures ? 
   and consumers are open to it . 
  and supermarkets do n't stock them because of some conspiracy or beacuse they do n't sell well . 
   why eu is setting an absolute upper limit instead of a minimum requirement baffles me . 
  the 2 years is a minimum , your country can require more an the producer can offer more . 
  but they have a longer and older history of moving west they came first from the east continued west till they met the roman empire . 
  some moved a bit west again with the fall of the empire , some did some fancy circles through ukraine , balkans spain , north africa and italy . 
  well it 's been like that since first humans entered europe . 
  the moors might have been the only migrants that started from the west . 
   i bring my own woman . 
  of course you do , estonians are world famous wife carriers . 
  his proposal i think are more targeting eurozone members . 
   is that something that only happens informally now on a project by project basis ? 
  in the eu there is currently the structural fund that goes mostly to the poorest members and is great but it is small compared to to the economy ( the whole eu budget is even if you include the cap ), 
  putin : [ chuckles sovieticly ], 
   minnesotans minesota had high immigration from nordic countries https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/minnesota#race_and_ancestry, 
  they 'll add an alias atlantic-north but it will still connect to the same server, 
  i assume estonia at least will work for a connection to finland , latvia is a bit problematic but a connection to sweden would not really be that much longer then ones between poland and sweden . 
  in the spirit of equality you can be a sir regardless of gender . 
   the ariane 5 main stage accelerates to roughly 7 km/s . 
  hey you are right i fucked up my back of the envelope :d . it 's 6.5 and 1.2 by my revised calculation ( that add up to the correct 11 km/s for the whole rocket with the eap ) ( 20t payload , 3.5 km/s eap , 6.5 km/s core , 1.2 km/s 2nd , total : ~ 11 km/s to leo ) that still makes the ariane upper stage bring 10 times more dv then the orbiter did for the shuttle . 
  but both have about the same leo capability with a 20t payload , and the numbers i 've given were for the es variant second stage used to bring the atv to the iss , you ca n't get a better comparison with the shuttle . 
  the eca variant for geo launches second stage is almost 1.5 the mass and brings even more of the the dv for that kind of launch with the smaller payload ( 10t payload , 3.5 km/s eap , 6.7 km/s core , 3 km/s 2nd , total : ~ 13 km/s to geo ) . 
  though you could probably give another similarity because both used large solid boosters partly as a subsidy for slbm/icbm motor manufacturers . 
  since the respective companies make motors for the us and french slbms and would probably by the main contractors ( if only because they are the only companies with any experience in large solid motors ) when either the us want 's to replace the minuteman or the french want to build an icbm . 
   both main stages are also way oversized , carrying them almost into orbit by itself not really 1/4 of ariane is it 's upper stage which is about normal for rockets and it burns twice as long as the core stage . 
  its supplies about 3000 m/s of dv ( ~ 4500 m/s for the core stage ) while for the shuttle the oms finished orbital insertion with maybe 150 m/s after burnout of the core . 
   the main difference is that one carries its payload on top and the other on its side the main difference is that it does n't carry the 100 t orbiter beside the payload :d, 
  and people that point out annexation of czechoslovakia forget that terrain was given czechoslovakia in 1920 by the western powers without a plebiscite even though majority was polish at a time poland was fighting the bolsheviks ( czechoslovakia even stopped weapon transports to poland going through their territory ) and could not oppose it . 
  the polish actions were of course pure dickishness , though not more then the previous czechoslovakian actions . 
  put higher prices on stuff sold by the pound , since it 's measured with vintage units . 
  try us military college lectures on you tube most of the ones i 've seen on the eastern front were really good and they debunk the common misconceptions on german and soviet way of war ( usually to the benefit of the soviets ) . 
  edit . 
  also they point out that western history prior to 1990 of the eastern front was based mostly on german sources and those were not only one sided but also blatantly wrong , the germans had shit military intelligence and did not know about the existence 1/3 to 1/2 of the soviet army . 
   because prior to dropping the bomb ussr and usa already had a plan to invade japan together yeah and they expected 500 k causalities on half of the wining side , not to mention they planned using the later produced 7-15 fat man bombs during that invasion . 
  there was never a question whether to firebomb japan , nuke them or invade , it was all of the above from the start with hope that they surrender before the invasion .

  jedi mind tricks do n't work on jedi but they do work on weak minded . 
  they never lived in poland and do n't really know anything about it but they are poles ( at least the ones i 've seen there mostly spoke polish ) . 
  the polish diaspora in the us is very conservative even by polish standards after all . 
  there have been some polonia members from the states comming to / r/poland for some time though they did n't really get anything done, 
  corportations rulling everything check , lack of privacy unless you live of the grid check , rising stratification between people check, 
  i do n't think so . 
  the only things requiring referendum are the first and last chapters of the constitutions ( on the basis of the state and the requirement for that referendum respectively ) afaik . 
  do you think the drain of educated people that would have an easy time getting a work visa would not happen without free movement ? 
  free movement actually mean that western europe ca n't just pick the most valuable people wanting to work there they have to let in everybody . 
   they 've also sent a ton of their far-right as volunteers to donbass well that 's a win win for putin , they either fuck up ukraine or die trying both help him . 
   they ca n't enter libyan territorial waters . 
  but they can enter italian waters illegally without a problem . 
  i do n't think surviving collisions with much larger ships is something that was in the requirements . 
   and spacex literally survives only off of nasa handouts . 
  providing a service to nasa that nasa needs at a lower price then the competition is not a handout .

  organizing a rape squad would count as a war crime, 
  unless it 's discipline of emissions, 
  good good the inquisition always needs bright candidates . 
    americans may be real dumbfucks at times . 
  i thing you are reading too much into it , that phrase is not that negative as you portray . 
  it 's main point is to emphasize that the us have money and guns ( or in ops comment technical expertise and capital to make reliable military equipment ) since that 's their undeniable strength and not the multitude of other things you could describe them with . 
  it 's not like he used `` for all their faults '' . 
   i understand that poland has only left behind its past as a soviet colony , it 's not even that , the postcommunists ( sld ) where in all parliaments in free poland and even won 2 elections . 
  their problem is the their economic policy was very much center-right ( which is probably good since poland needed that for the first 15 years of capitalism ) thus they lost the left electorate that votes based only on economic principles . 
  while communism is tainted the welfare state and social policies actually have large support and always have , even during the fall of communism . 
  poles did n't really want capitalism because they liked it and valued free enterprise , they wanted it because clearly i worked better then socialism in polan . 
  that 's the reason of the success of pis they married the traditional values rhetoric with social programs and completely hijacked the working class vote . 
  only no there is a new party razem that is trying to recapture those people from the ground up . 
   there should be a representation for progressives , greens and the likes .

  how many of them really believes is one thing . 
  but i think more important question is : how many lives accordingly to the teachings ? 
  and that 's my point - most of these * `` catholics '' * just uses the religion as an excuse for everything they do n't like and as a mean for everything they want . 
  people who live as the bible says , who respect other people as the bible says , are rare . 
  russia is too big to be considered anything but * russia * . 
  and * russia * meaning enormous and diverse . 
  you , considering russia european , are telling some kid from siberia that they 're not really russian . 
  they may consider themselves something else first and then russian but how about we leave that choice to them , shall we ? 
  you would n't be able to distinguish [ just by look ] a russian from the west from a pole , as well as you would n't see the difference between a russian from the east and say a mongolian . 
  and yet these two russians have a common factor - * russian * . 
  [ edit : and i 'm not talking about race here . 
  at least not only . 
  there 's different look , enviroment , history , experience , religion , mindset - but they still have a common factor - the russian one . 
  take for comparison belarus and mongolia [ geographic extent ] and you have next to nothing in common . ], 
  in that terms i say russia is in its own class . 
  and its culture , however close to european in some aspects , is still distinctive . 
  various as views during the trans-siberian railway journey . 
  russia is in its own class , really . 
  totally agree . 
  seriously ? 
  i always thought that aznavour is like piaf , brel , sinatra , martin , presley , the beatles or queen - meaning well-known and well-loved * everywhere * . 
  on the other hand , i always assumed that an average frenchman has no idea about okudzhava , vysotsky or kaczmarski , so i guess we 're even . 
  by the way , okudzhava 's mother was armenian , i remembered that just now . 
  yeah , i 've been staring at the map for the past hour and i figured that this is an example where the border is more of an area than a line . 
  mainly because the seas are treated this way and this part of the land squeezed between them is quite tricky . 
  also , i wonder how is it that we as the europeans have so many different * views * as to where that border is . 
  i always assumed that there is one universal version that is taught throughout europe and that seems not to be the case . 
  i was taught , as follows : * the pechora river * the ural mountains * the emba river * the caspian sea * the caucasus mountains * the black sea * the bosphorus * the sea of marmara * the dardanelles how is it in other countries ? 
   maybe we should have a series of posts where people can write about the respective , preferably smaller , less known , countries of europe . 
  great idea !, 
  soad , oh yes . 
  tankian is one of my favorite voices ever . 
  also charles aznavour is of armenian origin . 
   geographically , no , since it 's further east than turkey whose `` europeanness '' is highly disputable . 
  the border between europe and asia runs through the caspian sea , then the caucasus mountains , and then the black sea , so everything between the seas is european . 
  holy shit . . 
  i think you 're right . 
  :( but it has to be pretty badass baboon if it could pass for a lion !, 
  right ? 
  seriously ? 
  the only one i had a problem with is the netherlands . 
  i 'm not sure about hungary but it dangerously resembles a potato ... 
  looks like sleeping lion 's head to me . 
  got a better idea ? 
  come to think of it , that might be because of the * sleeping * part . 
  so , basically , russia shits on our face even though we are a lion ? 
  croatia is my favorite . 
  i do n't know the exact procedures either but i 'm afraid the only problem was with the prosecutor being a moron who does not think on his own and ca n't prioritize . 
  even when there are rules a man 's life should come first when it 's at stake . 
  all it takes is to think . 
  so what if there 's more paperwork later . 
  yeah , i bet it 's because his textbook did n't say what to do with a face in such cases ( ca n't blame it , really ) and he was covering his ass , because idiots who do n't know that bureaucracy is for the people and not the other way around are our specialty . . and they 're breeding more and more idiots . 
  * rules are for the obedience of fools and the guidance of wise men . 
  because that 's where we keep our summer houses !, 
  lots of lakes and woods . 
  you forgot how it ended the last time they did ? 
  no , thanks . . , 
  among the others . 
   reading this made me happy . 
  same here  i hope i live to see that freedom in my country . 
  and i 'm not even gay . 
   second-largest cities in the various countries will often be a better choice to hang out in . 
  something about them  so true !, 
  europe ca n't afford war . 
  we 're broke and have enough problem as it is . 
  seriously . . 
  well , as history taught us , there 's a difference between a declaration of war and actually doing something, 
  til , thanks !, 
  well , do n't come to poland because what you wrote there could be used as an exact description of what 's happening here . 
  edit : we do n't have royals but the government is trying to royally f * ck us over so i guess it counts . 
  first reaction : poland big !, 
  aww ... and then i noticed i 'd be czech :d ambivalent feelings . 
  that 's because they do n't know that the opposite of love is n't hatred but indifference . 
  love and hatred are closely related . 
  polan trick yuo all . 
  polan yuo of genius !, 
  * the elephant in the room . 
  * and then there 's * germoney * , but we 're besties now . 
  and my favourite and the least obvious : the never-ending * polish-polish war * ... 
  czech 's looking good . 
  austria , points for arnie . 
  hi there , brother !, 
  if you ask polish kids about * winnie the pooh * they 'll stare at you but that 's just because he 's called * kubu\u015b puchatek * here . 
  you have great wine , we 're friends , and russia pisses you off as much as they do us , that 's bonding . 
  it always surprises me that people fail to recognize one simple thing : * alive people are more important than the dead ones . 
  * it really is that simple . 
  and i mean this with absolutely no disrespect to the dead . 
  it would be really to the contrary of everything that we should learn from the atrocities of ww2 to put the already dead before the still alive . 
   your central bank gold was saved before we could get hold of it we also had enough brains/luck to send it to the canadians who gladly gave it back right after the war . 
  i 've heard some have n't been that lucky and the safe place they put their money in became a new permanent home for it ... 
  i think romania had a problem with getting their gold back , but i 'm not sure 'cause reddit told me that one ... 
   they do n't clean old buildings ever you know nothing so why are you talking ? 
  [ here ] ( http://i.imgur.com/xlxai6v.jpg ) , first example from pozna\u0144 . 
  the other day i 've seen cleaning of some tenements in wroc\u0142aw . 
  maybe they do n't do it where you 're from , maybe they do n't do it enough , or often enough , maybe you have n't seen it yourself , maybe you have n't heard of it but to say that * they do n't do it ever * is just bullshit . 
  and because people like you , who have to say something even when they clearly do n't know what they 're talking about , most poles are convinced poland is a shithole where nothing ever gets done , and that everybody around have it better , brighter , richer , funnier ... and when various sources show that life here is constantly improving they say : * what ? 
  nooo . 
  we 're the worst ... * i 've been up since 5 a.m and before 7 i already managed to meet 5 complaining people ... in a shop , while walking a dog , neighbour , family ... holy crap , poles , why are you all always complaining . 
  here , that 's my complaint . 
  dear / u/skocznymroczny , it 's nothing personal , you just had the fortune to be one more complaining person i 've met today and i 've already had enough so this happened .

  ok , let 's say you house * is * harming kids . 
  by doing something which used to be perfectly legal , but which the government has just made made illegal and has taken away your house because of it . 
  well , in any civilized legal system you would deserve compensation for the exproperiation of your property . 
  but you 're really clutching at straws here . 
  the point is clear : when a law , no matter how well-meaning , violates somebody 's rights and that somebody sues for compensation , it is disingenous and misleading to describe it as suing the underlying cause of the law . 
   we do n't have to dance to the tune of lawyerspeak . 
  the lawsuit was to stop plain packaging laws . 
  firstly , the lawsuit was to compensate for damages , not to stop the law from taking effect . 
  secondly , it 's not lawyerspeak but an important distinction . 
  the point is that you ca n't violate certain rights and rules , no matter how good the cause is . 
  this is the principle every civilized , democratic country follows in its internal judicial system as well . 
  philip morris alleges that its rights were violated and demands a compensation for the expropriated property . 
  it is very different than saying it sued the government for public health regulation . 
  let 's say i live near a busy intersection where lots of accidents happen . 
  last week there was an accident in which two kids crossing the road were mowed down by a truck and as a result the city council decides to build a big roundabout to make the intersection safer . 
  however , there is not enough space so in the process they bulldoze my entire garden . 
  i sue the city for taking away my property and i demand compensation . 
  is it fair to say that i `` sued the city for protecting kids '' ? 
  no , it 's misleading to say the least . 
   philip morris has spent tens of millions of dollars on a tactical move with little chance of success . 
  why ? 
  to discourage other countries from enacting similar legislation , while they wait for the result of the suit . 
  buying time , basically . 
  yeah , exactly my point . 
  firstly , the basis of that suit is * not * health regulation per se but expropriation of a trademark . 
  saying companies can sue government `` for protecting their youth '' is extremely misleading - they can sue for breach of specific clauses of trade agreements . 
  secondly , the suit has little chance of success , it is mostly a tactical move from philip morris . 
  i could also sue you tomorrow for some silly reason but it does n't mean your country 's judicial system is broken . 
  what counts is the result . 
  lastly , precisely because of the bad publicity brought by the above case , the eu negotiating mandate includes a clause designed to prevent companies from even * attempting * to sue in these sort of cases :  and should be without prejudice to the right of the eu and the member states to adopt and enforce , in accordance with their respective competences , measures necessary to pursue legitimate public policy objectives such as social , environmental , security , stability of the financial system , public health and safety in a non-discriminatory manner all of this makes for quite a different picture than the one painted by the statement `` tpp will offer a method by which companies can attack laws that affect them , suing governments through a tribunal for such offenses as trying to protect youth from cigarette marketing images '' ? 
  so no , i would n't trust that post as an honest , unbiased summary . 
  unless of course you 're not looking for that , but for confirmation of your preconceived opinions and fears, 
  it 's certainly made to * look * like a comprehensive , unbiased summary to someone who does n't know anything about the matter . 
  however , although i 'm not an expert myself , i do know a little bit and there are certain parts which i can recognize as highly misleading . 
  this for instance is a bunch of fear-mongering bullshit :  suing governments through a tribunal for such offenses as trying to protect youth from cigarette marketing images , trying to protect the environment from dangerous industrial contaminants , or even refusing to pass laws removing or suppressing regulations where beneficial to corporate activity so i advise not to trust that post too much . 
   so you think it \u00b4 s great to sue a country over their anti smoking campaign because it \u00b4 s not a `` general '' but some sort of `` specific condition '' wich was violated 1 . 
  i 'm not saying if it 's great or not , i 'm just refuting your assertion that companies can sue for anything that merely goes against their financial interests . 
  the philip morris suit has a small chance of success , it will probably be dismissed anyway . 
  ttip has introduced a clause specifically designed to make these sorts of suits impossible . 
   and you wan na tell me i do not need to worry especially as all those conditions are kept top secret ? 
  actually , i did n't say that . 
  i made a specific point but you seem unable to stick to the argument at hand and follow it through logically . 
  but since you brought it up - the conditions are only kept secret during negotiations , as is the case with virtually all international treaties ever . 
  no , i 'm not worried about it , though i do agree the process should be made as transparent as possible without compromising the negotiations . 
  ha , i am obviously not familiar with most of these cases . 
  but i happen to be familiar with at least two of them ( philip morris vs australia , ethyl vs canada ) and i know they are definitely * not * examples of companies suing for some general loss of investment , but for violations of specific conditions of trade agreements . 
  moreover , in the latter of the case the company was unequivocally right , as the canadian government instituted a discriminatory measure that was target against ethyl and did so under false pretenses , as the government internal documents clearly showed . 
  this tells me you probably just spewed a list of random isds cases which does n't answer my question at all . 
  companies can sue for discriminatory policies that violate specific terms of the agreement , not for some vague `` loss of investment '' . 
  the idea that companies would be able to challenge any policy that goes against their interests is just nonsense and fear mongering . 
  there are over 1400 isds clauses in trade agreements eu countries have signed - i challenge you to find a single example of the sort of thing you are talking about . 
  fortunately they can practise in their own rooms instead , since they were flooded . 
  yeah , lte is much better anyway . 
  to be fair , the comparison is misleading because that 's presidential elections as opposed to parliamentary ones . 
  though there still would be at least twice as many presidential candidates if we compared apples to apples . 
  i 'm not saying if austerity was right or wrong , but your statement is a fallacy . 
  austerity was employed ( no pun intended ) is countries that already were in economic crisis , so * of course * those countries have had lower growth . 
  it 's like saying hospitals make people sick because the ones who have recently visited them suffer more health problems than average . 
   great heroes get to be called righteous among the nations ( righteous in favour of jews , of course ) excuse me ? 
  righteous in favour of people being murdered by the millions . 
  have you just got caught up in the discussion or do you really mean to imply there are multiple viewpoints about saving people from holocaust ? 
  right , because the issue is so clear-cut that the only reason why someone would abstain is to pander to the us . 
   what ? 
  i 'm yet to demonstrate my view ? 
  you are yet to demonstrate that it holds water . 
  i do n't dismiss anything , i am open arguments . 
  however , you have failed to provide them . 
  you have presented no concrete arguments that religious beliefs have played a significant role in fuelling the conflict , other than that they * could * . 
  maybe you do n't understand what i mean by concrete arguments . 
  for instance , if you showed examples where either side regularly used religious rhetoric to justify its actions or to stir people up - this would be a strong argument . 
  you 've given nothing like this , no historical or social facts whatsoever . 
  of course logic must be applied in any debate . 
  but logic operates on facts and concrete information , which your posts are low on . 
   i fail to see how this statement does not contradict what you say next correlation does n't imply causation . 
  when a and b correlate , it does n't necessarily imply one is caused by the other , it 's also possible they have a common cause c.  i 'm not placing all blame on religion . 
  i 'm merely saying it is a relevant factor and a contributor to the conflict . 
  you are yet to demonstrate it . 
  you just keep making a purely logical argument , attempting to prove your point based on correlations and inference from general principles . 
  this reasoning goes only so far and quickly becomes frustrating to discuss against . 
  yes , religion profoundly influences one 's worldview and yes , there is a strong correlation between religion and political views in the ulster conflict . 
  no , neither of this implies religion is responsible . 
  either you are gon na make a more concrete argument and show exactly when and how religious beliefs contributed to the conflict , or this discussion will remain hollow . 
   i do n't see how you justify the claim that religion does not inform their decisions ( as is necessarily implied when you claim religion is not part of the problem ) this is incorrect . 
  it only implies religion does n't inform the particular decisions related to the conflict . 
   that 's what they want you to think . 
  we 're in a huge crisis because of the structural weakness of the financial sector . 
  that 's what caused the 2008 crisis , which worsened the economic situation and in turn suddenly made the structural deficits unsustainable . 
  but this would n't have happened if those countries were more responsible and did n't rely on foreign borrowing so much . 
  look at my country , poland , for an example of what happened if you were more responsible . 
  the crisis just exposed the vulnerability of countries which were borrowing too much because they were spending too much . 
  and crises happen - if it was n't this one , it would be something else down the road , and the problem would be exposed sooner or later with similar results . 
  that 's why it 's not the financial sector that holds the fundamental blame . 
   ireland is in the mess it is in not because of government spending , but because the state took the liabilities of private banks onto its balance sheet . 
  compelled by the ecb . 
  yes , exactly . 
  and this is exactly why after a few tough years ireland is showing signs of recovery and is bouncing back much quicker than the big spenders in the south . 
  same with estonia and other baltic countries . 
   well i think such a debate is over . 
  the record is nowhere near as clear and simple as you are painting it . 
  i could just as well provide you with a list of examples of high taxes and government spending `` failing again and again and again '' .

  and one has opposition and internal enemies . 
  and ca n't * simply * lie . 
  waiting for russian propaganda videos that will utilize this and the armed forces day iself . 
  i do n't know how legit it is , but if someone writes this at headline , it 's not * only * about money . 
  stands for :  do you want to go to work in northern sweden and earn ** some money ** ? 
  do you have free time in late july - mid september period , car and a bunch of good friends ? 
  go groundcover fruit picking to norsjovallen . 
  we guarantee ** unforgetable adventure ** and ** beautiful views ** . 
  if it was * only * about money , they would work in fast food restaurants . 
  they have more consumers/customers during summer . 
  i 'm of course not saying there are no people who do this * only * for money . 
  i just want to point that it 's more and more commonly adventure , not a real job . 
  of course it 's for money , but it 's not as crucial as it used to be . 
  i 'm talking abut * current * generation , i do n't know how it used to be in the past . 
  but yes , they can still earn more than at home in some cases . 
  when was it ? 
  it 's more of an `` adventure '' than a summer job for majority of poles . 
  usually people who go fruitpicking do n't * need * to , they just * want * to . 
  it 's a new experience in foreign country , something youth highly value . 
  ~ ~ when we need work , we just fly to uk ~ ~, 
   poland was very interested in local border traffic with kalinigrad . 
  this was a mutual initiative of the two sides , both russia and poland , which have done everything possible to make the lives of our citizens easier . 
  and the results have surpassed all expectations -- the border is no longer a barrier to travel . 
  afaik , they mostly visit shops ... 
  i 've heard they buy a lot in poland , especially after these embargo-hype started . 
  also , i support this . 
  i doubt there are jihad-style russians who would be a threat to our safety and i do n't think that russian society is to be punished for what just a few of them does . 
  russia is cool of full dudes !, 
  * meanwhile in sweden * poland ? 
  you mean these people from south who pollute our sea ? 
  i 'd replace elbl\u0105g canal with [ \u0141azienki park ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/\u0141azienki_park ) if it 's ok to submit whole park . 
  [ koz\u0142\u00f3wka palace ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/77/kozlowka_palac_lubelskie_foto14.jpg ) is quite nice and there is one `` wonder '' very important when it comes to culture ( especially in the past ) - [ jasna g\u00f3ra ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jasna_g\u00f3ra_monastery ) . 
  i also like [ sejm \u015al\u0105ski ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/silesian_parliament ) and - do not burn me alive - [ this middle finger to all poles ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/silesian_parliament ) . 
  it is hard to pick 7 of them . 
  i 'm waiting for a colorful map displaying `` the most wanted lands of europe '' . 
  each color for a number of countries that have ever owned certain land before . 
  and the history of poland shows it perfectly . 
  did n't see it , we think alike :p, 
  he seems to be the only man ever to get period . 
  you say bbc and reddit are bad ? 
  man , this sucks . 
  * quickly checks if poland has enough seats * . 
  are they going to build something bigger ? 
  assure it that all immigrants will leave it . 
  sounds good ? 
  that 's what they want , but it would ruin them . 
  completely . 
  they - almost * we * - share currency . 
  it was planned . 
   we ca n't set things straight for some reason because of nationalists in both countries . 
  you are high on my ` most ' list anyways , 
   obviously the russian only speaks russian . 
  i always want to report them , but there is no proper category . 
  it would be like 76 % if all churches had website . 
  come to germany before it comes to you !, 
  no it does n't , lawl . 
  how do i know that other countires do n't know something i know ? 
  how do i know what they know ? 
  this is mostly true . 
  sometimes it 's much easier to get something back from germany than any other country ... 
  we have really similar with silesian and a warsawian . 
  stereotypes are the best source of jokes , 
  i also remember that one : pole , romanian and hungarian are in a car . 
  who 's driving ? 
  what 's the slogan above the german ministry for tourism ? 
  come to germany , your grandparets ' furniture and paintings are already here . 
  it flows both ways . 
  the most modern bank in the us wanted to test if money it puts in their best safe is protected enough . 
  to check it , they invited the best and most popular thieves from germany , france , and two random poles . 
  the team who succeeds to open the safe in two minutes can keep all the money the rob . 
  to make it easier , americans shut the lights for the same time . 
  germans are the first to try . 
  the lights are turned off and on again after two minutes , but the safe remains closed . 
  a bit damaged , but closed . 
  french team is next . 
  the lights go out , they swear a lot , but also do n't make it . 
  time for poles to try . 
  lights go out , two minutes pass . 
  americans try to turn lights on , but nothing happens . 
  again . 
  still nothing . 
  after next ten seconds , they hear a whisper : - kur #a , stefan , we have lots of money , leave this fuc ## ng light bulb alone !, 
  i thought you were going to write : `` an apple a day keeps the ~ ~ doctor ~ ~ putin away '' . 
   painted red oh , the irony . 
   cheese filled pierogi you mean * ruskie * ( white cheese with potatoes and a bit of onion and salt ) or * na s\u0142odko * ( white cheese with sugar , sometimes also yolk and * \u015bmietana * ) ? 
  i was just sharing what google recognizes . 
  i did n't know some regions of poland claim them as their own as `` hau\u0142ski '' and so on . 
  til . 
  anything you can eat with ketchup is good . 
  i thought former commy countries knew all the uses of potatoes . 
   hlusky if someone wants to google it up , try `` halu\u0161ki '' . 
  i do n't know if it 's a typo or regional name , but it works better this way , 
  or he 's only had american pizza , 
   i was pretty wtf when i got garlic sauce to my pizza in poland i was pretty wtf when people in italy got suprised when i asked if they serve pizza with it , lol . 
  i thought it was normal throughout europe . 
   bad news this . 
   tv shows were ever no good either most of them sucks , but i find ranczo really funny , especially later seasons . 
  it 's just so chilly . 
  talent shows like x factor are mostly worse than their foreign versions , but they are slowly getting watchable . 
  kuba wojew\u00f3dzki show is sometimes really good - depends on guests .

  czech republic , it 's wonderful country , beatiful mountains , if i 'd like to swim in the sea it 's not so far away to slovenia or croatia , similar culture though it 's more secular and liberal ( like lgbt or weed ) , good salaries for it guys ( compared to cost of living ) , great food , in prague english is very common , though my first language is polish so it 's not so difficult to handle basic communication with natives . 
  if you understand few words of other slavic language and other foreign slav speaks slow it 's possible to have conversation while you speak polish and foreigner use his/her language , one difficult thing is accent , you just have to get used to it . 
  source : i 'm working with ukrainians , it 's possible to have long conversations as long as both sides use simple words . 
  i 'm speaking polish , my friends ukrainian and we get along , though it looks weird/funny when other people see such conversations . 
  she was a ( female ) king , ` couse our lawmakers back in the days never assumed that poland will be in situation were female ( queen ) will rule a country , due to that our nobles pretty much said `` fuck it , she 'll be a king '' . 
  it was legal issues that made her king not queen , not the linguistics . 
  nowadays , but back in the days , we actually had a border , but luckily it was border set on carpathian mountains , it would be very difficult to invade one another , we also had common enemies , like holy roman empire since the beginning of our existance and later ottoman empire . 
  long story short ; good borders and common enemies make good friends . 
  good friendship last forever . 
  while for example taxed gasoline is ok , ` couse you pay as much money as you use gasoline and most of it goes for roads that you actually use while using gasoline , or property/income tax payed local that goes for local infrustucture etc. 
  is completely ok , but taxing someone inheritance is just a theft . 
  tax itself is not bad thing , it becomes a bad thing when you tax something you should n't . 
  can you imagine `` kid-tax '' , ` couse you know not everyone can have kids and by taxing you ( as a parent ) , we 're trying to make it possible to `` soon-to-be-parents '' ? 
  socialism is n't the way mate , i know what i 'm talking about ` couse i live in former `` real socialist '' , marxist-leninism country , but by what you just wrote you seems to be fan of these guys . 
  you still do n't get that , it was n't some kind of `` new-poland '' . 
  it was a place ( still is actually ) where polish people ( and polonized locals ) lived for centuries , where poles were majority . 
  back in the time no pole could even imagine poland without such cities as lw\u00f3w or wilno , wilno was n't some periferal small town , or important industrial city , it was just seen as part of rzeczpospolita ( the republic , heir of polish-lithuanian commonwealth ) , as something we own , poles pretty much created that city in it 's shape ( since xvii century 'till 1940 's ) . 
  though in that case [ majority inhabitants of that territorry were poles ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/republic_of_central_lithuania#ethnic_and_national_background ) , all of the cities were majority polish , while towns were mostly jewish then polish , it also was as important place for us as kosovo is for serbs , [ in wilno lithuanians where less than 1 % ( ! ), 
  of population ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vilnius#demographics ) . 
  situation might be similar , but we have to remember the difference . 
  edit - wiki links, 
   yes . 
  at least the soviet union can excuse some of it 's actions as necessary for survival . 
  like exporting food while over 7mln of their own people starved to death ? 
  like mass deportations of poles to siberia and northern kazahstan simply for being poles ? 
  or maybe killing over 111k poles in 1937 simply for being poles ( polish action of nkvd ) ? 
  what actions they can excuse as necessary for survival ? 
  care to explain why ? 
   with the most evil history in the world they can rivalize with uk , russia , belgium , france , china , japan , turkey , usa and probably many more for that title . 
  i mean , they 've done terrible things , without doubt , but are they really no. 1 ? 
  by sterilization and abortion , by mixing better genes with better genes etc. 
  however not by killing people ( as long as abortion does not count ) . 
  yes it is dangerous as fuck , today people with family history of heart disease ca n't have kids , tommorrow blue eyed people ca n't have kids etc. 
  but still it 's not classic genocide like armenian . 
  eugenism was more about creating better human , it was n't actually about killing people . 
  i love australian alps , it 's a shame though they participated in partitions of poland . 
  awesome animals , especially dropbears . 
  you know , ukrainian guerillas slaughtered ~ 80k of polish civilians simply becouse they were polish and now those guerillas are `` national heroes '' and have their monuments and ukraine names streets after those guys , it 's hard to blame us , 
  you know , turks in poland are mostly nice , hardworking people , and almost everyone knows that nice `` turk '' ( who 's often hindu or kurdish ) that makes your kebab . 
  depends whether we 're talking ` bout somali or black westerner . 
  you know , black american = american , somali = somali . 
  far east asian like japanese or vietnamese is just another fellow tourist/immigrant , while iraqi or palestinian is seen as another fellow terrorist ( maybe i 'm exaggerating , but you know where i 'm heading ) . 
   indians or latinos literaly non existent , more like `` some exotic people '' . 
   also how are those of mixed race if you will ( white x black , white x asian etc ) viewed in poland ? 
  if they are tourists they are tourists , if they 're of polish parent and non polish parent and identify themselve as polish they 're polish , pretty much no one cares . 
  ethnicity and self-identification matters here , not race . 
  also how do you behave , if you 're nice black student you 'll be treated like nice foreign student . 
   an empire that stretches nearly to vienna and encompasses hungary , moldavia , wallachia , the balkans and greece was mongol empire european ? 
  you know , for a moment they even were as far as silesia ( nowadays western poland ) , they succesfuly occupied rus states ( nowadays ukraine and russia ) and actually ruled what 's now southern russia/north of caucasus . 
  by your argument they were european . 
  what studies ? 
  pasterz is shepard , pastuch is not a nice name for a shepard , but still a shepard , calm down slavs . 
  never heard of it, 
  why ? 
  becouse instead of regional rival we 've got source of cheap labor and place where we can export our stuff . 
  that depends on a definition , russia claims to be heir of novgorodian \\ kievan rus , ukraine claims it as well . 
  well , that 's true . 
  in '90s they were portrayed as a post-commie country that should succed and should be regional power in the next ~ 30yrs . 
  with their resources and their arable land i 'm shocked to see how they fucked up . 
  though it '' s better for my country that they did . 
  our gov. 
  is not considered far right by our standards , they 're basically catholic socialists . 
   if you do n't to allow immigrant to come your county , then you are free to do so . 
  we 're not against immigration to poland as general , we 're against taking ultra-conservative foreigners from completely different culture and paying for it . 
   although i quite like poland , it 's true that you have some really bad scum 's as every country , though for what i mentioned earlier poland is being portrayed as almost worst scum of europe . 
   yet it 's not about being against migration or whatever , it 's about spreading hatred . 
  if certain groups of people spread hatred against free speech , women , people of other religions and we wo n't allow such people to come here in the first place , we will have one less hatefull group to care about in our borders . 
  it is related . 
   also you have shit loads of anti-semitic stuff , which is quite dumb considering what the fucking nazis did to you well , after wwii jews were about 1 % of our population , however they were overrepresented in `` our '' communist government , secret police , over 30 % of our judges , prosecutors during stalinist era were jewish . 
  they were literally sentencing polish undeground soldiers , of home army , of polish armed forces in the west etc. 
  to death for fighting nazis . 
  i 'm not trying to say `` it 's ok to hate jews ` couse they 're jews '' , i 'm just trying to clarify why some people here do n't like jews . 
  hate towards jews here is pretty much of anti-communist background , not anti-zionist . 
   how do n't you allow such groups to speak ? 
  pretty much same as in the west , by portraying hateful groups as hateful groups not as `` cool antifascists '' or `` members of religion of peace '' . 
   and yes i endorse fighting against fascism , nazism . 
  it 's funny how fast you can become fascist nowadays . 
  i do n't endorse violence towards peoples of different beliefs/political views , it 's just barbaric . 
  it 's relevant to what you wrote . 
  you seem to endorse far-left violence towards far-right people . 
  then you wrote , that by allowing free speech to `` fucking nazis or any ** other organization aiming oppress some other groups ** '' we get such situations as in article . 
  you have to decide , whether you condemn actions of violance aimed towards one group based on their beliefs/political beliefs or not . 
  since we do n't like such situations like one in the article in poland , we do n't want far-left/right groups in our country , especially foreign ones ( domestic ones are easier to control ) . 
  however when we do n't wan na allow such groups to speak in poland and we do n't wan na import such groups and pay for it we 're literally second worst europe 's scum , just after russia . 
  so yes , it 's relevant to the topic . 
   this is what happens when you give free speech to the fucking nazis or any other organization aiming oppress some other groups . 
  yet when we do n't want foreign muslims we 're literally nazi 's , backward people who should be punished for not taking ultra conservative foreigners . 
  quite progressive for post-commies and , if i 'm not wrong , the most atheist country in eu . 
  he ca n't , no poland for 123 years , no continuous law . 
  it is n't ? 
   taturk winning the turkish independence war . 
  this and ethnic cleansings and genocides , it 's easier to hold those borders in armenian and greek free turkey than it would be in turkey full of armenians and greeks . 
  long story short immigrants votes left . 
  most likely we 'll get those f35s , ` couse you know , poor people ca n't afford cheap stuff . 
  and somehow isreal wants and gets money for death of polish citizens . 
  ` couse you know , those jews were polish citizens . 
  nah , prussia took land that used to be ours , so technically we get our land back . 
  we had trans mp , she was n't the best mp we had but still she was just another polish left wing mp not `` look at me , i 'm trans '' mp , i guess that 's why we have relatively high score . 
   where is the capital ? 
  in novgorod veliky ( or something like that ) , later in kiev .

  not many old teachers know english good enough to teach , that 's probably why there are n't more of such courses . 
  anyway , nobody have a problem with that . 
  people from abroad come and leave their money here , why should we complain ? 
  if you did n't invested more than that in power grid you now have to diseable most of the freshly build powerplants , because current powerlines wo n't be able to deal with varying output of these solar and wind powerplants . 
  http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/german-energy-expert-argues-against-subsidies-for-solar-power-a-866996.html  photovoltaic systems are distributed across hundreds of thousands of small power plants , which sounds nice . 
  but when the sky is blue over germany , these hundreds of thousands of decentralized plants act like a single , large power plant . 
  all of the sudden we have 30,000 megawatts coming into the grid , which , in many cases , we ca n't use . 
   i do n't want to bore you with the details , but a surplus and fluctuations lead to very unpleasant systemic effects . 
  we have voltage fluctuations within the grid that create problems for industry . 
  or we overload the grids in neighboring countries . 
  poland is in the process of installing technical equipment to protect its grids by keeping out surplus german electricity . 
  basically germany is using poland energy grid to dump occasional surpluses , and our grid ca n't deal with that without significant investment . 
  in a way we pay for their movement to green energy . 
  i want this http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/launch_loop  lofstrom estimates that an initial loop costing roughly $ 10 billion with a one-year payback could launch 40,000 metric tons per year , and cut launch costs to $ 300/kg , or for $ 30 billion , with a larger power generation capacity , the loop would be capable of launching 6 million metric tons per year , and given a five-year payback period , the costs for accessing space with a launch loop could be as low as $ 3/kg . 
  [ 5 ] and no new materials need to be invented for this to work ( unlike with space elevator ) . 
  so that 's just 22\u00a0000\u00a0000\u00a0000 eur for construction of the initial loop , and then we could send stuff to space for $ 3 per kg . 
  the rest of the money goes into building a moon base , and extraction of he-3 ( for powerplants ) . 
  she should have won in 1994 https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=ko9elaset3q#t=55s, 
  over 200\u00a0000\u00a0000 people in europe live outside eu , most of them wo n't enter eu any time soon ( european parts of russia ) . 
  maybe it 's simpler for you to ignore their existence , but that does n't make the simplification correct . 
  if he was nazi then yep , that 's exactly the good way to talk about him . 
  and that way is called `` incorrectly '' . 
  like english people towards welsh , i guess . 
  nobody see the difference when they do n't use their weird language , and the language is quite cute so what 's the problem - it 's not like they will demand autonomy or sth . 
  recently kaczy\u0144ski tried to target more autonomy-minded silesians as `` hidden german option in poland '' , and while kaczy\u0144ski has like 30 % support in most matters , that time everybody just laughed it off , it was so absurd . 
  the xenofoby that do exists in poland is mostly towards gypsies ( cause that 's the most problematic and most visible minority ) .

  so we differ in predictions . 
  time will tell . 
  i do think they eventually will come down . 
  i 'm quite interested in 3d printers and consider building some rep-rap model for myself , but i 'm an enthusiast , and i do n't think they will be ever as popular among `` regular people '' as paper printers . 
  for one thing i do n't see why regular person will need them more than once-twice a year ( to fix something , that can be easier and cheaper fixed by ride to nearest mall ) . 
  for rc-modeling hobbyist it may be good investment . 
  lastly i do n't think they are so game changing for guns . 
  we have had cnc machines for some time already , everybody can buy regular tools and do their own gun by hand , and including the time it takes to build 3d printer it is more convenient to only make the gun . 
  and it will be made of iron and not some cheap plastic . 
  i do n't think cheap 3d printers will be able to print hard metals any time soon . 
  and you still need to make the bullets and the cartridges . 
  not very complicated chemistry , but i do n't think you can print complete cartridge . 
  i 've heard there is benefit from state in nordics countries if you do n't work ? 
  in poland it 's not enough to live , and it 's over after 180 days , and in your countries it does n't end if you search for a job ? 
  but i got that from someone from norway or sweden writing on internet forum , and may remember sth wrong . 
  well , in poland renting a flat in big city costs around $ 300 , add bills and it 's 100 % of usual first salary for people just out of university ( which you graduate at 25 y.o. 
  btw ) . 
  buying a flat in big city requires credit for 20 years or more with 2 people working , and maybe you will have enough money left to go on a trip once a year , maybe not . 
  do n't even think about buying a new car . 
  and we do n't get money from state just for living , like you do in nordic countries . 
  all in all - it 's mostly economic problem here . 
  poland - you have to get licence from government and you have to register the weapon . 
  there are a few classes of weapons , with different requirements and licences ( hunting rifles have different requirements from self-defence weapons for example ) . 
  historical reconstructions using black powder are exempted from the rules , as are sport guns on pressurized air . 
  i 'm quite happy with that law , there 're almost no gun-related crimes in poland . 
  i do n't think 3d printable guns change anything regarding gun control in next 5-10 years . 
  for one thing access to good 3d printers is n't easy nor cheap . 
  for another - the quality of printed guns ( espeically using 3d printers that are cheap and accessible like rep-rap ) will probably be very bad . 
  you can already make a gun by hand using regular tools and iron , and if you are careful it will be much better than plastic 3d printed gun . 
  it 's called philipinian sickness in poland ( after our president aleksander kwa\u015bniewski visited philipiness ) . 
  he also tried to enter the limo using baggage doors , thus these are called `` presidential doors '' now . 
  nope if people from member countries can decide ( and they should ) . 
  to be fair russia has population density of 8 people per square kilometer , poland has 125 people per square km . 
  it 's much easier to deal with wild animals when there 's not too much terrain they can live on ( because most of the terrain is used for farming or cities ) . 
  these regions with a few dots in poland are also the wildest regions , with small population density and huge forests ( bieszczady mountains , bia\u0142owie\u017ca primordial forest , mazury lakeland ) . 
  polish is phonetic too , but we have a few characters for some sounds . 
  you say it like it 's sth bad . 
   `` esa continues to offer european states easy access to space . 
  last time , we had the first polish satellite launched into orbit , '' said antonio fabrizi , who is the director of launchers at the european space agency . 
  `` this time it will be the case for estonia to have a satellite in orbit . '', 
  take that r/polandball, 
  http://static.panoramio.com/photos/large/72387093.jpg not my best photo , but shows a little commie architecture , placement on the hills , trees everywhere , and great old architecture - that 's lublin , poland for you . 
  at least you do n't revitalize your commie blocks that way : http://static.panoramio.com/photos/large/66696138.jpg http://d.naszemiasto.pl/k/r/dc/cf/4ddca5b438ffe_g1.jpg http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-bgwqui41day/tiwthps5lli/aaaaaaaaco4/a2ghw5anzqs/s640/dabrowska_bloki2.jpg i understand that 's overreaction to gray communism , but it 's even worse . 
  almost nobody believed in communism even before it started in ussr sphere of influence . 
  it was forced on these people because of jalta conference . 
  minority believed , most just pretended they believe when it was necessary . 
  how exactly values of these people were wrong ? 
  they lived their whole lives in regular countries , then war came , and then communists took the power . 
  were they culturally changed overnight ? 
  explain north/south korea or east/west germany differences that arose in 50 years . 
  people were the same initially , only the system changed . 
  the casuality is the other way around - poor countries suffer from brain drain , and the people that live there adapt to inefficient system . 
  but it can be changed completely in one generation . 
  i 've maybe heard kurwa 5 times in supermarket in poland . 
  and i live here for almost 30 years . 
  people ( usually young ) swear when nobody older is around , and even then not as much as poles abroad . 
  i think it 's because at first only young poles moved to uk , nobody understood them , so they sweared more and more . 
  then other people followed , and they wanted to fit in . 
  and now everybody got used to that . 
  kurwa is a convenient word , after all . 
  because people that go abroad think then can say anything , cause nobody knows them/their language . 
  same reason englishman coming to krak\u00f3w piss to the fountain on the central market . 
  to be fair - young poles do swear more , but not even close to the point that poles abroad do . 
  it 's not the standard , emulating that will make you seem uneducated in poland . 
  | we can assume that the trend will strengthen , although of course it does not compare in size to the outflow of poles . 
  so the net flow changed marginally if at all . 
  | the new workers are coming for polish pay , which for outsourcing workers varies from 6,000 zlotys ( $ 1,900 , $ 1,450 ) to 9,000 zlotys a month . 
  yeah right . 
  i use shitf + delete/insert to cut & paste , and ctrl + left/right to jump to previous/next word . 
  select next word is ctrl + shift + right .

  therefore we are also building lng terminal and working on shale gas exploitation . 
  and fast . 
  with those circumstances public has given government a bit of a benefit of a doubt , when it comes to environmental dangers . 
  we 'll see how it goes . 
  it counts transferred gas too . 
  poland in this scenario exports 25m while producing 6m and consuming 14m . 
  oh , right . 
  do n't know how i missed it . 
  and you really have party called `` true finns '' ? 
  are they claiming that everyone who is n't supporting them is a fake finn ? 
  context being ? 
  first you need to be able to help yourself to be able to help others . 
  yeah , sure w/e . 
  * scotland , do n't leave us !, 
  ze germans are coming !, 
  have a good night then !, 
  it was exactly mali that i had in mind . 
  one specific thing that should be emulated ( if possible ) in every situation like that is a cooperation with the neighbours of country in question . 
  local governments figuring out the solution and cooperating with eachother while europeans provide firepower seems much better than us way of doing things . 
  tho i guess they are getting smarter in iraq with support for kurds and even coordinating with iran to some extent ( tho here it was mostly iran 's idea ) . 
  no , it was like that since the start , 
  you know i was joking , right ? 
  suuuure ... that 's exactly what bloody murdered of separatists would say . 
  maybe not the same amount ( in my opinion us was bloody awful in many many situations since wwii and recently ) , but blaming us for all the evil in the world is just childish . 
  and sadly quite common . 
  we really are lazy , are n't we ? 
  portugal and iceland hold their territory in iron grip . 
  they clearly covertly assassinate any separatists that pop up . 
  monsters !, 
  i remember it was due in 2013 at first and it was pushed to late 2014 . 
  last reports i 've read few weeks back still used that date if i recall correctly . 
  eidt : i just found an article from july about it . 
  apparently terminal will be finished in late 2014/early 2015 but with all the tests and whatnot first gas will arrive there in july 2015 . 
  there are big reserves and our domestic production is enough for all the heating anyway , so worst case scenario our industry gets hit . 
  terminal is supposed to be finished this year so with reserves and interconnectors i would n't call it too bad of a situation . 
  some countries have it worse . 
  do n't listen to the guy . 
  he is just a clueless kid making shit up . 
  most of what he says is pulled out of his ass , and rest are exaggerations and misconceptions based on those made up `` facts '' . 
  they just forgot to adjust their foreign policy since xix century . 
  yeah , i recognized classic late 90s westerns socialist attitude treating eastern european as some kind of nationalistic troglodytes who ca n't deal with their own history so they keep whitewashing it coupled with pro-soviet union bias fuelled by stupid assumption that everything us opposed has to be good . 
  later i will respond with all the links to disprove the nonsense and exaggeration in his post , but it seems like exercise in futility , really . 
  and quite disappointing in a sad way for a socialist like myself . 
  frankly it 's better if poland gets hit first . 
  our supplies are diversified enough for it to be a minor inconvenience at worst giving eu time to organize a political response . 
  granted that there is on to be had . 
  let me guess - only chapter that your book had was one describing [ national democracy ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/national_democracy ) ? 
  am i saying that ? 
  i simply said that guy who said that is spewing nonsense . 
  so they are n't brainwashed by devious us that is out to get russia ? 
  they just want to be safe from russian invasions ? 
  wow man - that 's some groundbreaking theory !, 
  in this thread , that is . 
  keep in mind that nato membership was n't really considered until well into the invasion . 
  it was all eu membership at first , and saying that eu is a hostile alliance is * a bit * of a stretch , would n't you agree ? 
  i see no excuse for russian actions in ukraine , even if i were to assume that russia has a right to dictate ukraine 's alliances . 
   i do n't see how you do n't understand that nato is an organization used to propagate western influence and hegemony , not a defensive organization used entirely for collective security . 
  and what * exactly * is that `` western influence '' you are talking about ? 
  sounds like an empty propaganda sound bite to me . 
  could you , for example , point that western influence effects on countries like poland or baltic states ? 
  it clearly has to be just under my nose , i just fail to see it !, 
   in the same way any eastern european country can apply for nato , nato could also reject those applications . 
  but it did n't , not because taking in these countries improved the collective security of nato , which it did n't , but because it allowed western hegemony to be extended and secured further east against russia in the post-soviet era . 
  you can also argue that creation of nato itself have n't helped security of us , so why bother at all ? 
  nato expanded eastwards mostly due to countries there being * very * interested in joining it and convincing their soon-to-be allies that they have a moral obligation to them due to the way they were treated in post-wwii negotiations . 
   if i was russia and all the states that were ** previously closely associated ** with me decided to join a hostile military alliance , i 'd be pretty pissed off as well . 
  closely associated you say ? 
  i could say that most of them were associated in the same way poland was associated with nazi germany between 1939 and 1945 , and that would n't have been too big of a stretch . 
  that * close association * was made of military presence , duress , installing undemocratic totalitarian puppet regimes , threat of invasion ( for example 1981 poland ) and even via invasions ( 1939 poland 1940 baltics , 1956 hungary , 1968 czechoslovakia ) . 
   to say that is not an endorsement of the russian response , it 's just the simple statement that people should n't be surprised nor should they be offended by the simple reality that if they 're going to spit in someone 's face and slap them that they 're going to react pretty angrily . 
  i could n't agree more . 
  russia should n't be surprised nor offended by the fact that after almost half a century of military occupation eastern european countries do n't want to have anything to do with it . 
  very well said !, 
  no , only ones who make no sense whatsoever . 
  every so often people who disagree with me are right and i adjust my views accordingly when faced with an proper evidence . 
  or they simply have a different perspective on a matter due to different experiences etc. 
  so i acknowledge that their opinion is every bit as valid despite being very different . 
  do n't seek any logic in this guy 's comments . 
  there is none to be found . 
  violence ? 
  it would have been violence had i actually done that . 
  till then it 's just a figure of speech to express one 's frustration . 
  care to move past that and explain me how in your mind russia 's hurt feelings over their shattered illusions of grandeur are more important than eastern europeans ' right to choose their own way and alliances ? 
  yeah , we are just a headless chickens herded into nato by devious us against our interest and will ... we just did n't know any better , being all retarded , as eastern europeans clearly are . 
  every time i hear an argument that boils down to that i want to jump on the plane and go punch that person in the face . 
  and there are really few things that annoy me , so go figure . 
  what 's khokhol ? 
  i 've seen it used by russians as a , i imagine , racial slur . 
  i do n't understand . 
  do n't you know where syllable starts without dots ? 
  it makes ukrainian situation even more infuriating . 
  it all could have been resolved by the referendum if not for fucking putin 's meddling :(, 
  you are trolling , right ? 
  look at dem swiss doing something decent for a change !, 
  [ wikipedia article ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_orsha ) it almost seems like our conflicts with russia have been going for a bit too long  painting itself , however , is exquisite with its level of detail and immense historical value , especially when it comes to learning about weaponry and uniforms of the era . 
  only had a time to watch 20 minutes today , but it looks very interesting . 
  i 've been missing debates like that since oxford union stopped putting their content online for some reason . 
  nice try you gay nazi !, 
  sure , but it still does n't mean that * everything * he writes is bullshit , does it ? 
  that 's not even good trolling man .

  corruption happens because people want easy money . 
  are n't music concerts a cultural thing , though ? 
  but does he have electrolytes ? 
  yeah , instead they can get 600 euros in social benefits in germany . 
  win-win . 
  my bad then , 
   you should introduce czech car brand ( czech republic is the country where only white people are , just like you ! ), 
  called '' \u0160koda '' you mean volkswagen with a different name ? 
  or is \u0160koda fully czech again ? 
  last i recall they were either bought out by vw or vw owned the brand ... 
  tis true : /, 
  was n't it france under sarkozy that bumped gadafi off in the first place ? 
   is this what we 've come to ? 
  yes . 
  good luck !, 
  our crazy catholics are not blowing themselves up in the name of jesus , though .

  it 's not just cyber but the cyber ...

  we 've had kebab-related scandals here in poland where the meat was being made in illegal meat processing centers ( do n't ask me how that managed to happen ... ) and the meat may not have come from a lamb or a pig ... 
  aaaaaand saved , obrigado !, 
  umm since when ? 
  did you miss the part where i wrote that he 's still a target ? 
  i get the joke but keep in mind that our president has almost no power , he 's just a glorified diplomat :p, 
  let 's hope that brexit does n't affect the eurozone 's economy too much . 
  as for economists claiming that it wo n't ... well , i 'll wait and see on that . 
  maybe he ate the journalist ? 
  read the article . 
  disappointed that it was n't the konami code or iddqd or something :p, 
  i am shocked and surprised / s, 
  their arses !, 
  show me on the doll where the evil dane touched you ... 
  guy on the right must be thinking : `` wtf is this guy doing !? '', 
  he should n't be a massive target now that he 's out of office , though . 
  still a target , of course , but i doubt he 's an important one nowadays ... 
  but it is liberal in the american sense of the word ... 
  even if we do end up taking them , there will be even more of them like a never ending amount ... 
  piracy would n't be a problem if a ) the prices for some content were n't insane b ) the drm was n't off the wall ( looking at you securom and denuvo ! ), 
  c ) the bullshit licensing that prevents content from being released in all countries at the same time ( i get sick and tired of getting my movies later or not all simply because of my geographic location ) .

  oppressed polish minority detected !, 
  this article is golden ...  ban adverts promoting `` unhealthy or unrealistic '' body images . 
   mr khan said : `` as the father of two teenage girls , i am extremely concerned about this kind of advertising which can demean people , particularly women , and make them ashamed of their bodies . 
  it is high time it came to an end . '', 
  translation : my children are lard arses who ca n't be bothered to go outside and perform some physical activity . 
  oh and this :  ** magdalena michalik ** who lives in greenwich said : `` please ban it . 
  i do n't want my children to look at it ! '', 
  the bolded name sounds very polish ... goddamn poles , going over there and complaining about being fat shamed ... 
  source please . 
  i hope you are moving to a city rather than a rural area . 
  have there been any terrorist attacks from extremist poles ? 
  what investors ? 
  low income housing does n't make money . 
   is n't a breeding ground for terrorism . 
  as of right now , no . 
  get a sizable amount of muslim immigrants , though , and we 'll see ... 
  and this is news how ? 
   there 's even japanese people in there writing in japanese `` overthrow the eu communist dictatorship '' that sounds like weaboos using google translate ... i doubt that the japanese , in general , care wtf happens in the eu ... 
  german can be beautiful ... at least when compared to dutch :d, 
  just because we can does not mean we should . 
  i do n't want my country to be another breeding ground for terrorism . 
  and just who will pay for the upkeep and the rest for that proposed apartment building ? 
  so why the hell should we accept them ? 
  because others have the ability to say `` no ! '', 
  every once in a while ? 
  so we should just make our country another country that has a `` second and third generation '' problem ? 
  i say no to that . 
   start building low income housing `` shit , they 're putting in low income housing in my area . 
  time to move ! '', 
  - everyone who ever saw low income housing get built in their decent-to-live-in area . 
  were n't they cast out of india , though ? 
  maybe in portugal pork is cheapest , i just know from my experience in poland that poultry is usually the cheapest meat available ... 
  better to have them here so in the next 18 years or so we can have more `` new europeans '' committing acts of terror on our soil ? 
  tell me , have you noticed how poland does not seem to suffer from these kind of attacks such as the one in manchester ? 
  did you not notice that we do n't have a sizable muslim minority from all over the place in this country and , thus , no ground for second and third generation terrorism ? 
  not all countries in mena are at war so they should have plenty of places to get asylum before even reaching eu borders . 
  thank goodness it does n't , i 've got things to do , no time for `` interesting times '' . 
  i wonder if one can draw a connection between poultry consumption and gdp . 
  i know poultry is popular in poland because it is * much * cheaper than beef , pork , or fish . 
  what 's a croatian ? 
  that 's where you 're wrong , kiddo.jpg, 
  i live in a big city and i do n't see terrorist attacks occur in it ...

you guys have money , just take these bloody olympics , i do n't want them in poland . 
  it was a serious answer though . 
  and cyrilic still does n't have every sound that is used in polish so we would still need some special marks . 
  no no , russia is enemy as well . 
  you know , we have enemies everywhere , west , east , north , south . 
  oh , and jews . 
  never forget about jews . 
  no , smole\u0144sk is not the the biggest debate anymore . 
  i 'd say ukraine is the most important right now . 
  also debate about pedophilia among the priests and disgusting comments from bishops about molesting kids it pretty big . 
  1st most of the countries that join eu after 2005 benefited greatly from eu funds , but poland is the biggest and the highest populated country of `` new '' eu so obviously we are getting a lot of money . 
  i 'm sure ukraine would get its share in time . 
  2nd published : march 15 , 1991 we were in similar if not worse situation then greece , so some of our debt was written-off , because west would n't get these money anyway . 
  i do n't know what it has to do with ukraine . 
  we pay our debts since then . 
  you ca n't forbit any march to go literally anywhere , or ban demonstration . 
  we have very liberal laws in that matter here in poland , because you know , freedom etc. 
  not even poles . 
  they were never in europe . 
  same as cyprus for that matter . 
  sweden is bigger country than poland ( 449,964 km2 to 312,679 km2 ) , but in poland three times more populated ( 38,5 m to 9,5 m ) and population density is six times higher ( 120/km2 to 20/km2 ) . 
  i honestly can not name one person without access to the internet . 
  ** poland ** * flooding danger in southern poland * cardinal said that gods law should stay above human law , and parliament 's job is not to question morality that comes from god ( obviously ) * last round of polish football league and some tennis, 
  there is a tournament in paris . 
  some call it french open , others roland garros , world 's biggest tournament on clay , one of four grand slams many frenchmen are playing , some really well . 
  too bad we do n't any party like that in poland .

  so many smiths in almost every country . 
  every east european country in eu is more or less `` westernized '' , whatever that means . 
  so , protest vote wins election . 
  pretty much sums up what greeks thinks about their political class . 
  * snow and low temperature - we do n't like -10 . 
  also no hot water and power supply in some places due to snow * ridiculous amount of speed cameras . 
  our current pm said few years ago , that only guy without driving licence can set so many speed cameras , but now we have more of them than ever . 
  people think that 's the way to reduce budget debt , not safety . 
  * smolensk crash episode 134532 * january uprising - polish love to argue about history ( or i should say polish politicians ) . 
  and we love to celebrate lost wars and uprisings . 
  * armstong and doping in sport, 
   the guy did create independent poland after 123 years of opression exactly this . 
  unfortunately , we ignore everything else . 
  that 's excacly how pis sees eu . 
  take as much money as possible because we are `` victims '' of communism and west `` abandoned '' us in ww2 so they have to pay for their `` sins '' . 
  total population of those countries ( except poland ) is 43.5 millions , just above 38.3 millions of poland . 
   he is a satirist , is n't he ? 
  i wish , but he 's serious . 
  i honestly do n't understand his popularity among younger poles . 
  he wins almost all ` elections ' in high schools , usually by a large margin . 
  he is extremely liberal economically and and as conservative as you can be ( anti gay , women should n't have rights to vote etc. ) . 
  most of his voters wo n't vote for him once they 'll have some ` real-life ' experience . 
  he 's quite funny if you listen to him and he 's only in eu parliament because of low turnout in elections . 
  pis got only 26 % from under 30 voters , but if you add up results of pis , kukiz and korwin ( those two are even more right wing and anti-eu ) you will get astonishing 62 % of votes . 
  so young poles are even right wing than older ones . 
   national rebirth of poland  division england that 's unbelievable . 
  i didnt know these people really exist . 
  it 's like in this polish meme , ` poland for poles , england for english and poles . 
  and image how sexy we would be !, 
  holy fuck dude . 
  no wonder people says polish are butthurt . 
   found the bavarian !!!, 
  that 's a brave thing so say to a guy named ` u/frankonia ', 
  i 'm not opposing any of it , i 'm just saying that when independence of out courts is in jeopardy , our public tv is reaching north korea level of propaganda , our government and president just ignore constitution , debt is rising and rising , and we are losing every ally we had , same-sex marriage is not a crucial issue right now . 
  and mind you , lgbtq rights have n't changed in any way since we have this government ( thankfully ) . 
   a party that opposes same-sex marriage , are highly critical of lgbtq and narrowly failed to ban abortion under all circumstances there are a lot of more important problems with pis than this ... 
  not a chance , as long as their polls are looking as they are now ( ~ 35 % ) . 
  most of pis ' leaders are either hardcore ideologist and they believe in all the crap they say or opportunists and they will do and say whatever they have to to keep their voters happy . 
  the core of pis , the ideologists wo n't leave party no matter what , but if kaczy\u0144ski leaves politics ( that can only happen if he 's seriously ill or he 'll just die ) pis would split into many groups . 
  actually few years ago some quite a few mps left the party , they created 3 or 4 different parties but none of them could get even 5 % in elections so i they will think twice before they would leave pis again . 
  and going back to the polls , they have n't really changed since election , their voters seems to be happy with what we have now , but next elections are in 2.5 years so a lot can still happen . 
  well said , you are 100 % right . 
  i would add that polish goverment media are already twisting facts and saying tusk was a german candidate . 
  they are citing merkel supporting him as a prove ignoring fact that every single country except ours voted for tusk . 
   i hope to go there sometime else again !, 
  you should visit strasbourg instead . 
  i 've seen both parliaments but i was more impressed with strasbourg . 
  jesus ... do they give them away for free ? 
  edit : actually i know where it is , so i guess they are just hungry pwr students . 
  one can only hope . 
  but for so many people being pole equals being a catholic . 
   they have underrated food like what exactly ? 
  it 's a weird thing to hear from a french . 
  i meant or not for , idk what f is doing here . 
  it 's great seeing poland ahead of most european countries . 
  i remember how rampant corruption was in the '90s . 
  as a common citizen you just ca n't bribe anyone any more which is the opposite from my parents ' generation when you had to bribe doctors to get a good treatment for police to avoid tickets . 
  good job czechy , we are barely ahead while our population is bigger more then 3 times . 
  most of these people are pro eu money though . 
   the only things i understood from this was jesus , god and thursday . 
  add a day off and that 's all you need to know about it . 
  exactly the same . 
  if a shop is opened you can buy anything you want no matter what day is it . 
  i ca n't think of any major institution that is not located in warsaw . 
  it 's jan kowalski in polish , means pretty much the same as john smith . 
  sometimes i see jan nowak as it 's also very popular last name . 
  actually drinking is forbidden on streets , parks and public squares so they could drink legally . 
  it 's a bit controversial where it is allowed to drink or not , few days ago our court defined what exactly is a street as a guy did n't agree with ticket for drinking on dike ( i think ? ),

  even better than cracow and prague i think . 
  and prices are ridicoulously cheap . 
  like half of these in poland . 
  i was there in 2005 , and public communication ticket was less than 0.10 euro . 
  i felt like rich man , 
  one could abstain . 
  certainly witold gombrowicz with at least [ ferdydurke ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ferdydurke ) belongs here and ryszard kapu\u015bci\u0144ski [ the emperor : downfall of an autocrat ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_emperor ) . 
  also i 'd add stanis\u0142aw lem [ solaris ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/solaris ) and [ l\u00f3d ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/l%c3%b3d ) by jacek dukaj . 
  yay for protecionism . 
  ukraine . 
  you can speak polish with the locals , people are friendly , everything is dirt cheap , and girls are even prettier than polish . 
  i think ukraine would split into eastern and western part , too . 
  yeah . 
  almost all infrastructural projects are in western poland , joining wroc\u0142aw , pozna\u0144 with germany , then with warsaw , gda\u0144sk , etc. 
  trade with ukraine , belarus and russia is much harder now than it was in nineties . 
  at the same time trade with germany , czech republic and slovakia is much simpler . 
  that 's why eastern partnership with ukraine is so important for poland - to make it easy for half of the poland to trade with neighbors . 
  people in western poland were forcefully moved there after ww2 from territorium that became ussr ( now belarus , lithuania , ukraine ) . so they were the easternmost poles not long ago  people in today eastern poland before ww2 lived in the central poland . 
  i doubt it is because of tradition , etc. 
  i think it 's more because eastern poland lost on eu accession , and western poland gained . 
  hence people in the west vote current government , and in the east people want change . 
  situation in poland is sad . 
  all mainstream media are ruled by politicians . 
  most by po , some by pis . 
  gazeta wyborcza , radio maryja and tvn are the worst . 
   because turkish is obscure in the context of european languages which are either latin or germanic ( and to a lesser degree , slavic ) . 
  hungarian , finnish and estonian are n't even indoeuropean languages . 
  also it does n't really matter . 
  give them 30 years and everybody will be speaking english ( i 've seen it happening in poland since 1989 ) . 
   turkey would have to be split in two and be maintained as separate voting areas for eu issues that would give turkish people more voting power in eu , than they would have if they had one country . 
  also nobody will agree to divide country just to enter eu . 
  in this context - by winning strategy i meant strategy resulting with biggest sum of payoffs of both participians over all the games , not assuming anything about oponent strategy . 
  according to http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tit_for_tat this strategy is optimal deterministic strategy for iterated prisoners dilema , and performed the best in simulations . 
   we can learn from game theory here : game theory has proven that overall the gain is higher if individuals cooperate , however the individual gain is higher for the traitor if people encounter each other rarely . 
  as the size of our societies increase , the winning strategy becomes increasingly to betray your fellow . 
  it matters how long the feedback cycle is . 
  in free market it 's usualy quite quick - you are betrayed once - you go to the competing seller next time . 
  the winning strategy in repeated prisoners dilema is to trust the first time you play with someone , and to repeat what he did to you the last time every time you play with him again . 
  and it 's more or less how people decide in free market economy . 
  in centrally planed economy the feedback cycle involves party and central planners ( if they even bother to read the complains people send them , if the people even bother to send the complains , etc ) . 
  most of the time the feedback do n't ever reach the people , so they do n't have incentives to play fair . 
  it makes huge difference , and it 's responsible for most of the inefficiences of cpe . 
  where i live it 's almost a dogma that free market is good . 
  mainly because we had centrally planned economy for 50 years , and everybody remembers where it leads . 
  countries that were on par with post-war poland , but had the luck not to have communism are now 2 times more wealthy and better developed . 
  and it 's after 20 years of catching up . 
  20 years ago it was more like 3-4 times richer . 
  even socialists parties here say free market is good ( but then , of course , they say we also need regulations and redistribution which make the market less free ) . 
  comparing reddit ( especially r/europe , but not only ) to similiar sites in poland ( wykop.pl ) , reddit seems like `` the nest of ` left wingers ' and socialists ''  i do n't think free market is always the way to go ( for example public education , infrastructural projects , health service etc can benefit from some regulations and have value for almost everyone , even for rich people that fly everywhere , send kids to private schools and go to private hospitals ( because economy would be much worse for everyone including them without educated young people , without good public infrastructure and without cheap healthservice ) ) . 
  but i do think we already have every regulation and exception from free market that we should have , and a few more , and further regulations are harmful . 
  for example most of the eu regulations are stupid , and the sheer amount of them is absurd and very harmful to eu economy . 
  regarding purpose of society - i think it should n't have any purpose except keeping people secure from each other . 
  less is more . 
  i was at hospitals very often when i was child , and i ( my parents ) only gave present to a doctor on one occasion - when she diagnosed my sickness after i went from one doctor to another for like 6 months and nobody had a clue ( and it was n't even the specialization of the doctor we gave present to ) . 
  i do n't think there 's anything wrong with that , we were just grateful . 
  the problem starts when doctors ( and other people ) expect you to give presents just for regular job . 
  it 's like with tipping in restaurant . 
  in poland especially older people think you should give presents to the doctor to make sure people will treat you well in hospital . 
  i do n't think it 's needed anymore , but still , when your relative is in hospital people often do things `` just to be sure '' . 
  i can understand that . 
  i just think saying `` love it or get out '' to people that disagree with you is n't very productive . 
  that 's how all progress happens - some people disagree with the way things are . 
  if all people that do n't like status quo just went elsewhere or shut up - there would be no progress ( see islamic states for example ) . 
  and `` sometimes hating your country '' does n't mean you hate everyone all the time . 
  yeah , it 's not like you can change anything in your country . 
  if you do n't like any aspect of the country - get out . 
  that 's why slavery is still legal , and black people have separate places in public transport . 
  well , in poland we hav had similiar debate , and now restaurants and pubs have to have separate , ventilated room for smoking people , otherways the whole restaurant/pub/cafe is for non-smoking people only . 
  i for one think it 's for better ( i have asthma , before this law every pub was effectively for smoking people only , and i had to take drugs every time i went to pub ) . 
  i do n't follow it , either . 
  from what i 've heard recently : - russia still has the plane wreckage - a few bodies of vips were badly identified and burried in wrong places , and now it 's fashionable to dig them up and check it - some polish experts ( do n't remember who exactly ) said that they have found traces of explosives on the wreckage , but later it was said it could be explosives , or some less suspicious things ( perfumes , etc ) . 
  some people ( like 30 % of poles , maybe more , hard to say ) think it was russian or po job , not an accident . 
  there 's constant battle in the media , which goes roughly like that : - kaczy\u0144ski ( from pis ) says po badly managed the situation , and russia is suspicious , and poland should get the wreckage immadietely after the crash , and the investigation should be made by poles from the start , and not russians . 
  - po says everything was ok , and kaczy\u0144ski should n't use catastrophe for political means , and we will get the wreckage soon ( which does n't seem likely from what i understand ) for me both parties try to divide voters as strongly , as they can , to get votes of the people opposing their enemy . 
  for last 2 elections it worked ok for them . 
  wow . 
  that 's like law that requires you to be a good person . 
  why nobody thought of that before , 
  in poland it 's `` lemming '' if you 're against pis , or `` moher '' and `` villager '' if you 're against po . 
  i 'm sick of it . 
  euro is n't controversial . 
  sth like 70 % poles does n't want it . 
  also no chance it will happen in next 5 years , and no chance po will be reelected , so no point talking about it now . 
  we do n't even pass deficit requirements . 
  but yeah , i got enough of smole\u0144sk . 
  sadly it 's still hot topic , mainly because pis-po medial battles . 
  actually `` hen '' would be useful in english , too , even when not speaking about people with complicated gender situation . 
  sometimes you need to write `` he/she '' and it looks stupid . 
  example - `` anybody should be able to buy whatever he/she likes '' . 
  or maybe it 's just problem with my english ? 
   abortion . 
  yeah , we had that one a few times . 
  if you are in auschwitz anyway , definitely see cracow and maybe wieliczka mine ( it 's nearby ) . 
  cracow has mostly medieval/renaissance sights , but it 's worth it , and you 'll probably land in cracow , anyway . 
  wieliczka is salt mine that has centuries of history . 
  it looks like moria before dwarfs escaped  they made whole underground chapels there from salt , etc. 
  if you like ww2 history , i recommend uprising museum in warsaw . 
  it 's a great museum , very interactive . 
  you can also see old town in warsaw , remains of warsaw ghetto ( there was another uprising there - different from the warsaw uprising ) . 
  warsaw was almost completely ruined after ww2 , then rebuilt , it 's worth to see the old town for that alone - there are photos of how it looked after ww2 .

  i can only remind you that to 2015 po did almost nothing what they promised in 2007 , yeah 8 years . 
  and this party has now 8 % and it 's a political walking dead trying to desperately gain votes through attack . 
  i did n't notice that . 
  people usually say niderlandzki and that is a correct case . 
  no https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/j%c4%99zyk_niderlandzki, 
  holandia - netherlands ( country ) holenderski - dutch ( adjective ) niderlandzki - dutch ( language ) holender - dutch ( person ) holenderka - dutch ( female person ), 
  do n't be surprised . 
  germans feeded by this by their media and press which clearly make that picture . 
  it 's not him to blame , but rather the press . 
  he 's only the victim . 
  most people do not have any issues with the british, 
  wtf is with that shitposting about poland here ? 
  because `` w '' is a special polish letter ? 
  then speak polish . 
  are you czech ? 
   2,000,000 poles living and working in germany those are not polish immigrants , but poles and germans of polish background . 
  or self-identified . 
  yet . 
  you can look up on immigration of 2014 . 
  poland was the third most immigrational country in europe in relation to the population after sweden and malta . 
  while the sweden 's and malta 's are mostly arabs the poland 's one were ukrainians and russians which are european and that 's very important . 
  it is nearly 1 million actually 800k . 
  still a large number . 
  i ca n't say how many of them are here to live permanently though . 
  that 's data for 2014, 
  not czech republic either . 
  they should never come there . 
  there are also russian germans in volga region . 
  they also drink a lot . 
  yes exactly , 
  it was part of kingdom of hungary but the region was inhabited by poles , as the part of galicia which were part of austria . 
  castle and territories were handed over to poland after trianon treaty . 
  hurr durr glorious estonia was undervalued !!, 
  eesti would want to be part of sweden any day . 
  just to be nordic . 
  actually eesti would be the non-nordic overseas territory of sweden . 
  eesti can not into nordic even when nordic !, 
  kaczy\u0144ski is a supreme leader in disguise . 
  he has control over pm and president and he 's trying to act like he 's not . 
  also known as `` smole\u0144sk tree '' in poland, 
  i think chinese people would prefer wealth with bad air than extreme poverty and hunger . 
  something for something . 
  poles in uk have absolutely no right claiming benefits from uk budget . 
  i believe they should have their access cut and should n't be parasites . 
  if the uk 's government is concerned , then it is huge problem . 
  our previous government was against uk cutting benefits for polish immigrants , so we have our chance to have nato bases and acceptance of uk in exchange for rights of poles for claiming benefits in uk . 
  the worst poles in uk might be unhappy , but many of them will agree with me , that if you come to another country and taking advantage of higher minimum wage , then at least do n't leech the country 's system . 
  that 's dishonourable . 
  the only difficulties in building it are in creation of isotopes and having access to them and also the technology ** used for ** constrution , not the overall construction that is known by 15 kid and please now do n't manipulate what i said . 
  and i said that 15 year old kid can build it , because it 's true , because the construction is simple . 
  i never mentioned materials . 
  so in another words you 're embarrassing yourself . 
  first you act like an angry kid , now you are manipulating . 
   call me when you get one . 
  what if i would n't call you ? 
  will you attack me with your baguette ? 
  and also i like when you call me kiddo , just because i 'm still studying . 
  i 'm not saying we will have our nukes instantly . 
  i wish we were n't forced to have nukes , but it leaves us with no other option . 
  i would abolish using nukes worldwide . 
  and yet pakistan has it . 
  i do n't believe they do n't have nukes . 
  pakistan has and it 's a fucking impovershed and unfunctioning shitstate . 
  who said we need special technology ? 
  i 'm yet to have engineering degree too , we both did n't studied a nuclear technology , so you do n't have any right feeling better than me . 
  i know what i said maybe hurt , but get your shit together and do n't cry and act like an angry kid . 
  do n't be also mad that poland might have a nato bases , because we deserve that , our conrtibution in nato was huge and we are waiting for payback . 
  i 'm not a fan of this government either , but it 's still better than our previous corrupt government . 
  pis at least have a vision of a state and they want to reveal the corruption scandals and the people from our previous ruling party that were affected in it . 
  that 's why they are using every method of propaganda . 
  their affilated journalist write propaganda articles in foreign newspapers about `` poland in trouble '' and then `` poland in ruins '' and tomorrow `` right-wing fascist dictatorship '' . 
  and people reading that are victims of that . 
  do you know what is a real difference between po and pis ? 
  that when po broke constitution pis did n't shouted `` end of democracy '' worldwide and when pis was in power the was no corruption scandal , but a scandal of a suicide of a corrupted lady from leftist party that was yet to be arrested for malversations . 
  the po and sld called it `` a political move '' does n't matter if she stole the money it only matter it was `` political '' . 
  i 'm not idealising and i did n't vote for them , but as i said that party has a vision that is n't liked by po and their journalist that will continue of bashing on poland in foreign media . 
  yes , because you are an expert of nuclear technology !, 
  every 15 year old can build a nuke . 
  it 's not so hard and the technology is known for 70 years , otherwise iran would n't have nukes . 
  sorry for rough answer but that is a truth . 
  i do n't really understand that shitstorm over our nato bases . 
  we trurly deserved , we were military an american puppet for more than 15 years in a row , we financed and we died for nato in masses , so why are n't we able of having them ? 
  at least we contribute in nato and we are n't a parasite state like baltics are . 
  we want at least to be allowed to had our military potential in the region , that might benefit also your weak country too if some country will come for narva with 95 % russians in it that would want to be part of russia anyway . 
   still require visas from poles that 's not our govenment fail , but our people that were cheating and faking visas before . 
  i blame ourselfes . 
   you want to end the treaty on the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons ? 
  i honestly want not to have nukes at all , but we are hopeless otherwise . 
  if would be possible i would ban using and having nukes worldwide , but we know it 's a sci-fi . 
  chinese have right to be proud of their nation . 
  their nation is a superpower that quickly gained wealth and is still developing rapidly and life standards went up too . 
  no , nato bases and nuke capability are to protect us from russia and get a full resistance if war occured ( we are first to be destroyed with or without nukes/nato bases anyway ) and we trurly deserve that bases considering our contribution in nato . 
  time will show this . 
  i personally prefer poland over unstable france having nukes . 
  france ca n't even get their shit together when it comes to internall affairs and a situation within state , and we do n't even say anything about war , when french were always a surrender cowards . 
  if a country like france is allowed to have it , so we are . 
  your logic france - north korea uk - north korea, 
  very good move . 
  at least polish immigrants will be profitable for poland for the first time . 
  krakow has more touristy places and is more `` cultural '' .

  they have different distance between rails than most of europe . 
  edit : it goes only for kaliningrad , otherwise you 'd a have already switched bogies in the baltics/belarus/ukraine, 
  and you do n't have to spend hours at the airport . 
  and you do n't really need a passport , id is sufficient . 
  fits better in the wallet . 
  i do n't know about the baltics , but in poland e-75 , the part between lithuania and warsaw , is being modernized to accommodate trains with speeds not exceeding 160km/h ( shame it 's not 250 ) . 
  connecting warsaw with gda\u0144sk would be nice . 
  kalisz was unfortunate enough to be destroyed by germans during the first world war . 
  my local lidl 's beer selection is ... disappointing . 
  you 'd expect more from a german supermarket network . 
  tesco ( the big ones , at least ) are much , much better in this regard . 
  biedronka is better , too , plus it has these nice , big and cheap packs of crisps . 
  over here i can choose between tesco , carrefour , lidl , real and biedronka . 
  lidl is rather the shittier one . 
  just by looking at it i am going to guess that kolache are an easier to pronounce equivalent to what 's called okr\u0105g\u0142a dro\u017cd\u017c\u00f3wka z [ czym\u015b ] ( round yeast-dough thingy with [ whatever the filling is ] ) . 
  readily available at any civilized bakery over here . 
  in poland it 's even worse with these [ bloody sound barriers ] ( http://i.imgur.com/p9v3e80.jpg ) . 
  they are everywhere :(, 
  there is no permanent lenin statue in krak\u00f3w ( nowa huta is a district of krak\u00f3w ) . 
  the current lenin is small and part of artboom festival . 
  the original lenin was sold to some swede whom i 've identified in the past but reddit does n't permit searching your own posts :( edit : [ [ size comparison of the pissing lenin ] ] ( http://i.imgur.com/dspip26.jpg ) [ [ size comparison of the old lenin at aleja r\u00f3\u017c . 
  ] ] ( http://i.imgur.com/55mapqm.jpg ) people tried to blow him up a couple of times but to no avail . 
  edit2 : the swede was called bendt erlandsson , the purchase took place in 1992 , the scrap cost 100 000 sek and is likely on display somewhere near stockholm . 
  yup . 
  it is , but it would fuck over the poor . 
  there 's a reason most income taxes are scaled depending on how much you make and vat has different rates depending on what you buy . 
  you forgot about the rector and pro rectors . 
  it 's understandable , though , as they do n't deal with the filth the students are . 
  in poland we got 0.41 for `` unreasonable delays '' . 
  seems about right . 
  `` earlier today german tanks rolled through warsaw , advancing in the eastern direction ; they met no resistance , they were even being cheered by the local people '', 
  a guy who got elected as an mp of the european parliament was , the last time i checked , supporter of ditching all taxes in favour of everyone paying a set amount of money each month . 
  what do they do with the removed bikes ? 
  are they taken apart and recycled/sold / ... ? 
  [ [ fields medal wiki ] ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fields_medal ), 
  not exactly for shits and giggles , but yes . 
  even if there are none it would be interesting to see a policeman on a bike hauling a huge cage , with bars , chains and stuff . 
  a skeleton would be a nice touch , too . 
  they should get some trailers to transport the arrestees . 
  on the other hand in the 50s we demolished various historical monuments in other devastated cities because bricks were needed for warsaw . 
  well , former tank crews then . 
  well , your tank crews do n't really have anything better to do now , do they ? 
  thanks !, 
  [ [ krak\u00f3w ] ] ( http://imgur.com/a/seuth ) as to why nobody likes the aquariums , that 's from the last week : [ [ a bit of derailment ] ] ( http://i.imgur.com/picib44.jpg ) these rails are shit , but no train yet managed to derail this spectacularly . 
  edit : there 's also a museum line , it uses a seemingly random train from the local engineering museum . 
  the city also ordered 36 trains [ [ like this in the picture ] ] ( http://www.tvn24.pl/krakow,50/beda-nowe-tramwaje-w-krakowie-miasto-kupi-krakowiaki-za-300-mln-zl,446028.html ) . 
  the polish parliament building 's resemblance to a circus tent is not coincidental . 
  wow . 
  i checked and yes , almost every catholic church in my city or its vicinity , just shy of 500 in total ( i might have missed some ) , has a website . 
  more than that the nearest church has a website which is responsive and well-designed overall . 
  the only bad thing i can say is that it does n't validate as valid html5 . 
  edit : it passes jslint . 
  holy fuck . 
  i wonder if you can see a small whirl in your gas tank when the engine 's on . 
  is the data self-reported or independently measured ? 
  or does it vary by country ? 
  they are probably the same kind of idiots who vandalised an old mosque in poland . 
  tatars living there moved there at least 300 years ago . 
  they might have been in poland longer than families of those who sprayed the walls of the mosque . 
  to be honest i would be surprised if tusk was recognized by anyone except polish tourists on vacations . 
  i have doubts about for example some presidents . 
  i know how the german one is called , but have no idea about how he looks like . 
  there is a lot of places in military women can be just as useful as men - logistics , communication , drivers to name a few . 
  we stole their job in less than two months !,

  it 's usually fine , but if you run into gestapo-babcie it 's best just to move to the other side of the tram car ( if possible ) . 
  what one should not do is staying near the door unless you get off the tram at the next stop . 
  and even if you do have to stand there , get the fuck off the tram at the stop instead of standing at the very centre of the door . 
  if not you might end up * accidentally * pushed out regardless . 
  it took him only ~ 21 hours to swim across the english channel . 
  he is also apparently the first person in the world to both climb everest and swim across the channel .

  one of your guys , apparently on binge drinking holiday , almost puked all over my shoes on the weekend ; it was a sufficient warning ... 
  it 's funny to hear it from a brit ;p, 
  it is n't hard to cross border to the uk .

  there was a photo of a girl sitting * inside * one of the crematoria furnaces at some concentration camps .

  do n't make any nazi signs at the concentration camps . 
  apparently every year some people get arrested for that thinking that police will take it as a joke . 
  the usual punishment is a suspended prison sentence and a fine . 
  the same goes for taking `` souvenirs '' from there . 
  if you wo n't get stopped at the camp itself , they 'll get you at the airport . 
  according to some article i found we export 60 % of 1.2 million tonnes of apples to russia annually , which amounts to roughly 19kg of apples a person , on top of the usual consumption . 
  in other words , what kind of booze can be made using apples ?

  the second one only because there 's an ass hidden there . 
  i loved it , because it made a perfectly good sense with the two first submissions , but not so much with any of the following . 
  it took me a moment to figure it out . 
  oh , the memories ... or rather lack of thereof . 
   it is the product of ef education first , a global language training company , and draws its conclusions from data collected via english tests available for free over the internet .

there 's a world of difference between considering something appalling and inhumane , while expressing the inability to change it , and only considering the particular methods inhumane , while mostly condoning the reasons behind those actions . 
  if someone thinks that maybe charlie hebdo cartoonists should n't be murdered the way they were , ** but ** they had it coming and the values that pushed the terrorists to act are right , only the execution was wrong , that person has no right to call themselves * moderate * muslim . 
  this * `` but '' * works the same way it works the classic phrase * `` i 'm not racist , but ... '' * -- it nullifies anything said before the word * `` but '' * . 
  i have a constant feeling that many think * `` moderate muslim '' * means * `` a muslim , who is quite moderate in their views , compared to what many other muslims believe '' * . 
  it 's wrong . 
  what it should mean ( unless we split the term and find a new one ) * `` a person , whose world view is moderate enough to be compatible with western values , who happens to be a muslim '' * . 
   probable scenario : it 's mostly funded by eu money ( which comes from all of us ) nothing happens , really . 
  life goes on . 
  another proof you know nothing about eastern europe . 
  nobody here will just wave their hand and say it does n't matter , it 's * mostly * funded by the eu ( which is very far from being sure right now ) and most definitely nobody here will have the approach * `` everybody 's paying , so it 's cool '' * . 
  dude , people in poland ( and we 're not talking some fringe political pundits , but big , legitimate political forces ) are still of an opinion , joining eu and the benefits it brings is not some great privilege bestowed upon us by the merciful europe , but a long due payment for selling us out in yalta and potsdam . 
  this is a sentiment that will not go away and no politician , polish or from other eu country , can try to ignore it without consequences . 
  we can accept refugees , no problem since they 'll run away to germany the second they have a chance to and there 's no way to stop them . 
  that would require force and keeping them locked . 
  germany ( and netherlands too ) would shit themselves over the perspective of such a * nazi like * treatment of the poor refugees . 
  we will take them , but on the conditions that will not even * remotely * resemble the standards western europe imagines refugees should be treated with . 
  either that , or no refugees at all . 
   the reason why i 'm not panicking ( at all ) is because we ( as europe ) have weathered much much worse storms than this . 
  not the part of europe we 're talking about here . 
  we had our own problems and they 're far from over . 
  the specifics of the region are completely different from germany or netherlands . 
  from economical to cultural ones . 
  but you do have a point , that this seems how western europe seems to look at things -- * `` we did it one way one time , so now everybody will do this our way too . 
  '' * this is not gon na fly . 
   many eastern european leaders already have unilaterally said `` no , you solve it '' or rather are doing what 's in their capacity , which is completely different from what germany et consortes imagine in their myopic worldview . 
  as i 've said once before -- germany is acting like a guy who goes to the bar with his friends and is convinced they will be ordering the same expensive drinks and lap dances from strippers , he does . 
  when the friends do n't want to , he accuses them of being a buzzkill and not good friends anyway . 
   these people are not going anywhere , as they have a right to request asylum in most european nations . 
  first of all , they only have right to asylum in the * first * nation they reach , that is not a war zone . 
  they do n't get to choose , and yet they do and will continue to , because germany could n't imagine people do n't act as it is expected from them . 
  surprise , surprise . 
  angela unilaterally breaking the dublin regulation made that a problem of germany . 
  i do n't see , how it 's news . 
  contrary to what you and some politicians claim , eastern european leaders are open to dialogue , as long as as there are any propositions and conditions that are grounded in reality those countries exist in . 
  and not some feel good fairy tale berlin believe they live in and expect everyone to . 
  so i 'd advise to tune down on the smugness and self-righteousness . 
  even the dalaj lama understands , europe ca n't take all the refugees . 
  angela 's soft heart means shit . 
  breaking agreements to let * more * refugees will quickly backfire and result in countries breaking the international law to accept them * less and less * . 
  this is exactly , what is going to happen , whether some sobs on the eu political scene will ( unsuccessfully ) try to scare everyone into submission , or not . 
  in conclusion -- until the eu is ready to accept that * maybe * , just * maybe * the reality of the refugee crisis is to what budapest or prague describe and much less what berlin , stockholm , amsterdam or vienna believe in , there will be no dialogue . 
  not to mention , the discussion on * `` how to make sure plans written in berlin are realized all over europe '' * is not dialogue . 
   they get food , they get clothing and a roof over their head . 
  but nothing more . 
  it 's almost cute , how detached from reality western europeans are . 
  what you described is what they will get here in poland and other countries of the region ** even if they will be here legally ** . 
  why would they stay here ? 
  unless germany and other countries of the old eu plan to direct some new and additional funds * specifically * aimed for the refugees , they will get nothing more than the ( poorly heated ) roof over their heads and spam sandwiches twice a day . 
  unemployment is high even for the locals , if refugees miraculously get a job the median pay is laughable compared to the western europe , the social net is ** much ** smaller both in number of services offered and the amount of money they provide . 
  and if our government directed some special ( even if not large in absolute numbers ) part of our country budget towards the refugees or created some special forms of welfare , even if just for those 12.000 that is the stated number ... well , it would n't be pretty . 
  best case scenario -- political suicide for the ruling party ; worst case scenario -- riots and refugees being treated as outright enemies by the * very * large and disenfranchised part of the population , convinced ( and quite rightfully so ) this money should first go to them . 
  western europe does n't seem to understand that we here , in the east , have a significant economic delay compared to them , even when taking all the economic growth after the fall of the eastern bloc taken , into account . 
  we 'll take the refugees and provide them with a decent welfare , no problem ... 
  call us in 30 years . 
  and refugees know very well all that i 've written above and will everything they can to reach places they consider beneficial for them . 
  and the ( projected ) million of refugees can do * a lot * and are almost impossible to control . 
  and , to add to your comment , you simply * can not * offer the refugees better welfare than the the country is offering its own citizens . 
  people in western europe , whose parents and sometimes even grandparents lived in prosperity , may have a problem with understanding that offering refugees better social nets than the natives have at their disposition in our countries ( the ones east of berlin wall ) , is at best a political suicide for the political party doing that . 
  worst ( and very probable ) case scenario -- massive riots and the refugees being treated as outright * enemies * of the locals convinced they 're taking the funds that should go to the natives . 
   the wealth must be redistributed . 
  and it is -- through taxes and social welfare . 
  any more invasive or more global form of wealth distribution inevitably ends with bloodshed and oppression . 
  which is exactly the opposite of what it is supposed to achieve . 
  communism does n't work and never will . 
  basically , germany is acting like that guy who goes with his friends to a bar and orders the most expensive drinks assuming , that since he 's ready and willing to pay for them , everyone who 's with him has the same approach and the same idea how to party , so they are supposed to order them too . 
  not really . 
  one can comment on reddit with total disregard for opinions of other redditors . 
  it 's even easier since res introduced the * disable inbox replies * function . 
   to ultimately reach germany that 's the crux of the problem , though . 
  they do n't get to choose to travel to germany . 
  as refugees they must accept shelter in the first peaceful country they arrive to . 
  there are no assad 's barrel bombs in hungary . 
  case closed . 
   aka artificially made up reason for humans not to move freely across land and the concept of everyone moving freely across the land is a pipe dream that will never come to life without restrictions . 
  so any discussion about asylum seekers and other immigrants simply has no room for idealistic and unrealistic views on the matter of borders etc. 
  if islam is understood as an ideology , what is wrong in being anti-islam ?

  it 's alive and well ... 
  in the court of law , where it applies . 
   the entire continent of europe has become pacifistic and peaceful that only means it would have a hard time defending itself from an invasion ... 
   maybe the gloomy cunt feels the need to consolidate his power in russia even more ? 
  nobody really knows how strong is putin 's hold on power . 
  everyone seems to forget , that he did n't just come out of nowhere and took the power from yeltzin . 
  putin was * assigned * by the same people , who forced yeltzin to step down . 
  of course it 's possible , vladimir already took care of the people who brought him to power and remained the only one on this internal russian battlefield with absolutely no group to challenge him ever , but i would be surprised if that was the case . 
   if you do n't like a goverment the most democratic way of changing it is assaulting the parliament sometimes it is . 
  like , when the government wants to effectively ban demonstrations . 
  which , interestingly , is exactly what happened in ukraine and escalated maidan which ended with ousting yanukovych . 
  i wonder if spain is going the same route ... 
   do you want people to take photos of you while you work and post them to god knows where with god knows what comments attached ?

  i suppose majority of belarusians share your view ? 
  well , opinion on su is one thing , but there 's also cultural and political shift . 
  people are more liberal economically , domination of english in advertisements , big american influence , etc. 
  these two sentences are n't exclusive . 
  i would n't call this mentality `` soviet '' because i could n't define such term properly . 
  what i meant that while most ex-commie countries have changed their mentalities ( ddr , poland , czechoslovakia , baltics , romania etc. ), 
  belarusians i 've talked with could be taken straight from the eighties . 
  can i ask you a question ? 
  do you think there is such * ethnicity * as belarusians ? 
  southern one . 
  still more kilometres than yours . 
  at least lithuania have some history due not being artificial state like belgium . 
  but they also murder people . 
  of course they do n't .

  if i would be in the germany and a clerk will use ` raus ' word - what should i do ? 
  go away as quickly as possible ? 
  what is the best strategy ? 
  i know german language only from movies ... 
  but using ` raus ' word by clerks is considered as rude or is it normal behaviour and is acceptable for germans ? 
  as far as i remember i did read that some of the magazines issued in sweden during ` sex revolution ' are now considered as cp and can not be viewed in libraries . 
  is that true ?

  getting money from eu is a hard and painful process . 
  you need to make a lot of business plans , applications , requests , bank loans , visiting many clerks and places to get some money . 
  i think that this question should be addressed for romanian government and institutions . 
  imho poland has bigger population than other countries .

  poland . 
  i do not know what is taught now , but i was learning about : 1 . 
  common king [ sigismund iii vasa ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sigismund_iii_vasa ) that moved capital of poland from krakow to warszawa . 
  his election started the mess with swedes .

  swedish deluge http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/deluge_ ( history ) that started falling of rzeczpospolita . 
  thanks - however i knew that . 
  my question was about something else . 
  priestly found some gas that he gave a name to it , but he did not know that it is element . 
  my question was how can one say that a substance is element or chemical compound . 
  for example - you have salt ( nacl ) and sulphur ( s ) . 
  both are powders . 
  using old equipment say which one is compund and which one is element . 
  or you have co2 and oxygen - which is which ? 
  anyone knows how was observed whether a substance is an element ? 
  for example , how to tell if a powder is an element or chemical compound with the eighteenth century instruments ? 
  it seems that outside of music , former yugoslavia nations also differ in the appearance of faces . 
  sounds like an attempt to defend a monopoly on suffering . 
  ` equal representation ' in the criterion of race , age , gender , and sexual orientation . 
  probably these are the countries that stefan have visited . 
  never heard - sorry . 
  and it is not studied in the primary and secondary schools . 
  history is not strict science and will never do - every country has it 's own version . 
  i like this one : [ lulaj\u017ce jezuniu ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9pw0t10mhc ), 
  i 'm from pomerania and never heard of it .

  by the way there is ( was ? ), 
  a project of constructed international auxiliary language - www.slovio.com - ` the international simplified slavic language , as simple as esperanto but understood by some 400 million people around the world . 
  this makes slovio one of the most widely understood languages around the world . ', 
  here you have sample : http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=yxczl8koyqe for me it is not easily understood , 
  we have many words that are similar to russians , but there is some exceptions that sounds the same but have different meaning . 
  for example polish ` kawior w puszce ' ( ` caviar in a can ' ) means ` carpet in a cannon ' in russian .

  swedes are not at the top . 
  could you explain why norwegians leads in democracy ? 
  this is my personal opinion : long time ago my grandparents had a house in the village . 
  they had two neighbours : hans and ivan . 
  hans was on the west border and ivan on the east border . 
  both were aggressive and wanted to expand their farms . 
  one and other was trying to convince my grandpa to join them and attack the other one .

  but you ca n't define a dictatorship that way . 
  because the nazis had laws for everything they did and they followed those laws . 
  you need far more for a dictatorship than `` government and judges get into a bitch fight '' . 
  as long as there 's still personal freedoms and the normal judicative works for the citizens as it is expected to i 'm not going to call poland a dictatorship . 
  even your `` what 's not ultra left is literally hitler '' point of view wo n't change that . 
  so they got carte blanche to choose where in the world they want to live ? 
  man , that refugee thing sounds better every day . 
  and that 's why the refugee convention needs to be reworked . 
  it was written in a time where there were no extensive welfare states and people did n't move from country to country to mooch off social systems . 
  it was written with the case of `` what happens if germany and france go to war again '' in mind . 
  not `` what happens if merkel says ` welcome ' and half north africa decides it 's better to live off social welfare in germany than to work in africa '' . 
  oh , yeah , that position that allowed po-lead poland to stay involved in the ukraine process ? 
  or the one where the germans listened to our concerns regarding nordstream . 
  ah maybe it 's the one with the anti-missile shield ? 
  or the one where we get visa-free entry to the us because we joined every us led punitive expedition into the middle east ? 
  hate to be that guy but poland 's international position has been shit since the golden liberty . 
  government does n't need to show me bugbears in this case . 
  it always was a propaganda tube . 
  only difference is that you did n't notice it that much because the news fit into your personal narrative . 
  threats are a great way to achieve something . 
  oh wait ... they 're not . 
  someone please tell that to germany 's diplomat corps . 
  if you fail they call you `` virgin '' in the paradise :3, 
  most wo n't really care because they 're not from syria . 
  guys , i do n't speak arabic . 
  can you discuss in english please ? 
  so they cross through the balkans because they are of course unsafe . 
  then enter austria and leave it because it 's still unsafe . 
  some of them stay in germany but many find it not safe enough either and go to denmark , norway , sweden and finland . 
  and because even that is not safe enough a few decide to go back to iraq ... 
  very interesting refugee movements we have here . 
  the current concept of refugee stems from the past wwii years when the refugee convention was brought to life . 
  it 's not really applicable to the people who are coming to europe now as they mostly want to immigrate permanently . 
  axis denied !, 
  as long as it spares us from taking in isis terrorists i do n't really care about how russia-like we 're being perceived by gender fluid liberal westerners . 
   is not what it used to be . 
  why ? 
  it 's still pro government . 
  only the government has changed :3, 
   and finding pis dangerously incompetent and that 's why i 'm pretty certain that they wo n't cause too much damage . 
  spoken like a true ant . 
  it 's amazing how people from ant-like societies simply ca n't understand the free market . 
  the answer is always some regulation or law patronizing citizens because people are obviously too dumb to choose for themselves , 
   otherwise the organisation may as well not exist . 
  that 's the point . 
  western leaders might choose to sacrifice nato and not to intervene in a conflict in the baltics because `` who wants to go to war for talinn '' ? 
  because that 's what nato is about - slavic dominance rituals . 
    the chances of this are extremely low . 
  some ukrainian guy 2012 . 
   paranoia does wonders . 
  gee , thanks for the remote analysis , dr. freud . 
  did the kremlin pay for your education ? 
  i mean it 's funny that the only topic you comment on reddit is when it 's about russia and nato , 
  said he sitting in his comfy chair in berlin hundreds of miles from any possible border issue , 
   and yet most europe has almost no ability to send help to the east \\ + they block any efforts of establishing nato bases in the east ( possibly not to anger russia ), 
   nato is obliged to defend all allies . 
  in case of an out right attack . 
  but if you have `` ethnic russians in estonia demanding independence '' it 's not an attack . 
  it 's an estonian inner issue . 
  russia would deny any involvement but warn western powers not to intervene as they will protect the russians in estonia in that case . 
  means the ball is in the court of western politicians who have now to decide if they treat is as an inner-estionan issue or risk starting war with russia over `` those few separatists '' . 
  the dangerous scenario is not that putin will attack nato head on with tanks n shit . 
  it 's rather that `` green men '' scenario in the baltics . 
  plausible deniability + `` if you intervene we will have to protect our minorities '' . 
  suddenly western politicians will have to decide if they want war or would rather accept some split off `` republics '' in east estonia . 
  and i can imagine how they would decide ... 
   they seem to be traditional cleptocrats that simply use nationalism as a tool to control others . 
   let 's hope you 're right . 
  and let 's hope putin elects a competent kleptocrat as his successor . 
  that actually would be a feasible deterrent . 
  putin could speculate that `` no one would launch nukes for estonia or even poland '' . 
  but once you give those countries nukes the deterrent becomes real . 
  i 'm very confident that poland would launch all its nukes the moment a russian division would cross the border . 
   it is kinda strange that russia is provoked when people are nice to them . 
  not provoked . 
  but from dealing with russians i learned that they regard you as weak when you are nice to them . 
  you have to be borderline rude for them to respect you . 
  it 's fucking annoying as i 'm usually a rather nice person and hate being rude - but with russians you have to be or they will just ignore anything you say . 
   what people need to read . 
  maybe let everyone decide for themselves what they need to read ? 
   state aid - without political ties that exists :3  regardless , people want shit , people eat shit up like flies . 
  it 's their choice . 
  if you want to tell people what to want join the communist party . 
  the press is free to write what they want . 
  but if they are producing shit no one wants to pay them for they should n't be surprised when their business ventures fail . 
  i do n't know man . 
  if i were them i would have looked for a different job/business long time ago . 
   someone 's got ta pay for that . 
  no one `` got ta '' pay for that . 
  the publishers of the newspapers just think people might pay for that if they find it interesting enough . 
  so they paid the journalists to do the work and now hope they will recoup their investment + make a profit . 
  it 's really business 101 . 
  yes . 
  and that 's why that eu directive is bullshit . 
  let the customers and businesses sort it our for themselves . 
  but it 's the eu so they will do it nonetheless . 
   quality journalism where ? 
  yes . 
  imagine your sink is clogged up and you call a plumber . 
  the plumber says : `` well , plumbing is hard .

only to invade and fight with all of its neighbors following pilsudski vision of `` felt the time was right to expand polish borders as far east as feasible , to be followed by a polish-led intermarium federation of east-central european states as a bulwark against the re-emergence of german and russian imperialisms '' poland attacked all of its neighbors ? 
  i can only think of minor conflicts for polish parts of lithuania/ukraine . 
  pilsudski 's idea was n't the reason of this war and polish government did n't even like the idea of intermarium so they did n't take whole belarus and kiev when signing the treaty of riga ( russians were n't against it , it was polish officials ' choice ) . 
  btw intermarium was n't a bad idea , it could have prevented the ww2 ( this wiki fragment even mentions it ) . 
   how was ukrainians and lithuanians treated in `` greater poland '' at the time and prior to that during commonwealth ? 
  ukrainian peasants were treated the same way as polish peasants in western poland during the times of commonwealth . 
  lithuanians had their own duchy during commonwealth and there were n't many of them in poland after ww1 . 
  i can ask how the life of ukrainians looked on the russian side after ww1 ? 
  your country took eastern parts of poland during partitions and then after the ww1 you complain that poland wanted to create little empire ? 
  then why russia took this land earlier ? 
  even after 123 years there were more poles than russians in this area . 
  that exact fragment from the wikipedia proves that you 're wrong :d `` polish forces ( . . ) awaited expected support and relief from france and the united kingdom '' - two or three days before the expected aid from france and the united kingdom russia attacked poland so polish army could n't get this aid . 
  if russia had n't attacked poland from the east poland would defend longer with the western help . 
  i noticed more bullshit in your first post :  russia did not even enter poland until germany had crossed the polish boarder an started invading russia !, 
  what ? 
  germany started invading russia in 1941 and russia invaded poland in 1939 ...  previously to ww2 and the 1917 russian revolution . 
  the parts of poland that were invaded by the soviets , were actually part of the russian empire . 
  previously to the 1917 russian revolution there was no poland so by your logic if russia had got warsaw too instead of germans , you would write that warsaw was also in russia before russian revolution so it 's ok .  also , in my `` western education '' the previous war in the 1930 's with russia and the polish is never mentioned in the ww2 history pages . 
  there was no war between russia and poland in the 1930 's . 
  i think you mean the early 1920 's . 
   the ussr and polnad had a big war previously to ww2 and i think russia just wanted it 's land back . 
  stalin could not belive that germany had invaded russia . 
  he refused to believe the early reports of the germans invading russia . 
  this land was longer under polish-lithuanian rule ( before partitions ) than russian . 
  the fact in your second sentence is true but again you are clearly mixing 1939 with 1941 :d  on another note , i ; m not a nazi sympathzier , but i don ; t belive 6mil jews were killed . 
  i think the real number was 3mil . 
  oh , i see that you are the real history expert . 
   in my opinion hitler also wanted `` some colonies '' . 
  so i belive that may have been one of his reasons for war . 
  no shit !, 
  have you heard about the lebensraum ? 
   i bet they do n't tell you that in your western education !, 
  as you can see your post is great example of glorious soviet education which omits important facts and exaggerate the unimportant ones . 
  oh and i admire that you write so long post knowing so little about history . 
  i had about 34 students in my middle school and high school class . 
  and this school is in the top 20 school ranking in poland ... 
  the root cause for the difference is n't the resettlement . 
  the areas in the western part of poland ( that were polish pre ww2 ) like pozna\u0144 or that corridor were n't in most part forcibly repopulated after ww2 . 
  you just ca n't compare 20 years of the second polish republic before ww2 with 123 years of differences between german vs russian/austrian rule . 
  many people from the former polish lands ( pre ww2 ) lived in cities like lviv which was the center of the polish science with the best universities in poland so they were n't all from the rural area - uneducated , poor and conservative . 
  the rural part of kresy was inhabited mostly by ukrainians . 
  i was in the class with the german profile in the middle school . 
  we had about 8 lessons of german per week with 3 different teachers ( including lessons with german native speaker ) . 
  after these 3 years i knew german quite well but now after high school and few years in university i do n't remember most of it : / almost every school offers german ( you have to learn two languages starting with the high school so most students start learning german at this time ) . 
  some students have german in the elementary and middle school so they do n't start learning english until the high school . 
  french , russian or spanish are rarely taught , at least in the area where i live . 
  i do n't understand why ukrainians glorify bandera and upa - even without them stalin would have resettled all the poles from the ukrainian ssr without the whole massacre . 
  ukrainians murdered innocent poles from the villages and it gave them nothing , even worse - many ukrainians died because of counter attacks . 
  no , you 're wrong . 
  this match had to be played in kyiv because the city of kharkiv is in the dangerous area . 
  originally the match was planned in lviv but they changed plans so there were n't many fans at the stadium . 
  lech and legia have probably the most fans in poland so it 's not surprising that there might be some idiots among them . 
  worst in europe ? 
  hahaha no . 
  btw the photo you linked is not from legia match - it 's lech poznan fans ' banner . 
  not only southern , i did n't notice that `` porost '' is also similar to polish `` prosty '' which also means `` simple '' as in the link you posted . 
  porost means lichen or phenomenon of growing/sprouting vegetables in polish so i think it can be a borrowed word . 
  many slavic languages have this strange rule for counting . 
  in polish , euro is both singular and plural - [ pronunciation . 
  ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cb/pl-euro.ogg#pl ) it 's one of a few foreign origin nouns that remain non-declinable in any cases . 
  poland : singular : euro ( [ pronunciation ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cb/pl-euro.ogg#pl ) ) , cent ( [ pronunciation ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/59/pl-cent.ogg ) ) plural : euro , centy ( 2 - 4 ) , cent\u00f3w ( 5 - inf ), 
  no , that 's because they are afraid that there might be a policeman who is hiding somewhere . 
  if the road is empty why would they think about the cars ? 
  yeah , i often see that people wait for the green light even when the road is completely empty :d, 
   but most are put off by the language so they 're expecting that they will have to know polish ? 
  so why are n't they put off by french and german when visiting france and germany ? 
  this is a pointless reason . 
  most sattelite receivers have option to choose the original soundtrack and subtitles . 
  `` brz '' like `` bzh '' and `` czi '' like `` chee '' ( but like i said `` czy '' in this surname in pronounced slightly differently : ch + `` i '' sound from english `` bit '' ) . 
  oh so now i know why people think polish is full of consonants - `` y '' in polish is a vowel ( sounds like `` i '' in `` bit '' or `` hit '' ) . 
  no , i think he wrote it correctly . 
  there is n't such a word as `` pollish '' , 
  haha funny name - in polish bilecik means little ticket ( diminutive form of bilet ) . 
  maybe he meant the cbos polls which always overestimates po . 
  i 'm curious what 's so special about it ? 
  replace w with v and you have generic slavic language . 
  at least polish can be easily recognized from the other slavic texts ( there are no v letters ) , 
  it is the same thing : http://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/babie_lato_%28meteorologia%29, 
  really ? 
  it was mentioned in polish media many times and there was even an interview with his family members . 
  it was august 2013 so maybe you were on holidays ? 
  btw does living in warsaw improve access to the news in media ? 
  i do n't want to take lwow and wilno but why should poland give up cities that used to be in germany ? 
  germany started this war and taking prussia land has nothing to do with losing eastern poland . 
  south western poland ( with present borders ) was in prussia and south eastern part of poland , which was the only part that was in austria-hungary , was one of the poorest regions of the whole pre-partition area of poland ( you can even see it today - your second map ) . 
  if it was too religious he would n't be fired ... 
  i 'm from radom and i do n't remember large amount of `` bizarre crimes or other weird events '' happening here . 
  for a few years it 's a very calm city . 
  the problem is when something like this happens everybody exaggerates it and says `` radom again '' . 
  comparing radom to the other two cities it lost less inhabitants in the last 20 years . 
  maybe that 's because it 's close to warsaw so many people work there but live in radom . 
  this is also the reason why people in warsaw do n't like radom - we took their jobs . 
  it 's j\u00f3zef pi\u0142su ** ds ** ki not pi\u0142sudzki ... 
  from wiki : `` in 1575 , henry iii of france ( then king of poland ) , was introduced to new technologies of septic facilities , in which litter ( excrement ) was taken outside the castle walls . 
  on returning to france , henry ordered the construction of such facilities at the louvre and other palaces . 
  other inventions introduced to the french by the polish included a bath with regulated hot and cold water . '', 
  in what part of poland do you live if you have 12c in the middle of a day and all june below 18c ? 
   instead , there 's catechism , which is taught by clergy . 
  i was never taught by clergy in primary , middle or high school . 
  there was always a catechist ( theologian ) .

   private companies are inherently inefficient because they aim for profit maximization . 
  a state-run service , theoretically , only has to break even and will therefor for structural reasons always have the potential to be cheaper and more efficient than a private service . 
  that 's just one aspect . 
  sure , if that was the only factor then you would be right . 
   most people , except the most zealous of free market fundamentalists of which the thread in question had a few , realises that water should be a right and not a commodity subject to profit maximization . 
  see , that 's exactly what mean . 
  this is a false dichotomy and completely the wrong way to frame the problem . 
  water being a right means nobody can be * actively denied * access to it , not that access to it should be free because there is no such thing as free . 
  you pay for it one or the other . 
  so the real question is , what 's the most efficient way to provide it at the best quality ? 
  whether or not somebody makes profit on it is a red herring . 
  it stems from a zero-sum game fallacy : the idea that if someone is making a profit , it means people are getting screwed . 
  in reality , it 's possible for all parties to benefit . 
  so it may very well be that the solution that ensures cheapest water for most people involves a for-profit provider . 
  so on , so forth . 
  as i said , your post just exemplifies my point . 
  most economic discussions in / r/europe are framed in such a manner that in my every post , before getting to my actual point , i would basically have to give a thousand-word condensed introduction to free-market economics to straighten out all the misconceptions and fallacies . 
   support neoliberal policy . 
  hardly . 
  see the yesterday 's thread about water infrastructure , as a pretty representative example . 
  as a neoliberal , i 'm often reluctant to post in economy-related threads because of the prevailing sentiment of the discussion . 
   firstly i think it is an internal russian issue . 
  obviously not , given the suit was accepted by the permanent court of arbitration and , as far as i know , even the russian government did n't question its eligibility . 
  also , the russian internal justice system is n't exactly known for its independence and objectivity , so it is definitely in the interest of fairness that the case was judged by the pca . 
   amazing how people are happy to champion the cause of oligarchs , just as long as it sticks it to putin . 
  or maybe they just support the rule of law ? 
  you are advocating for the exact reverse - championing the corrupt and undemocratic actions of putin as long as it sticks it to oligarchs . 
  what the hell are you talking about ? 
  the judgement did n't concern moral integrity of the sides , it was about the legality of russian government 's actions in regard to confiscation of private assets . 
  you think courts should make judgements ad hominem ? 
  i 'm sorry but that 's just objectively wrong . 
  any self-respecting economist will tell you it 's nonsense . 
  it 's a textbook zero-sum game fallacy . 
  it always baffles me . 
  creationists , for example , are commonly ( and rightly ) acknowledged to be irrational and anti-science . 
  but when it comes to economics , you can freely make uninformed statements that fly in the face of the scientific consensus and reveal lack of basic understanding of the discipline , and nobody bats an eyelash . 
  the mechanism is the same - people thinking through their sentiments instead of rationally . 
  in addition , the perception of economics not being `` an exact science '' makes people think they can say whatever the hell they want . 
  it 's a lot worse than creationism , actually , because rejecting evolution is just an academic issue - economic ignorance has very real impact on public policy and on our lives . 
  i completely agree . 
  but it 's really beside my point , which is that we should n't shut down discussion by downvoting controversial opinions . 
  / r/europe : where not only you ca n't have a dissenting opinion , even admitting you understand another point of view will get you downvoted, 
   how do you mean ? 
  its not a moral opinion . 
  it was because of religious reasons . 
  he believed it to be morally wrong , it 's the definition of a moral opinion . 
  moral opinions can be based on religious values , you know . 
  sure , but it 's still a small minority , which is why `` everyone else '' was wrong . 
   i think a minor increase in unemployment and the loss of very unproductive jobs is a fair price for increased earnings for everyone else . 
  what do you mean by everyone else ? 
  only a couple percent of workers earn the minimum wage . 
   the liberalists who are against higher wages for the working poor nobody is against this , that 's a complete strawmen . 
  what plenty of people * do * say is that wages should grow in accordance with the market , because artificial price floor ( which is what the minimum wage is ) decreases demand and therefore increases unemployment . 
  * that * is the argument . 
   you 're just being a petite bourgeoisie apologist holy shit . 
  either i suddenly jumped to the mid 19th century or there are still people saying stuff like this non-ironically in 2014 . 
  do n't know which one would be more amazing . 
   you could make that argument with any eu regulation . 
  with many things there is inherent value in consistency . 
  for example , unified food quality standards make it easier for businesses to operate across borders and are key to the common market . 
  i think we have found the underlying reason for our disagreement . 
  you agree that we should weigh restrictions relative to importance of various rights , so you must agree that some rights and some aspects of human condition are more important than others . 
  yet you disagree that the ability to practice one 's religion come before a lot of other stuff . 
  this means you simply do n't see religion as important . 
  it 's a common theme among atheists . 
  they are just unable to understand the nature of the religious experience and they do n't appreciate just how important faith is to religious people . 
  they see religion as just another activity , ideology , state of mind , whatever . 
  i would say that 's objectively wrong . 
  it 's not only incorrect from a scientific point of view as i 'm sure any anthropologist would tell you , but it also represents a lack of empathy . 
  religious faith * is * a special part of the human condition , just as e.g. 
  gender is . 
  i think you 're looking at this too simplistically . 
  in practice , laws and restrictions are often based on tradeoffs , weighing conflicting rights of different groups . 
  to take a trivial example , in my area there 's constant fighting between bars and clubs on one side , and residents on the other . 
  where do you draw the line between the right of club owners to run their businesses , people 's desire for the city to have a vibrant cultural scene , and residents ' right to have some peace and quiet in their homes late in the evening ? 
  when enacting restrictions , you clearly have to weigh relative importance of each group 's rights . 
  what i 'm saying is there are some things that hold a special place in the person 's identity , such as gender , sexual orientation , and religion . 
  they deserve more consideration and must be given extra weight when compared against the more mundane , practical needs . 
  thus , people should be expected to tolerate a certain degree of inconvenience if it enables others to practice their religion . 
  it 's a matter of empathy and civility . 
  we 're agreed in principle . 
  my reply was provoked by this sentence of yours :  just because there 's freedom of religion , does n't mean you are or should granted any protection from law interfering with your practise religious freedom most definitely grants protection from * unjustified * laws that interfere with religious practice . 
  you might say that laws must be justified anyway , but we all know it 's not always the case , as there are all sorts of not-strictly-necessary restrictions in the public sphere . 
  usually they 're just practical nuisances and nobody cares , but if their subject has religious connotations then it understandably becomes a big deal . 
  also , things are rarely black-and-white . 
  a restriction may be technically , secularly justified but if the reason is n't very important and the restriction would severely limit people 's ability to practice , it 's probably better not to enact it . 
  so while you 're right that in principle all that matters is presence of a legitimate secular justification , in practice religion is special in a sense , simply because it matters a lot to people and plays a unique role in their lives . 
  that 's why we should take religious sensitivities in the account ( though , of course , we should n't be held hostage to them ) . 
  well , we need to be careful here . 
  laws can be implicitly targeted at certain religious practices and historically that 's how religious discrimination was often carried out . 
  the government could outlaw public gatherings in buildings which have crosses on their roofs . 
  it 's not religious discrimination , it 's just a general law !, 
  if it * happens * to interfere with christian religious practice , tough luck , right ? 
  there was no chance , given how poorly psl fares in the current polls . 
  well , neoliberalism is a broad and vague term , so it 's hard to make definitive statements once we get into concrete details like this . 
  what we can say pretty safely is neoliberals consider price controls an extreme form of intervention which can easily backfire and should therefore only be used as the last resort , if ever . 
  i have n't studied the ins and outs of the european telecommunications market , but it 's quite possible there was a less blunt way to deal with the issue . 
  neoliberalism does n't say the free market * always * works best but that it usually does , so we should n't intervene prematurely and should be very careful about potential side-effects of regulation . 
  perhaps i should start blathering `` please remind the next socialist you meet '' every time there is an example of competition causing low prices , as if socialists postulated price controls on everything . 
  just as much of a strawman and just as petty and annoying .

  65 +74 +57 = 65.33 on their chart it 's 58.66 all in all it 's fucking manipulative to use this 3 questions as indicator of eu knowledge . 
  the only question that matters is second one about parliment . 
  instead of first and last one they should ask more about eu mission , single market and budgets . 
  then suddenly results would become more flat . 
  ** edit : upon request they fixed calc .

  as source shows quite generic questions about how people ` feel ' about different eu topics . 
  [ well done ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vchreye5gzq ), 
  thanks . 
  this one is really clear and shows nicely how far we are from final results . 
   you should disabuse yourself of the idea that you decide what the country needs and does n't need . 
  points to you , i put it wrong . 
  i just agreed with him that it 's good he is not here . 
   secondly , you know nothing regarding his motivation to move . 
  for some immigrants , it 's not a choice . 
  based on his comment it was politically driven decision . 
  if it was n't , i do n't understand why he lied down that point in his comment :  good thing i do n't actually live there , but it 's still sad to see my country go to shit ... 
  but you are right , other then that i know nothing about his decision . 
  anyway i just reaffirmed his decision . 
   thirdly , making a comment on reddit does not add to any pile . 
  it hurts your feelings , sure , but that does not mean it 's making poland a shittier country . 
  here you did n't understood me . 
  we are talking about democracy . 
  in perfect case discussion should be productive . 
  saying that someone is happy ( good ) he/she does n't live here due to change of ruling party is just false . 
  they dumb down concept of a country to political slogans put in media . 
  and use all of that to reaffirm their decisions . 
  same goes to offending politicans and summarazing country vector as ` shit ' . 
  i 'm just tired of that kind of discussion . 
  which probably caused me being a little bit to harsh . 
  for that i 'm sorry . 
   all in all , your implication that he or she is a coward is the real shallow statement here . 
  more bitter than anything . 
  oh come one man . 
  where did i said he/sh is a coward ? 
  he/she probably left to provide better life for himself/family and i 'm all up for it . 
  nothing cowardly about that . 
  it requires a lot of energy and bravery to face new environment . 
  i just do n't like if people mix such decisions with politics and then compress whole thing to one :  good thing i do n't actually live there , but it 's still sad to see my country go to shit ... 
  where did i said he/she ca n't be critical ? 
  ba3d offended kaczynski , and said everything is `` going to shit '' . 
  such insightfully commentary . 
  democracy 3.0 . 
  v republic of poland . 
   good thing i do n't actually live there , but it 's still sad to see my country go to shit i just reaffirm him that we do n't need such people that on a whim decide to choose more comfortable life , and now are first to comment about how great decision they made . 
  he will be changing countries very often based on that . 
  sure , be critical , but i myself will be critical of shallow statements . 
  we are aware of how shitty pr we have currently . 
  does it mean i should just pack my things and leave ? 
  we are trying to fight it of as much as we can . 
  and if ba3d wa n'ts to help , he is welcome . 
  there will be a lot of shit to move . 
  but let 's just not add to a pile . 
   good thing i do n't actually live there i 'm glad you do n't live here as well . 
  and if you are so happy about it , focus on your new politicians . 
  i hope the ruling party in your new homeland will not change , ever . 
  i 'm not happy either about ruling party but poland is much more then politics . 
  at least to me . 
  whatever you decide , we will still love you the same . 
  that 's bad :( i though they maybe took into account working on weekends as modern slavery .

  a : they are standing in a circle . 
  on more serious note , are we that badly perceived in usa ? 
  truer words were never truer, 
  it 's getting better . 
  negative attitude dropped from 47 to 35 in one year . 
  in the same period positive attitude did rise from 15 to 28 . 
  let just hope this trend will continue . 
  fucking is the easy part . 
  for anything else , visit any of our neighbors . 
  and due to that fear , shitload of polish people decided to go to uk . 
  living in low income areas around other migrants that are very `` different people '' . 
  seems like this fear is not as powerful as will to have more comfortable life . 
  so if you are right , it will be quite easy to get rid off . 
  looking at krakow , wroclaw , poznan and warsaw , you can already see huge move toward mixed nation . 
  people will slowly get more comfortable with seeing polish + families . 
  we need that . 
  even from biological point of view . 
  we can not fuck each other till ethernity , otherwise whole `` polish bloodline '' will get weaker . 
  maybe that point will force hardcore nationalists to start embracing other cultures/nations , 
   opposing immigration plan seems to be basically fear of different people . 
  it 's not only that . 
  sure , there are groups that want to keep country ` clean ' .

  i meant euromaidan . 
  but back to your point - i 've had a funny moment last year , when we were waiting for the shooting range to clear . 
  last group was stretching their time , so the 6 of us started chatting . 
  after a short chat it turned out 5 of us were reconstructors :d it 's great at multi national tournaments , because our patriotism is usually rooted in pride , and not antagonisms . 
  and the people you fight with the hardest you then party with the hardest . 
  ukrainians have shown they 're made of steel at prague battle of the nations in 2015 . 
  and i do n't mean only that they were iirc the only team to take down russians . 
  after the tournament , there was a royal melee . 
  all the fighters divided into 2 even-ish teams . 
  as fighters got injured and too exhausted , 21 russians remained on one side , and 8 ukrainians , and 1 crazy-ass new zealander on the other . 
  for about 20 minutes . 
  now , the fights were until no fighters were standing from either team . 
  when the teams were even , russians usually lost 2-3 fighters vs the fallen 21 . 
  so you can guess how the bouts looked like with 21 pro and semi pro fighters vs 9 semi pro and amateur competitors . 
  this lasted for at least 20 minutes : stomp into the ground , form ranks , rinse and repeat . 
  one ukrainian in particular was always first to get back into a ready position , and the rest kept forming the line . 
  the stands were clapping and encouraging at first , but after a few bouts there was an eerie silence . 
  finally , the russian captain/coach formed two lines , bowed and russians yielded field . 
  in the end , russian fighters showed class , and ukrainians showed amazing heart . 
  and the fights were unusually clean - probably the only bouts russian team participated in throughout the weekend which did n't end in an ambulance ride . 
  as a sidenote - many ukrainian fighters took part in ~ ~ orange revolution ~ ~ [ euromaidan ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/euromaidan ) , and 1 was killed by a sniper ( one of 77 killed ) . 
  edit : brainfarted pretty hard , i meant euromaidan, 
  i actually like this turn of phrase , and here 's why : russia is the mekka of [ knight fighting ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/58f6sh/russia_is_producing_a_viking_movie/d907xpx ) . 
  this title electrified anyone dabbling in historical reconstruction . 
  and the fight scenes will be absolutely amazing . 
  russia has professional [ knight fighting ] ( https://youtu.be/ugkl_jvvolw ) leagues ( m1 medieval , wmcf ) , and during the equivalent of world championship - [ battle of the nations ] ( https://youtu.be/fmbabqzxose ) they usually send 3 teams , and take 1-2 podium places . 
  this movie is going to be dope !, 
  yeah , we can expect waves of greeks and spaniards to emigrate to alt-utopias of turkey and russia aaaaaaaanyyyy day now . 
  yeah , and even if they did - who cares . 
  great news , should n't have gotten into a pedantic mode over nothing . 
  this is more aimed at ie families of doctors who often stay full time in poland and send money home . 
  in other trades ( ie seamstresses ) the ukrainians who come here do n't want to be separated from their families but they 're the ones for whom travel is easier , so they have to take a lot of time off of working and earning . 
  now their families will be able to visit . 
  ditto for owners of ie textile factories who can go to germany , poland , denmark or italy to get in contact with textile franchises and contract work . 
  and these are just examples i know of . 
  if there 's one complaint i 've heard in poland about ukrainian workers it 's that they do n't want to stay . 
  personally you do n't see any harm in it , because it 's not an issue you ever face . 
  mr dutchman  it does remind me of how poland is consistently called eastern europe - at a certain point it ceases being plausible all those journalists , politicians and laymen never heard of central europe and it 's an honest mistake . 
  aww ... we mostly want it because [ w\u0142adek was an awesome king ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/w%c5%82adys%c5%82aw_ii_jagie%c5%82%c5%82o ) . 
  full disclousure , our politicians are still arrogant power hungry dickwads . 
  but maybe we can pull czechia into the mix ? 
  their guys seem to have their shot together . 
  and how do you know this for a fact ? 
  for now , ukrainian workers are known for doing what poles claimed they would - they come to earn some money and go back to ukraine . 
  at least that 's the case in textiles and construction in poland . 
  medical doctors on the other hand stay here for longer and send money home . 
  there 's definitely a huge risk of what you 've mentioned , but you might be underestimating ukrainians . 
  would n't mind if they stayed tbh , but at least for now and in fields i have access to - they just want to get an education or some startup money and go back home to their families . 
  sort of - media and laymen often use these innacurate shorthand terms , and that _ maybe _ there 's no need to get our collective panties in a bunch . 
  maybe the most obvious example of this is how term yanks is used in us vs rest of the world . 
  yeah , well lets get back to it when brits learn what central europe is . 
  i absolutely referred to irish and scots as british if i meant to mention people from british isles but not from 1 particular nation . 
  and i recall the jokes top gear made in tgt - about how when non-english make an invention or are succesfull , suddenly they 're british . 
  good example , false premise . 
  noooo , croatia is , um ugly !, 
  and hot !, 
  unless you like snorkeling , playing with crabs , diving in sea without sand in every orifice , or possibly mountain hiking or wandering around venetia / westeros like cities and villages , there 's nothing to do there !, 
  unless you like jazz festivals , then i guess you can visit groznjan . 
  or would like to see medieval festivals , but that 's waaay off in koprivnica . 
  and what are you gon na eat ? 
  calmari and istrian pizza ? 
  dammit , i wan na go to croatia again :(, 
  from us through britain and belgium to poland , bigots being loudmouths show that at least stupidity transcends nations . 
  pretty sure people more and more often file this sort of shit as `` eh , right wingers looking for a fight as usual '' rather than putting it on a specific nation . 
  or maybe it 's just my own projections and wishful thinking . 
  to a varying degree we 've all got some shit to work through in our public discourse . 
  i guess norwegians and czechs and estonians get to be judgy , but they 've had that going for them for a while . 
  ... yes ? 
  no refunds . 
  for what it 's worth , polish writers and historians are deeply aware of that . 
  hell , our national epic begins with ogniem i mieczem , which shows khmelnitsky uprising as a matter of another nation fighting for freedom . 
  and for whatever good anecdotes will do , my history yeacher who was a fiery dmowski apologist also stressed the moments in our history ( ie fighting spanish insurgency along napoleon ) when we were fucking up . 
  btw - can i ask what your background is ? 
  i read a bunch of your comments in this thread and you seem to have a far better grasp on finer details of polish-ukrainian relations than i 'd expect from a layman from another country . 
  if you 're ukrainian , what 's taught about dmowski in your schools ? 
  opposition to nordstream started with previous government because it is obvious not that putin _ would _ use it against poland and ukraine - russia does it consistently . 
  but putting a wedge between uk and eu , weakening position of poland by beck-ish posturing detached from reality ( ie the posturing before rome - as party secretary kaczy\u0144ski was visiting uk , our puppet minister szyd\u0142o ( who 's not even the first to know when kaczy\u0144ski fires her ministers ) was `` demanding '' a number of items which at the time were for more than a week in the final draft of the document . 
  they are also dismantling our military - for context , ever since afghanistan and iraq , our right wing and military-spec media were lauding our involvement because it meant experienced military . 
  now that our generals are leaving en masse , and their places are taken by politically appointed ex-retailers pis pretends there 's no issue . 
  they will fund ridiculous national guard when our career soldiers do n't have enough ammo for live-round and dynamic exercises . 
  opposition to nordstream is something started by po , although if pis was at the steer they 'd have done so then as well , it 's obvious to anyone but germans how dangerous it is to security of europe . 
  but there 's more to international and internal security than this issue they managed to get right . 
  he may not be openly and knowingly siding with putin , but either by hubris or stupidity he and pis keep furthering putins agenda as outlined in dugins foundations of geopolitics . 
  because crimean tatars do n't take shit from nobody . 
  when push comes to shove they were always fighting for their freedom . 
  polish epic revolves mostly around [ khmelnytsky uprising ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/khmelnytsky_uprising ) , russians did n't wait long with declawing them asap after wwii : https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/deportation_of_the_crimean_tatars when left to their own devices , crimean tatars will buck under anyone who tries to subdue them . 
  seriously . 
  i read the headline and thought `` well duh '' . 
  was quite surprised they accuse it of being _ anti _ brexit . 
  my impression was that it kept parroting whatever gov days , even if some authors do so without much effort to sell it . 
  i guess their beef is the same as most right-wingers - they 're angry someone who spends their life researching and writing about politics ends up with opinions of their own . 
  and that they are not always the same views as theirs . 
  to which the non biased alternative is truth vehicles like daily mail , braitbart , info wars etc. 
  well yeah - since when they wanted to change their system , warsav pact nterwened - sadly with ie polish forces . 
  most poles are happy with eu , there 's more euroenthusiasm here than ie in germany . 
  pis on the other hand benefits from picking fights and distracting from their shitty governance by showing outside danger . 
  like most other right wing parties , pis needs a steady supply of opponents to fight . 
  hence the constant if half-hearthed fights with eu . 
  and why enlisting eu help in fighting constitual tribunal changes was about the dumbest thing opposition could 've done . 
  that said , she 's just a puppet .

/ r/europe has a boner for most countries to be honest , which is kinda nice . 
  no party would if they did n't have to , to be honest . 
   spent too much time on animation and not enough time showing you ** the reality ** . 
  like typical pole complaining on the internet ? 
  jokes aside , it 's a good spot . 
  it 's just one of many actions taken by polish mfa ( and other people ) to promote the country . 
  and it 's doing a good job . 
  it shows three iconic places in poland ( giewont mountain , krak\u00f3w and baltic arena ) and adds some historical tidbit that foreigners may want to look up . 
  it 's also really well-made and shows poland as a modern nation . 
  no reason to not like it , really . 
  [ or you know ... ] ( http://swiatmakrodotcom.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/278.jpg ), 
  fighting against gender is just an example of a thing that these people like to bring up . 
  basically it always have to do something with religion , homosexuality etc. 
  - things that everybody have an opinion about , unlike economy and other stuff that require actual knowledge . 
  even if this opinion is terribly uneducated and backward . 
  the gender itself is a societal construct that is , in actuality , about as useless and restrictive as race ( taken from an urban dictionary ) . 
  you can read about it on the [ wikipedia ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gender ) . 
  basically the gender movement is about changing traditional social roles attributed to men and women . 
  i do n't think that you can even call it a movement . 
  anyway , in poland it is automatically equated to the breakdown of the traditional family model , communism and basically satan . 
  the whole discussion is really about nothing and most of the people do n't know even know what they 're arguing about . 
  i 'm pretty sure that \u017buk will win , but pis having a majority in city council is a possibility ( according to surveys ) . 
  and they would block his every move . 
  it can be really frustrating to live on the east of the country . 
  i 'm not talking about it being underdeveloped ( because that 's not that big of an issue now ) , but about people voting . 
  i live in lublin , the biggest city on the east . 
  4 years ago we elected a president who turned out to be the best president we ever had ( post 89 ' ) and he did more in the 4 years he had than his predecessors in 12 years . 
  he 's from po . 
  while i may not be a fan of po on the national level , they 're helping the president to change the city , alongside with a few councillors who were willing to leave pis to help the president . 
  why , you ask ? 
  because when you 're in pis you are not allowed to vote with po , like , never . 
  our local pis is even worse . 
  they 're a bunch of uneducated , unsuccessful bigots , who are always against everything that the president is doing . 
  for them everything is always too small or too big , too wide or too narrow ... and yet all they 've been doing is renaming street or fighting against gender . 
  basically the worst kind of opposition . 
  you want to know why i 'm writing all of this ? 
  that 's because according to latest survey pis is going to win the elections to the city council ... old people do n't care about new roads , they do n't need a stadium or olimpic swimming pool . 
  they 're gon na vote for whoever a priest in the church is telling them to . 
  and those priests obviously want them to vote for pis , because they 're representing them . 
  it will be like that till they all die . 
  and i may be a bad person , but i ca n't wait . 
  i saw him in the stands during milan 's game yesterday . 
  it is way harder . 
  maybe because it 's so damn funny for us . 
  do we ? 
  i once overheard a group of people talking and it took me a few minutes to realize that they were talking in slovak , not some weird polish . 
  i basically understood everything , but there was something weird about the language . 
  seriously , never heard of it ... 
  dislike ! = hate . 
  i do n't have anything against belarusians , but lukashenko & co. are really bringing them down . 
  maybe i should n't have put belarus in the same category as russia , but i sadly do n't find any reasons to like the country right now . 
  it 's my opinion , it will probably change over time , especially if i get to interact with someone from there and generally got to know the country . 
  plus , there is this whole [ upb thing ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/union_of_poles_in_belarus ) . 
  [ it would be like that . 
  ] ( http://i.imgur.com/hkrmb7l.png ) i actually like slovenia though , just kinda forgot about it . 
  i would really like to love italy and hungary , but there are all those political reasons . 
  we also have maany cultural ties with lithuania , but they can be kinda hard on poles living there so only light green for them . 
  russia , belarus , czech republic and slovakia are pretty clear i think . 
  i also have an educational hard-on for finland . 
  i 've started drinking when i was 15 or 16 , so by the age of 18 or 19 i was quite a responsible drinker already . 
  it does n't really matter when you start imo . 
  you have to learn how your body handles alcohol and get embarrassingly drunk a few to times to realize what it 's all about . 
  higher drinking age only means more young people drinking illegally , as teenagers do n't give a crap anyway . 
  greece , seriously ? 
  they 'd be dead by now if not for the money eu has been pumping into them recently . 
  this obviously is n't merkel 's fault , but i ca n't help but feel that somebody was unable to see the bigger picture when making this deal . 
  russia was n't as retarded as they 're now , but they were always meddling with central/eastern european countries . 
  but then there is [ this ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nord_stream ) . 
  i know that every country should worry about itself first , but this is something that really hurts me as a pole . 
  the idea of nord stream is clearly influenced by politics , but germany really did n't care about anything else than economics with this one . 
  this pipeline is gon na cause lots of problems in the future . 
  according to this we have a higher standard of living than italy , france or japan ? 
  i 'm sorry but this is some weird data . 
  stereotypical polish college student will drink everything handed to him . 
  special mention to [ this ] ( http://img821.imageshack.us/img821/9905/001ojj.jpg ) . 
  we do n't like russians , maybe to some extent french and germans ( history , but seriously nothing serious anymore ) . 
  most people are divided when it comes to uk and usa . 
  some people think that romanians = gypsies . 
  common misconceptions , same stuff as everywhere . 
  i would say that we especially like czechs , slovaks , hungarians and croats . 
  i do n't think there is a general opinion about countries like spain , italy , portugal , austria , switzerland so i would say we like them by default . 
  let 's not act as if we do n't have a slight mentality problem though . 
  for many people it 's still acceptable to not pay for something as long as there is a certainty that they wo n't be caught . 
  tickets and stuff , you know what i 'm talking about . 
  i spent some time in the country lately and i 've learned that stealing raspberries or apples directly from the tree is a thing . 
  it 's nothing big , but there still are many people in rural areas who would rather steal those than work . 
  we are definitely not a nation of thieves , but communism has affected us on every possible level . 
  we still need some time to caught up to standards present in the netherlands or scandinavia . 
   - we do n't often drink alcohol , or not as much as russia , denmark , finland do . 
  not true . 
  everybody is drunk all the time , at least in my circles . 
  or just `` kebab '' . 
   germans best friends ? 
  maybe on a political level ( before hollande ) is there anyone that you actually like ? 
  i guess wallonia . 
  in polish it would be pretty much the same - `` na zdrowie '' . 
  never heard anything & bia\u0142ystok is actually pretty nice city . 
  i live in eastern poland and have never met one . 
  well , radicals are n't exactly the smartest bunch . 
  they 're mostly just xenophobic , i do n't think they give much thought to why they are supposed to hate something .

  you might overestimate old people . 
  maybe in your country . 
  uhhh ... people ? 
  i do n't use cheap services provided by immigrants , if you exclude kebabs at the late night . 
  you really believe that ever bigger masses of radicalized and disenfranchised muslims will have no impact on european societies ? 
  really that 's what you believe ? 
  are you really asking for a proof that muslims are more and more radicalized , and attend saudi funded , radicalizing mosques ? 
  https://www.wzb.eu/sites/default/files/u6/koopmans_englisch_ed.pdf and no , the moroccans are not an exception :  fundamentalist attitudes are slightly less prevalent among sunni muslims with a turkish ( 45 % agreement to all three statements ) compared to a moroccan ( 50 % ) background . 
  yeah , not adhering to the principles of religion makes you less of a believer of that religion . 
  just like not going to church on sunday and eating meat on friday makes you less christian . 
  well they are , since prevalent salafism and wahhabism is more of a modern phenomenon . 
  would n't that take very much time ? 
  for example , lessons in poland take 45 minutes with 10 minute breaks , during which people dress and shower . 
  i do n't know where would you fit traveling to a different place . 
  why running is mandatory ? 
  that does n't mean it was key in this process . 
  i assumed data is counted monthly . 
  same as poland . 
  huh , was n't really aware of it . 
  [ the real aardvark ] ( https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--mo5nhhoj--/c_scale,fl_progressive,q_80,w_800/19e0b0ev5drg4jpg.jpg ), 
  how many data you have that you ran out on 2nd of december ? 
  then comes pis and fucks all the safeguards in the ass , and nobody can do anything about it . 
  you mean [ this one ] ( http://cdn29.se.smcloud.net/t/photos/477027/lech-walesa-papiez-pilsudski.jpg ), 
  why not ? 
  it 's not like they can use it effectively . 
  if they want to lose money , western countries should help them . 
  obviously . 
  but that 's what i did when i had like 1gb four years ago . 
  it 's the other way around here . 
  and in most central and eastern europe i think . 
  use apps , not browsers . 
  why would you ever choose \u0141\u00f3d\u017a ? 
  zimna w\u00f3dka - cold vodka . 
  it does not have the magic of kebab with meat of questionable origins . 
  nah , it 's kebab + at least half a litre energy drink . 
  that 's nearly unanimous opinion of whole polish nation . 
  of course , implementation varies . 
  why ? 
  we still need to suck us dick to be safe . 
  definitely more prestigious now . 
  i 'd say it 's at best secondary or tertiary topic . 
  even migrant crisis was perceived mostly as internal issue - as `` evil po goverment tries to destroy polish nation by importing millions of migrants '' . 
  nobody really cares what germany , france or uk thinks about us - only exception is us . 
  i 'd say any criticism of our involvement in iraq or afghanistan came from similiar principles : `` why waste money and manpower on that desert '' vs supporters `` we do n't fucking care what happens there , we 're doing it to suck us dick '' . 
   the consequences involve thousands of unnecessary deaths ( including many uk servicemen ) and further destabilisation of an already unpredictable middle east , leading to increased anti-western feelings and eventually to the rise of isis . 
  yeah but really people hate him for some shit that happened far away ? 
  does foreign policy really is a defining factor in uk ? 
  we 've been lied too , just nobody cares now . 
  just being lied to makes you hate that guy so much ? 
  then got reelected and won nobel prize . 
  why iraq is so remembered in uk ? 
  we went there together ( famous `` you forgot poland '' ) yet no one cares about that anymore . 
  poland biggest slav, 
  was n't london metro open in 1863 ? 
  they have to conduct polls to have exit polls results . 
  unless you want to forbid those too ... 
  so governments should [ give no fuck about it 's funding ] ( http://stooq.pl/c/?s=10ply.b&amp;c=10d&amp;t=l&amp;a=lg ) ? 
  decreased trust in government lowers investment rate . 
  no way we 'll get over 3 % with those idiots in power . 
  they just lowered the retirement age ... 
  it makes you desire competency . 
  yeah , no . 
  look at polish politicians : everyone said that anyone could do job as good as last government , than pis came . 
  but it attracts ambitious people and broaden range of people who want the job , making competition bigger . 
  you have millions of times the responsibility than average salary worker . 
   universities in the west are actually giving students and recent alumni money if they start a company in/right after university . 
  will it likely lead to disaster ? 
  yea , most likely . 
  but you know what , companies eat that up . 
  you started a company , created a proposal , tried and failed ? 
  well , shows initiative and experience , and you get one up from mihai geogescu who 's top of the class but ca n't wrap his head around doing anything that is not in a specification document . 
  someone in india can do that cheaper and just as well . 
  way to present false dilemma . 
  my friends have even won contest to create their own company , and got some funding . 
  all they got from it was half a year of pizza , and prototype of product which nobody ever would want to use . 
  most succesful companies and startups need experienced people with knowledge in their area of expertise , not newly graduated hippie hotshots . 
   friends have bad experiences . 
  the money was to good , so they went for it . 
  but those banks expect their money 's worth . 
  so you get roped into a bureaucratic office environment which tries to milk you for any excess time you have to work on whatever proprietary crap the management decided to go with . 
  there 's better tech enviroments , although if you 're willing to climb the corporate ladder likely not better money unless you sink yourself into the right start-up , which after a few years of hitting your head against that mess seems like a breeze . 
  thanks for sharing . 
   heh , i guess i was on the poorer end of the spectrum . 
  if you needed more than a pen and paper to do it , you did n't do it . 
  did go to the olympiad . 
  for me and my sister it definitely felt pushed , we 've since learned that the world is a lot more complicated than we were taught . 
  life does n't have to be shirt-tie at a microsoft subsidiary , fighting for management , which is what we could hope for in the home country . 
  it was more about not disturbing people than helping them in reality . 
  in a suitable environment people will love to learn with little help other than mentoring . 
  but i wo n't spend time learning olympic level maths if i have to spend 10 hours learning to * extremely * important biology exam . 
  so the school remedy was to remove unnecessary annoyances . 
   are you serious ? 
  you are are n't you ? 
  trust me , you do n't want to find yourself in the `` looking at listing '' end of things . 
  too much competition , and many are just there so the company can say the tried to find someone , when in fact they already picked put have to do it out of company/national rules . 
  sending emails to see if positions are available is better . 
  so is having friends tell you of gaps in the company . 
  you always get bonus points for going through unorthodox channels . 
  yes , if you stand on your head and sing company anthem you 'll probably get bonus points . 
  bottom line is that we live in a world with 7 000\u00a0000\u00a0000 people and there is not an `` unconventional '' way for every one of them .

  you have hydro , solar and wind . 
  they are not as feasible here . 
   as it is now if one party would say `` we will close the mines '' other would say `` we will keep them open '' and get all those votes . 
  current government won the elections on that promise to keep them open . 
  then closes them . 
  well , us had `` department of war '' up until 1947 , and uk had `` war office '' up to 1964 . 
  good tsar , bad boyars mentality at full force . 
  pokemon trainers . 
  did industrial revolution bring `` new '' jobs ? 
  people mined iron and coal before , people made clothes before , people made glass , paper et cetera hundreds years before . 
  the actual difference was that less people were needed to make these - not more . 
  only new jobs were directly connected to servicing and creating the machines that driven the revolution , namely steam engines and their applications - which were actually not many people . 
  the same happened later with electricity , petroleum , and lately computers . 
  they are considered `` services '' . 
  the economy progresses only if jobs are eliminated . 
  yet people work the same amount of time . 
   you missed the services available part . 
  we have vastly more choice in our food , and the food is selected much more strictly . 
  it 's not just a matter of someone eating x amount more , it 's a matter of us producing x amount more per person . 
  while having y more people . 
  where y and x together make up the difference . 
  though of course there was also a shift in who worked where . 
  in no circumstance those changes can compensate for needing 80x less worktime for same amount of goods . 
   and what is that new industry ? 
  where are the millions of new jobs actually coming from ? 
  mostly services . 
  there are working somewhere , since there are no big differences in employment rate - there are at least a magnitude smaller than differences in agriculture employment rate . 
  i do n't want that on a german paranoidal level , but yeah , sometimes it is handy . 
  yeah , nobody cares what happens on eu levels . 
   ( which is what we did , expanding our population and the services available per person ) okay , this is bullshit - average person does n't need 80 times more food than 100 years ago - maybe 1,5 times more . 
  we did n't expand food production per capita 80 times - nobody would need that food , and since food production is in private hands , nobody would produce that much . 
  we increased food production to maintain population increase and have margin , yet in no way employment in food production is being maintained . 
  it is a shadow what it was . 
  [ france ] ( http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/sl.agr.empl.zs?locations=fr ) , [ germany ] ( http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/sl.agr.empl.zs?locations=de ) , [ poland ] ( http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/sl.agr.empl.zs?locations=pl ) - everything proves that you are wrong . 
   this is what people do n't get when they compare where we are now to the industrial revolution . 
  people in industrial revolution started being employed in a completely different industry - mass production and services - and that 's what 's going to happen now , albeit on a different scale . 
  what 's the difference between going from 80 ppl to 1 doing the job and 80 ppl to 0 ? 
  if they go abroad how would you make them pay ? 
  it seems to me that this would only drive people away . 
  only thing that would work is forbidding citizens to leave the country . 
  not the best solution . 
  or having german wages ... 
  this is too drastic . 
  they have already been there and survived . 
  we can help them secure their border , not commit mutual suicide . 
  high population means more consumption , which means more people to service this needs . 
  it 's not like everyone is getting new uniform now . 
  it will probably be gradual . 
  first link from google tells me that [ poles are for nuclear energy ] ( http://innpoland.pl/114415,sondaz-58-proc-polakow-popiera-budowe-elektrowni-atomowej ) . 
  the reason nuclear has n't gotten very far is : * when the time was best for nuclear energy - 70s , early 80s - communists - gierek etc - loved coal * when they finally understood that coal is n't everything chernobyl and freedom happened * then we had absolutely no money for such costly investments * when we finally could afford nuclear power plant po stalled * now pis will probably trash whole idea . 
  i do n't think we are somehow more fearful than anyone else . 
  we 're not germans . 
  i was talking about west . 
  yeah , there 's a lot to fix about africa . 
  they have to start though . 
  cheap energy . 
  pv , solar , maybe even nuclear fusion lel . 
  that 's a fight we can not win . 
  there are deeper problems with africa . 
  and until they solve theirs technology might solve some problems here . 
  less than using them as slaves imo . 
  yeah , i fail to see what 's wrong with that . 
  well , kids can fuck . 
  what 's wrong with that . 
   this is issue with this kind of practice , it 's easy for companies to jump from country to country . 
  we are running from shitty countries though . 
  [ china ] ( http://cdn.tradingeconomics.com/charts/china-wages.png?s=chinawag&amp;v=201606141716n&amp;d1=20060101&amp;d2=20161231 ) , [ india ] ( http://cdn.tradingeconomics.com/charts/vietnam-wages.png?s=vietnamwag&amp;v=201608101914n&amp;d1=20060101&amp;d2=20161231 ) and vietnam are n't so shitty anymore , korea , japan and taiwan are first world now . 
  you have only myanmar , bangladesh et cetera now . 
  why do you connect age of consent and being a kid . 
  it would apply to crimea if citizens got actual chance to express their opinion , without russian boot . 
  and unlike uk , i do n't think 50 % +1 is enough majority to decide things that are that serious . 
  maybe 2/3 or 3/4 . 
  we are very divided , but people actually believe in what they believe . 
  i think this happens with every languages - at least it happens with polish . 
  awesome for software developers ? 
  where do you work ? 
  intel ? 
   jan hus had something going on . 
  flames ? 
  dorm which i was living in looked similiarily . 
  good times . 
  jesus fuck , this is school ? 
  it looks like some tech company hq . 
  that 's what i would like avoid . 
  yeah , barn is great . 
  though i recommend [ this ranking ] ( http://burgerblog.pl/ranking-burgerowni/ ) if you wish to find some at least equally good , lesser known place . 
  they told me it will clog . 
  maybe they are plumbers . 
  ok , i had a different experience 6 years ago . 
  and great northern war , which is often overlooked , and had the same devastating effect . 
  maybe my impression was wrong . 
  bad plumbing i guess . 
  that 's what i encountered . 
  i do n't know any plumber . 
  i guess we have good enough plumbing that we do n't need a lot of them . 
  and we can flush toilet paper , suck it lithuania , belarus , ukraine . 
  i quite love the irony there : headquarters of communist party are headquarters of warsaw stock exchange . 
  it 's not like decent buildings are destroyed to make those skyscrapers . 
  usually old commie office buildings or empty lots . 
  that does not only apply to skyscrapers .

  people need to learn ( especially brexiteers on / r/europe ) that we use terms interchangeably and it can be understood from context what europe we are talking about right now . 
  there are two britains , one geographic and one political and so are two europes . 
  `` good porn stars '' ? 
  not that i mind , but i think it better suits czech republic, 
  ca n't imagine why / s, 
  i like your spirit , although there 's not much of defending with nuclear weapon , it 's mutual annihilation, 
  thank god he did n't have a gun, 
  aleksandreczki macedonicki , he 's some greek cheesy copy :p, 
  ceremonial capital aigai too , but that does n't change the face that alex was a squatting slav, 
  someone had to, 
  for me it 's irena sendler and her alike forgotten by history, 
  huh ? 
  i always thought he was macedonian, 
  are you saying that there are places where people do n't build houses of cardboard ? 
  findland , you can not into commie brutalism , stahp, 
  easter ~ ~ poland ~ ~ ukraine new investment area in the ~ ~ europen ~ ~ new soviet union, 
  he looks goofy on that pic , reminds me of swedish king in bunny ears hat, 
  i like the drawings and all , but it 's so in white and black narrative , they want to make a hero and sell a good story rather than present actual history . 
  it 's especially visible in their series on suleyman the lawmaker . 
  so much talking about his feelings , they even managed to put there ghost of justinian . 
  i 'm not sure what audience are they targeting . 
  he did n't backed erdogan , he backed democratically elected executive . 
  obama did n't even mention erdogan by name or title . 
  ech , opinion pieces are now coming up and the coup is getting to an end, 
  they lost control over attaturk airport and the biggest military unit in istambul does n't support the coup, 
  yup, 
   they 're not worried about their control being challenged .

  are you sure op ? 
  where 's erdogan ? 
  is he still in ankara ? 
  damn , this is happening fast, 
  fucking hell , it 's official , pm confirmed coup :p, 
  i feel like coup would actually get turkey back from extremists, 
  far worse , but ok , fair enough, 
  really ? 
  just yesterday over 80 people lost their lives murdered, 
  holy shit !, 
  is this for reals guys ? 
  uugh , read once again slowly what i wrote and calm down . 
  you 're completely missing my point . 
  you asked whats an `` american thing only '' , then my answer followed . 
  seeing politics in two colours , seeing only donkeys and elephants , `` liberals '' and `` conservatives '', 
  it 's american thing only, 
  philip the 0 for english, 
  funny you say that considering that yt comment sections are occupied by right wing nutjobs and nationalists , all of whom are brexiteers allergic to fact, 
  `` we had enough of experts '' `` 350 fucktilions pounds every week '' `` 300 thousands welfare tourists from eastern eu '' `` breaking point '' `` brussels make 170 % of our laws '' `` eurocrats give hiv to english babies '' ... ok i made up this one , but is n't it something that could do well on a daily mail cover ? 
  my brain just exploded 0_0, 
  hitler was a german so is merkel , does it mean she 's a nazi ? 
  there are many shades of far right . 
  le pen as awful might be do n't preach superiority of french race , do n't call for an extermination of any ethnic group , do n't want another war on this god forsaken continent . 
   because of people with low iq , like you . 
  talk about nazism with an edgy kiddo with superiority complex, 
   hitler hitler blah blah hitler come on , find a proper argument, 
  and the award for hippie green progressive leftist of 2016 goes to ... 
  that 's simply not true . 
  by the time of greatest extent of hunnic empire , elites , people closest to attila lost their language and adopted germanic speech , even their names started to become gemanic . 
  well not german but a germanic language, 
  could you stop quoting your interlocutors ? 
  [ chant du depart ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qaqg16quv9c ) is even better . 
  france has some amaizing anthems, 
  in other news - donald trump : `` we are even smarter , stronger and more determined ! '', 
  nope , that was a regular mep, 
  is there any ? 
  huns were mostly germanic speaking at time of attila . 
  another genocide germans have to apologize for imo edit added '' - ic '', 
  that bulgarian speaking part of serbia, 
  and here i was trying to help . 
  how mean, 
  how about vardaria ? 
  western bulgaria ? 
  vardarian bulgaria ? 
  bulgarian serbia ? 
  bulgarian macedonia ? 
  norther macedonia ? 
  discount macedonia ? 
  moesia superior ? 
  i can go with this whole day long, 
   `` if everybody were like that , germany would confront poland for the revenge ethnic cleansing from 1945 to 1950 . '', 
  it 's about whitewashing history and maiking germans the victims . 
  we lost 17 % of our population , over 5 and a half milion people were butchered by germans alone , cities were razed to the ground and nation sold to stalin . 
  bragging about world war 2 casualties by germans is . 
  sheer stupidity and lack of morals of you two is unbelivable . 
  oh i see how well you acknowledge it right about now . 
  you really want to compare lost of gda\u0144ska and szczecin to deaths of milions in most inhumane ways ? 
  how can you compare those hills of corpses while braging about `` danzig '' with straight face and say that you `` acknowledge your crimes '' . 
  such an empty phrase that could be use by anyone . 
  i too can say that `` i acknowledge polish crimes '' because i belive what wikipedia says . 
  how most honourauble of me . 
  of course germans acknowledge their guilt plainly because it 's obvious and overwhelming . 
  scale of barbarity and cruelty shown by your nations was never seen before on this continent . 
  unbelievable, 
  oh , shut the fuck up now please . 
  do n't start a martyr constest with us , because you , midly speaking , did more harm to our nation than we did to yours . 
  from annexed lands alone germans expeled over 1,5 milion native polish people and you were planing to butcher 80-85 % of whole nation , germans were killing in houndreds of thousands and i have n't even get to polish jews . 
  but hey , much rapes in berlin , many kids had to clean death camps and remove mines , oh boy , how sorry im . 
  utterly ridiculous . 
   i was the future once my feels ;( let him be our pm now , plox, 
  i still ca n't belive they made this nutter a minister . 
  of all people they had to chose this mujahedin,

til , thanks !, 
   the southern and eastern epithets carry negative connotations true . 
  part of why it triggers me , obviously . 
  i was not being serious about the time zone - however i always forget that spain has cet , too . 
  i remember about germany , but by simply looking at the map of europe i expect spain to be one hour behind poland and it is n't . 
  i 'm taken by surprise every time . 
  :p on a more serious note , though . 
  in my opinion , language is one thing . 
  the countries on our eastern border do n't even use the latin alphabet and we do . 
  religion - we are both christian , but poland is strongly catholic ( currently and historically ) . 
  they were part of ussr , we never were ( we were a satellite country which is not the same ) . 
  i feel that ukrainians , russians and belarusians share more between themselves than we share with them . 
  i 'd rather feel more bond with czechs ( even though they do n't like us ? ), 
  and slovaks . 
  i consider them central european as well , where ukraine , belarus and russia is eastern europe . 
  yes , we do have similarities , but we are also different . 
  i 'd say poles are somewhere in the middle and calling us central fits this notion well . 
  again , this is about how i feel personally . 
  i am not going to convince anybody . 
  apparently ... :p, 
  ever heard about the cental european time zone ? 
  i was going to get triggered by putting poland into eastern europe , but your map is correct . 
   when i visited your country a few months ago , i felt like i was the only person who stuck to the speed limits . 
  i feel this way in my home country all the time . 
  is the same bull `` reused '' the next year ? 
  bk burgers at least somewhat resemble mcd 's false advertising , while mcd burgers look like they 've been rolled over by a road roller and had the ingredients eaten out by wild dogs . 
  there was once a school trip in majdanek ( another big death camp in poland , near lublin ) and one of the kids entered the furnace because it was fun to do ... http://wiadomosci.gazeta.pl/wiadomosci/1,130438,5683714,pamiatkowe_zdjecie_z_majdanka__nastolatka_w_piecu.html and here are swedish children playing hitler and nazis in auschwitz : http://www.dn.se/sthlm/elever-pa-elitskola-spelade-in-nazifilm-pa-resa-till-auschwitz/, 
  yeah . 
  let them live in luxury for two years , then set them on fire and kill them with pointy metal objects - but make it slow . 
  `` there is no evidence '', 
  i guess it 's a soft drink then . 
   in poland it 's stored in refrigerators in grocery stores next to milk products . 
  it seems it 's not easy to get the genuine ayran ( i.e. , made in turkey ) here , mostly knock-offs made in poland . 
  i do n't think it 's popular . 
  i guess sex on a pebble beach is better as long as you 're on top . 
   but pebbles and rocks are superior in every way if you like pain . 
  that 's what i thought before i went to croatia . 
  now i 'm in love . 
  i 've been to mallorca - sure thing those white sandy beaches are better , but i like everything else ( people , cities , atmosphere ) better in croatia . 
  i think this has to do with being a slav , i feel more like home there . 
  easier to communicate , similar behavior , etc. 
  that 's what he wants you to think . 
  i do n't like soft drinks ( sugar , bleeeh ) and that 's the only one i 'd drink . 
  i do n't know what it is doing on this map , it goes with milk products like yogurt or kefir . 
   i also saw it poland everywhere team mirinda vs team fanta , 
  are the fires out ? 
  there 's also china and north korea . 
  by the definition given here a communist state is an oxymoron , yet they call themselves that . 
  looks interesting . 
   i checked it out on youtube to see it in action . 
  thanks for sharing . 
   we also have it in france is it somewhere near the spanish border ? 
  never heard of it . 
  i agree with what you 're saying , it 's a fair point . 
  maybe the difference is one is for entertainment and the other is for life sustenance of humans ( we eat meat , well ... ) . 
  i do n't want to go full veggie . 
   second , you can read what dirk jacobs said , that legally these products are different products and that 's why they ca n't be compared . 
  those precise products in the article , but there are many more ( like the butter cookies ) which are exactly the same . 
  for evidence - go to a store in germany , take a box of bahlsen butter cookies . 
  go to a store in poland and take a box of bahlsen ~ ~ palm oil ~ ~ butter cookies . 
  compare the ingredients and price . 
  i agree some products can be considered different - i think somebody fucked up when they presented the case to the comission . 
  they should have selected better examples . 
  not to repeat myself : https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6jon69/no_evidence_of_lower_quality_foods_in_eastern/djgbtbk/, 
  i was not using the proper term which is hydrogenated fat . 
  so , palm oil is a trans fat - which is bad in itself ( who recommends eating no more than 1 % daily ) and hydrogenated is far more worse . 
  just from a [ random search result ] ( http://www.whfoods.com/genpage.php?tname=george&amp;dbid=10 ) :  the chemical structure of artificially hardened hydrogenated fat is , however , different from either that of a naturally hard saturated fat or naturally liquid unsaturated ( mono - or poly - ) oil . 
  saturated fats have a rigid straight molecular form , which tends to `` rigidify '' the body structures into which they are incorporated , like blood vessels ( thus the association between hard animal fats and atherosclerosis or hardening of the arteries ) . 
  unsaturated fats have various wavy or zigzag forms ( called `` cis - '' forms ) that contribute to more flexible arteries and other body structures . 
  hydrogenated fats also have bent molecular shapes , but hydrogenated fats are bent in the mirror-opposite direction ( which is why they are called `` trans - '' forms ) of naturally occurring unsaturated fats . 
  for this reason , hydrogenated fats are difficult for the body to `` grab onto '' and metabolize , and can neither be incorporated into cell structures nor excreted in the normal fashion . 
  thus , hydrogenated or `` trans - '' fats tend to remain `` stuck '' in blood circulation , becoming oxidized and most importantly , contributing significantly to an increased risk for cardiovascular disease and possibly also cancer . 
  i 'd say butter is better than cheap hydrogenated palm oil and they are trying to kill us !, 
  [ here you go ] ( http://www.foodnavigator.com/policy/no-evidence-of-lower-quality-foods-in-eastern-europe-says-commission ), 
  do you know what 's the propaganda ( ? ), 
  about hardened fats , palm oil specifically ? 
  i read a few times they are really bad for health , but now it 's about as much as i remember . 
   i do n't know why . 
  is that not true ? 
  palm oil is very healthy if it is not hardened , but in the case of groceries it 's usually the bad one . 
  i 'm not . 
  it says 206,76 pln + 31,41 % per 1000 cigarettes . 
  that would n't include vat , i guess . 
  it seems like 80 % of the price is tax . 
  cigarettes are really expensive here . 
  it 's better to buy an apartment or a good car than to smoke . 
  i am currently playing horizon : zero dawn and have some reservations about robot bulls , it could go wrong . 
  wait , what ? 
  but that was not true last month . 
  the eu even rejected the claim of the easterners as ungrounded . 
  we were told it 's our imagination . 
  we do n't even like butter here !, 
  customs + vat, 
  it is a cruel thing and it 's good there are people trying to change it . 
  that put aside - what 's the history , why do you spaniards do it ? 
  how do you feel about it ? 
  how was it before ? 
  i know there 's wikipedia , but personal opinions and stories here are more valuable and interesting . 
  are those other small parties in favor of the changes ? 
  i would n't think so .

   again , not applicable as we are talking about humans . 
  why not ? 
  because of [ central limit theorem ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/central_limit_theorem ) . 
  yes - there was no poland :(, 
  [ heinz guderian ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/heinz_guderian ) was born in my town - che\u0142mno ( kulm or culm ) . 
  you said :  their is substantial evidence of polish peasants and villagers rounding up local jews and denouncing jews without any direct orders from german authorities to do so . 
  perhaps in the cities it was a bit different . 
  it is not a generalization ? 
  from your source : john connelly quoted a polish historian ( leszek gondek ) calling the phenomenon of polish collaboration `` marginal '' and wrote that `` only relatively small percentage of polish population engaged in activities that may be described as collaboration when seen against the backdrop of european and world history '' the secound one is telling story of one village . 
  even if it is true , it is hard to extrapolate it to whole society . 
   large enough amount of people took part in the holocaust and contributed to it without any germans demanding them to do so . 
   their are instances in rural southern poland where the germans were not even there yet or had given orders but the citizens handed over jews to german authorities . 
   is substantial evidence of polish peasants i agree that it is complex , but please take a reponsibility for your statements and please answer : what does it mean ` substantial ' ? 
  what percentage of polish population are you talking about ? 
   is substantial evidence of polish peasants what does it mean ` substantial ' ? 
  what percentage of polish population are you talking about ? 
  i think it is quite easy to draw conclusions based on today 's standards . 
  please remember , that for helping jews , germans killed poles and used a collective responsibility . 
  sorry for question , but what would you do today , if there would be a terror in your city and you and your familiy could be killed becouse one of your neighbour is keeping ` illegal ' emigrants ? 
  i 'm not excuse these people , but it is tough question . 
  despite of that many poles helped jews . 
  some estimates put the number of poles involved in rescue at up to 3 million , and credit poles with saving up to around [ 450,000 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rescue_of_jews_by_poles_during_the_holocaust ) jews from certain death . 
  for helping jews germans pacified whole villages and killed it 's residents - including women and children : cisie , hucisko , ob\u00f3rki , paulin\u00f3w , etc. 
  several thousand poles were killed for helping jews . 
  please do not forget about it . 
   wiped out in poland wiped out in german-occupied poland . 
  ftfy . 
  for me constant accusation of poles that refused to integrate jews in their society for centuries is just unfair . 
  there were two parties of such process and talking only about one side is wrong , even without giving the context . 
  where did i justify oppression ? 
   next you 'll be telling us please try to not use stereotypes . 
  it seems , that i was put in the box with ` racist , anti-semite , killer , bully , oppresor ' caption - literally hitler , that would like to burn some gypsy , black , gay , etc. 
   if a russian ever said something so starkly anti semitic , 3 . 
  let 's make an experience - try to find some citation , or use mine and put it in some discussion - we will see ( using russian , or other eu country flare ) . 
  probably yes - process of up ( down ) voting is to some extend , correlated with the flare . 
  opinion of russians my not be popular here - probably because of the ukraine stuff , etc. 
  but for sure opinion of poles are not at the top of this ranking . 
  are you serious ? 
  how citing the jew author describing facts can be anti-semite and neo-nazi ? 
  jews in poland , for many centuries , lived mostly separately in getthos , did not consider themselves polish and refused to assimilate . 
  [ isaac singer ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/isaac_bashevis_singer ) - the jewish author and nober price winner , wrote in forverts about pre iiww jews in poland : ` rarely did a jew think it was necessary to learn polish ; rarely was a jew interested in polish history or polish politics . 
  ( ... ) even in the last few years it was still a rare occurrence that a jew would speak polish well . 
  out of three million jews living in poland , two-and-a-half million were not able to write a simple letter in polish and they spoke very poorly . 
  there are hundreds of thousands of jews in poland to whom polish was as unfamiliar as turkish . 
  the undersigned was connected with poland for generations , but his father did not know more than two words in polish . 
  and it never even occurred to him that there was something amiss in that . ', 
  do your really need all of that slavs , italians and hungarians ? 
  you are german and you can easier join to germany . 
  after the 1st ww the czechs had a ` dobr\u00fd voj\u00e1k \u0160vejk a jin\u00e9 podivn\u00e9 historky ' and poles had a ' [ c.k.

  there was a banned and popular song in post-war poland : ` truman truman dump this pumpkin ( a-bomb ) because it is unbearable ' ( ` truman truman zrzu\u0107 ta bania bo tu jest nie do wytrzymania ' ) . 
  yet another joke party that has support at the level below triple of standard error deviation . 
  never heard of it . 
  are not you afraid that articulating of such views , you will become a dissident and at the end you will have to leave russia ? 
   i agree that is great . 
  [ this ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/slovak_invasion_of_poland_ ( 1939 \\ ) ) fact is not mentioned in polish schools and is not widely known for society . 
  be careful - due to globalization and costs cutting , polish plumbers may be employed as donors . 
  you are risking that after few years a bunch of young people will knock at your door asking for alimony . 
   racism against russian-lithuanians xenophobia - ftfy . 
  and haste makes waste . 
  a little bit unreliable - google translate should work too ... for me it works quite well when i translate comments from - for example - delfi.lt . 
  let 's say it was a test , 
  great idea , but it may scary people that are not too sure about their english . 
  imho , you can start your mission from sending pm ( s ) .

  without crying crocodile tears because of men death . 
  why ? 
  no one will kill you . 
   our graves were destroyed and our people expelled . 
  do not be exagerated . 
  my mother family is german . 
  and i was talking about graves of polish citizens killed by german neighbours . 
   you have to stop looking thank you for lecture , but we were talking about pre wwii period , i suppose . 
  are you trying to justify the whole germans aggression ? 
  that is just sad - man . 
  you have no sources , you have only ` friend of my friend grandpa said ' statements that grows to ` whole village massacre ' . 
  come to poland , see the graves , hear the people , read sources - be open . 
  and god bless you . 
   germans were killed just because they were germans and to make place for the poles and czechs . 
  \\ sources ? 
   that is the same thing you blame the nazis for . 
  if i would blame that would be the 6.000.000 citizens . 
   i 've got a friend whose grandfather was killed in the early 30 's . 
  that is not ` whole german villages ' is not it ? 
  give some reliable sources . 
  but for real - my grandgrandpa was killed by germans neighbours - here : http://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/zbrodnia_w_mniszku, 
   whole german villages were massacred by poles and czechs before the nazis in germany even gained power where ? 
    killed because of nationality or shape of skull or just wipe off to give some space to ubermensch ? 
   you just supported my argument . 
  that 's what poles , czechs and russians have done to germans . 
  what to hell are you talking about ? 
   tell that to my grandparents who owned multiple apartment blocks and got nothing of their existence back just because they happened to speak german . 
  tell that to my grandparents who were polish and were murdered by german neighbours just because they were polish . 
   what the czechs , poles and russians did was nothing short of what the nazis have done , i view their actions with the same disgust . 
  really ?

  yes . 
  @ obviously is an elephant 's ear . 
  a ( sitting ) monkey looks like this : & .

  where is the inaccuracy ? 
  besides lithuania in all mentioned cases the polish state , together with other partner divided some other country and took some land . 
  do you want to say that this was n't a partition because in most of the cases there was a significant polish population in taken territory ( except germany ) , like in crimea case ? 
  the only joke part is that we love it . 
  not anymore i hope . 
  what ? 
  we love it !, 
  in 20th century we took part in partitions of : * ukraine ( together with ussr ) * belarus ( with ussr ) * lithuania ( well , this was actually land grab ) * czechoslovakia ( with 3rd reich ) * germany ( with allies ) edit : formatting,

  other news from the same source : the governor of volyn oblast ( western ukraine ) has resigned , forced by protesters, 
  poland can not into science funding . 
  i guess polish church also does n't know what the term `` gender '' means . 
  they 've created their own definition , have thrown there all the scary ( for them ) things like feminism , homosexuality etc. , and transmitted it to their public . 
  now `` gender '' together with `` the civilization of death '' ( abortion , euthanasia ) are simple banners used in ideological fight . 
  it 's easier to say for example that gay marriage is evil because it 's part of some evil genderrrr ideology , than to explain why the union of two men is wrong from the perspective of the not very coherent catholic doctrine . 
  the recent church obsession with the word `` gender '' resulted in some interesting works , examples : * [ the first photo of gender ] ( http://deser.pl/deser/51,111858,15200534.html?i=1 ) * [ stop bender ideology ] ( http://deser.pl/deser/51,111858,15200534.html?i=16 ) * [ the exorcism of gender ] ( http://www.polityka.pl/galerie/1558745,9,rysuje-jan-koza.read ),

  [ video ] ( http://youtu.be/jwsml61dymi?t=36m ) from the incident . 
  you did n't mention one funny ( or some would say strange ) incident that shows that poland in fact is in some aspects a special country . 
  it started previous week but continued into the current one . 
  in radom , city in central poland , new police chief ordered to remove crosses ( i mean catholic religious symbols that hang on the walls in many places in poland , even in the parliament ) from his office and two others public rooms in police . 
  this started a series of interesting events . 
  anonymous group of policemen write a complain , saying that their new chief is rude , uncivil and last but not least , he does not believe in god . 
  the complain was sent among others to regional police hq and to local bishop ( they know who has the real power here ) . 
  the case gained interest of right wing politicians always ready to defend the faith against mounting armies of atheism . 
  especially eager in this fight was well-known mp '' [ agent tomek ] ( http://bi.gazeta.pl/im/32/9d/c5/z12950834q,zdjecie-wykonano-29-lipca-2009-r---o-godz-10-54--t.jpg ) '' , who sent his own complains to various central offices and accused radom 's police chief of insulting the religious feelings of his subordinates ( in polish law this crime can put you in jail for two years ) . 
  the accused police chief came back from his holiday and had to explain what happened to his superiors . 
  he also wrote an open letter explaining his actions . 
  i do n't want to break any special bond ( although i 'm not really sure if such thing really exists , beside the saying mentioned in the picture i 've seen little proof to support it ) with hungary , but i have impression that in poland in recent years this phrase `` pole and hungarian cousins be ... '' has been almost exclusively appropriated by right wing supporters , who , in that way , express their strong desire to `` orbanize '' this country . 
  the leader of right wing opposition ( who currently leads in polls ) said some time ago that `` there will be budapest in warsaw '' , hinting at what type of politics he wants to introduce if he wins elections . 
  later he many times has expressed his admiration for hungary 's pm . 
  there are also that strange groups that go to sponsored by orban party trips to hungary to wave polish flags during some official events , there are football hooligans ( by definition extreme right wing ) that loudly say about their brotherhood with hungarians . 
  i 'm not sure if this is how it works from hungarian side , but i 'm afraid that this saying ( and this alleged bond ) is becoming compromised ( at least in some part of society ) , by narrowing its use to express support between right wing groups in both countries . 
  why did you edit the title of the article ? 
  it does n't say about riots after the legalization , only about police preparation for possible violent outcome . 
  all photos of clashes come from the protests that took place before the legalization and as [ bbc describes it ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-22261494 ) : `` although rallies opposing the change have been overwhelmingly peaceful , there have been some clashes , blamed on far-right elements .

  if this picture is true i 'm not sure if this can be called riots . 
  no , there is no playing here , it 's only some bullshit that got out from the not-entirely-rational mind ( my personal opinion ) of our minister of justice . 
  the anti-german sentiment is sometimes used by right wing opposition but i 'm not sure it can be called nazi card . 
  poland was also added yesterday ( earlier only the biggest cities had coverage ) . 
  in one of polish clinics an empty container used for storing frozen embryos for [ ivf ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/in_vitro_fertilisation ) has been found . 
  polish justice minister jaros\u0142aw gowin ( devout catholic and strong opponent of ivf ) deduced from this fact that there is an underground embryos trade , that probably thousands of human beings lost their lives in result ( for him frozen embryo equals human being ) and that experiments was conducted on missing embryos by those evil ... germans . 
  no proof of these claims has been presented .

  what do you mean by insane ? 
  they are n't that high , at least comparing with the rest of europe . 
  i 'm sure many people took the deep , philosophical approach to this question and wondered how long it will take for humans to get to mars . 
  kudos for the kid who got it correct . 
  i 'm sure you can . 
  i did n't want to suggest there is no difference whatsoever . 
  sure , you have higher sentences in such cases and they are more often , but here ( in poland , but i guess in some other european countries too ) you can also be sentenced for only saying something about religion . 
  we are not so different : [ polish singer convicted for `` offending religious sensibilities '' ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/doda_ ( singer \\ ) #blasphemy _ charges ), 
  is it possible that this tangible effects on productivity etc. 
  was caused by the decrease in value of euro due to the financial crisis , that made german products and services cheap for the rest of the world ? 
  does this doctrine prevent europe from being nuked ? 
  i do n't mean entirely but similarly to japan and the end of ww2 . 
  the sheer cost of planned invasion of main japanese islands was also considered to be enormous , so usa tried the other way first and it worked . 
  i have exactly the same thoughts and that 's why i signed this . 
  according to [ this ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_union_free_trade_agreements ) no . 
  it 's not only balkan thing - as far as i know lithuania forbids bi-lingual street name signs in the areas inhabited by polish minority . 
  i think ( though i 'm not really sure ) this could be characteristic for small ( by population number ) nations that have recently regained independence and are afraid of loosing their cultural identity . 
  i agree . 
  making the poll in the midst of the financial crisis probably has huge influence on the results . 
  i think this reasoning has a lot of sense , there is a lot of similarities between poland-ukraine ( and to some degree belarus ) situation and western countries-their colonies . 
  you mentioned colonization actions ( this also took place not only in interbellum period but also in xvi-xviii century ) i would add also oppressing the local population , some brutal episodes when the colonial system fell ( in that case during ww2 and immediately after ) and the current situation when many ukrainians come to poland for ( rather low wage ) work . 
  there are groups in poland that romanticize the image of ukraine under polish rule ( as a some kind of our wild west ) , some feel nostalgia for the lost lands . 
  i guess this is quite similar to some situations and views in the west . 
  the major difference is the lack of sea/ocean between poland and ukraine . 
   in the name of polish nation we apologize ... 
  so who exactly are you ? 
  for now i do n't see any mandate only big words put into highly compressed and thus blurred image .

the very notion that a news anchor could have a character is insane . 
  munich does n't exist - in fact , all cities there in the south of germany are just potemkin villages . 
  it actually consists exclusively of a single house in the alps whose inhabitant is a racist old catholic and who spends all day drinking and planning for uncle adolf 's return . 
  do n't let anybody tell you otherwise , especially anyone who is n't from the enlightened areas in the north and votes die linke three times every election , minimum . 
  you obviously do n't even speak german ... nice false flag , though , literally . 
  i suppose you ca n't taste bitter , or a certain kind of it ? 
  ( quite a few people ca n't . ), 
  because gamey meat has a certain kind of pleasant bitterness to it when compared to common livestock . 
  that 's why you put lingonberry jam on it , their bitterness combines very well with it . 
  still , the dutch and passion ? 
  that does n't fit their stereotype _ at all _ . 
   there is n't a magic wall that separates africa and europe well , if we 're talking in such primitive terms , i 'd consider the mediterranean to be `` a magic wall '' . 
  but it may be the case that you only use such primitive terms to ridicule people you do n't agree with , i 'm not sure . 
  because africa is n't a single entity . 
  there are countries that are fucked up beyond recognition as such , and there are extremely prosperous and promising ones . 
  for an easier parallel , just look at the former bloc countries - some , such as the baltic countries are doing extremely well and improving rapidly , whereas others seem to be degrading . 
  and that 's an order of magnitude less people than africa has . 
  i 'm currently trying to make a linguistic world map of sorts , and the numbers i get from people speaking a minor language there are _ insane _ in certain regions .

  maybe you should get your great new public health care system to pay for a hearing aid . 
  see the recent invasion of crimea . 
  those are n't `` crazy '' ideas , they 're completely legitimate thoughts that are n't exclusively demanded by them and them only . 
  they need to be discussed and implemented or discarded like any other idea . 
  it 's not some lunatic fringe party like die violetten . 
  go to the us if you want to feel superior because of pseudo-political drama . 
  oh , scram ... living in bavaria , i _ really _ do n't get this circlejerk about the csu , any member i 've ever met was a completely nice and normal person . 
  you 're just taking them as an easy target without having _ any _ idea what you 're talking about . 
  and imagine the outrage among the pseudo-intelligentsia if i were to say that die linke needs to be forcibly disbanded !, 
  people like you would n't stop talking about the fourth reich for weeks , yet positions like yours seem to be completely acceptable because they 're _ obviously _ the bad guys . 
  and worst of all , you probably consider yourself progressive , democratic , liberal , and everybody is buying it . 
  how would that fit with the lore , atmosphere , style ? 
  at least do n't call it fallout ...

  this would have the same outcome if they build a 50km pipeline , which is probably cheaper . 
  that 's actually a long-term plan ( that i ca n't remember the name of ) , afaik - a european and north-african network of renewable energy ranging from the sahara to norway , with storage facilities at choke points . 
  but that 's an absolutely major project , nothing you can make appear magically . 
  also , how would you store energy in fjords ? 
  i thought they just used those for tide power generators . 
  pump storages sound pretty good to me , there 's no obvious loss except for technical imperfections . 
  nuclear power has other leaders , germany leads in renewables . 
  there 's big money to be made there for a high-tech country . 
  those are just birthing pains , we 'll figure it out . 
  and the hippies will cry as long as we do n't revert to the 1800s , so they 're not really a good indicator for what 's right . 
  well yeah , how to store energy from renewable resources is a huge problem that 's nowhere been solved to complete satisfaction . 
  it 's being worked on , though - afaik , they 're currently surveying for places for a ( or several ) pumped storage hydro power station . 
  the problem with that kind of technology , as always , is that the very people who ___ demand ___ green energy also say `` not in my backyard '' ( and also `` this makes mommy earth cry '' ) , so they 're not finding any . 
   who are we defending against ? 
  last time i asked if the us had any channels that did n't do that , people pointed me to pbs 's news show , which looked similar to ours . 
  and why would you need a whole channel for news ? 
  it 's not like they actually work with all the time they have and do any in-depth reporting ... 
  i still do n't understand why the `` 24h news cycle '' is perceived as an achievement . 
  it 's responsible for the exact thing you complain about . 
  is future kebab clay . 
  he couldnt hear you over his freedom, 
  a lot of the horizontal lines should cut at the alps , imho - if i interpret them correctly , they currently throw in southern germany with southern europe in a lot of cases where it does n't make sense , at least according to our internal stereotypes .

  you 've now said i 'm * ridiculous * deluded * arrogant * pseudointellectual * mentally diseased * dumb and for what ? 
  because i was making an offhanded comment you did n't even _ attempt _ to inquire the meaning of . 
  your sole strategy is to insult and aggravate me , you deliberately attempt kill any discussion from the start and would like to publicly beat me into submission . 
  and you possess the gall to present yourself as the reasonable person here ? 
  if that 's not eristic , then what is ? 
  fuck off , gently , i 'm not falling for your crap . 
  _ what _ ?!, 
  you write _ that _ thing above and call _ my _ reaction to it an ad hominem ?!, 
  are you insane ? 
  ah , i only read the first line of your comment and started explaining myself . 
  i keep on making the mistake of not assuming everybody 's an asshole ... good thing reddit is teaching me otherwise . 
  it 's a generalization if you have n't personally worked with ever single one . 
   can mail readers ' houses really be so dusty that they need a turbo-charged , jeremy clarkson-approved machine to clean their floors ? 
  and they belittle the tabloids for bad journalism ? 
  but right , right , they 're doing it with _ good _ goals , not like those others who have _ bad _ goals in mind . 
  i deduced as much . 
  but you 're painting those exact things you list as islamist as `` nothing scary '' in the context of people wanting to introduce them into european politics . 
  and that 's what i disagreed with in the first half of my comment . 
  i , for one , ca n't wait for the erm\u00e4chtigungsgesetz !, 
  sssh , do n't ruin the circlejerk . 
  he 's a nazi , period . 
   tories are actually like that . 
  that sentence in itself is strawmanning , the strawman here being a generalization / a stereotype . 
   tldr : islamism just religion being political and nothing scary . 
  that 's ... controversial . 
  we 've _ just _ overcome direct influence of religion in politics for about 100 years now . 
  i do n't want to see us falling back . 
  and if you only mean things like social market economy being based on christian values , that 's a _ really _ thin connection that nobody really cares about any more . 
  it does not at all make sense to draw a parallel in the case of a religion that has rampant actual extremism today , especially because something like social market economics is just as `` islamist '' as it 's `` christianist '' . 
   only because they hold the public and democracy in contempt . 
  well yes , if you had to call his viewpoints popular and not populist , you 'd also have to call vast amounts of people scum , not just him . 
  so it 's simple - reinvent a word , put a thin veil of scholarship in front of your arrogance and continue telling people what to do and think in the name of all that is good and progressive . 
  saddest thing is that this is working as perfectly as it ever has , only fewer people notice it . 
   because eastern europeans are scum . 
  and _ you _ vilify him for populism ?!,

the funny thing is that exactly this kind of overreacting and misinformation allowed pis to win elections . 
  i 'm starting to think that they really want to support pis even further , it can not be explained otherwise  . 
  he does not babble , he have very coherent views that he did n't change for decades , and which should be respected because he backed them up very strongly with many articles and books . 
  entertaining is his presentation of those . 
  well you need to decide now , clown can not be predictable , if he would - he would n't be entertaining . 
  because i think that what he is saying can be interesting and at worst is entertaining . 
  why are you insulting other people ? 
  polish mep janusz korwin-mikke voice during debate . 
  source : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfglbj6iasg ( polish ) my rough translation : `` thank you , mr chairman . 
  i 'm not a democrat , i hate democracy , i despise democracy , but you are democrats !, 
  in this case acknowledge that polish people , legally and democratically , elected pis . 
  did you want democracy ? 
  so you have it . 
  democracy is a tyranny of majority , so pis having a support of majority , will be doing whatever it want . 
  if you think that pis is a very bad party - then i agree , but think how bad had to be previous government !, 
  what a huge corruption , thievery , contempt for a common man , suppression of freedom of speech ( which i 'm personally experiencing ) had to be , so the tortured polish nation elected pis as the only party , which gave it a hope that previous rulers will end in prisons , where is their place . 
  and besides of that , i think that european union has to be destroyed . '', 
  lol , that was the last place i was looking at  _ < . 
  thanks !, 
  could you help me find it , please ? 
  i must have missed that . 
  what do you mean ? 
  i think meaning and usage is pretty much the same as in english language . 
  in poland as many people were confused by this usage at first but he explained many times why he is using it and what he mean . 
  he is also a publicist specialized in intellectual provocations  . 
  well , this is theory of those whose iq is lower than vegetables . 
  he never said this . 
  i do n't know anyone with iq higher than vegetable that would call him an idiot . 
  many people disagree with him or call him crazy , but no one of who i know , call him an idiot . 
  he called martin schulz , not \u00d6ttinger . 
  also by `` national socialist '' he means literally nationalist and socialist and not a historical nazi . 
  he uses this confusing term for entertaining purposes . 
  well , frankly i do n't believe them at all  , i did n't try to imply that they are totally clean , they are certainly crazy in their own way but their propaganda always lacked range and influence , which is exemplified in oettinger comments , and they really had to f * cked up to lose this elections . 
  i 'm not telling that all what was telling previous government against pis was false , but are you denying that they went overboard with some claims , which increased number of sympathizers of pis ? 
  i know many publicists who was defending pis even they did n't agree with it , just because the charges was too ridiculous , like ziemkiewicz to name the most influential one . 
  it was also basically proved that po was using political marketing specialists , specialized in framing political opponents , the fact quite disgusting by itself . 
  i 'm commenting only their political marketing here . 
  we can say one for sure - they really specialized in exposing double standards because of hell they went through in their own country , which may have interesting consequences  . 
  also one more thing - indeed it seems like ziobro instead of defending himself , is just going through route `` they were worse '' - this can be explained by what i wrote above . 
  basically the whole political debate in poland , was based on fear , you can not defend yourself against all ridiculous charges everyone is throwing at you at all times . 
  that 's why pis , when it was still in opposition - changed strategy to attacking back and exposing double standards . 
  this was really cartoonishly funny , because they both was debating only `` who is worse '' which was represented perfectly by hilarious presidential debate during presidential elections earlier this year  . 
  the `` double standards '' were clearly visible in `` government-media '' and they ware trying to expose it at all times . 
  now they carried away this mentality of victim outside of the country - unfortunately . 
  ** added : ** this is also why they started their work from the ~ ~ press ~ ~ media law . 
  basically new government got credibility because previous government lost all credibility . 
  i personally believe that we will see some good and bad things coming from its reign , but what is more important and interesting is under-representation of this side of story . 
  in poland division between different media/newspaper etc is really extreme , like most of them was pro-gov or anti-gov and both were telling only their side of story - to the really , really cartoonish extremes . 
  there is like no honesty at all with some minor exceptions . 
  i stopped reading/watching them at all because of that . 
  previous gov based all its political marketing on fueling fear towards opposition - to the extreme , and this story went outside the country - because it was `` official '' , and this is what the whole hate towards pis comes from . 
  if now it will be just like we had it before internally - we will see some really ridiculous charges against pis . 
  fortunately i see that outside our borders , many people are as much confused at fierce attacks on this government as its electorate . 
  i personally did n't vote for them , but i 'm not too afraid of them , we just need to get our shit together and start looking at it realistically . 
  i 'm not pro or anti of this government , but i must say that i really hate this propaganda based on dehumanizing of opposition which previous gov was promoting . 
  this is one of the reasons of overturn - it got too ridiculous . 
  that is because left and right have ideas and do care . 
  common voter does n't have a clue about economics or anything really , when democracy is falling with visible arrogance of political class he just want someone who actually care , and this is either far `` right '' or far `` left '' ( using here common description of those ideas , but personally i hate this division ) . 
  yeah , because nazi raise to power improved situation in germany in short-term , and common voter can see only short term consequences of everything . 
  however there are also examples of authoritarian governments which improved situation legitimately and in long-term . 
  i was n't implying that all authoritarian governments are always good - only that it is merely a result of something often equally bad , that is often forgotten . 
  authoritarianism is just addressing issues that can not be resolved by democratic government because of whatever reasons . 
  if it appears in the place of democracy - this democracy must fall by itself to make space for it . 
  funny thing is that many `` liberal activists '' are first to criticize authoritarianism but last in trying to fix democracy before its collapse . 
  common sense for typical human being is that the form of government is n't so important as every day life we are living , yet `` democracy ideologists '' seems to think the opposite . 
  if there is corruption , lawful thievery , and deteriorating economy - it is not such a big deal , but when the democracy finally falls its like `` oh no !, 
  now we are falling ! '', 
  my intention was n't to praise current polish government , from which i 'm pretty far - but just to indicate why this outcry will not be understood , and wo n't help in anything , until people stop criticizing forms of government , and focus on commenting on real people every day lives , which are bigger deal than democracy itself . 
  `` it 's not a crisis , it 's a result '' [ stefan kisielewski ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/stefan_kisielewski ), 
  so basically , eu commisioner g\u00fcnther oettinger started with this : http://www.politico.eu/article/oettinger-warns-poland-over-new-media-law-rule-of-law-mechanism/ and polish minister of justice , zbigniew ziobrio responded with open letter : http://www.wprost.pl/ar/529053/gdzie-pan-byl-kiedy-agenci-sluzb-specjalnych-wdarli-sie-do-redakcji-wprost-zbigniew-ziobro-pisze-list-otwarty-do-komisarza-ue-gnthera-oettingera/ there are some references to polish internal events which caused raise to power of new government in poland , which should be interesting for some , because as i wrote once `` it 's not a crisis , it 's a result '' and both sides deserve to be listened . 
  below is my rough free translation , sorry for mistakes , i hope it will be readeable enough . 
   dear commissioner ,   i do not have the habit of responding to unwise comments about poland coming from foreign politicians , because they are telling about them . 
  however i was provoked by what you did n't tell , and what i expected from you - as from commissionaire . 
    public opinion in germany , and also in poland , was shocked by mass sexual attacks on females , which happened during nye in german cities . 
  events which raise concern , also about safety of polish people staying in germany , were hidden for few days by german media . 
  former german interior minister hans-peter friedrich even called it `` the cartel of silence '' . 
  censoring of this information by the german media dumbfounded public opinion in the world . 
  i waited in vain for a strong reaction from you at such a flagrant violation of citizens ' right to information . 
  i came to the unpleasant conclusion that it 's easier for you to talk about fictitious threats to media freedom in other countries , rather than condemn censorship in your own homeland . 
    mr oettinger ,   a week ago , in an interview for `` frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung '' you criticized actions of democratically elected polish parliament and government , which is going to restore the objectivity and independence of the public media in poland . 
  you demanded to put poland under supervision . 
    this kind of words , spoken by a german politician have worst connotations among poles . 
  also , me . 
  i am the grandson of a polish officer who , during world war ii fought in the underground home army with the `` german supervision . '', 
    dear commissioner ,   where you have been when in june 2014 . agents of special forces stormed the editorial office of one of the biggest weeklies in poland `` wprost '' and tried to tore from its editor-in-chief , his laptop with recordings compromising the previous government , headed by the current head of european council - donald tusk ?!, 
  in your own country , similar assault of editorial office , of the weekly `` der spiegel '' in 1962 was a huge scandal and led to the collapse of the government . 
    why escaped your mind the fact , which was covered by all polish media , that more than 80 polish journalists and lawyers who dealt with the matter of this compromising tapes , were bugged ?!, 
  the secret services have used undercover operatives for surveillance of independent media . 
    will you find an excuse for dismissing of half thousand employees , of the polish television , and forcing them to work in the outer company , in humiliating conditions , which happened during a reign of po-psl ?!, 
  these parties are still your coalition partners , in the epp group , in the european parliament . 
  an introduction to the mass purges in public television was the removing of several dozen independent journalists , shortly after previous government took the power . 
    how do you assess the fact that the previous government , caused the dismissal of the editor-in-chief and journalists of the independent , influential , daily newspaper `` rzeczpospolita '' and weekly `` uwa\u017cam rze '' ? 
  most of the shares that government had of those companies , was passed into the hands of the friendly businessman . 
  dismissals were a consequence of a single article , which put into question the government investigation of plane crash in smolensk , which killed polish president coming from the opposite political camp . 
    why are you silent when the german-swiss publisher ringier axel springer , owner of several media in poland , including `` newsweek '' , in a dramatic way denies press independence , and openly supports protests aimed against democratically elected polish parliament and government ?!, 
  the authorities of this foreign company approved the behavior of the chief editor of `` newsweek '' tomasz lis , who came out of the role of a journalist , and during street demonstrations fueled anti-government speech . 
  would you be silent if the head of the largest german weekly `` der spiegel '' klaus brinkb\u00e4umer demonstrated in the center of berlin , demanding the removal , by mass protests , the government of angela merkel ?!, 
    dear commissioner ,   in your country , germany , there is a saying : `` cuius regions - eius radio , '' which means `` who have power - have a radio '' it boils down to a simple principle that heads of public radio and television are appointed by politicians currently exercising power . 
  the media act , which being worked on by polish government , provides a much more democratic solution . 
  it assumes that the national media council will be elected by the president and both houses of parliament .

  `` when the eu was primarily working as an economic union of free trade and common interests i was quite happy with it . 
  now that the real push towards a united states of europe seems be put in motion i really do n't want any part of that anymore . '', 
  but you would gladly give up your sovereignty to uk . 
  as i said above , i can understand wanting to be independent but joining uk hoping that you will be better represented ? 
  you will be just as bullied , and in europe you can at least try to find other countries with similar interest . 
  in uk you will be alone . 
  you think uk wo n't bully you into decisions you do n't like ? 
  good luck with that . 
  w/e man i just hope you are a minority . 
  all in all , please try harder , a few slogans and baseless claims is all you have written so far . 
  please focus on data . 
  we can throw slogans at each other whole day . 
  you will say eu is bad for ireland , i will say if not for eu ireland would be 2 times poorer . 
  i really could n't find any merit in your post , even though i tried . 
  i 'm pro-eu can i can do a much better job at listing things that i do n't like/think are bad for my country/shouldn ' t be implemented . 
  i 'm sorry to say that but ireland will be irrelevant in a grand scheme of international politics and economy no matter what . 
  the only way your country and we , as europe can be relevant is by unity and more cooperation . 
  also would you rather give your sovereignty to uk ? 
  i can understand that you want to be independent and not be a part of any federation . 
  changing one for the other really does n't make any sense for me . 
  could you perhaps enlighten me what advantages are there for such solution ? 
  also please be free to post how exactly was eu bad for ireland , i 'm really curious to know that . 
  yeah , putting aside how stupid is this comment , it 's really sad how eating with fork is the only thing he could think off . 
  we ourselves got it from italians ffs . 
  there is none . 
  it 's just shit attempt at banter . 
  it 's like you do n't have better argument and you tell americans that they should mind their own business because you have pubs older than their country . 
  your smell works surprisingly well . 
  as it turns out one of the main lockheed-martin lobbists in us is also a ceo of the friends of poland organization that our mod is/used to be ( not really clear , really shady stuff ) ceo of too . 
  i 'm really not that into military stuff , so maybe someone more knowledgeable can correct me , but i do n't think it was ever ongoing and there were never any concrete plans to buy one . 
  it was just an idea being passed around . 
  there is already one assembly in place and it does n't look like we will get another one . 
   they did n't win in though . 
  they were the only company to be accepted into the last stage of procurement . 
  i 'm not quite sure . 
  if that was the case then all the talk about compensation coming from airbus would be pointless . 
  also our mod talks all the time about voiding the tender and not about `` not completing last stage of procurement '' . 
   it was never said in this way . 
  since winning the elections their official rhetoric was always about `` hard negotiations '' , regardless of what we know about their real intention . 
  it is terrbile , but what can you expect when , as it turns out , our mod is just another lm office in poland . 
  lmao you are trying way to hard m8 . 
  that 's not even `` an ap story '' . 
  those are excerpts from government pr department . 
   not really . 
  contract was n't signed yet , negotiations were ongoing and - while extremely rare - it was possible to abandon it at this stage . 
  not really . 
  when you win a tender ( przetarg ) both sides are binded to sign a contract and you ca n't just `` abandon it '' . 
  usually cases like this are a total shitfest , but in this particular one proving bad will on the part of our gov should be quite easy . 
  there were plenty of comments from mod about how caracals are not good enough and we are not going to buy them prior to this moment . 
  also if what airbus says about their offer is true and we asked for transfer of tank ammo technology it 's clear who wanted to sign a contract and who did not . 
  nope , my parents both went to religion classes in church , after schoolday . 
  sound is back , now you know what i meant . 
  trust me you do n't want to . 
  damn it 's just 10pm and it 's already looking great . 
  midnight games are going to be fun . 
  yeah i agree . 
  the problem here is what the uk and eu think is a `` fair deal '' . 
  i 'm afraid they are a few key differences .

  i 'm so glad that there is finally a strong voice with a plan . 
  i 'm sick of inability to make decisions and set goals . 
  i 'm also sick of half measures , they just do n't work . 
  we either have to focus solely on maintaining the single market and drop other agenda or move towards single state . 
  there is no other way for eu to work . 
  that was a bit of a joke on my part . 
  i meant western values associated with things mentioned . 
  http://bigstory.ap.org/article/43caadced1c94142a526eec654f670af/cultural-sensitivities-obstacle-un-aids-conference i guess we did n't make any official statements or took any official negotiating positions , more like behind the curtains type of activity . 
  it 's not really being catholic per se . 
  we invented our own brand of `` catholicism '' one that is full of false pretense and two-faced people , that lately is driven mostly by hate and trying to fight off western inventions like gender , homosexuality , in-vitro and abortion , that tries to influence politics for economic gain ( lately there was a bill passed that regulates selling agricultural land , all religious organizations are exempt , but as you can imagine catholic church is the only one that matters ) , one that is deprived of any sophisticated thinking or philosophy , one that refuses any change and adaptation to modern times . 
  ah yes that is so weird that i expect easily countable data to be provided by numbers order . 
   but anyway it 's clear your perception of history is non existant if it does n't match your retoric nice , you have absolutely no arguments to anything i wrote so you just dismiss everything without any basis to do so other than your own bias . 
  did n't you ? 
  you literally mentioned uk first . 
  i think that matches the definition of the word `` ahead '' . 
   from 2017 the uk will have a thousand troops in poland can i have a source on that ? 
  it 's 2017 already and all you have in poland is less than a 100 soldiers . 
   you do n't see the uk , france or the us begging for a few thousand polish troops to be deployed in their countries well i have a pretty good guess why that is . 
  i also wrote why does our government wants those troops and i 'll repeat that it is really not because we count on you to fight for us . 
  honestly it is pretty similar to afghanistan and iraq when americans `` begged '' us for troops . 
  they could have done all by themselves but they needed as many countries on board not for their military prowess but to show that they are the right side , that has a lot of support . 
   ... and that 's before we even go into the incredibly costly nuclear umbrella that nato provides from the uk , us and french nuclear stockpiles . 
  it 's pretty cute how you put uk ahead of us in terms of nuclear capabilities . 
  i also do n't know what 's your point here exactly ? 
  you would have kept your nuclear weapons and delivery system whether or not we had been in nato because said umbrella also protects you . 
  i 'll give you that it 's pretty funny trying to claim that you keep your nuclear weapons because of poland . 
   for effective purposes the west pays for eastern european defence maybe for baltics that ca n't afford a big army . 
  as for poland the only thing we really count on here is us nuclear power and airforce and i 'm honestly not quite sure how does uk pays for defense in poland . 
  can you tell me what exactly are you funding here ? 
   until after it had declared war and said declaration was an empty gesture that did n't include any real action . 
  real action and fighting on your part started only when you got attacked . 
   also acting like poland did n't want nato troops stationed in it is a lie where did i say our government did n't want that ? 
  trust me , none thats inside military counts on those troops to really do anything when serious conflict comes .

how would that thing even be legal ? 
  i 'm not familiar with nuances of uk law , but refusing someone entry based on sex alone is illegal in poland 's constitution and i 'm pretty sure such sentiment is mirrored on eu-level . 
  note : i 'm talking from eastern europe perspective here . 
  asia topics are basically non-existent in mainstream media , unless some bigger stuff happens ( malaysia planes , bangladesh factory collapse , hong kong protests are the latest 3 i saw in tv i think ) . 
  for people mentality - current oldest generation ( grandmothers etc. ), 
  has this `` here be dragons '' mentality . 
  younger generation ( parents , 40-50 year olds ) have better knowledge , can actually show few `` most important '' countries , like china , india , japan on map , but mentally they only have this idea of chineese sweatshop or rice growing peasant . 
  my mom was really worried when she learned that malaysia is islamic country , when she heard mosque call to prayer during our skype conversation . 
  i had to spend some time explaining to her that there are no talibans on streets . 
  now the most important thing - actual culture . 
  i was very suprised how at home i felt . 
  there are many thing that make south-asian and eastern-european cultures very close : - all-around hospitality towards guests and even total strangers - big importance of family values - `` doing something out of nothing '' - it 's most likely common to poorer and no-longer-poor nations ( i think south america is similar in this regards ) - if your car breaks down in the middle of road , you do n't call mechanics or have it hauled to workshop - you peek around , maybe tie the loose part with bit of steel wire and drive away . 
  same thing when you 're building a house - you do n't hire plumber , electrican , and special dude to put floor tiles in kitchen - you just get `` construction worker '' and expect him to do all this stuff . 
  male houseowner is expected to do basic maintenance , without calling specialist to change stupid lightbulb . 
  also - corruption :( and `` those traffic laws are not really a law - merely a guidelines '' . 
  here 's a poem written by czes\u0142aw mi\u0142osz , a polish poet , in lw\u00f3w 1939 . 
  it was printed in newspapers , got special stalin award etc. 
  as for the content ( sorry , but i 'm unable to provide english translation ) - if read `` normally '' it 's typical commie propaganda about twilight of religion and triumph of red army under bright guidance of tow . 
  stalin . 
  censors were really happy when they read it , and awarded the poet with stalin award for such moving piece ... 
  the trick is ... if you ignore 1 . 
  4 . numbers and read it as it 's written ( line after line ) , it prophets poles kicking ruskis out of country and stalin going to rot in hell . 
  17th not 19th century , but we kinda got it covered . 
  http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0128378/  in 1648 a cossack rebellion in the ukraine threatens the sovereignty of the polish-lithuanian commonwealth over the cossack nation . 
  the cossack rebellion also known as the khmelnytsky uprising is pitting the cossack nation and its crimean tatar allies against the forces sent by the polish king john ii casimir . 
  polish colonel michal wolodyjowski is leading a squadron of polish cavalry.traitors , assassins and spies are everywhere . 
  against the backdrop of the uprising , a polish knight skrzetuski and a cossack leader bohun fall in love with the same young beautiful woman , helena . 
  their rivalry becomes the symbol of polish-ukrainian struggle . 
  there 's also 1810 one http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0170351/  in the early 1810s , poles , part of russia 's client state of lithuania , think independence will come if they join forces with napoleon when he invades russia . 
  this unity of purpose , in one district , is undermined by two families , feuding since the head of one shot the head of the other twenty years before . 
  there are hopes of a reconciliation through a marriage of pan tadeusz , a soplica , whose father , the murderer , is in hiding somewhere , and zosia , a teen-aged girl , a horeszko who lives in the household of pan 's uncle . 
  other cross-currents - of love , family , politics , village traditions , land reform , and what it means to be polish - give the film texture . 
   can other countries governments have . gov websites ? 
  . gov top-level domain is usa government agencies exclusive . 
  many other countries use second-level domain like . gov.pl, 
  during communist `` occupation '' in poland , there was a saying roughly translatable to `` give me a person , and paragraph will be found '' . 
  allegedly spoken by andriej wyszynski , a public persecutor from stalinist era . 
  oh , how little have changed in russia . 
  put ( t ) in ( g ) economy aside , there 's big shift of attitude towards russia in poland . 
  we had difficult past with both russia and germany , but youngest generation put it aside and wanted to have good relationship with them . 
  people learned german/russian not because they had to , but because they wanted to . 
  relationships with germany are better than ever in 1000 year history and keep improving , as bitter people from oldest generations die out due to age , and effort from youngest generation on both sides is showing . 
  before georgia incidents we had more beef with lithuanians ( polish minority there is really discriminated against ) and ukrainians ( unresolved upa mass murders , increased nationalistic attitudes on both sides ) than with russia . 
  russia ( and russians ) was seen as kinda politically-incorrect , a bit crazy , redneck uncle , but you did n't mind his jokes and enjoyed sharing a beer with him , while visiting on thanksgiving day . 
  nowadays ... everyone here tries to cut all ties with russia , businessmen scatter to find different countries to export to , and do n't want to invest anything there , even if their self-imposed `` sanctions '' get lifted . 
  soviet-era leftover monuments are getting vandalized and petitions for their removal are signed . 
  some restaurants are putting `` we do n't service russians '' signs . 
  many companies are dropping kaspersky av subsciptions in favour of non-russian made solutions , every newspaper article online about increased price of food , plunging ruble etc. 
  has 100s of `` keep crashin ! '', 
  `` serves them well . '', 
  `` they totally deserve it '' comments ... 
  sad , kinda sad . 
  the only thing you 'll see on internal borders of schengen treaty countries are roadsigns `` welcome to country_name '' - there is no-one there to check anything . 
  of course . 
  that 's actually what remote villages , that are n't connected to gas grid are doing . 
  after small modification you can connect bottle to ordinary kitchen stove - just switch the bottle every few months ( depends on usage ) . 
  many modern flats do n't use gas at all , in favor of electrical stoves . 
  personally i 'm planning to drop mine , since about 2/3 of my gas bill is not the actual usage itself , but various maintenance and transit monthly fees . 
  it 's pretty much the same situation as in poland and belarus here . 
  greece should stop being whiny bitch and try to think . 
  quite a few of our farmers are exporting fruits/vegetables/meat to belarus , where it gets stamped as belarusian produce and imported to russia without problem . 
  middle-man takes a cut , but since it 's end-users who are paying increased price anyway , we do n't give a fuck . 
  ( there 's lack of data on scale of that proceder , but export from belarus to russia last month rose 1,6 times for susages and diary almost doubled ... ), 
  poland does n't use gas for electricity - we have huge deposits of coal which is used in our power plants instead . 
  atom is long-term solution to safeguard our nation 's increase of demand for electricity . 
  gas is mostly used for cooking , industry ( fertilizers etc. 
  ) , and heating in suburban areas there 's big push for gaining more independence from russia 's gas and oil , ever since it became obvious that they are using it as a means of political pressure - we increased our storage tanks - we can last for 2-3 months on that reserves alone , even if 100 % of supply from russia were cut . 
  there have been some investment made to pipe infrastructure to make pipes `` two-way lanes '' that can transfer gas from west ( germany ) to us , in similar fashion as we are transfering gas to ukraine now . 
  finally , construction of lng ( compressed , liquid gas transported by tanker ships ) gasport in \u015awinouj\u015bcie is almost finished , which will let us import from countries like quatar . 
  there 's debate going on in poland now - four major energy sector companies signed an agreement and are starting building first commecrial nuclear plant in poland . 
  many people , including `` not in my back yard '' rednecks , russian shills and various pro-ecology organisations are protesting it . 
  pretty much the same situation as with shale gas . 
  '' * which roughly translates to * `` old highlander once have said , poland will span untill ural . 
  behind ural there 'll be china . 
  you 'll be gone , motherfuckers '' * ( sorry , i ca n't really rhyme it as in original version . ), 
  borders themselves - unlikely . 
  our south-eastern border is basically huge plains and forests area . 
  as soon as they reach some town , they will be picked up very quickly . 
  darker-skinned people really do stand out here . 
  few weeks ago , some vacationers from i think spain got questioned on train by border police , after anonymous tip from fellow passenger that they might be illegal migrants ... 
  we used to have similar problem ( obviously on lesser scale ) with chechen refugees trying to impose sharia law on georgians and ukrainians in camps . 
  eventually , someone got pissed off and made hidden cam video , showing them demanding women to `` cover up '' ( we had really hot summer this year ) , which prodded media into frenzy . 
  i think some local football hooligans took it on themselves to `` explain '' to new arrivals that this is europe and women need to be respected , but i have n't been following the case too closely . 
  ** tl ; dr : new laws got passed in poland , banning sales of various `` unhealthly '' food on school grounds . 
  predictably , students leave schools during recess to buy chips etc. 
  in nearby stores , while some turn profit by buying bagels in bulk and re-sell them to fellow students . 
  ** * ( title editorialized for clarity . 
  original title was `` kolach black market blooms in schools '' ) * full article translation : new law cleared school stores from unhealthy foods . 
  now veronica goes for buns to food store located next to the school , and charles buys from a colleague who before school supplies in a bakery , and then semi-legally sells in the corridor . 
  during the long break in lublin v lo it is almost empty . 
  some students still benefit from nice weather and go out . 
  the others stand in queues in the local shops . 
  - most people come near the 12 , when they have a 20 minute break . 
  sometimes queue end up on the stairs . 
  at the beginning i wondered why there 's such a turnover , then i found out about this law about school shops - says anna from the bakery on maria curie-sklodowska street , which is located right next to the school . 
  students are buying mainly donuts , danishes and coke , which is what the shops are no longer selling . 
  in the picture - the school shop 's offer in ii lo in lublin according to the minister of health from 1 september 2015 year , schools have to sell only healthy food . 
  without salt , sugar , white bread . 
  the list of `` banned '' products is long . 
  during the breaks on shopping - i agree with that chips should not be in the shops , but who had problems with cereal bars ?

  you do appear to have less , how shall i say , quality control than germany in that regard , though . 
  if someone here has a license to do anything , including shooting a gun , you can be confident they know what they 're doing . 
  ( well , exclude military , maybe , i almost shot my commanding officer once ... ), 
  there 's an incredible amount of leftist , socialist , communist , whatever thought written by very intelligent people - read that as something opposed to your world view , not clowns like wsws . 
  i recommend starting with sarte 's short stories , i love those . 
  show me one single incident of a sane homosexual abusing someone due to a belief of heterosexuality being inferior . 
  that is a _ completely _ false equivalency . 
   yet you exclusively post a list of actions aimed against refugees not even that , they include things that clearly were not actions against refugees ( such as someone simply going nuts ) and cliche manipulation tactics like attorney quotes about how their defendant is n't guilty ( well , _ duh _ ) . 
  the bias evident from the first day 's description sufficed to turn me off reading the rest . 
  well , yeah - see above , i consider extremism a sane opinion ( just with dubious axioms ) . 
  that 's different from committing apparently extremist acts because you have severe psychological problems . 
  mixing up insanity and `` insanity '' is aggravating to me . 
  there 's little to be found on her because she got most publicity due to a single action , but looking at this : http://www.cbn.com/cbnnews/world/2014/march/brave-german-woman-why-heidi-mund-rebuked-islam-/ ... she seems quite sane and actually not unlike my mother 's side of the family ( as mentioned above ) . 
  particularly her advocacy of sola scriptura would resonate with my family , and she does n't appear to be in favor of violence or the like . 
  so she would be a pretty good face to put on `` christian extremism in germany '' as i described it . 
  i 'm not so sure whether there 's an american influence to this - calvinism originated from switzerland , after all , and although the reasons are lost in time my relatives stem from that general direction . 
  that there are partly similar ideas in the us may just be coincidental from a theological pov - my grandmother as the family 's `` religious center '' actually despises the `` loud '' kind of christianity you find in us megachurches . 
   fifa investigates how to make a title hilarious in just two words . 
  do n't rely on votes to judge people 's sentiments on this sub any more - i 've made that mistake several times myself , but as it turns out _ absurd _ misinterpretations of my comments were usually to blame . 
  extremists of any kind will just read what they want to , and / r/europe is a battleground for all kinds of ... intellectually interesting people right now . 
   not even joking . 
  no , but seriously , you were joking , right ? 
  neither of you have apparently read this thread ... no reason to not circlejerk about being victimized , though , right ? 
  hm , i admittedly have no idea where i went - i had no place to sleep so after exploring the center , i just walked in one direction . 
  but i probably did n't come close to actual suburbs considering the size of the city . 
  thanks for explaining !, 
  `` disallowed comments : agenda pushing '' ? 
  that seems , uh , somewhat broad . 
  i like that you clarified some of the rules - more specifics were direly needed - , but why counteract your intentions with something like this ? 
  an addendum clarifying what that actually means and when it will be applied might be a good idea . 
  finding some neutral description of their politics is pretty much impossible , but judging from their vocabulary ( `` mitteldeutschland '' as the historical term for the current east ) , they appear to advocate the kleindeutsche loesung , i. e. reclaiming some territories in today 's poland and czech republic . 
  but as i said , that 's not _ quite _ as extreme as it might seem at first glance , it was a widely held opinion ( or at least hope ) by the political center for decades after the war . 
  and by `` sensitive '' , i did n't mean `` it 's a problem to talk about '' , i meant `` it 's a problem if you destroy it '' . 
  see our reaction to versailles , for example - a large part of the anger was because the treaty was perceived as an attempt to undo what the revolutions of the 1800s had accomplished . 
  same goes for the soviet partition . 
  our entire concept of a nation is built on events like the 1848 revolution , the hambach festival or the wartburg festival , all of which were based on defiantly talking about `` greater germany '' in opposition to the small kingdoms and princedoms of the time . 
  any german will have images like [ this ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/77/hambacher_fest_1832.jpg ) burned into their memory if they paid any attention in history class at all . 
  i 'm not sure what the npd 's policy is on this , but historically , there have been several concepts about the definition of the german nation . 
  most included eastern prussia , for example , i. e. what 's currently polish territory ; it was n't that long ago that even the left let go of the idea of reuniting these places with germany . 
  ( edit : and including austria was actually opposed by a substantial number of them because integrating vienna 's political power would have been challenging at the time . 
  google kleindeutsche / grossdeutsche loesung for a more thorough explanation . ), 
  unity is a _ very _ sensitive topic in germany in general since all of our major political changes in the 1800s dealt with the concept in one way or another . 
  afaik ( from reading my mother 's psychiatry and psychology journals and books ) , the disorder really is much more prominent in men - for whatever reason , the political climate probably makes research in that field somewhat difficult . 
  wtf , helsinki is dangerous ?!, 
  i absolutely loved walking through the city at night , one of the most beautiful sceneries i 've ever seen . 
  i even spent some time chatting with the bums at the central station , very lovely people . 
  that was in 2007 or so , has it changed since or was i simply being stupidly naive ? 
  ku klux klan in schwaebisch hall ? 
  that sounds like an absurd joke - swabia is one of the most catholic regions in germany . 
  that alone should show how extremely limited their reach was ( as the article mentions ) . 
  of course there are isolated pockets of just about any kind of extremist in just about any country , that i have to admit . 
  but that 's not really worth talking about exactly due to that universal nature . 
  i summed up those pockets under `` mental spectrum '' because i do think that such thoughts are n't usually sane and based on reason ( unlike actual extremism like al quaeda , gladio or raf ) but so detached from reality that they qualify someone as `` crazy '' . 
  but those are semantics , nothing worth arguing about . 
  and future developments may of course bring on a very different situation , we 're at a _ very _ volatile point right now and it 's hard to make any predictions . 
  funny that you think it must have been me - i consider your viewpoint naive , but i only downvote people who are malicious . 
  ( check your righteousness privilege and all that . ), 
  and of course , your statement did n't come across as _ exclusively _ describing your local perception ; that would be rather uninteresting , so people are going to extend its meaning to your perception of your region or country . 
  yeah , i 'm literally fearing for my life every time i walk through munich at night ... 
  i was saying that christians _ that _ radical simply do n't exist in germany outside of the mental spectrum . 
  i come from a family of fairly radical christians myself , but they 're simply die-hard calvinists ( in tendency , not literally ) and could n't harm a fly , and i 've never met anyone with more extreme views on religion . 
  anyone who 'd literally try to kill someone to `` save the messiah '' _ must _ be insane in this country . 
  ( and most others . ), 
  both `` discussions '' are equally stupid , too ... 
  i know quite a lot of people who own guns ( hunters ) , and they 're _ extremely _ careful with them . 
  in fact , german policy about firearm safety is so thorough and requires so much education that i think we would n't see any problems even if we were much more liberal about who 's allowed to own a gun . 
  ah , alright , `` i love him '' seemed to suggest you were aware of him before . 
  you may be confusing ahmad and ahmed mansour ? 
  it would be surprising if a brit knew this guy , and the ahmed one is british . 
  that sounds more like he found a convenient outlet for serious mental problems that cold and calculated politics . 
  `` i 'm saving the messiah '' , really ? 
   `` according to the german legal code , therapists are forbidden from revealing anything that happens in the context of treatment , '' said laura kuhle , a clinical psychologist and one of dunkelfeld 's therapists . 
  `` if people mention anything in therapy that could make them criminally culpable , they are protected . 
  in other countries , that 's not the case . '' that ca n't be stressed enough in the general context of psychotherapy . 
  i just naturally assumed that at least my insurance would be aware of my diagnoses before i talked about it in length with my psychiatrist , but as it turns out , there 's absolutely nobody but the therapist themselves and an independent reviewer who receives an anonymized report who knows anything about you unless you explicitly sign off on it . 
  all even the insurance receives is an unspecific `` medically necessary '' or `` unnecessary '' statement . 
  maybe that 'll help dispel some fears people may have about psychotherapy . 
  as i said , that 's probably due to local reasons - either you take less refugees than other places or they just are n't as visible because you may have had a lot of foreigners before . 
  the influx is _ very _ visible in rural regions where the population was completely homogenous before ( save for a few turks , greeks , italians ) . 
  in my grandmother 's village , there are now as many migrants as natives - no way to overlook this . 
  it 's very funny to see an american defiantly using another country as an example of urbanization gone wrong . 
  heute straightforwardly reported this as `` a past allegation of corruption '' . 
  it may be the biggest stunt the titanic ever pulled , which really means something . 
  reactionary has two translations - `` the ones acting in response '' and `` the ones trying to push back to the past '' . 
  ( `` re '' in this context can mean `` back '' both as a description of manner and time . ), 
  but it 's so often abused ideologically that it 's not a very useful term in general . 
  you 're maybe looking for `` structurally conservative '' - people who 'd like to preserve the factual state ( often of the past ) instead of seeing towards its values being preserved like value conservatives . 
  \\  germany \\  conservatism top kek . 
  most we get is a centrist party and some retarded loudmouths on the fringe , neither of which would qualify as `` conservative '' in summary . 
  the union - and to a lesser extent , even social democrats - do have wings that would , but that there 's a variety amongst them is probably a non-statements as it applies to all parties everywhere . 
  ( same goes for the population , there 's of course a wide variety of approaches to conservatism . ), 
  oh ffs , yes , i remembered one specific wording one but the rest of what i said obviously is n't touched by that - claiming it does makes zero sense . 
  now go away . 
  i already said i 'm not interested in repeating that ordeal , and you do n't exactly make me more inclined . 
  so what 's your point in smugly confronting me ? 
  bismarck was likely mulch by 1908 . 
  i 'd very much like that , too , but unfortunately you 'd have to be some kind of universal genius or a large group of scientifically-minded people to compile such a report . 
  neither is going to happen , especially when all official stats ( at least in germany ) only describe one very particular aspect of the situation without putting it into context . 
  ... huh ? 
  that means absolutely nothing , your city may just not have an asylum center for whatever reason .

  and in this case , this is being defended by people who consider their culture superior and are proud of our ` civilization ' .

  that is true , however , many nazis in high positions ( that did some serious shit ) were put into high positions after the war . 
  this is contested since sometimes there was simply nobody else left to do the job .

  germany you have catholic and protestant lessons in school . 
  some states also have islam now . 
  i had to take one of those until we were able to choose the subject ` ethics ' which was much better ( going from 10th grade ) we discussed kant , rawls and others while the other students in ` catholic religion ' were busy doing esoteric dances and creating massage oils .

  who ? 
  erdogan or \u00d6zdemir ? 
  sure , that 's why i stressed that * one person * can live by that `` normally '' . 
  i am a student , so it 's different ofc . 
  my health insurance comes with the family , other insurances as well , etc. . 
  when i said i have much less , it included all that . 
  of course i get support from my parents and i have 2 jobs next to being full-time student . 
  what is left after rent , internet , electricity , water , gez , phonebill etc. 
  is enough for booze and holidays . 
  that was my point . 
  i ride a bike . 
  daaamn , 980 $ , i wish i was as poor as that . 
  one person can live by that perfectly fine in germany imo . 
  i have much less as a student and it 's enough for stuff , booze and holidays . 
  and i live in the most expensive part . 
  exactly . 
  how can the countries that are in the worst economic condition deal with the huge amount of refugees without relying on the help of the other member states ? 
  it 's ridiculous and everybody knows it . 
  we need legal processes and equal distribution among member states . 
  regarding your edit : i was just googling hidden champions and mittelstand . 
  first thing that came up basically . 
   no , you are thinking of the chicken tax thing : http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/sb125357990638429655?mg=reno64-wsj&amp;url=http%3a%2f%2fonline.wsj.com%2farticle%2fsb125357990638429655.html     it effects vans . 
  otherwise we get cars from everywhere . 
  / u/shoryukenist has already answered to that , i made clear enough that i wasnt sure . 
  right . 
  but wait for the people screaming ` but crysis !, 
  and anno ! '',

  no shit i was n't even aiming for `` did nazi that coming '' joke . . 
  sorry if you got it wrong . 
  quite new to reddit . 
   as for the actual discussion , i actually believe that applies to the whole planet . 
  call me a radical leftist , but i 'm strongly opposed to big capital , big wealth , big countries , big corporations , big banks . 
  in my view , it just begs for trouble and bullying around . 
  if everyone has a more equal footing , the benefits would be immense . 
  well in that case we have nothing to disagree on . 
  hm , i ca n't see that complex to be honest . 
  and the article itself is from an american/canadian perspective . 
  but thanks for clearing that up .

  my bad . 
  in that case , map 's key is at least slightly misleading . 
  probably this : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/wymysorys_language tl ; dr some weird ass germanic language which is a left-over after dutch settlers in medieval times . 
  did n't you even bother to read the key ? 
  your word comes from celtic which is not exactly latin , is it ? 
  if your myths & epics are ancient then what about indus valley civilization and mesopotamians ? 
  damn , turns out that romans and greeks do n't have exclusive right to be described as ancient . 
  what 's the point , sooner or later the russians will come and deport us to siberia . 
  if we 're lucky . 
  generally your right , but in this context it does not matter . 
  one of three italian dishes that typical northernen knows is spaghetti bolognese . 
  the point remains, 
  when a northerner says spaghetti , he actually means the sauce . 
  aim higher , helsinki-tricity tunnel would be admired even by the chinese .

  what about german minority in the polish sejm ? 
  usa is on pair with china in that matter . 
  anyways , what rosti meant is that conservatives of eastern europe beli ... oh , i 've written that much before i noticed your nick . 
  not really . 
  their leader , kaczy\u0144ski , has said that there is no possibility of poland leaving eu . 
  not sure about visa part , but finding a job as a web developer with more than 3 + years of experience is as painless as buying a loaf of bread . 
  it is n't . 
  poland is one of the most euroenthusiastic countries . 
  one exception is euro - most of the poles believe that we should join common currency once we are as wealthy as germany , because otherwise we would end up as another greece or portugal . 
  yes 2 . 
  no b no 5 . 
  according to polish army - no 6 . 
  no i hope all my noes are n't that meaningless . 
  if you steal german made cars in poland then the victim was in poland at the time of the crime ( which was also commited in poland ) . 
  stop polonization of europe !, 
  you know that 's polish anthem , right ? 
  he was his great-grandfather actually . 
  transit tourists ? 
  like ford transit ? 
  you 're looking at this from different angle than me . 
  it 's worse for you if you got 20 % of your 10 million country emigrate than if 2 % of 100 million country leave it . 
  also , it 's better if you have 2 million foreign nationals from diverse places than if you have 2 million migrants from one country . 
  it makes it harder to assimilate them . 
  they should 've used percentage . 
  there 's slightly more poles living abroad than germans , but germany 's population is twice as big as poland 's . 
  not to mention portugal . 
  not really , we have to change our constitution in order to adopt the euro . 
  good luck with that . 
  as a human who knows others i deduce that we should aim for simpler solutions and choose c # . 
  not really , it just depends on languages you know already . 
  since i 'm polish , german is far easier for me . 
  and make the uk pay for it !, 
  fuck you iceland , i 've cried because of you , even though the only thing i 've understood was `` yeaaaa !, 
  yeaaaa !, 
  yeaaaa ! '', 
  too bad the only way we can play each other is to go through to the final . 
  for me daily mirror 's front page is the most sensationalist of them all . 
  nothing 's as catastrofic as a picture of a black hole , come on !, 
  seriously ? 
  i 've always thought that y' all be afraid to be dominated by us if such a union came into place . 
  i do n't think that serbia is that different from poland , croatia or , especially , bulgaria . 
  they are ready to access real soon . 
  try writing to polish ex-commies . 
  they 'd be more than happy to restore prl ( peoples republic of poland = polska republika ludowa -  prl ), 
  do n't flatter yourselves , you were by no means the first . 
  https://www.wikiwand.com/en/corsican_constitution https://www.wikiwand.com/en/cardinal_laws and one may argue that magna carta and henrician articles were constitutions , too . 
  tl ; dr ` murica was n't the first , sorry not sorry . 
  wow , i thought our policy was a joke . 
  turns out we ca n't call it zero tolerance policy anymore, 
  yeah , but what were your law during interbellum and as a soviet republic ? 
  iirc ii rp and polish communists never made a law about sexual orientation . 
  it 's not that they legalised it , they just avoided the problem . 
  would n't be so sure . 
  so what does heavy flooding look like ? 
  yes , but that 's just single company 's policy , not an eu-wide law . 
  i do n't buy on steam . 
  the trick is to make them believe that your country is ruled according to those ideas . 
  it will guarantee that we 'll have the most ` z 's in the whole world . 
  that 's something , innit ?

  it does n't mean that they were . 
  well , poland is a huge manufacturer of german car parts and cars as general . 
  volkswagen pozna\u0144 employs almost 7,000 people .

  in reality , it 's not true . 
  tractors made us more wealthy by enabling more people to do different thing than growing crops for survival . 
  compare how what it took to be a software developer in '80 and what it takes now . 
  modern tools allow you to create software with an unprecedented ease , thanks to the exceptionally gifted ( compared to the whole human population ) pioneers of this field . 
  being able to supervise work of robots is an extremely easy thing to learn . 
  imo 20 engineers in a german factory is better than a thousand workers . 
  just like 100 office clerks are better than 1000 factory workers . 
  and 1000 factory workers are better than 10000 farmers . 
  a those farmers are far better than even bigger number of hunters-gatherers . 
  that 's what progress is about , low-efficent and low-paid positions are being replaced by higher-paid ones . 
  and today , since our societies are shrinking , we do n't even have to have 100 % replacement rate, 
  not really , tribes that invaded romans were bunch of primitive , hungry and frightened men . 
  they were seeking after better and safer life far from huns and other nomadic invaders . 
  nazi germany is an example that a bancrupt and mostly unemployed nation can turn its country from economical ruin into a military complex in matter of few years . 
  they wanted to better they life conditions by subjucation of other peoples . 
  border protection ( i think we can all agree that maginot line was pretty tough ) did n't save france , did it ? 
  nor did it save romans , dare i say .

do consider though that it likes to influence politics and is happy to use its bank to do the mafia dirty work . 
  do you know of any examples ? 
  i 'm genuinely curious . 
  italians here are so anti-theist that they would n't even want to support the church that accounts for a huge chunk of their yearly tourism . 
  have you ever seen how well attended the weekly papal masses are ? 
  also throw in the various church holidays throughout the year that attract even more people . 
  you should n't complain , italy probably makes back double from the amount of tourism in the vatican . 
  not everyone wants to be as progressive as you . 
  sounds like you ca n't handle the banter . 
  people are skeptical of an ideology that dictates the destruction of our societies . 
  atheism is a cancer that destroys a functioning society . 
  wikipedia uses some old statistics , but now the estimates say that there 's [ 300,000-400 ,000 ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/may/13/ukraines-refugees-find-solace-in-poland-europes-most-homogenous-society ) of them here . 
  i doubt that will happen , though .

  u/johnnashlover  father michael doyle said the seven went to the pub in quay street to celebrate the ordination of father peter mclaren at cardiff metropolitan cathedral of st david near queen street . 
  he said it was a double celebration because fr mclaren was the second to be ordained to the priesthood in a week . 
  nope , catholics worship neither . 
  we worship god alone . 
   idolatrous worship of saints saints are the perfect role models of how christians should live their lives . 
  we ask for their intercession , which is like asking a friend to pray for you . 
  https://www.catholic.com/tract/the-intercession-of-the-saints  relics relics help us recall the particular person that we 're asking to intercede on our behalf in our prayers to god . 
  those are n't contradictions , the website uses out of context straw man arguments that can easily be refuted . 
  tell me which one you find most convincing and i will show you that there 's no contradiction . 
  god . 
  you have to look at the context , beginning in genesis where god gives dominion to man and man decides to follow satan thus giving dominion to him . 
  however , god is more powerful than satan and he still owns the earth . 
  i will certainly be praying for you and i hope that you repent from your nihilistic outlook . 
  it 's not a good way to live . 
  it 's nice to see you here . 
  you 're definitely right . 
   primordial soup , billions of years of evolution right , but where did that all come from , that first organism ? 
  what created it ? 
  i 'm curious to find out what theory you subscribe to . 
   average by what standards ? 
  these are the teachings of the church . 
   a fanatic a fanatic for christ , sure . 
   i do n't really care interesting . 
  what do you think is the origin of life ? 
   15 he said to them , `` but who do you say that i am ? '' 16 simon peter answered , `` you are the messiah , the son of the living god . '' 17 and jesus answered him , `` blessed are you , simon son of jonah !, 
  for flesh and blood has not revealed this to you , but my father in heaven . 
  18 and i tell you , you are peter , and on this rock i will build my church , and the gates of hades will not prevail against it . 
  19 i will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven , and whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven , and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven . '' ( matthew 16:15 -19 ), 
  thanks . 
   may god bless you and feel free to pm me if you have any questions about the faith . 
  nope , i 'm just an average catholic . 
   that makes you a misogynistic , homophobic , racist ethnic cleanser and a religious terrorist . 
  before you declare me as all of those , we have to make a distinction between the old testament ( old covenant ) and the new testament ( new covenant ) . 
  the old testament is binding to the people that it was delivered to , the jews . 
  we as christians follow the new testament . 
  thus , you do n't see us following laws such as those that enforce certain diets or clothing . 
  that 's why i love it when people who do n't know much about the bible use straw man arguments and call christians hypocrites because we eat shellfish or wear clothes from mixed fabrics . 
   people who actually have read the bible also know that jesus said that all those horrible laws of the old testament are still valid for his followers . 
  where did he say that and which laws ? 
  refer to the point i made above . 
  the nicene creed ratified what the majority of christians already believed , what was written in scripture and it refuted the arian heresy ( which a small minority of christians believed and was a rather new concept at the time ) . 
  also for / u/narwi, 
  wtf i 'm a heterodox christian now, 
  there 's no contradictions in the bible , it 's the word of god . 
  that 's why i 'm asking them to give me a verse that they believe is a contradiction and i will clarify it . 
   your assumption that bible should be followed word for word and that religion should n't change to suit modern times is just that - an arbitrary assumption . 
  god 's teachings are eternal and they are not confined to a single time period . 
  what exactly do you define as ` modern times ' and why should this period nullify the teachings that have been accepted for thousands of years ? 
   just like the idea that a lesbian could be a priest is just an arbitrarily decided rule . 
  what 's your reasoning for this ? 
  the definition of marriage , condemnation of sodomy and the nature of the priesthood is clearly addressed in the bible . 
  even a child that has read scripture will tell you the same thing . 
   your saviour he died for all of us , this includes you . 
   you are encouraged to accept him . 
  christs reaffirms that marriage is between a man and a woman : * `` he answered , ` have you not read that he who made them from the beginning made them male and female , ' and said , ` for this reason a man shall leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife , and the two shall become one ' ? '', 
  ( matthew 19:4 -5 ) he reaffirms genesis 2:24 , where god institutes marriage to be between a man and a woman : * `` therefore a man leaves his father and his mother and cleaves to his wife , and they become one flesh . '', 
  ( genesis 2:24 ) as for female clergy , we just have to look at the actions of christ . 
  he ordained his twelve male apostles to the priesthood just as they ordained males to be their successors . 
  this apostolic succession has continued until today . 
   `` christian '' what makes you you think i am not a christian ? 
  i still do not see any contradictions in that list . 
  which verses do you mean ? 
  then can you enlighten me as to which dogmas , doctrines of teachings of christ were changed or contradicted during these councils ? 
  the answer is : none . 
   the purpose of an ecumenical council is to define doctrine , reaffirm truths of the faith , and extirpate heresy . 
  yeah , but in this case the finnish op referred to christianity . 
  everyone has a chance to repent . 
  could you provide a coherent argument for why you think so ? 
  the first link i clicked on there directed me to a site with the title : ` possible gay stories in the bible ' . 
  that 's not specific and this lets me know the entire website is based on straw man arguments . 
  if he thinks the bible contradicts itself , then i 'd love to discuss the examples he has in mind . 
   homosexuality/lesbianism * `` for this reason god gave them up to dishonorable passions . 
  their women exchanged natural relations for unnatural , and the men likewise gave up natural relations with women and were consumed with passion for one another , men committing shameless acts with men and receiving in their own persons the due penalty for their error '' ( rom . 
  * `` just as sodom and gomorrah and the surrounding cities , which likewise acted immorally and indulged in unnatural lust , serve as an example by undergoing a punishment of eternal fire '' ( jude 7 ) . 
  * `` do you not know that the unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of god ? 
  do not be deceived ; neither the immoral , nor idolaters , nor adulterers , nor sexual perverts , nor thieves , nor the greedy , nor drunkards , nor revilers , nor robbers will inherit the kingdom of god '' ( 1 cor . 
  there 's many more examples like this . 
   female clergy women have their own roles within the church , but being priests is not one of them .

  so close , so close !, 
  that was too recondite for me . 
  makes some sense , in that case . 
  get a room you two , sheesh .

  the above puerile vernacular may have been prompted by my mind still reeling from the discovery i made earlier today - that of the so-called [ `` trap '' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/trap_music ) music , which had been mentioned to me by a considerably younger member of our glorious populace , which i - as information-addicted sophomaniacs such as me are wont to do - in my never-ending quest for discovery and enlightenment had to investigate . 
  suffice to say , i was later lead to such masterpieces of contemporary culture as [ `` turn down for what '' ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmudvmiitou ) , which in turn reminded me of the fact that ninja and \u00a5 o-landi , whom i had seen in the film `` chappie '' , were not just names of characters from aforementioned movie , but actual handles real people in the real fucking world use in reference to themselves , which ended with me stumbling upon [ `` i fink u freeky '' ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8uee_mcxvrw ) .

  ( i thought we were discussing the english version of the word used to denote the countries ; additionally , there are `` short '' country names and `` official '' country names - if you insist on `` the united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland '' , then you should also be okay with `` the czech republic '' ... oh , my , what a pickle we 've run ourselves into ), 
  it is my understanding that traditionally the uk is also called `` gro\u00dfbritannien '' in german .

  like who 'd be the aggressor , and how would the un be placated or side-stepped , or what to do about the back-lash , things like that . 
  well , i guess a prudent tourist would do their research before going somewhere : is it safe ( for someone like me ) ? 
  are the laws there drastically different than what i 'm accustomed to ?

  you 're wasting the opportunity to engage in dialogue and possibly make it plain to all around why `` colonialism 2.0 '' would not be a good idea , which is important - since there are people who think it is . 
  refute the points , then , instead of admonishing the poster indirectly .

  where did you even get that from what i said ? 
  man , it 's getting to the point that anytime a pole says anything people automatically assume we want to be the center of attention or whatever .

  i would like to see a europe where someone , who has been made `` redundant '' ( yes , i hear this term being bandied about in this subreddit all the time when referring to people of the working class ) , can go and better themselves and still be able to live a normal life . 
  i would like to see a europe that is n't just centered on france and germany . 
  i would also like to see a europe with some balls and not some spineless entity that just stands by and watches as a portion of ukraine gets annexed and we have a war going on in our own damn backyard . 
  can we get that ? 
  or is it just going to be more sabre rattling and everything will remain the same ?

  i suggest reading up on franklin delano roosevelt and just why the americans enacted term limits after him . 
  as long as the lgbt community 's right to boycott and campaign against such businesses is not interfered with , sure . 
  if , on the other hand , they have no choice , no means of pushing back against such discrimination due to unfavorable laws , then no . 
  those haircuts ... dudes look like they just stepped out from a photo shoot . 
  guess i 'm a racist then . 
  they do n't have segregation laws/ordinances backing them up so no , they do n't decide . 
  also , why would they decide such a thing ? 
  it would just drive customers away and put them out of business since people can freely boycott and use word of mouth to shut the company down . 
  so you 'd rather have the same person elected , however they get elected notwithstanding , over and over and over and over ? 
  also , europe tends to have some history of third , fourth , etc. 
  parties getting into power whereas the u.s. has been a two-party system so it 's not like the americans actually have that much to choose from . 
  their problem gets even more compounded when they 're told `` if you vote for this guy , you 're actually giving your vote to the person you do n't want in power '' .

  `` the spy who no longer loves me '' now in theatres !, 
   remember when a baker refused to bake lgbt propaganda cake in the uk or a printshop refused to print lgbt leaflets in poland ? 
  the people being discriminated against still have the choice to go to another business that will serve them the way they wish to be served , if we put aside the separate issue of discrimination . 
  if , for example , lgbt topics were to be censored then no baker or print shop would bake an lgbt cake or print a leaflet concerning lgbt topics . 
  under censorship you have no choice whereas if you do n't agree with a site 's terms of use you can use another site . 
  i never mentioned either of those points , i was simply bringing up the fact that people will protest against laws that are already in place , that 's all . 
  you do understand that the people in my example were protesting a law that was already in place . 
  it was already decided on , passed through all the necessary legislature already . 
  oh , they can criticize private companies , sure , but `` free speech '' is n't free on private property and `` censorship '' is usually the domain of the government and it 's enforced by law and you have no choice in the matter . 
  when you log onto facebook and the like , you are told what the terms of use are when using facebook and you have a choice to either abide by the agreement or not use facebook and other sites like it . 
  tl ; dr censorship is enforced by law , regulation of speech is agreed upon by both parties .

i 'm still surprised that an uninformed vote of a person who steals or murders has the same value as academic professor working on curing aids .

   well , what if the euro could be devalued as well ?

  introducing euro in pl is a suicide .

  because you know better than us . 
  what the fuck do we know . 
  because ukrainian government is a great government ? 
  if ukrainian government was great ukraine would be on the same level as polish or richer . 
  gdp per capita of ukraine and poland in 1991 was the same . 
  ukraine has good lands , very arable , big amount of resources which are not in use . 
  you had your chance . 
  and i do n't watch any rt or `` moscow books '' just trying to look at it from both perspectives . 
  russian , ukrainian and polish and polish statement is that it 's your buisness you need to fight for your country and we are supporting you , but you also need to listen local people from donbass , because what happen if ukraine win the war against separatist ? 
  it will have an antiukrainian land in ukraine , which will bring later consequences . 
  do n't be so angry mate . 
  just take some view . 
   i 'm sorry , that 's just plain ignorant . 
  it 's so hard to admit that your culture/language and history is nearly the same , the only difference is that you were conquered by lithuanians and russia by mongols and then become independent ? 
   declaring war on us and saying we 're an `` artificial nation '' is not friendship . 
  proposing to poland to `` carve us up '' like a fucking ham is not friendship . 
  holodomor was not friendship . 
  russification was not friendship . 
  as i said its politics ( btw putin did not declare war on ukraine ) but equiped the separatists from russia . 
  and now look at it from different perspective . 
  crimea and donbass are the russian populated regions of ukraine , where the people have extreme strong sentiment towards ussr ( even much bigger than in mainland russia !!!, 
  ) , because when ukraine became indpendent the gdp of this country dropped really hard and much more than russian , because russia had oil and natural gas . 
  those people are highly antiukrainian and hate ukrainian government who is robbing them . 
  they 'd rather die than be part of ukraine again . 
  why just ca n't live them own life ? 
  putin do n't want to take kiev and other ukrainian populated cities . 
  we need to look at it from different perspective and i do n't support terrorists from don , but why ukraine did n't gave them independence , or at least autonomy ? 
   that 's something i find hard to believe ? 
  the numbers i 've read earlier lead me to believe that was impossible without some new , major economic changes . 
  see chinese investments in other words . 
  but it 's not really hard to became economically independent . 
  countries usually trade with themselves and greenland is importing goods in large scale and will still import , due to climate and geographical location ( far from civilisation ) who know maybe they will find an oil resources ( i wish them ) and greenlandic life/culture and dishes are based mostly on the fishes . 
  iceland is selling pretty much a large amount of fished so will greenland . 
  pretty much it is . 
  baltic tribes occupied only the southern part of kievan rus while the eastern became independent , later ukraine was joined to poland . 
  i 'm not an expert but i thought russian separation from rus is due to vikings . . 
  is n't that true ? 
  regardless , ukrainians and russians are very similar and you should n't fight each other and hate because you are basically the same . 
  politics ruined your friendship . 
  for many people it 's saddening that upa are national heoroes of ukraine . 
  many of people hate ukrainians just because of that . 
  well i 've been to greenland once 2 years ago ( nuuk ) and i started to learn deeply about this country and government . 
  greenland is already trying to be free from danish funds and their government is doing everything to make greenland economically independent ( it nearly is now ) but for example the nuuk university is fully funded by denmark and the local people are even receiving a big scholarship , but only if they are the residents of greenland . 
  from danish perspective independent greenland is a lost territory , because denmark will feel smaller than it is with greenland . 
  but i support greenlandic independence because it 's nice to have a real american country . 
  that 's not true then . 
  what about big support to ukraine during maidan/donbass war ? 
  ehh what country are you from ? 
  russia and ukraine both originates from former kievan rus . 
  ukraine was firstly part of polish-lithuanian commonweath and the name of ukraina comes from your geographic location , because in old polish `` ziemie u kraju '' meant ukraine , later it was just called ukraina and zaporo\u017ce . 
  after that ukraine became part of russia for quite a long time ( including soviet union ) russian people and culture and also russification influenced on ukrainians and ukrainian language . 
  i doubt nunavut will become independent , because it 's part of royal territories and greenland is pretty much a colony of denmark with 95 % of greenlanders ( which are deeply connected to inuit/eskimo people from northern canada ) and their government want to became independent from denmark . 
  putins ideology is entirely different from polish mentality . 
  we never thought and defined nations as `` real '' or `` artifcial '' look even silesians got `` nationality '' even if they are really artificial nation ( according to putins logic ) because they are mixture of polish , czech and german culture . 
  like ukraine is mixture of russian and polish . 
  even our worst nationalists do n't think of ukraine as a fake country . 
  that 's something to be proud of . 
  lw\u00f3w is a poverty-stricken city . 
  i 'd never want to have it back . 
  entirely ukrainian city ( by inhabitants ) with less than 10 % poles in it . 
  which is poorer than our poorest regions . 
  i ca n't even imagine how much money we would need to invest in it . 
  i do n't want to have it back even if my family is from there . 
  i wish ukraine will come to eu and schengen in 2040 there will be no borders between us and we will can visit this city every weekend . 
  lviv is not `` entirely different '' from lw\u00f3w , because it was one of the least destroyed polish towns . 
  and soviets/ukrainians did n't build anything worth . 
  there 's only bad roads , no new offices , no modern architecture , no newest places to hang out , or spend your time etc. 
  lw\u00f3w stay polish in it 's heart even if is not part of poland ( and i do n't want it to became part of poland ) country borders do n't define culture . 
  i wish lw\u00f3w stayed polish , but i do n't want to have it back now . 
  what would happen to them after war ? 
  will they be deported back to syria ? 
  i ca n't even imagine such country as lebanon with such number of refugees . 
  estonia can not into nordic aswell as can not into refugees, 
  how is their calculation wrong ? 
  please explain . 
  if the greenland became independent it will be the first native american country in whole americas and another country richer than us . 
  such is life .

  i do n't why you are suddenly jumping to attack pis which won elections just yesterday . 
  do you think by chance that the way pgej is working right now is ok ? 
  because for all these years of being active they provided nothing for vast investment of money . 
  he is not nazi sympathizer - he did that to compare ue to nazi government that wants to regulate everything . 
  people with nothing to lose and everything to gain will even go to jail . 
  in somalia pirates were taking over ships just to surrender and be trialed in france . 
  after x years they get out and have a right to stay in france . 
  so no , i do n't think that jail time in 1st world country will scare them . 
  for you jail is horrible thing because you have established life and a career that can be damaged by having a jail on your record . 
  my solution is to help border countries patch up their borders . 
  work with turkey so they can afford to patrol coast and stop migrant boats as soon as they leave shore . 
  if your ship is sinking , you should n't take a water out with a bucket , but first try to patch up a hole in hull . 
  first stop the influx of migrants . 
  then focus on trying to deal with them . 
  definetely what you want to do is to spread them out . 
  and to do that you should build mosques all over the place . 
  otherwise muslims will relocate or clump in areas with mosques . 
  then you have a lot ghettos forming up and this is the worst situation you want to be in , because this prevents/slows down integration . 
  shit , i would even provide them with free basic cable so that their children watch dubbed cartoons and grow accustomed to local culture and older folks have exposure to language . 
  we are in deep shit and germany will have to spend a shit ton of money to fix this situation . 
  you do realize , that po-established company meant to build nuclear power plant in poland is there only to provide high salaries to it 's employees ? 
   i do not care . 
  that 's the part of problem - people demand solutions but are n't coming up with ideas and their implementation . 
  only orban does . 
   either deport them or put them for 5 -10 years in jail because they are criminals . 
  if you put them in jail , after 5-10 years they will stay in germany anyway . 
  because by that time they will learn german and they will be able to work through bureaucracy necessary to stay . 
  so in 5-10 years you will have an army of people coming into society who were first traumatized by war and then lived through prison life . 
  does this sound like a good scenario to you ? 
  keep up good work guys and stand up to leftist idiots in western europe . 
  we just changed our government that was bending to germany . 
  we are still not fully sure what will be the position on this issue from new ruling party . 
  - with love , poland, 
  deported where ? 
  most people do n't have legal papers since germany shouted `` everyone welcome '' . 
   and if a refugee does not like the country he is getting to and wants to germany for example he can go but will not get any support oh boy , i can not see any way this may end wrong . 
  oh wait - i do . 
  it 's called increased crime rates in germany since illegal migrants can not work legally . 
  i 'm just feeling good , that in the end it 's germany who will get shafted for their own doings . 
  worst thing is - in polish media this subject was non-existent since we just had election and we just kicked bunch of incompetent idiots off the pedestal . 
  i emailed three polish meps . 
  i got no response . 
  they do n't give a fuck - they are there only to get rich . 
  i saw that they are sending the same english e-mail to meps from all countries . 
  so i took liberty of quick translation of polish e-mail . 
  if you could please check it and correct it , so i can forward it to the authors of this website . 
  i still do n't get it - how can you pay in us such massive sums for studying such bullshit topic as gender studies . 
  it gives you no real-life skills besides complaining . 
  why would n't they though ? 
  center burns down , the government needs to relocate them to the hotel . 
  i 'm sure hotels are much nicer than centers . 
  and it does n't take all asylum seekers to set fire to the center - you need only one person . 
  how do you know if these were caused by swedes ? 
  they as well might be caused by migrants from another center or even people living there , that wanted to be moved to hotels for some period of time . 
  he did n't break a law just `` a bit '' . 
  he broke it quite significantly . 
  he had 300 bottles . 
  they are breaking a law . 
  and that 's a fact . 
  too bad the food is made of the same material as furniture . 
  as i was reading your comment i anticipated that you will say that the solution is to make young people poor to make them procreate . 
  lol , cry me a river mate . 
  everyone gets their criticism here , it was just never about uk . 
  it was n't politicians that decided to do brexit , referendum of the nation did . 
  you did stupid shit , you get criticism . 
  plus , your nation wants to separate from unified europe , so why would give two shits about your feelings ? 
  want to go , then go , you have every right to do so . 
  oh man , i remember baldurs gate . 
  was there ever a game that had better translation / localization ? 
  i really liked pink panther game - they got popular singers to record songs . 
  i found it impressive . 
  solidarity is now dead - walesa turned out to be a scam , and solidarity is now run by old farts that want to stay relevant . 
  countryside is nice and you are right there . 
  but everyone is sitting at home due to weather , 
   britain  clean you clearly have n't visited any city in uk , am i right ? 
  they behave like pigs - they drop everything to the ground because there is someone paid to pick it up . 
  when cheap labor moves out they are in for a big wake up call because of their habits . 
  if by wrong religion you mean islam . 
  yes , it 's very toxic and completely oppressive ideology . 
  same goes for christianity , which is still going strong in the east , but younger generation is slowly getting rid of this weight . 
  they can . 
  that they hate russians . 
  i can see a rift of eu splitting into east and west side . 
  east side being visegrad group lead by poland . 
  yeah , because brits will just buy british made cars made out of british steel from tata . 
  lol, 
   federation lol nope . 
  it sort of works in us because it 's all the same culture . 
  it might sort of work in russia , because they have military power . 
  but it wo n't work in europe because we are too different . 
  and in current shape it 's going to be more of a 4th reich for germonies than democracy . 
  just put it in place . 
  what 's so difficult ? 
  you do n't like those guys anyway , right ?

  apparently some of the knowledge can be lost , e.g. 
  maybe there 's no reason for investing many military crashes . 
  i mean `` yep , it got hit with a missile '' kind of thing . 
  especially if it falls on enemy-controlled territory . 
  people on the internet * say that 10 % of motivated population is enough to start a revolution . 
  [ * ] claims completely unsourced . 
  it 's a little-green-men insurance . 
  i was sure it 's a joke , but looking at the flair i 'm not 100 % sure . 
  czechia is another name for czech republic . 
   not taking the pills would indicate at least some amount of doubt . 
  or just being a lazy person . 
  as friend-of-friend kind of thing i know about people going to czechia or sweden for abortion . 
  it 's probably googlable . 
  they had less 38 % of votes and got over 50 % of seats . 
  if it were direct democracy then yes . 
  otherwise no . 
  in indirect democracy somebody has to stop the nutjob who got a majority of seats . 
   they do n't break the law yes , they did . 
  that 's the whole point . 
  for some reason people believe that something feeling right makes it the right choice . 
  somehow they lack basic understanding of cause and effect . 
  only upper ( not lower ) silesia has any kind of separate identity . 
  area in the lower part of poland should be at least a half smaller .

  w is two leters v , like vv .

  you 're not talking about global warming , but sea levels rising as a result of global warming . 
  there 's a lot of ice * above * sea level , because ice floats . 
  greenland was not green during viking times . 
  ice sheet is ~ 100 000 years old . 
  it means that it have n't melted to the ground in that many years . 
  last ice age was ~ 20 000 years ago . 
  there were n't any vikings back then . 
  it 's called greenland for `` hey guys , go explore there and leave us alone '' reasons . 
  in 90s they were much friendlier and people thought we could cooperate .

  any big organisation is pita when it comes to requirements .

  should n't we talk only about victmis and make sure the voice of attackers is never heard ? 
  people do n't realize that if you drink anything below 36 degrees your body will have to warm it up and use energy to do this .

  po does not represent interests of poland - that is why they lost the elections . 
  ( post soviet corruption just like in our judiciary system ) . 
  he does n't work in cooperation with polish government and for polish economic interest . 
  that in my opinion makes him at least a `` non patriot '' . 
  in poland we ( majority of poles ) see him as a german pawn . 
  & nbsp ; ps . 
  there is nothing wrong in that germany are trying to improve economical situation of it citizens - but polish politicians should do the same thing - thats why we ( together ) created european parlimen - to have place where we can discuse future of our countries .

  `` hate never yet dispelled hate . 
  only love dispels hate . 
  this is the law , ancient and inexhaustible . 
  you too shall pass away . 
  knowing this , how can you quarrel ? '',

  even if you knew all about the coming war nothing could be done . 
  i think even north korea has better future potential , obviously assuming the collapse of their idiotic regime . 
  ukraine would need an actual miracle to get even to the current level of poland/lithuania , like finding big amounts of oil . 
  but then maybe that would cause russia to fully invade lol . 
   in most countries bank bonds are held by big institutional investors , who know the risks and can afford the loss . 
  but in italy , thanks in part to a quirk of the tax code , some $ 200 billion of bank bonds are held by retail investors . 
  when a few small banks were patched up under the new rules in november , one retail bondholder committed suicide . 
  forcing the rest of the population , many of which have no assets or income , to bailout those that had something is even worse . 
  if they wanted no risk they should have used government-insured accounts , presumably with lower return . 
  also favoring some investors over others based on temporary political circumstances is a fundamental break of the rule of law . 
  now the group of small investors is very big , so their interests win , but if the loss was localized ( like one city ) , the same regard of law would lead to big investors having more political clout and win . 
  well the closest current real life version of that is switzerland  much closer , but historical - america before civil war . 
  i think something like that will emerge in europe on its own eventually , centrifugal forces in eu and individual countries are getting stronger in almost every aspect with two major upheavals coming ( demographic - ageing society + major local ethnic changes , and technological - widespread automation ) . 
  it 's not popular because almost nobody actually wants that result - they want their version of ideal society to be the norm everywhere . 
  sadly overwhelmingly some version of socialism . 
  the only realistic alternative is an actual ussr-style police state , but that seems unlikely to happen ( not for lack of trying i expect ) . 
  `` warns '' lol . 
  the main problem of the eu is not enough diversity and too big countries ( france and germany in particular ) . 
  true diversity , as in many law systems and cultures , not ` diversity ' as a one giant uniform multiracial blob with no differences except for colors of the flag . 
  ideal union would have room for one small state with sharia law and another one with minimal libertarian state with no income tax and legality of all drugs . 
   i suppose it 's because romania/romani people sounds somewhat similar it 's because leftist media reports every crime by gypsies ( or any other protected minority ) as ` romanians committed ' or their other citizenship , as long as its not from ` normal ' country . 
  then it 's ` travellers ' or ` men of x background ' . 
  about 10 years ago there was some nasty murder in the netherlands ( or belgium ) , reported everywhere as done by ` polish man ' , in reality a gypsy from poland . 
  romania just has the biggest amount of them which is why they suffer the most . 
  i hope we get to taste their own medicine in the future when average 2050 's american or chinese thinks ` islamic terrorist ' after hearing ` belgian ' or ` french ' , 
  that 's ukraine , not poland/slovakia/cr . 
  one of reasons why you are so poor now . 
  ukraine had higher gdp per capita than poland in 1989 . 
  avoiding risk is a sensible strategy when cost of failure is extremely high, 
  no , ipa is not very practical , mostly because it 's artificial , way too general and strict . 
  having spelling be bijective to pronunciation would be enough , although direct mapping between graphemes and phonemes would be best . 
  well to be fair that would be an improvement . 
  english spelling is atrocious . 
  it 's so broken there are even spelling contests ... 
  the proper written language ought to be 100 % phonetic . 
  so not only are they german terrorists , they are germany 's terrorists , because as you effectively said german society is the only entity really responsible . 
  well then . 
   sinti and roma can be eastern european as well so an isis fighter born in germany is german , regardless of his actual ancestry ? ... 
   because it is eastern europeans . 
   31 % came from romania eh ? 
  romania is not eastern europe . 
  geographically it 's southeastern , but it 's not slavic , so the most proper term is south europe , as it has most in common with italy . 
  then there 's the fact it 's mostly gypsies doing the crime , not romanians , so in any case it 's definitely not ` eastern europeans ' . 
  the fact that germans are so happy to lump romanian gypsies along with poles does n't surprise me though . 
   drumpf 's argument are you fucking kidding me .

  if we have robots which can replace the majority of jobs then we can have a robot policeman and a soldier . 
  these countries are going to be much more stable as a result . 
  how to ensure europe becomes poor in one simple step, 
  the whole point of a state tv is to show things from a state 's viewpoints . 
  it 's just not possible for a government-controlled media to show really anti-government stuff . 
  if there 's something that appears to be so it means it 's either not important and used to create a fake image of ` independence ' , or a public opinion test for change in something . 
  if you think it 's different in germany or anywhere else it only shows how naive you are . 
   an international outcry more like german outcry because previous government was extremely pro-german ... 
  it centers around germany and france as a way to tell small eu members : `` we now have all the economic and political power and are doing it anyway , submit or perish '' . 
  scroll down for scans in english, 
  there 's more than one person in the uk, 
  anyone * capable * of working illegally , which mostly mean young people doing hard physical work so in [ this video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqso7ga6lpa ) the ukrainian guy says that his mother works as a secretary and makes $ 57/month ( 1600uah ) . 
  if she could move to germany and work in a nursing home for one year , she could save 20-30 years of her current salary . 
  expecting people like that not to move once it becomes possible is delusion . 
  i do n't even understand how people like that do n't starve without help from family in other countries , your prices are n't really that low . 
  unless they actually do starve ... 
   dec/14 do you even 2016 m8 ?

  two immigrants attacked a ( then ) 18 year old swede man , one pointed a gun to his head while another was shouting ` shoot him ' . 
  the swede pulled a knife and one of the assailants walked into it , he later died . 
  result : '' [ the victim should ] in the emergency situation , when the gun came up , have been able to use the knife on one of the [ robber ] less devastating than to stretch it out to [ robber ] most vital parts , '' reads the judgment ( google translate ) . 
  he got two years for manslaughter .

  there 's nothing new in that article except easier change of surname . 
   anything that is n't marriage , even if it 's `` almost like it '' in tax matters is a deprivation of that . 
  civil marriage is tax benefits + shared ownership . 
  the rest is meaningless . 
  so without income tax the whole concept of civil marriage is redundant and should be removed . 
  if you want meaningless title and rituals get married in a protestant church or whatever , then call yourself married . 
   also what does orb\u00e1n 's year old delusions/empty promises have to do anything with this ? 
  the only head of state that publicly said he wanted it , so hungary is still most likely . 
  i ca n't see my previous comment in a thread , only in inbox . 
  it 's either reddit error or automod shadowban . 
  not sure if you can read this . 
   that is n't the case for lgbt , they are deprived of basic rights because of traditionalism . 
  maybe in saudi arabia . 
  in poland only real difference to straight marriages is no income tax exemption . 
  the proper solution to that is to remove individual income tax , instead of asking to be included into current discriminatory system . 
  out of all countries , hungary seems most likely to achieve [ true equality ] ( http://www.politics.hu/20150309/economy-minister-orbans-zero-income-tax-idea-ambitious-for-now/ ) for all lifestyles . 
  you should check the meaning of ` encourage ' and ` ensure ' in an english dictionary and compare the differences . 
   because it is n't possible to see gay people ( or any other distinct minority ) as equals in a society there are no ` gay people ' . 
  there are individuals who happen to be gay . 
  minorities do n't possess collective minds and exist only as a statistical abstraction . 
  when you start treating people as individually mindless part of a greater whole you end up with totalitarianism . 
   and now that `` nobody cares '' again , it 's okay to continue to ignore them . 
  that 's what freedom is , to be ignored by default . 
  the only legitimate reason for a state to bother someone is in connection to a crime .

  i remembered it differently somehow . 
   when is your next election ? 
  should be in 2015 , but if the opposition parties think they could win more seats than they have now they can vote for earlier elections in a few weeks . 
  the problem is - most of the opposition parties that are in polish sejm currently a month ago ( in euroelections ) got worse percentages than before , so it may be not in their interest ( depending on how many people they calculate to change votes from governing party to theirs instead of newcomers like knp ( which is n't in sejm right now ) ) . 
  last time we had `` watergate '' was in 2002 and there were earlier elections . 
  there are corrupted politicians in a democracy , so what ? 
  the fact that it 's exposed and governments are changed by people actually means democracy works . 
  in poland in early 2000s sld was in power , they got caught in corruption scandal , got vopted out and they were n't in power ever since . 
  this time it can be the same with po . 
  compare to putin , \u0141ukaszenko or kims in north korea - how do you change them when they do something stupid ? 
  you do n't . 
  criticizing democracy because there are corrupt politicians is like criticizing marriage institution because some people cheat . 
   i am always interested how much of lithuanian polish can a real pole understand , here is a fb dla wilniuk\u00f3w thanks for the link - it 's interesting . 
  i understand everything , but some words have secondary meaning i catch only from the context ( `` chorujecie '' as `` kibicujecie '' for example ) . 
  strangely it sounds to me more like interwar l'viv dialect ( i only know it from the kornel makuszy\u0144ski books ) than modern bia\u0142ystok dialect ( which is the closest big polish city to vilnius , and is considered the region with lithuanian influences ) . 
  what happens in poland is good , not bad ( because exposing corruption is good , and i say so even that i supported po recently ) . 
  the corrupted politicians were bad , but there 's no reason to think they started just recently . 
  on the other hand russia do have something to gain by trying to destabilise poland , and there were precedenses . 
  for example late andrzej lepper ( former vice-prime minister ) got to power by organising farmers protests against polish eu accession in early 2000s , and he was getting money and support from russia and belarus `` ministry of farming '' . 
  he was n't very important in polish politics , but he got several percentage support in one elections and ended up pis parter in coalition . 
  so yeah , i would not be surprised if that was russian agents , but we wo n't know anyway . 
  and no matter who recorded it - it 's a great possibility to fight corruption so unfortunately ( because they were quite competent otherways ) po must go , just like sld did . 
  i just hope there will be some new power in politics , because i wo n't vote left side , and neither pis , nor knp seems ok . 
   no `` complaints are justifiable '' then why no bilingual signs in lithuania ? 
   about justification , i refuse to justify any death , or put a meaning to it , because it puts into a trap . 
  there were just people trying to survive fighting anything they say as threat . 
  they wanted their own country - fair enough . 
  poles did , too . 
  does n't change anything . 
  does n't make sense to say `` all crimes are equal '' . 
  if you kill people that attack you - you are a hero . 
  if you invade others ( and some poles did some of that , too , including taking wilno in 20s ) - you are a murderer . 
  if you kill people that did nothing to you - in tousands - you 're a war criminal . 
  simple as that . 
   just answer me a question how come ukrainian polish citizens became on different side of barricades ? 
  because they were persecuted . 
  nobody denies that . 
  also wanted their own country . 
  so what ? 
  right now poles in lithuania ( whiny bunch as they are ) complain about being persecuted by lithuanians . 
  some of their complains are justified . 
  do you think they have right to kill a few tousands of lithuanians ? 
  because some of them certainly feel threathened by lithuanians . 
  would it be `` just trying to survive '' ? 
  it 's a very dumb rethoric to say any persecution justifies any response . 
  also ukrainians in interwar poland ( while they were indeed persecuted ) were n't killed or starving as you sugest . 
  all the rest is naive anarchism and i wo n't go into that here . 
  it was debated many times . 
  of course poles were n't saint , but : - there were no mass murders of ukrainians in poland - villagers were random , mostly innocent people . 
  for comparison - imagine afroamericans in usa in 60s organised militia and killed 50 000 random white citizens of usa . 
  would it be justified , or would members of that milita be war criminals ? 
  because in ukraine there is significant minority that views them as heroes . 
  upa killed 50 000 people or more . 
  mostly kids and women . 
  only because they were polish . 
  burning whole villages , waiting for anybody who escape and killing them , then going to the next village , etc. 
  if that 's not a war crime - what is ? 
  you would guess wrong . 
  yes , obviously . 
  and things done by part of ukrainian society 60 years ago are not a reason to invade ukraine today . 
  but it would help ukrainian case if they stopped the right sector and similar movements from glorifying bandera . 
  his army - upa - was also responsible for mass murder of over 50 000 poles in eastern poland/western ukraine . 
  they murdered whole villages . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/massacres_of_poles_in_volhynia_and_eastern_galicia not a nice guy , russians are right there . 
  edit : wrong number , i only counted the ones murdered in wo\u0142y\u0144 . 
  russian government . 
  i think it 's clear from the context . 
  i hope so . 
  imagine all the possibilities that infinitely divisible , easily transferable currency gives people to monetise weird stuff . 
  imagine reddit where people pay 0,000001 pln for each comment they write . 
  imho it would have much better content . 
  yes i know . 
  will hurt economy . 
  so what . 
  it 's summer . 
  stop buying russian anything for a few months . 
  if they do this in the summer when they have less leverage over eu think what they will do in the next winter . . 
  better to act now . 
  also notice they do their shit always during big sport events . 
  i bet in kgb manuals that 's one of the first rules . 
  i got singaporean , us black vernacular / ebonics , new zealand , and russian , hungarian , german . 
  if you want to feel badass you can try no hands at all . 
  best used in countryside . 
  polish `` pospolite ruszenie '' or `` popular movement '' was unpaid army of nobles + mercenaries hired by them . 
  king in exchange offered them some priviledges , and besides nobility in poland paid almost no taxes and had rights unheard elsewhere ( electing kings , voting on taxes and wars , religious freedoms etc ) . 
  when olbracht went to fight turks he used 40 000 strong pospolite ruszenie army , that ( theorethically ) was mostly nobility . 
  and there were huge casualties in that war on polish side , that 's why nobles afterwards created the proverb . 
  tl ; dr : king olbracht persuaded them to fight turks and lost . 
  of course the proverb is hyperbole . 
  nowhere close to destroying nobility - it was around 10 % of polish population at the time . 
  wnet to moldova to fight turks . 
  moldova was polish vassal at the time , but they turned to turks instead , so we fought both of them and predictably lost . 
  there were big casualities among nobility , or so the proverb says . 
  he was good at art etc , but bad at ruling . 
  for example catherine played him like a small boy - both in love and in politics . 
  wo n't be original , but [ w\u0142adys\u0142aw jagie\u0142\u0142o ] ( http://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/w%c5%82adys%c5%82aw_ii_jagie%c5%82%c5%82o ) is my favorite . 
  he wanted to deal with teutonic order , so he ordered half a year before to prepare mobile pontoon bridge to cross vistula river in any place he wanted ( it was made in parts , it could be moved with army , and constructed in any place in less than one day ) . 
  thanks to that whole polish army ( together with horses , carts and artillery ) moved through the vistula surprising teutonic order completely . 
  he also build many castles , churches , etc , that still stand in most old polish cities , recreated first polish university , and together with his brother witold made the future polish-lithuanian commonwealth possible . 
  nice , but `` worlds first computer coding championship '' is a stretch .

  maybe you should visit the city again , then . 
  i was there a month ago and had pretty different experience . 
  til some people ca n't understand a concept of sarcasm, 
  what do you mean by that ? 
  i 'm surprised that there are n't any positive comments . 
  what 's wrong with / r/europe these days ? 
  deezer is a great replacement for spotify , it has the same music and lets you store your mp3 in the cloud so if there is n't a song in their base you can still listen to it on all devices . 
  the downside is that it still needs flash when used on pc . 
   step three : see if we can get 10 % of / r/europe [ 3 ] to upvote a post to start a campaign for the station so you want to make a 2nd most upvoted post of all time ? 
  good luck with that . 
  :d more seriously , the biggest problem would be translating everything into a number of languages and getting copyrights for all that stuff . 
  if it was n't for that you could start such tv e.g. 
  on the internet basically immediately . 
  i heard a version of the ` legend of manole ' but about a church with twisted towers in chernivtsi ( ukraine ) . 
  [ ( photo/googlemaps ) ] ( https://www.google.pl/maps/@48.290786,25.943722,3a,75y,90t/data=!3m8!1e2!3m6!1s68938960!2e1!3e10!6s%2f%2fstorage.googleapis.com%2fstatic.panoramio.com%2fphotos%2fsmall%2f68938960.jpg!7i3532!8i3806 ) the towers took such strange shape because they felt the pain of the builder 's wife , apparently . 
  [ so that 's the explanation ] ( http://i.imgur.com/8vya3tx.png ), 
   soviet union was socialist only in theory , it was just a totalitarian regime . 
  totalitarism is not an economic system, 
  there was ` war communism ' before the ` state capitalism ' but it ended up in total disaster . 
   well its just unfortunate that most of the `` socialist '' country leaders also happened to be a wee bit authoritarian . 
  somehow leaders of democratic capitalist countries can live without authoritarism . 
  suggesting that the war is between eastern and western ukraine . 
  they mounted an offensive to capture warsaw in july 1944 . 
  when the uprising started stalin decided to stop the red army on the outskirts of the city . 
  they had n't crossed vistula river until 1945 . 
  if this is not waiting then i do n't know what is . 
   lowering taxes for the rich . 
  and for the poor . 
  but because you do n't like them it 's better not to mention that , right ? 
  homosezuality was actually often criminalised in regional ( voivodship-level ) codexes in the 1st commonwealth , though legal in the interwar period ( iirc ), 
   do n't expect society to pick up the tab because you could n't be bothered to care about contraceptives . 
  i am all for male rights , but that specific debate is usually just another way of saying `` i do n't want to use condoms , but i do n't want to be bothered with the consequences '' . 
  then why is abortion legal there in the first place ? 
  they only got weapons that could reach passengers planes altitude ( the buks ) shortly before the 17 july . 
  the airspace by then already closed below 9800m . 
  germany : germany debt money want lithuania : russia want europe . 
  why lithuanian countries ? 
   in short , he espouses intelligent design , which is incompatible with evolutionary theory . 
  well , if you ask e.g. 
  catholic church you 'll hear that the evolution was a part of god 's plan . 
  one can say it is sort of ` backing out ' from literal interprations of the bible into the metaphoric ones , but it ` works ' . 
   there is a pretty big difference with how ` conservative ' protestantism of for example the usa and catholicism approach science . 
  that 's new to me , i 'd have thought we do n't have so much morons in europe . 
  when i hear protestant i think more of the scandinavian type who even accept homo marriages and what-not or the polish ones that i actually know who are more ` conservative ' but do n't fight science - so kind of people who are overall more ` liberal ' than catholics . 
   humans descend from apes and are apes . 
  after wiki-checking you 're right here , i can only justify myself by not knowing exact definition of ` ape ' in english . 
  but still the guy we 're talking about did n't deny this . 
   you are a nutcase if you believe that all those scientists who have dedicated their professional life to actual experimentation-based research are incorrect when it comes to evolution . 
  i believe in evolution . 
  i do n't know if your science minister does , because it 's not stated anywhere in the article . 
   also , the materials/energy for earth was created in the big bang ( or big expansion ) . 
  this is likely what the author meant . 
  it 's unfair to judge people by what you think they meant . 
  you think that larsen denies evolution , which he does n't , you think that the author knows the bing bang theory but made a mistake ( even though he tries to show the politician as the uneducated one ) . 
  well , * that * 's unscientific . 
  read the article , you 'll understand the reasons . 
  he did n't deny any scientific theory ( in contrast to the author of the article who tries to mock him - lol ), 
  study literature then, 
  if you actually read the article you 'll see that this guy is not a nutcase but just a * possibly racist * christian with a phd in theology . 
  he does n't deny evolution nor the theory of cosmic expansion . 
  i 'd dare to say he is smarter than the author of the article , because larsen does n't make statements about things he knows nothing about , while the author suggests that people descend from apes ( people and apes have common ancestor ) or that earth was created in the big bang ( earth was created some 10 ^ 10 years later ) . 
   pretty obvious to me that this means that he is * not * on board with evolutionary theory where do you see that ? 
  what you are doing is making assumptions instead of drawing logical conclusions . 
  that 's like the most * unscientific * thing to do . 
   he also disapproves of the big bang theory . 
  can you show me where ? 
  i do n't understand why people tie disapproving the bing bang theory with religiousity , when in fact it was * a priest * who first proposed it . 
   i think there is a different between being patriotic and being a patriot being patriotic is like a definition of a patriot . 
  do n't reinvent words when you do n't need to . 
   being a patriot is blinding yourself to the faults and mistakes that your country ( government ) is doing , and anyone questioning it is against you . 
  * idiot ( or nationalist-idiot if you wish ) would you say that for example decabrists or white rose ca n't be considered patriots ? 
  the terrorists succeed when we start to agree to change our culture because of fear . 
  france is french people ' country , not theirs . 
   a lack of prospects for immigrants why do they immigrate then ? 
  so we give up our privacy - part of our culture - because of terrorist acts ? 
  this means that terrorists win . 
  in poland abortion in that case * is * legal . 
  you fail to realise that a fetus can be considered a human being and in that case the right to life takes priority over right to do stupid shit, 
  this is the result of lack of responsibility . 
   jokes aside , it is catholic taliban that forces us to stick to this primitive ban . 
  majority of poles is against abortion . 
  this is why we stick to this ` primitive ' ban . 
  if one says it 's because of ` catholic talban ' then it means that most of poles = catholic taliban . 
  yeah , but i just say that people opposing the convention did not support violence against women, 
  this argument is stupid , becuase it can be used against any law . 
  see : jokes aside , it is catholic taliban * ( most of poles ) * that forces us to stick to this primitive ban . 
  if you believe that most people would suddenly murder others because they can , you are grievously wrong . 
  truth is if you really want to murder someone you will , regardless if it is legal or not . 
  says someone from a country which allows child euthanasia, 
  it all boils down to a point in the convention which states that ` states should try to eradicate traditions based on stereotypical view of men and women, 
  countries can adopt laws against violence without adopting the convention . 
  in poland contraception , adoption , baby hatches as well as abortion in case of rape , terminally-ill fetus or threat of damaging mother 's health are all legal . 
  so even if someone irresponsible has unwanted pregnancy she does n't need to raise the child , she can just go through these 9 months of pregnancy and abandon the child . 
  why then abortion on demand should be considered legal , if fetus being ( or not ) human is still a subject to debate ? 
  law applies to whole society not only you . 
  because you find it nonsensical does n't mean other people do . 
  if everyone would think like you we would have anarchy . 
  grodzka was actively participating in the communist regime . 
  same for many others leftist figures so it 's no wonder people do n't like them, 
   people forcing their beliefs on others .

  to be aligned you need to be equals . 
  as others pointed out , krrit is a political body itself , so the change is cosmetic . 
  unless you really believe in krrit , then maybe you should read about the rywingate . 
  indeed , poland is the only army east of germany capable of any kind of resistance . 
  look at the baltic states , they have like 5 planes and 10 tanks in total . 
   even less popular opinion : how they are palling up the the usa and playing that relationship off their eu one is galling to me . 
  allowing the usa to place weapons within their borders endangers all of the eu . 
  they need to decide if they are with us or just want our money . 
  whaaaaat ? 
  so us bases in germany , italy or belgium are a threat to eu ? 
  i guess we should just power down all our military , exit nato and welcome putin anyway , right ? 
  really , how can people even find courage to write such bullshit and not be ashamed of themselves ? 
  you should check your sources before commenting . 
  bie\u0144kowska is the current eu commissioner , from the previous government 's po party , which is hardcore pro-eu . 
  how about bie\u0144kowska , our eu commisioner , prominent po member ? 
  `` for every euro spent in poland germans get 86 cents '' http://m.wprost.pl/ar/id,317666/mob.html on topic of laws , many - not paralyze , but they are a cost . 
  for instance , the stupid regulations of lightbulbs or vacuum cleaners , or the milk quotas , which cost millions . 
  there was quite a thorough comparison done in recent months that combined all costs and benefits , such as cost of additional bureaucracy , huge costs associated with obtaining the eu project money , import duties lost , etc. 
  in the end , the balance was still positive , but much less so and due to change to negative by 2020 at latest . 
  or maybe because tusk 's previous party , kld , was directly sponsored by cdu in the 90s and he has a long history of being subservient to german interests ? 
  they did n't restrict the courts power . 
  they changed the way they preside over important issues , so it requires a super-majority instead of a simple majority - which , for important constitutional matters , should have been like that anyway . 
  they kind of illegally changed some of the previously ( also kind of illegally ) chosen judges . 
  the reason for that was if they allowed the po ones , then 14 out of 15 judges in the court would be the ones appointed by po ( it 's same as supreme court in usa , where the judges are not really apolitical ) . 
  moreover , po changed the law some months before elections ( which they knew they would probably lose ) , so that the court could impeach the president , on top of blocking any legislation pis wanted to pass . 
  it was a proactive defensive move . 
  i guess the change of government actually increased our international standing , contrary to what po claimed would happen , 
  those who do n't vote , do n't count . 
  that 's the basic rule of democracy . 
  also , how come such accusations were never raised when po was taking over ? 
  they had similar popular support , yet nobody was crying wolf about ` minority dictatorship ' . 
  do you know how many poles left during po government ? 
  i can tell you the number is way higher , i was also among these emigrants . 
  very few are returning . 
  among my friends , i am the only one to be honest - and emigration was huge in my region , lublin , because we are one of the poorest parts of eu . 
  the only reason i returned is because i can work remotely in western companies , so even that does n't count . 
  the money partially flows back to poland , but this is not sustainable and is a huge brain drain issue anyway . 
  `` when the center-right civic platform party ran the polish government from 2007 to 2015 , it could do no wrong . '', 
  also , i 'm not sure what the author meant with these words , but from my perspective that only shows the eu media bias - if pro-eu ( or rather , pro-german ) party is in power , we do n't criticize anything ; once eu-sceptics takeover , we demonise them and criticize everything . 
  such a pathetic propaganda method . 
  btw , i guess you know 80 % of media in poland are german-owned ? 
  no true scotsman much ? 
  that 's what the french want you to believe !, 
  so you are saying you are an ignorant person , with no understanding of polish history or contemporary issues , that only jumps on hate wagon when your precious media tells you so ? 
  tells a lot about the average german . 
  to be honest , it tells me the same thing it did in the 30s - you are just as easily manipulated and as filled with hatred . 
  today 's eu commission actions also proves you are just as adamant on interfering with internal polish affairs . 
  for instance , the guardian ? 
  : `` the guardian has been noted for a number of other controversies . 
  on october 14 , 2009 , nazi-hunter efraim zuroff alleged that : `` the second world war narrative [ ... ] has been distorted since independence and the transition to democracy to make it more palatable to their electorate and to minimize the role of local collaborators in holocaust crimes . 
  '' [ 96 ] on october 20 , 2009 , the guardian 's jonathan freedland said : `` we are meant to be friendly towards the newest members of the european union . 
  but the truth is that several of these `` emerging democracies '' have reverted to a brand of ultra-nationalistic politics that would repel most voters in western europe . 
  it exists in poland '' . 
  in response to the above attacks timothy garton ash wrote in the same paper on 23 december : `` in my experience , the automatic equation of poland with catholicism , nationalism and antisemitism -- and thence a slide to guilt by association with the holocaust -- is still widespread . 
  this collective stereotyping does no justice to the historical record . 
  '' [ 97 ] '' or the times ? 
  : `` also in 2008 the polish ambassador sent an official protest to the press complaints commission about the times . 
  [ 106 ] on july 26 , 2008 , giles coren published a comment piece with the ethnic slur ` polack ' used to describe polish immigrants . 
  he accused poland of complicity in the six million jewish deaths of the holocaust , [ 107 ] [ 108 ] [ 109 ] prompting not only an official letter of complaint to the times , but also an early day motion in the uk parliament , followed by an editorial in the economist . 
  [ 110 ] [ 111 ] [ 112 ] [ 113 ] [ 114 ] the ambassador , tuge-erecinska , explained that the article was `` unsupported by any basic historic or geographic knowledge , '' and that `` the issue of polish-jewish relations has been unfairly and deeply falsified '' by coren 's `` aggressive remarks '' and `` contempt '' . 
  [ 106 ] [ 115 ] [ 116 ] coren reacted by telling the jewish chronicle : `` fuck the poles '' . 
  [ 117 ] [ 118 ] [ 119 ] the case has been referred to the european court of human rights . 
  [ 118 ] [ 120 ] the editor of the jewish chronicle , stephen pollard , commented on august 6 , 2009 : `` there are few things more despicable than anti-semitism , but here 's one of them : using a false charge of anti-semitism for political gain . 
  did i hit your nationalistic german nerve or something ? 
  i never said there is no antisemitism in poland now . 
  i was merely pointing on incorrect assumption that poland was very anti-semitic throughout its history and that led to the holocaust , etc. 
  i edited the post to add ` historic ' . 
  virtually every article on contemporary anti-semitism in poland starts with ` poland , the country with long history of anti-semitic agenda , where most of jews died in death camps ' , which is just revisionism and simply not true . 
  haha , made my day . 
  and if they find immigrants in the lorries , the drivers pay thousands of pounds out of their own pockets - of course , on top of all the damage immigrants do to their trucks and load . 
  at the same time drivers are not allowed to use force against them . 
  this is the european dream . 
  then you 'd have to put half of muslims in jail . 
  there was an article the other day about mass exodus of french jews to israel . 
  the french collaborated extensively with the germans , they even had quite a lot of ss volunteers . 
  so you are suggesting only ~ 5 % of jews in poland survived because poland collaborated with nazis , while french did n't ? 
  if that 's the case , your historical education is worthless and you need to read more books , because exactly the opposite was true . 
  `` the relations between poles and jews during world war ii present one of the sharpest paradoxes of the holocaust . 
  only 10 percent of the jews survived , less than in any other country ; and yet , poland accounts for the majority of rescuers with the title of ` righteous among the nations ' , i.e. 
  people who risked their lives to save jews . 
  the poles honored by yad vashem are a fraction of the true number of deserving individuals and : `` so far represent only the tip of the iceberg , '' according to paulsson . 
  [ 109 ] the nature of this paradox was debated by historians on both sides for more than fifty years often with preconceived notions and selective evidence . 
  [ 109 ] many jews , persecuted by the germans , received help from the poles ; help , ranging from major acts of heroism , to minor acts of kindness involving hundreds of thousands of helpers acting often anonymously . 
  this rescue effort occurred even though ( since october 1941 ) ethnic poles themselves were the subject to capital punishment at the hands of the nazis if found offering any kind of help to a person of jewish faith or origin ( poland was the only country in german-occupied europe in which such a death penalty was applied ) . 
  [ ... ] in total , some 30,000 poles were executed by the nazis for hiding them . 
  [ ... ] in his work on the jews of warsaw , gunnar s. paulsson has demonstrated that despite the much harsher conditions , polish citizens of warsaw managed to support and hide the same percentage of jews as did the citizens of cities in reportedly safer countries of western europe . '', 
  no such thing as polish death camps , stop the propaganda . 
  they were german death camps . 
  actually , a lot of them went to poland . 
  every time jews were expelled ( and they were expelled from virtually every country in central and western europe ) , they went to poland/commonwealth . 
  that 's why the jewish population there was so high - because everybody else hated and forcefully expelled them . 
  have that in mind next time you hear about historic polish anti-semitism in the western media . 
  edit : for downvoting ignorants `` for centuries , poland was home to the largest and most significant jewish community in the world . 
  poland was the centre of jewish culture thanks to a long period of statutory religious tolerance and social autonomy . 
  [ ... ] from the founding of the kingdom of poland in 1025 through to the early years of the polish-lithuanian commonwealth created in 1569 , poland was the most tolerant country in europe . 
  [ 5 ] known as paradisus iudaeorum ( latin for `` paradise for the jews '' ) , it became a shelter for persecuted and expelled european jewish communities and the home to the world 's largest jewish community of the time . 
  according to some sources , about three-quarters of all jews lived in poland by the middle of the 16th century . '', 
  in sweden anything right of marx is far-right extremism . 
  not really , before this clusterfuck the national agencies worked pretty well . 
  only when merkel & co. said eu must accept any number and started threatening sanctions against any critics they decided it 's better to appease merkel than to defend their borders .

  ummm did n't france just extend it 's state of emergency for the 5th time already and they have military guards in paris , at least around the eiffel tower and the like ? 
  please correct me if i am wrong ... 
  how did you manage , if it 's ok to ask ? 
  i hope you 're doing much better now , 
  what the fuck does 500 pln even do for a couple even with just one kid ? 
  you can probably spend that 500 pln in about 2-5 days if you have a young child ...  they are talking about what is good and what is bad from our pov and ? 
  that 's how most governments stay in power , they say what people want to hear . 
  you still have not elaborated as to how exactly pis is taking care of poles ... 
   takes care of poles that 500 + is really taking care of poles eh ? 
  seriously , though , could you explain in greater detail how pis takes care of poles ? 
  i was looking for this comment .

  bulagaria borrows money from eu for strategic popcorn reserves / s, 
  sooo what 's the latest ? 
  so far i am hearing that there was a dead body in the truck and that the driver who performed the act is not the original driver of the truck ... 
  oh goddamnit ... that 's all we need is for this guy to be from poland ... 
  where did i say yours was bad ? 
  i was merely asking for a more in-depth explanation besides `` reduce poverty ''  if you could point me to where i said your solution was bad , please do so . 
  you will admit that the initial `` reduce poverty '' is somewhat generic , no ? 
  now , to address your points once more :  are you somewhat familiar with the concept of `` taxes '' ? 
  yes , but again , i wanted you to elaborate on how these kind of solutions are to be financed . 
  also , when you say `` taxes '' do you mean you will raise taxes , reform the tax system in your country ? 
  may i ask you to expand on the `` taxes '' potion of your argument , if you do n't mind ? 
   one example could be to test employers to see if they discriminate by sending equally qualified job applications , one with a native name , another with a foreign name , to see if both are treated the same or if there 's systematic discrimination . 
  i know the u.s. will do this kind of thing but has this sort of thing been done in your country before ? 
  now , for my country 's poor the solution would be as follows : 1 . 
  reform the tax code so that any obvious loopholes are closed . 
  one loophole we have is that some businesses ( not sure if small or medium-sized business ) do not have to pay taxes for the first 5 years of operation under a given name ( this is highly simplified as i am not a lawyer ) . 
  what this leads to is stores will be under one name , then you see the same store with the same people under a different name entirely . 
  i would also seek out solutions that would entice businesses to pay taxes in this country rather than a country like cyprus where they have a lower tax rate . 
  i would also change the tax code related to our social security . 
  as of right now , we have the zus , which is basically the national retirement fund . 
  the problem with paying the zus in its present form tends to strangle smaller businesses because the amount you have to pay does not appear to change when you make a profit for the month or not . 
  i would like to reform that tax so that a ) people will be able to pay a % of what they make towards the zus tax rather than a stiff fee that can break small businesses and b ) ensure the tax is paid via audits . 
  again , do keep in mind i am not an expert on taxation and the like . 
  basically , the ideal solution as far as taxes go would be to reform then enough so that more people would be willing to pay their fair share and make it more of a hassle to circumvent paying taxes via whatever means available , legal or otherwise . 
  reduce the amount of civil servants we currently employ and upgrade our various governmental structures with up-to-date technology that would allow the government to operate with a reduced work force . 
  a radical solution would be to legalize marijuana and tax that as well but i am not sure how well that would actually work . 
  not saying it would n't work , just that i do n't have any hard data as to whether that actually works . 
  at least with the legalization of marijuana we 'd get rid of one avenue of crime which comes with its own cost to society . 
  i would also make the catholic church pay taxes , if they do n't already in poland , would have to look that up but i bet they probably got a sweet deal going on with our government . 
  i would look for ways to cut other extraneous government expenditures but considering it 's not that easy to know where every euro spent by our government goes , forgive me for the rather generic quality of this point . 
  another possible solution for financing helping the poor would be to legalize abortion but there would be a fee paid to the state itself . 
  i am not sure how much the state should charge but considering we have , as of right now , 38 million people the fee should n't be too exorbitant but enough to pay for the procedure and then some . 
  it 's a rather radical solution but considering the demand and the state does lose a potential tax payer because of it i hope you can see why i suggested it . 
  now that we have some tax reform and hopefully some income coming in , we then move to set up community outreach programs where the state works with the local communities to find out what they need . 
  just because people are poor in the various regions of poland we should not presume that one solution will work for each voivodeship or district or region or whatever . 
  some communities may need access to jobs or transportation , some may have issues with communicating with the outside world because where they live there 's hardly anything resembling the internet . 
  in short , they might not need money directly but a way to make money on their own . 
  apologies for the long wall of text but this is literally off the cuff . 
  i am sure some of my points are rather laughable but it 's better than nothing , no ? 
  i have n't proposed one initially so i have n't come up with one ... yet . 
   well established social security system who will pay for it ? 
   activation programs what exactly are those as i 've never heard of this particular term ? 
  and , again , who will pay for those programs ? 
   measures to reduce discrimination and what * exact * measures do you have in mind that are n't already enforced by the law of the land ? 
   access to child care facilities who will pay for them ? 
  pork cutlet is one of the staples in poland :d, 
   most of emps speak in their native languages i know this will sound odd but i think they should speak english because the voice-over translators are horrible , they stutter , they seem to omit lots of phrases , and so on . 
  if nothing else , someone please give subtitles !, 
   you do n't see americans complaining about cross-state immigrants . 
  ask texans about the californians that emigrate there ... 
  of course we can , we 're rather resourceful when it comes these kind of things :p, 
  ahh yes the old `` false friends '' conundrum , very common mistake , 
  great , who will pay for it or how do you plan to go about reducing poverty for the long-term ? 
  so gentrification is not a solution , the poor people are not exactly in a position ( afaik ) to lift themselves up out of poverty .

  i sadly do n't know much about your country except that it has some beautiful , green landscapes . 
  could i ask you to recommend a blog / site where i could learn something about macedonia ? 
  maybe a set of pictures with comments attached to them ? 
  or a fabular movie made in your country ? 
  it 's just that we live in relatively close cultures , but i do n't know anything about your country , society and culture . 
  and it does n't seem i could go visit macedonia or any country anytime soon . 
  i have a feeling that people outside of poland do n't understand your joke and they really think you 're referencing to some catholic saint . 
  if it was up to you to pick new name for macedonia , what would you choose ? 
  do you have any type ? 
  damn , i had read this comment before looking at the map and i had thought i missed international balkan meme conference 2015 , but then i saw the glorious t\u00fcrktan\u011fle . 
  as / u/boavida said , it 's putting penis between breasts . 
  honestly i thought that this term is commonly used throughout whole western world , the same as with '' french sex '' . 
  additionaly '' bi\u0107 niemca po kasku '' ( '' beat german on his helmet '' ) , means , well , that you can propably easily figure out . 
  funny thing , in polish '' robi\u0107 hiszpana '' ( '' making / doing spaniard '' ) is solely related to one specific sexual act . 
   there 's some obvious anime inspirations ( ghost in the shell , etc. ), 
  i would n't call putting one show 's poster as a inspiration , it 's the same as with the movie whiplash , just because character says some famous drummer 's name it 's not inspiration , just a wink . 
   other than that , the overall effect is ... mediocre . 
  as it was with ambition , bagi\u0144ski is unable to make a convincing live-action piece without wooden acting and overdone effects . 
  imo he should stick with cgi . 
  live action is not his thing . 
  mediocre ? 
  it is what is , nicely crafted modernized version of famous tale . 
  and for what it is , i like it . 
  i sense some heavy finnish memes . 
  i 'd like to move to another country before turning 30 , i love my city , but i would n't want to spend my whole life in one city / country . 
  i have narrowed my selection to 4 countries and portugal is one of them , although i was never in your country . 
  it just seems to be a peaceful and kind place with warm climat . 
  hey , dear american !, 
   you 'd think they would open another register since there are 10 of us waiting . 
  if you would tell me that while standing in a queue , i 'd propably think a ) you 're insane person that says random things to random people ; b ) you 're relict of iron curtain times and you feel the constant need to bitch about something publicly ; c ) you 're a creep ; d ) you want to steal something from me , or scam me ; e ) or just i 'd be annoyed that some guy had to bother me . 
  then i would say something like '' yeah , yeah '' maybe even '' yeah , yeah , they could '' on a happy day and immediately look other way and pretend you do n't exist . 
  i 'd like to visit usa someday , but a thought of faking these small talks and smiles there seems like something that would bother me and propably majority of family and friends . 
  but on the other hand i must say that some time ago i met one american while waiting in a drug store , it was a long wait because they had to fix cash register or something , after like 30 seconds we were talking about what a bummer this situation is , after 2 minutes about food in poland in us and having a laugh , after 4 minutes about our families , and after 6 minutes he was telling me about his experience during wtc incident in 2001 . 
  i mean , maybe it was just him or maybe this stereotpye is true and y' all are just a bunch of happy , friendly folks . 
   ironically and refreshingly , authors who make fun of nationalism also become objects for national pride , like witold gombrowicz if you would ask typical polish patriot or '' patriot '' ( sometimes i do n't see a distinction anymore ) about gombrowicz , the reaction would be rather aggressive , disdainful and maybe even homophobic . 
  poland has in general a large problem with nationalism , racism and basically hatred for everyone who is n't white , european , right-winged , christian or atheist , and straight . 
  i 'll give you two examples . 
  first , recently in pozna\u0144 media reported that a syrian man assaulted a woman . 
  later it turned out , that he did n't assault a woman , but a group of few men , and did n't assault , but was beaten by them because of his skin colour . 
  second , i deal with such people everyday , i had many occurrences when someone i talked a lot with in college or in work seemed like a cool guy / girl , but only until you talk about weather / movies / work , as soon as politics turn up , your tipical pole will wipe out his or her racism and casually smack it into your face . 
  and i know that in every country there are some racist , hatefull people , but after living in poland for a while now , it seems that here majority of people are . 
  antoni macierewicz will be the minister of national defence in poland 's new government . 
  i 'm aware that tells nothing to anyone outside of poland , but well ... 
  it 's not going to be that much of hyperbole if i call this man a psycho . 
  it 's just very bad news . 
  thank you for this comment , whenever there is political discussion amongst poles on reddit , this issue shows up . 
  many people in poland think that everything that is n't some '' anarcho-libertarianism '' is socialism . 
  i have no idea if what you wrote is true or a joke , but you made me cry of laughter . 
  thank you . 
  i think i 'd feel comfortable in latvia . 
  also i dig your flair 's description . 
  '' neoliberal '' does n't mean you do n't pay taxes . 
  funny thing is that everytime it shows up on this sub , only people from poland do n't understand what liberalism is . 
  practically flat income tax rate in poland is as liberal as it can get . 
  eastern europe is pretty neoliberal , i do n't know about other countries , but in poland both someone who earns minimal wage and someone who earns 10 000 euro pays the same income tax . 
  i have yet to meet a pole not from warsaw who 's opinion about the capital is this optimistic . 
  this . 
  the reason i believe that russia will bother my country in a few decades is the same one that makes me expect that sun will rise in the morning . 
  during my lifetime , yes . 
  i honestly believe their goal is the fall of eu and nato , after which they would be free to conquer poland , baltic states or finland . 
  only times i see this is women complementing each other , but since it 's not hostile in any way , i wouldnt call it cat calling . 
  you have great punk , these are just the band i 've seen live in my city : [ anne m. christiansen ] ( https://annemchristiansen.bandcamp.com/releases ) - fantastic emotional hardcore punk , vocalist is a beast . 
  [ pacino ] ( https://pacino.bandcamp.com/track/ps-srdce ) - soothing post punk with some classic punk rock mixed in [ esazlesa ] ( https://esazlesa.bandcamp.com/ ) - romantic and long post-punky songs with screamo vocals put here and there . 
  if amazing czech bands such as these play in krak\u00f3w , they for sure play near where you live . 
  my flair is the answer . 
  all the norwegians i met were humble and `` poczciwy '' , so that 's the image in my head i have about you guys . 
  poczciwy is a word in polish , which does n't have a proper equivalent in english , but it 's an adjective which perfectly fits winnie the pooh , so maybe you get the idea . 
  the coolest one in the thread , for sure . 
  after osram nothing surprises me . 
  rich , democratic , smug . 
  [ vans basically ( http://scene7.zumiez.com/is/image/zumiez/pdp_hero/vans-old-skool-black-%26-white-skate-shoes-_204607-front.jpg ) , they 're not to large and not a lot of stuff fit in the , but few take a few trips and you 're settled . 
  i did n't say nothing about us economy , but rather about inequalities , which already are worse than 100 years ago : http://piketty.pse.ens.fr/files/capital21c/en/pdf/f9.8.pdf and i seriously doubt that us government will implement any prosocial redistrubution policies in the next 10 or 20 years . 
  i believe the consensus shared by quite a lot of economists and sociologists is that us will remain a superpower , but income and wealth inequalities will keep raising to the point where you will end up as a really dystopian-lite country . 
  it fucking sucks , cause up until 1980s everything was going well in that department . 
  language . 
  of course i 'm biased since polish is my native language , but i 'd say it is sophisticated and poetic . 
  it has this grandiose spirit that i 'm very fond of , which i encounter whenever i read polish ( or translated to polish ) philosophy or poetry . 
  yes , it 's called like this biblical sea monster . 
   anything you 'd like to share about your culture i 'm open to hear . 
  polish person starter pack : - you 're blunt and direct with what you say - you 're an elitist when it comes to bread - on the evening of 24th of december you eat a traditional dinner with your closed one ( no need to be religious , it 's a pagan tradition in its roots anyway ) - statistically speaking , there 's a 60 % chance you 're a racist and / or a homophobe - you think your country 's utter shit , but still love to live in it - you put ketchup on pizza , you drown these slices in ketchup till italians explode - you 're religious - statistics about more than 90 % of poles being catholic are false , but it 's indeed true that lots of poles are religious , either they are christian and if not there 's a high chance they 're deists . 
  for many poles atheism is a ridiculous approach , and the approach i encounter the most while talking about this stuff with people is * i believe there is some sort of primordial power , i doubt it cares about me , but i 'd really want it to * . 
  of course it 's only my anegdotical experience , other poles here may disagree with me . 
  yeah , we are eastern european , nothing wrong with that in my opinion . 
  yep , that 's why you 're ee too , godless lil ' brother . 
  if russians would claim that russian dumplings are russian . 
  let me just say that after migration crisis i 've come to learn something about lots of people i know . 
  had there be a war or destabilization in my country i can see many poles eagerly participating in cleansing comparable with the one that happened in balkans in 90s . 
  but [ ice is located in poland ] ( http://www.icekrakow.com/ ) , not in k\u00f6ln ... 
  you cant drink alcohol in public and holding open bottle or can with any alcohol is good enough to get you a ticket . 
  open bottle of alcohol in public . 
  i will be morbidly excited once putin will die to follow the news and see how power will shift in russia . 
  as of now , it seems like the whole facade of russia is built around him and i wonder how the people who will run the system will introduce new lovely uncle for masses to admire . 
  euiii : holland into netherlands was my favourite playthrough . 
  other than that england , france or any small country by the sea . 
  * cebulactwo * - it 's a very finese term having its roots in underlying values in which majority of poles tend to believe . 
  we jokingly call people who put exceptional effort in realizing this philosophy * polaczek-cebulaczek * , but those are only jokes - in the end this set of values is shared by everyone in poland . 
  it 's hard to describe with words what values are those , since it 's more about mentality , not ** what ** you think , but ** how ** do you think . 
  anyway , i found a picture that maybe will shed a light onto * cebulactwo * for you : [ link ] ( http://x3.cdn03.imgwykop.pl/c3201142/comment_pwb2s3049ldgq6as4mf5dvkti6qh4v6l.jpg ) this intricate describtion on the image can be translated as * gra\u017cyna do n't clean yourself , we 're going to the pool * . 
  i found some data and in 2015 earning 1700 $ and more ( before taxes ) placed you in 2,55 % of richest poles . 
  something like 2200 $ probably makes you a one percenter here .

this is also true . 
  it 's unfair that millions of young people leave because they ca n't find jobs and support themselves/their families , but `` migrants '' will be coming here and getting hundreds of euros . 
  it 's like , sorry you did n't get that mansion and 10,000 $ a month lads . 
  the first girl being interviewed is really attractive . 
  nice . 
  ( that 's where term economic `` migrants '' comes into play . ), 
  poland already took some families in , but they all escape for germany . 
  look what being a `` big boy '' is getting germany , riots and shootings in their streets ( e.g. 
  the terrorist that attacked the police officer in berlin and was killed or the riots in small towns you 're seeing on liveleak . ), 
  i still do n't understand why it 's the eu 's responsibility to take in non-eu nationals or pay the consequences . 
  look at all these people that need our help , they must be famished !, 
  hence why i said it should be based on if a country wants them . 
  if western europe does n't want them then they do n't have to take them just like central and eastern europe . 
  by `` competent enough '' i mean not coming out with a plan that forces non-multicultural societies to take in thousands of people that are totally different . 
  when she came out and said that , it scared all central european nations into a corner . 
  there 's other ways to approach this ( e.g. 
  every country takes in the amount they think they should ) . 
  `` we do n't want to take in dozens of thousands of non-eu nationals '' you 've dun fucked the eu now , v4 !, 
  seriously though , the migrants could 've been helped if merkel was competent enough . 
  janusz is going all out today . 
  right , but now when these migrants get through they 'll let their friends and family back home know that they all got through . 
  suddenly the numbers will be doubled or tripled . 
  still not butthurt . 
  it 's just weird that you have a hate for other europeans that are so similar to you , but you want everyone take in culturally different people that would stab you in the back at the first opportunity . 
  if your job is being taken by an immigrant that does n't even speak the language , then you need to reevaluate your life 's choices . 
  laughed harder than i should have lmao . 
  not even butthurt , it 's just borderline autistic to compare blue collar working poles in your country to welfare-leeching migrants . 
  i 'm sure you have a personal reason you hate them , though . 
  did a pole steal your girlfriend ? 
  is your single mom dating a pole ? 
  i bet you 're just another pakistani/indian immigrant . 
  they 'll reach maximum level of political correctness . 
  `` being in the eu means accepting thousands of illegals from the middle east/africa who do n't even want to be in your country in the first place . '', 
  ^ ( none of these immigrants even want to go to these countries : they all want to come to germany and other western-european ) central europeans do n't want migrants , migrants do n't want to be in ce , migrants want to be in western europe , and we wants them . 
  what 's the problem , then ? 
  forgive us that certain countries want to keep a cultural identity and not flood it with completely different people . 
  if you do n't like poles , then close your borders . 
  no one is forcing you to take any people . 
  did n't know about that one . 
  what 's your personal take of who will win , po or pis ? 
  i support helping refugees , but it should be on a voluntary basis . 
  the countries that would want them can take them ; you ca n't force two different cultures together if they do n't want to be together . 
  also , there 's something similar happening in poland . 
  in warsaw at 16:00 , there 'll be an anti-immigration protest . 
  so do you propose to have planes ready in turkey to fly all of them straight to europe no questions asked ? 
  probably wildlings , yeah . 
  is that ... is that a game of thrones reference ? 
  right . 
  however , i do n't know why it falls on the shoulders of europe to take hundreds of thousands/possibly millions ( in the future ) people in when surrounding muslim countries do n't even want to help them . 
  do n't take me wrong , i support the cause of sending aid/money . 
  nice . 
  then why not stay there ? 
  it 's obviously safe . 
  these people are only looking for free handouts . 
  from what i 've been able to gather , the swedish media seems to be almost brainwashing people ( often from childhood as you 're pointing out ) . 
  this is crazy . 
  they see me korwin ' , they hatin ', 
  that 's actually pretty cool , i 've got to admit . 
  central european countries like poland should n't be responsible for the problems of germany & france . 
  germany is accepting all refugees , but then suddenly needs help and dumps them all around the eu ? 
  last time i checked , most of these refugees are from african and asian countries which have no wars . 
  ` you would n't even notice them . ` not until they started rioting and burning down buildings because they want to go west/north to germany or sweden . 
  and most refugee applicant are n't even from syria , most are from peaceful countries in africa or asia . 
  what 's your point there ? 
  so how many refugees is latvia currently housing and feeding ? 
  good for the uk . 
  i think that the eu should be sending money to refugee/aid camps in turkey or its surrounding countries that hold the most refugees . 
  why ? 
  this would show that europe is n't accepting people en masse and would discourage people from making these often dangerous journeys , but at the same time we 'd still be helping them . 
  it 'd be a win-win situation . 
  i think by then you 'll be too occupied with pleasuring ahmed and his \u0642\u0636\u064a\u0628 , my little hans . 
   no big enemies are you forgetting that russia is invading an eastern european country * right now * ? 
  no shit that putin wo n't care , ivan . 
  what 's important is that other poles ( and future generations ) know that you snakes are continuously targeting us . 
  proving that there is no foul play to be found . 
  if so , then they should gove the wreckage . 
  but they wo n't . 
  imma need you to give us the wreckage of the plane that killed our president . 
  if there is nothing to cover up , then explain why russia has n't given us the wreckage of the plane . 
  gib back wilno jk :p, 
  i can agree with this . 
  sadly , after that we never had good leadership ( until wa\u0142\u0119sa ) , but then still we had crappy leaders . 
  even today . 
  poland became independent thanks to him . 
  i 'd take him as our leader over anyone that was his successor up until today . 
  pi\u0142sudski was the best thing in the last 100 years . 
  did n't know that , it 's probably just for protestants . 
  roman catholics do n't have to pay anything , some people just choose too add a little to the donation plate . 
  save money ? 
  last time i checked ( this sunday morning ) , the church does n't take your money . 
  it 's called voluntary * donations * . 
  no , it 's not . 
  some people are still actual believers . 
  in other news : water is wet . 
   we need diversity why ? 
  most countries are homogeneous and they 're fine . 
  the only areas that are experiencing problems are multicultural ones .

  why does it have to be a choice between extremes ? 
  why does it has to be `` nasty racist sd supporter '' tribe vs `` antiracist narrative activist '' tribe ? 
  how about talking about real issues , you know , like grownups . 
  is n't it happening ? 
  if you are in your thirties and you were educated in eu , you know at least a couple of people who participated in erasmus exchange . 
  you also experience the free movement across the borders . 
  we also have a casual conversation in this reddit . 
  crazy times , no ? 
  in this reply i 'm also addressing / u/ikolla . 
  i have nothing but disdain for sd for their bigotry and general assholeness . 
  but seems to me that everyone who dares to question the official narrative is automatically deemed `` racist '' , and you guys throw this word around without even trying to prove anything . 
  power lying in the accusation , not the evidence . 
  i daresay you can be honest in looking at stats and not be a racist . 
  so let 's try that . 
   sweden is the rape capital , but that is because they count sexual harrasment under `` rape '' , so the statistic is quite misleading . 
  correlation is not causation . 
  in swedish law biggest shift in legal definition of rape has happened in 1992 ( inclusion of sexual assault into def of rape ) , but this does n't account for continuous growth of registered rape cases [ between 1975 and now ] ( http://imgur.com/qdmie6y ) . 
  you ca n't explain 10-fold increase in reported sex crime by `` increased awareness '' , you would need much stronger evidence than just vague correlation . 
  can you explain [ 11 % increase in rape cases ] ( http://bra.se/bra/nytt-fran-bra/arkiv/press/2015-03-31-slutlig-brottsstatistik-2014.html ) just in one year by `` increased awareness and women rights '' ? 
  also , police reports in similar countries to sweden , sometimes stipulate how more likely people from some cultural backgrounds are to commit sex crimes ( [ in finland mena immigrants 17 times more likely ] ( http://www.optula.om.fi/material/attachments/optula/julkaisut/tutkimuksia-sarja/xz5bk8f2h/265_lehti_ym_2014.pdf ) ) the last official swedish crime statistics that deals with background of crime perpetrators says people from middle east / north africa commited 5 times more rapes than `` natives '' http://www.bra.se/bra/brott-och-statistik/valdtakt-och-sexualbrott.html ( after that we have the have silence , in accordance with [ antiracism religion ] ( http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/07/27/antiracism-our-flawed-new-religion.html ) ) . 
  sd is a horrible bunch and their rise to power is a painful thing to watch . 
  but all their opponents work very , very hard on their success . 
  as long as you insist on ignoring reality , they will be growing . 
  edit for typos .

  in case of poland it is mostly [ government bonds issued predominantly to polish citizens ] ( http://images.slideplayer.pl/1/427931/slides/slide_14.jpg ) . 
  there is nothing terrifying or [ unusual ] ( http://jakubmarian.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/public-debt-europe.jpg ) about it . 
  it does pose risks when it grows too much , but in a healthy economy it reflects strength of a national economy as much as anything else . 
  ( because it means that domestic and foreign investors trust in future growth ) . 
  where does he say anything about belonging ? 
  take off the tinfoil hat , buddy . 
  i for one belong to the realm of homer , herodotus , chaucer , rabelais , copernicus , newton , bacon , kant , bach , rousseau and goethe . 
  where you belong is completely your choice . 
   if by independence you mean sucking us cock it 's ok . 
  here in the west we do n't mind your gay fantasies . 
   if by vibrant liberal democracies you mean corrupt and morally bankrupt kleptocracies thieves happen in all governments , in democracies they go to jail or at least do n't get re-elected . 
  prefer belorussia much ? 
   and if by lifting out of poverty you mean 20 % unemployment ... polish unemployment this year is [ around 10 % ] ( http://stat.gov.pl/obszary-tematyczne/rynek-pracy/bezrobocie-rejestrowane/bezrobocie-rejestrowane-i-kwartal-2015-r-,3,19.html ) . 
  by `` lifting out of poverty '' he might mean that polish growth of gdp per capita between 1989 and 2013 was [ highest in europe ] ( http://www.brookings.edu/blogs/future-development/posts/2015/02/11-poland-post-socialist-transition-piatkowski ) or that [ poland went from 32 % to 60 % ] ( http://www.mckinsey.com/insights/economic_studies/how_poland_can_become_a_european_growth_engine ) of western european gdp per capita within last 25 years . 
  you are always welcome , and i say it without mockery . 
  but not quite right  it 's [ declension ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/declension ) and 2-4 take nominativus and 5 forward take genitivus of the noun . 
  the solution to this conundrum would be not to have more than 4 beers , 
  i would n't . 
  they tend to flip ( last time 780 000 years ago ) . 
  one word . 
  yumm , 
  but this statistic is not insane . 
  the article compares it to 1 % of jewish population in poland after the war , but since those were soviet aparatchiks , perhaps you should compare it to pre-war numbers - 10 % of polish citizens were jewish , and among educated professions ( doctors , artists , lawyers , etc ) it was circa 30 % . 
  the fact that soviets promoted jews in communist structures is not surprising , and also did n't last forever ( 1968 ) . 
  all cool , m8 . 
  apologies for reckless badge throwing !, 
  edit : on double checking , i actually threw it sarcastically at myself . 
  still , point taken . 
  in your link only eisner and rosa luxembourg seem to be jewish . 
  it just seems like a sweeping generalizations i keep hearing . 
  it 's like in poland i hear folks saying that polish communists were jewish . 
  nope , great , great majority were actually polish , great surprise . 
  uh-huh !, 
  the first `` left '' was linked to french revolution , and there you will not find jews among organizers - quite on the contrary : voltaire had quite antisemitic views . 
  also you will not find jews among saint-simon , robert owen , proudhon or fourier ... 
  damn it . . where are those jews hiding ... then finally !, 
  yes !, 
  i found one !, 
  but then he was also an assimilationist , who believed that the way of jewish emancipation must be via abandonment of judaism ... ehh , tough day to be a jew-hater :(, 
  up for class and cold head . 
  i have similar observation . 
  influence of american movie/tv culture is something i did n't take into account before . 
  or british misconception that their body-related mores is like in the continent , 
  next step : restoration of hussar units , 
  no , seriously they are not doing the same stuff as previous government did , not even close . 
  previous ruling party broke many rules . 
  pis is changing them . 
  * they are undermining the separation of powers , which since locke and montesque have been the safety mechanism against dictatorship . 
  ( legal changes to constitutional tribunal make it practically impossible to stop unconstitutional legislation , putting * prokuratura * under direct control of ministry ) * they are basically cancelling civil service in poland , by removing the requirement for civil servants to not be members of a political party * they are putting public media under direct control of government * and , wisienka na torcie , pad has pardoned his party colleagues the first moment he got to office . 
  who does that , for forks sake !, 
  1 ) why do you think the picture sums up everything pretty well ? 
  2 ) the association with nazi was well intended and obvious . 
  now you are just stretching it . 
  plus verhofstadt is belgian and juncker is luxembourgian . 
  the picture is offensive and idiotic . 
  3 ) do you know what propaganda means ? 
  this admittedly weak article , is just an opinion piece in vaguely unknown `` network of student journalists '' or whatever . 
  thanks . 
  good info . 
  is nyheter idag related in any way with sd ? 
  is it considered mainstream ? 
  just curious . 
  nope . 
  romania is awesome and we should be allies . 
  majority of connections are run danish-operated \u00d8resundtog . 
  this train does n't go as far as stockholm though . 
  \u00d6resundt\u00e5g is used by thousands , and new regulations will increase travel time . 
  it 's going to suck when you commute to copenhagen to work . 
  this `` myth '' is based in willful ignorance and misinterpratation of info from public portal of legal information : http://ppiop.rcl.gov.pl/ click `` orzeczenia trybuna\u0142u konstytucyjnego '' .

  they are spreading the russian narrative , which is wrong in every way . 
  i am actually disgusted by those apologists and propagandists . 
  ps : the reports about ukraine actually are n't one-sided . 
  instead they actually take too much propaganda from russia . 
  also your first link is exactly what i meant : `` ukraine bombarding its own people '' . 
  a classic from russian propaganda . 
  there is also a tiny problem with your press . 
  a little bit too biased . 
  once again : i said germans for a reason . 
  or is schulz not a german ? 
  yet again : the main outcry came from the germans . 
  so in this case it does n't matter from where , but from whom . 
  alright , then tell me about those `` evil fascist ukrainians '' `` die linke '' was always talking about and how russia did the `` right thing '' in invading and annexing crimea . 
  since that 's exactly what their narrative is . 
  i actually believe that they are almost the same as your old sed and our kpp . 
  and that 's why they are far-left . 
  it does n't have to make sense . 
  neither does it have to be realistic . 
  makes perfect sense , does n't it ? 
  haha, 
  business as normal : /, 
  why would n't you need to ? 
  you do know , that pis and po are pretty much the opposite in poland ? 
  ( not in terms of quality ( they are the same ) , but politically ) why would i let the previous government replace everyone and then just let it be , even though they are biased towards the ex-ruling party ... 
  it does n't make much sense . 
  the changes to the constitutional court were needed , since the previous government illegally appointed some judges ... ( and you should know , these judges get a huge amount of money ) and all of those judges were aligned with po , which meant that po had complete control over the court . 
  pis is continuing to silence polish ... oh , how ironic, 
  good to know that there is someone who thinks the same about the german political landscape . 
  and these are far-rights, 
  he forgot to add , that in terms of foreign affairs `` die linke '' is very supportive of putin . 
  well . 
  he is actually right , since it is mainly germans who call our government `` putinised '' and `` coup '' . 
  maybe your politicians should stop fiddling inside other country 's affairs . 
  the new polish government is actually doing the same as the old one did , but ** where was the outcry ? 
  wrong comment woops . 
  pssst , poland also had some sort of dictatorship in that time . 
  of all these countries , finland was actually the most democratic one ... and many believed that `` the enemy of your enemy is your friend '' , because you know , you , the balts and finland were attacked by the soviets first , so they sided mostly with the germans . 
  meanwhile we , the poles were first attacked by germany ( and later by russia ) so we sided with the allies . 
  god damn americans , they always have to attack great russia . 
  well , bloodless does n't mean completely without deaths . 
  otherwise these revolutions in the whole ost bloc , which were against the soviet/communist occupiers could neither be called bloodless , since there was a huge amount of abductions and also shooting involved . 
  politically , the german government : one of the worst times . 
  not only are they unjustifiably critizising our government , they are also practically destroying themselves by saying that everyone is welcome . 
  germans themselves ? 
  they are fine people , although some are naive . 
  i also had a different experience with german turks , if you can call them like that : most of them are rude and insulting as well as abusive . 
  but i have also met some nice people from that group , too . 
  not always , but mainly about ukraine including the crisis, 
  liveuamap and interpretermag do a pretty good coverage in their liveblogs which get saved every day . 
  in this month already about 100 people died . 
   i dislike talking to emotional people . 
  then stop talking to such , no idea why you bring that up . 
  or maybe you are just too dumb to understand what a broken peace is . 
  there will be more deaths , one way or another and it has nothing to do with `` russophobia '' . 
  but of course , i 'm always russophobic , everyone in central europe is russophobic , right ? 
  that also would be terrible . 
  the democrats have already proven themselves to be completely incompetent in times of conflict . 
  no peace is n't really different then a broken peace and it still shows the laziness . 
  how do you know ? 
  did you ask everyone in crimea and those crimeans who live now in exile ? 
  and what `` injustice '' was `` corrected '' by invading a foreign country ? 
  crimea is still part of ukraine and it will remain part of it , except of course they vote differently and do n't tell me , that they already did , since that `` referendum '' was n't a real one and was already done in russian occupied crimea . 
  it is illegitmate . 
  and in what way has our state of law ( which btw is ok ) to do with any of you ? 
  should i just start to ignore the aggressions of russia , just because some liberals think , it would be a good idea to demonize the new party ? 
  no idea . 
  it is an unknown number . 
  but the russians still hold pow , savchenko for example . 
  and yes , the death tolls are high , but what other do you expect in a war in the middle of europe ? 
  also a broken peace is not a real peace . 
  instability will be present , which means that terrorist attacks will appear as well as a continous aggression demand , since putin could just break it at any time . 
  and that 's why i said `` shoots '' not `` dies '' . 
  people will still be killed by the terrorists in the east . 
  or at the very least , they will be tortured . 
  and i actually believe that dying is better then being tortured for an extended time . 
  but you have to be more specific next time , since for politicians making `` peace '' there , just means that noone shoots anymore , which does n't prevents unjustice . 
  not only peace , but making russia move out of eastern ukraine is the # 1 goal . 
  but for some it is just peace ( no matter how broken ) , so they can continue trading with russia . 
  many european politicians even forget about `` cease '' part of `` cease-fire '' treaties . 
  let 's hope the eu will support that . 
  russia 's aggressions shall be not tolerated . 
  also if crimea should n't be returned , sanction the shit out of putin 's russia . 
  sadly , there are politicians with too many interests . 
  even worse is , that trump is coming . 
  wow . 
  not only doxxing , but harrassing , too . 
  the best thing : the leftists are harrassing a victim , which spoke out and where that spoken , goes against their leftist agenda . 
  my initial reaction , while reading this : to hell with this unhuman scum . 
  the cdu is the ruling party and has a coalition with spd . 
  in this case even the spd is more conservative . 
  also in poland the right-centrist party is po and even they wanted to take in `` refugees '' . 
  it has to be right-wing . 
  in that case , are n't these `` refugees '' migrants too then ? 
  since they go through several actually safe countries , which could have held them , just to reach a country , where they will recieve benefits ? 
  or just use the tactics of australia . 
  done . 
  well , apparently ukrainian refugees do n't count as `` refugees '' according to the eu, 
   are you one of the deniers ? 
  `` denier '' , no . 
  and we still sit on a huge pile of coal .

  plc and ii rp maybe , but prl and iii rp are on of the most closed homogeneous societies in the world rivalled only by japan and koreas . 
  [ you could have stopped this ] ( http://www.repostuj.pl/upload/2014/02/20140226185920uid2810_85300.jpeg ), 
  no , neutering constitutional court is a danger to democracy . 
   we 're really concerned about the freedom of speech are we finally removing blasphemy law ? 
  not really . 
  it 's mostly pr . 
  call me when you see things like this in ex-commie block . 
  that 's not bad thing * per se * . 
  dunno , ii rp was pretty authoritarian . 
   bolsheviks tfw you 're so conservative , you 're living in the xix century . 
  that 's not the case though . 
  it 's not a traditional polish value , duh . 
  after we get final result . 
  not this year , buddy . 
   you should not take seriously every statement you hear . 
  i 'm not taking statements like that one seriously . 
  i 'm just baffled , because such idiocies were n't that popular three years ago or so . 
  my point is that people tend to overlook economic progress and overall amelioration of quality of life when the spotlight is on the masses storming the borders . 
  recently i 've seen opinion that it would be better to leave eu because then poland would n't have too accept refugees . 
  insane . 
   make a comics [ i 've already drawn one two months ago ] ( https://i.imgur.com/tdlna52.png ), 
   i do n't understand . 
  they raised the vote pass threshold for parliamentary bills from 51 % to 67 % so that they requires more support to pass . 
  is this wrong ? 
  that 's not what they did . 
  [ apart from pis ignoring ct 's rulings , but who cares about constitution . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nnorp_83ru ), 
  it 's the biggest newspaper . 
  pis : the gift that keeps on giving . 
  this sub is pathetic . 
  needed that siesta . 
   it can give us a chance not to become completely colonized by our new overlords . 
  i see it works perfectly on the cases like serbia , albania and macedonia . 
   i 'm just calling you on being fucking hypocrite . 
  oh yeah , that 's the problem , not dismantling tk . 
  our `` independent '' media were first to call out hypocrisy on other but to notice that pis is n't so lawful and justice-y ? 
  they 're blind . 
  what this so called sovereignty can give poles besides smugness ? 
   and so did po that 's not an argument . 
  please , we 're not just bulwark , we 're the chirst himself . 
  human lifespan is about 80 years . 
  so no , apart from few exceptions all germans that were massacring poles are two metres under . 
   has the legals standing to outright ignore the new law while ruling if its constitutional i hope so . 
  they 're all dead . 
    it does not change the fact they broke it . 
   and now , after tk 's verdict , the constitution-breaking ** laws ** that po has made ** were deemed as null . 
  ** i 'm sorry , did you even read what i wrote ? 
   hopefully speak for yourself, 
   po broke constitution way before . 
  and now , after tk 's verdict , the constitution-breaking laws that po has made were deemed as null . 
  that 's why 2 judges had to be replaced . 
  pis ignored tk 's ruling and pushed through their own vision of `` prawo '' . 
  see the difference ? 
  ----------- i should just ignore yet another `` but po did it earlier !!! '' . 
  whataboutism and * tu quoque * is so popular these days ... 
  oh yeah , the life so better without eu . 
  both basically spoon-fed with dollars until hi-tech started to pay off . 
  how dense can you be ? 
  literally the whole thread is about how people protest about breaking the constitution , not pis ' victory . 
  there were no protests until they started dismantling tk . 
  number 1 in europe in martyrology !, 
  omg , evil gender ideology !!, 
  `` offensive '' has no meaning in today world . 
  anyway , now in media i only see `` czarnosk\u00f3ry '' , so the debate on `` murzyn '' is pointless . 
  i agree with this analysis but i do n't see how breaking the neck of the constitutional court can help with our economy . 
   yes , but ` murzyn ' or ` murzynek ' also are a derogatory not really . 
  condescending maybe . 
  no , downvoting you just hides a paranoiac . 
  we should just make jaros\u0142aw kaczy\u0144ski the generalissimos and end this presidential charade already . 
  oh , yeah , a lot of `` i did n't vote for pis , *** but *** ... '' lately . 
  because pis opponents are n't true poles , duh . 
  people tend to forget that poland is the christ of nations and can not do wrong . 
  no , it 's not . 
  uk is n't all europe . 
  i see , i edited out `` and the rest of '' . 
  i understand exaggeration just fine . 
  the problem is that you and far right treat it as a proper argument . 
   5 % of population  bazillion muslims did n't know germany has population of china . 
   you are forgetting about iceland . 
  i 'm not the first who did this , nor the last . 
  hahahahahaha . 
  we were the first democracy in europe after middle ages . 
  what is yoir flair ? 
  that 's even better . 
  it 's still better for poland . 
  that is for easter and weddings . 
  both . 
  show me one country recognised by un and that is not failed state , with ** absolute ** freedom of speech . 
  merkel is more competent than kaczy\u0144ski , so yeah , i would . 
  insourcing . 
  implying duda is more than puppet . 
  we have to pull a crimea to protect polish minorities in uk from their oppressice government . 
  what idaho has to do with genitalia . 
  seriously . 
  i 'm hanging out on european forum , discussing european issues and european news . 
  i could care less about `` american values '' . 
  i can argue about free speech and discuss varying pointsof views without americans ruining threads . 
  europe is diverse enough to have people favouring absolute free speech without your `` help '', 
  this is / r/europe , not / r/worldnews . 
  you wo n't find me on / r/idaho telling hpw the state should be run .

  the only party that i do n't have a lot of direct info of their thieving is kukiz 15 - who just have n't been around long enough , and are shameless opportunists that 'll say whatever they think people want to hear . 
  po , psl , pis , sld - for each of this i know of several ridiculous cases of corruption and cronyism . 
  to give an example to what / u/austinvonrivia is saying , because redditors from romania may have different expectation of what corruption is vs someone from czechia : a ) big company is being privatized , employer for 700 people , has signed contracts with world-level brands in it 's segment , and renown for it 's own products domestically . 
  ai n't no way to fuck this up . 
  the only problems are ageing crew in a country that 's eliminated it 's trade schools which increases overhead costs . 
  but in their specific niche and with their clients - really no way to fuck it up . 
  crew and local journalists raise an alarm when the company is about to be sold for 7 mil pln to an investor that has been nicknamed `` undertaker '' - he bought and liquidated with similar mo 3 major companies from that sector in other voyvodships . 
  has been convicted of having an union rep beaten up by his bodyguard . 
  has previously sold a company which then after 10 months has shown 35 mil debt to pension fund . 
  local politicians see nothing wrong with selling the company to him . 
  within the year their file to city planning to have the land approved for development . 
  within few years the company lost it 's domestic market , has already fired 300 people , is about to fire rest of 400 when the change in city planning is approved . 
  and this is a case that can be traced via internet accessible news reports and government information ( to track the people he puts in board of directors in the companies he buys and liquidates ) . 
  company that uses those funds to invest in infrastructure for those companies ( roads , lamps , parking lots etc ) . 
  i 've seen a director of one of 3 most successful ones in the country replaced by 2 psl cronies who then hired over a dozen of psl cronies who did literally nothing in the company - esp . 
  in last 6 months ( post election ) . 
  what happens after pis wins - old director reinstated , new competent one hired ? 
  naaah , just put a pis crony and replace the psl cronies with 14 pis cronies . 
  how is doing things through other people , yourself unable to hold a direct conversation with another leader - a sign of independence ? 
  if anything - it introduces a way of outside influence . 
  oh , that 's a whooooole other can of worms . 
  poland during wwii , although occupied , [ has not lost it 's government continuity ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polish_government-in-exile ) . 
  many of administration members escaped in time and sneaked to london where they re-formed the official polish government . 
  fast forward to yalta and poland is basically given up by americans as a gift to russians . 
  churchill has had an alternative plan , but in the end he yielded as well . 
  many british mps protested giving up a wwii ally , but their amendment to treatise was defeated . 
  this part is important , because the disagreement you see in this thread stems from what was gained by soviets , and how . 
  specifically - that the difference that poland was `` just '' a satellite state and not part of ussr stems more from language of yalta treatise , and not actual difference in how that country was governed ( which is a huge simplification because every communist country , be it ussr proper , a satellite state , or any number of other communist regimes - were volatile depending on regime in moscow and china and their ideological turmoils ) . 
  fast forward to end of the war , and soviets ruling in poland . 
  there was still government in london . 
  between 1943 and 1947 main political parties tried to band together to form a realistic way of cooperation with soviets , begrudgingly accepting reality of post-yaltan europe , but it 's proven to be ultimately futile . 
  soviets [ installed their own puppet government ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/provisional_government_of_national_unity ) ignoring the fact that there was an active one in london . 
  government in exile tried reconciliation way until 1954 ( so even after systematic genocide of poles in their own country , especially former ak army members ) . 
  with less and less power , the government in exile arguably survived communists and in 1990 passed on the power to lech wa\u0142\u0119sa . 
  but realistically , it 's lost any real influence and more importantly - official recognition - in 1959 . 
  in 1955 several members of government in exile returned to poland to try and work with soviet regime after the thaw . 
  just to note - not until 1955 did [ tomasz arciszewski ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tomasz_arciszewski ) return - one of most prominent socialists in history of poland . 
  a guy that used to be a communist terrorist fighting for proletariat since at least 1898 . 
  i 'm just mentioning this to underscore that the problem people had with provisional government installed by soviets was not that it was communist , but that it was just a puppet government subservient to another country . 
  he 'd have to cover rationale of post wwi border drawing , yalta border drawing , history of society and ruling elites in commonwealth of poland and lithuania and how identity of regions of poland , belarus ukraine and lithuania established . 
  and especially the first two are prime bait for nationalists from multiple sides . 
  basically , poland after wwi was smaller than the commonwealth , but bigger than the polish part of commonwealth . 
  after ww 2 it lost territory to east , and was given territory on west instead . 
  looking up a map of commonwealth and crown within it would explain this better . 
  the contended part is not whether the regions lost to ussr post yalta were poland , but whether poland was de facto sovereign . 
  but we were still controlled by moscow , even the economy , theathers etc. 
  qed : us and its pac and suler pac situation, 
  and you have non-zero amount of contact with any germans whatsoever ? 
  german patriotism is the thing i 'm most envious about , because i see it as a root of a lot of their success . 
  it gets a bit annoying when you do business with them . 
  or when they visit . 
  germans i 've met and saw are patriotic by thinking all they do is of remarkably high quality . 
  they support not just companies from germany - from their land specifically . 
  they take care of their municipality . 
  and act like they own the place wherever they go . 
  i much prefer that kind of patriotism to footbal hooligans with unearned patriotic symbols on a t-shirt made in china who then destroy benches in park . 
  as for suicide rates and regressive demographic tendencies - those seem consistent for a developed economy anywhere . 
  i do n't see myself having kids anytime soon myself , but that does n't mean i 'd rather be in russia ( which stabilized it 's negative growth tendencies fairly recently ) . 
  or ie palestine . 
  : again , how is excerting military strength working out for regular russians ? 
  economy and price of food doing alright ? 
  can you feel all that muscle flexing having positive impact on how living in the country is ? 
  if so , what made you leave ? 
  and how is that raw military power and not sweating small stuff working out for 90 % of russians right now ? 
  for the rotten downfallen cesspool germany is supposed to be according to russia - germans appear to be doing fine for themselves . 
  still in a higher danger from eating too much wurst and kebab than terrorist attacks . 
  how are things working out for actual russians since the crimea annexation ? 
  better ? 
  wait , so are germans suicidal servile castrated nation or evil overlords of europe keeping others servile ? 
  russian media talking points get confusing . 
  pis has a history of fundraising with republicans among polish expats . 
  and us expats are famous in poland for being absolutely out of touch with how the country looks like nowadays . 
  i wonder if trump is n't miscalculating what the reception will be based on how conservative us poles are . 
  that said , as much as i detest the man and think he 's being a liability to european safety regarding russian aggression - we should praise his big manly hands , his classy gild-all-the-things style and how big his inauguration crowd was . 
  let merkel and macron push him . 
  we should fluff his ego , give some positive headlines , and see if he promises visas within first day or not . 
  give us visas donnie boy . 
  we have the cheap labour your economy needs - but white !, 
  our illegal immigrants will vote republican , so there 's also that . 
  does that matter to banking though ? 
  i 'd have thought lax regulation and easy access to and from other markets would be all they care about . 
  examples would be communications surveillance , internet censorship . 
  and eu and uk taking turns justifying tightening the screw by pointing at eachother . 
  um , i think it just took a photo . 
  can you hit the wall again ? 
  we can wait 2 years , 
  why do you think it 's considered `` green '' energy ? 
  you do n't get it . 
  in some countries military industry is the milk cow for ruling party . 
  board filled with technologically illiterate political appointments . 
  all they want is for the factory to bang out the same shit in same numbers and to nobody to pay attention to their books . 
  i 'd think that prosecuting right after given term ends could help that . 
  but other might have much better ideas how to prevent abuse , and if that safeguard cod be abused and how . 
  what i 'm saying is that these rules allow bad behaviour , but guard principles of democracy for when the likes of ie erdogan or putin come to power . 
  or according to some critics - the likes of le pen . 
  so yes , if voters are being stupid , they 'll do stupid things . 
  but imho the way to combat this is by getting people more involved and in much more critical way , nit tearing down or ignoeing aafeguards of democracy . 
  you 're missing the point behind immunity laws methinks . 
  she could still be tried after she leaves office . 
  immunity laws are there to prevent influence of executive officials on legislative branch .

  depends on location and size of the apartment i guess ... 
  i could see merkel winning a fight but will she be fast enough ? 
  i mean she does not seem to move around very fast ... our army , pm and president will hold putin off for maybe a day or two . 
  i realy want into reich now ... 
  no no no not roll over and die . 
  just do not take vanguard . 
  do not get ahead of the pack . 
  why no polenreich ... its so humiliating ... 
  hmm thats the same as me pretty much . 
  we are so fucked if he will come here . 
  yea but you know sometimes i would like our politicians to take more of a back seat . 
  they have all the cities, 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/antemurale_christianitatis spolier 120 year after poland was no more, 
  all history, 
  yeeey let 's become a bulwark of europe again it went so nice the last time ... 
  rome , georgia , usa ? 
  if it was 80 years ago i 'd trade germany for estonia any day but now ? 
  meh estonians are too imperialistic and aggressive compared to current germans :p, 
  surely turkey would n't want them inside their borders if they saw them as some kind of threat . 
  they would either jail or deport them . 
  is n't it what he said ? 
  he does not mean conflict as in war , but rather the thing that our main opposition party see 's germany as almost as bad as russia . 
  get into conflict as in have sour relations . 
  already have one with lithuania/russia/belarus . 
  damn deficit of 98 % gdp would be ridiculous xd, 
   ~ ~ greece ~ ~ ~ ~ bysantia ~ ~ eastern roman empire , ftfy, 
  selling ammo to kebab so that kabab remove itself , genius !, 
  i attempted to watch jerry springer thingy ... 
  she looks like my former polish teacher , oh the nightmare ... 
  but eating cake and having it is a dream that everyone should aim for !, 
  lots of people speak english in poland let 's make it an official language !, 
  eez is exclusive economic zone i think :p, 
  how else should we call feta cheese ? 
  i think, 
  there is so much wrong with polish ... 
   we 're talking about ukraine here , not europe . 
  you mentioned europe ... 
  oh god ` though ' this word ... 
  some older folks still know it quite well . 
  well you now know food = / = food . 
  feta-like cheese :p, 
  ... yea sweden pls invade we wo n't defend this time ... but no rape and mass killings this time pls, 
  it 's further away from friendly border . 
  not to mention poland has very not defense friendly terrain . 
  excluding ofc . 
  the fact that roads in eastern poland are reaaaaly bad . 
  we should totally take berlin ... just because :p, 
  we make fun of their language all the time :d . they are the best . 
  im very pro eu and even i think that america would be the first to help ... 
  thing is when you get hit by lighting it 's either your own fault ( standing near metal objects during storm ) or otherwise we ca n't do much about it as nature does not think about killing people it just happens . 
  terrorsts on the other hand are humans like us . 
  for some ideological reason , they kill random people who in many cases never did anything against them in their life . 
  but yeah limiting freedom for all due to tiny minority is stupid . 
  well it would be nice for arabs to get their own local ww 1/2 in middle east . 
  would probably pacify them like it did europeans ... 
  but ... 
  but ... spartans ... 
  well they did want to shutdown gps so ofc they will get lost once in a while . 
  well romania did help poland waaay more then hurt it during ww2 so , good job romania !, 
  thanks to eu our sidewalks are n't gray or asphalt anymore !, 
  they lasted for 250 + years of polish rule and 150 + of russian and they are still there . 
  5 years without gas will be a walk in the park :p, 
  thing is neither west nor russia will allow ukraine to remain neutral anymore . 
  so it 's either go back to russian sphere of influence or get into eu sphere . 
  if your little brother drinks more than you you should be ashamed ... 
  well you need to drink something along with vodka ... 
  it 's actually quite popular here to get drunk with vodka and when you are hungover drink beer supposedly it helps . 
  poland is best catholic ... 
  in some cases even politicians can tell that something can hurt ` xxx ' people feelings e.g. 
  if merkel went to celebrate crimea `` reclamation '' day in russia . 
  how can some random person on the internet know what people in japan feel about it ... 
  well there would be a lot o jokes about germans and the situation for sure ... 
  poland also did and after having our industry f *** d for decade or so we ended much better off . 
  note we do n't really have much oil , gas or other high income resources ... 
  commie buddies :p, 
  well , unlucky ? 
  i do n't think that it 's russians fault how putin turned out ... 
  nationalism is you know , the easier option so many people go to it to explain stuff . 
  i chuckled a bit . 
  but yeah !, 
  you evil russian !, 
  free ukraine !, 
  we are not that against it , we would allow turkey to join when pigs start to glide * * without any help ofc . 
  no no they do that but they are n't ( at least in my experience ) asking them ( my sister ) to bear they children ofc . 
  when the friend is away ... 
  yes !, 
  our dear eurocratic overlords . 
  \u0141\u00f3d\u017a means boat in polish so i could see there being some issues :p, 
  ahh famous castles of zprzwzykszwzrzksyzcykrzrwyzkjzwykzy you forgot . 
  i think its more about romania ... 
  come to poland we do n't have many non-white people :p, 
  well some muslims give them bad name ... like the one hitting on my sister while having baby and being married to her best friend ... 
  fries only with ketchup . 
  potato + mayonnaise is a sin . 
  warsaw is kinda sucky , just average big city . 
  well for lithuania we are forced by nato to defend them anyway , so even if we had to finance the entire thing it would be beneficial , as in the case of war there would be less poles and more lithuanians to die for their country ... as for ukraine the stronger pro-west ukraine the better for us . 
  normal russians would be plugged out of the internet . 
  professional troll would most likely be still plugged in to spread misinformation abroad . 
  mazowieckie definitely stay in . 
  warsaw is the london of poland ( sucking up the economy of the rest ) .

  you realize that it 's entirely possible to be pro-life and non-religious , right ? 
  it 's not a purely `` based on religion '' issue . 
  uk results are even more interesting , with the top three being kukiz , pis and korwin , each getting a bit over 20 % of votes . 
  zero , they failed to get past the electoral threshold . 
  zero . 
  they failed to get enough signatures to even register their candidates . 
   so can they get no seats ? 
  if they fail to reach a good result in the electoral district they start in , they wo n't get any seats just like any other party with a weak result would n't . 
   and the other parties are allowed to participate in the elections there too , right ? 
  yeah , the nation-wide parties also participate in elections there . 
  there are multiple parliament seats available in each electoral district , and after the votes are counted they are assigned in a way proportional to the result . 
   how many ? 
  that depends on their electoral results . 
  it used to be 2-3 in the 90s ( with as high as 7 in 1991 ) , nowadays it 's usually one seat . 
   what 's the system ? 
  the exact same as with any other party , the only difference being that as a minority committee they do n't need to pass the countrywide 5 % threshold to have their result taken into consideration . 
  in fact , if only one colour was used for each party , they would be barely noticeable . 
  that 's actually where the belarusian minority lives . 
   who was that self righteous cunt asking for `` culture '' ? 
  sejm marshal ( speaker of the parliament ) [ marek jurek ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/marek_jurek ) . 
   doesnt change the fact that k\u00f6nigsberg is and was always german/prussian . 
  yeah , until uncle stalin decided one day that he fancy a warm baltic sea port , bombed it to oblivion , demolished what remained of its ruins , built shitty commieblocks all over it and settled them with russians : dd  even today it would be de jure german . 
  * de jure * , even today prussia would merely remain a rebellous vassal of the king of poland . 
  personally , i prefer the [ 1648 ] ( http://img09.deviantart.net/ad89/i/2013/141/8/9/europe__ad_1648____the_peace_of_westphalia_by_undevicesimus-d61mavp.jpg ) ones . 
  the small polish province of prussia still knew its place back then . 
   they will split you faster yeah , the might of your broomsticks is legendary indeed . 
   his salary is coming out of our tax money . 
  i dont want to pay for that idiot thank you very much . 
  i do n't want my taxes to be spent on commie meps either , but sadly this is not how it works . 
  actually , both stockholm and oslo have earlier sunset in the winter . 
  warsaw has short days in the winter , and as it 's quite in the north , moving to another timezone wo n't change this situation ( and i 'd rather have sunset at 3pm in the winter than sunrise at 9am , really ) . 
  also , we have * always * used the cet , and it * is * our natural timezone ( as in noon is the closest to 12pm ) . 
   do you know the buzz words around this election ? 
  \\ #polandinruins, 
  the last time i checked , norway ranks higher on economical freedom than poland . 
  with their very liberal economic model they are actually one of the * last * countries in the world that could be described as `` socialist '' . 
   the other end of the scale is just as bad . 
  definitely not , communism is * way * , way worse . 
   that shit has worked out well in the past , right ? 
  so far , that shit seems to have worked out way better than putting all the power in hands of the left-wing marxist lunatics , which was sadly also tried out in our country . 
   the conclusion is that right-wing is the only truth ? 
  well , the conclusion that we have reached so far is that socialism does not work . 
  initially - in the 80s - commies had really low support levels , in single digit numbers . 
  during the 90s , after they transformed into a - nominally - socialdemocratic party , their support strongly but steadily grew , and they were one of the two major political blocks in poland ( the other being what emerged out of anti-commie opposition , post-solidarity ) . 
  post-commies won the elections in 2001 , but did such an atrocious and embezzlement-ridden performance , that after the term ended their role as a major political block was over forever . 
  on the other hand the post-solidarity bloc , which since the 80s has gone through various disintegrations , reintegrations and re-disintegrations many times , ultimately consolidated into two major parties around that time - which are current po and pis . 
  those parties successfuly took over not only the post-solidarity voters , but also expanded into the void left by ( now completely compromised ) post-commies . 
  this situation mostly persisted to this day , although po seems to be in a serious decline lately . 
  the poles living in poland , a group that among others happens to include myself , are those who * did n't * emmigrate anywhere . 
  the fact that church in finland is mostly a local protestant church , and not the roman catholic one could have something to do with it . 
   romania 's most important party after the revolution was the left wing party . 
  that 's because unlike poland , romania did not have a mass anti-communist resistance movement that lasted for a decade , out of which influential non-left wing parties and political leaders not connected with the communists could instantly emerge . 
  i do n't recall immigrating anywhere . 
   seriously , that 's not our fault that you were moved west . 
  not your fault ? 
  we would n't be , if you did n't start the fucking war in the first place . 
  nah , i am simply happy that after 26 years we finally got rid of post-commies . 
  finally ending the rule of po that completely betrayed their programme is a nice bonus . 
  i have never been so happy about election results before . 
  the only thing that would make it better would be korwin making it in as well . 
  every single historical book or map of europe regarding the 1387-1497 period , as well as interpretation of those treaties in kingdom of poland begs to differ then . 
  though i 'm quite sure the international historical community will be interested in your discovery , you should share it . 
  just for your information , the pokuttia matter was regarded in * another * treaty , signed long after the pledge of vassalage . 
   there never was such an arrangement , of course there was , in fact there were multiple ones . 
  [ petru ii of moldavia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/petru_ii_of_moldavia ) signed such agreement in 1387 , and similar agreememts were also signed by all the moldavian rulers during the following 90 years . 
  i do n't recall we ever had live threads for local elections * anywhere * . 
   principality of moldavia principality of moldavia was a vassal of poland until 1487 , thus it 's depicted in poland 's colour . 
  absence of serbia and croatia is easily explained as well :  in 1402 it was actually an ally of hungary under stefan lazarevic exactly , in * 1402 * . 
  on the other hand , this map shows the situation as of a.d. * 1400 * , and in this particular year serbia * was * a vassal of oe ( a relation that persisted between 1394 and 1402 in spite of earlier battle of kosovo ) . 
   oh and croatia was a separate country still , even if it shared a king with hungary . 
  it was in a personal union with hungary , just like lithuania was with poland , or denmark was with sweden . 
  the map is very consistent in how it treats this kind of situation , it * would * be ` shit ' if it made a special exception for croatia . 
   what kind of shit map is that ? 
  the only thing that 's shit here is your historical knowledge . 
  unemployment , gdp per capita , education levels and many other statistics are not really following this artificial russian - / prussian - partition divide . 
  while actually it was mostly used by prussian and russian agents to prevent * any * legislature from passing whatsoever . 
  surprise , surprise , who would have guessed . 
  or little too early , if they only waited a few more years until napoleon , then we would probably still exist after the congress of vienna where the european situation was roughly set in stone until the ww1 . 
   also if we do no reforms russia might not attacks us . 
  well , they * were n't * wrong . 
  the partitions of plc happened * precisely * because our nobility finally got their shit together and started to modernize and reform the country . 
  [ europe in 1400 , way before hungary `` teamed up with austria '' . 
  ] ( http://www.euratlas.net/history/europe/1400/1400.jpg ) notice the familiar shape ? 
   why does it have only two color instead of three ? 
  if you are really interested , because three colors are too mainstream , and our [ old flag design ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0c/chor%c4%85giew_kr%c3%b3lewska_kr%c3%b3la_zygmunta_iii_wazy.svg/1280px-chor%c4%85giew_kr%c3%b3lewska_kr%c3%b3la_zygmunta_iii_wazy.svg.png ) was already taken by austria . 
   hungary teamed up with austria to steal clay from surrounding nations . 
  hungary already had all those lands for over 500 years before habsburgs inherited their throne . 
   actually believed in communism , i 'm quite sure you could count those on fingers of a one hand . 
  communism in poland was pretty much dead as an ideology long before the system collapsed . 
   ask about your political alignment i do n't support any party in particular . 
  i 'm somewhat conservative on social issues , and liberal ( or perhaps even libertarian ) on economical issues . 
   which polish newspapers do you think are more trustworthy , if any ? 
  both rzeczpospolita and dziennik gazeta prawna , while not perfect either , are at least an order of magnitude more reputable as a news source than wyborcza . 
  murder 20 % of poles 2 . 
  wait 70 years 3 . 
  enjoy your increased relative power in europe . 
  long-term planning is important , is n't it ? 
  good , i really hope they 'll take enough electorate from zlew that it wo n't break the 8 % threshold . 
   is n't the gazeta one of poland 's most reputable newspapers ? 
  lol .

   india i do n't even know what is going on there . 
  the only thing i can think of would be the after effects of british colonialism but i have no idea about india , sorry . 
   if we define anything as poverty as not german median levels , then sure , it is still poor , but it would n't tell us anything . 
  it tells us that countries east of germany still have tons of catching up to do and might not ever catch up as while they are catching up , western europe countries and their economies are moving farther and farther forward . 
  in short , countries that were poor will still be poor but hey , at least they get a new coat of paint every now and then . 
   cries in spanish never gets old . 
  i love this story , it just drives home the point that life can still be somewhat absurd :d, 
  because democracy is a greek invention :d, 
  i refuse to believe this . 
  we had a digital technology minister here in poland and here was his desk : http://m.natemat.pl/5a21310c1ed50aed52c35a58008649ad,640,0,0,0.jpg, 
  i do !, 
  sounds like some weird version of spanish to me . 
   has turned himself over ... in his sleep . 
  `` there 's a serial suicider about , three people have died of bullets to the back of the head ... '', 
  oh yeah , i heard about that . 
  i think they still play them on our tv ... 
  poland : we realized we are still here and went back to hating each other and everyone else around us for no reason . 
  i know , right ? 
  while the area does look nicer , you can still see the poverty just underneath it all . 
  this is like the `` hanging chad '' scenario in the 2000 election in the us : something completely silly fucks up everything . 
  you know what i mean though :p, 
  he made so many u-turns that he 's now looking at his own ass . 
  why not have the euro as a trade currency while at the same time people use a national currency in their own borders . 
  that way all of europe wo n't have to be dragged down into the pits whenever we have another greece-like default scenario . 
  why are we at the behest of a ratings agency ? 
  looking at the map on the side bar , we neighbour 4 eu countries . 
  are we to consider our fellow eu countries enemies as well ? 
  that is some seriously paranoid shit right there ... 
  they existed ? 
   every neighboring country hold up . 
  are we doing the martyr of europe act again ? 
  jesus h. christ , is our country really that paranoid that we think everyone 's out to get us ? 
  are n't the brazilian telenovelas also popular in poland ? 
  a german asking for camps in poland ... absolutely triggered !!, 
  ask the swiss ... 
  socialist europe !, 
   poland is number 40 hell , poles tend to hate each other around here so i am not surprised . 
  if they 're using us state plates then it miiiiiight be illegal ( not a lawyer ) . 
  i think the license plate thing was a trend in florida as in the us you only need to have the proper fl license plate on the back of the car . 
  you can put anything on the front of the car , though . 
  and recorded in their official logs `` we have destroyed $ 10m worth of cocaine on this day '' . 
  what i am just supposed to submit to your idea that these `` refugees '' are some kind of a boon ? 
  fell off the back of a truck . 
  we have our own problems , why invite people with their own problems ? 
  as you can see , they tend to cause mostly trouble and are a net drain on their host countries . 
  then they 'll assault the innocents or even make them into accomplices . 
  sure , but that device can hold thousands of books in one device . 
  some people just do n't have the room to have thousands of individual books in their homes . 
  human beings with a heightened potential for criminality . 
  instant access , no physical media ? 
  who cares about all that ? 
  they come from places where they do n't even have a dictionary look up the meaning of the word `` civilization '' . 
  they should not be allowed here , it 's not our problem that their countries are in a constant state of chaos . 
  yes , let 's just import people who are barely civilized so we can continue to feel good about ourselves and moralize . 
  so you are more than happy to let in thousands of potential criminals hidden amongst the millions of refugees ? 
   for those unemployed so how is that any different from welfare ? 
  considering how many neoliberals gutted post soviet-bloc countries of just about everything worth having , at the time , just after communism fell , it 's no wonder people just might not like them . 
  muslim celts or celtic muslims ? 
  you decide !, 
  is `` krach '' an actual romanian word ? 
  because it means the same thing in polish : crash as in `` stock market crash ''  referring to one of the newspaper headlines in the video . 
  interesting ... i wonder how many asylum applications finland will receive once this goes in effect . 
  because you have not lived anywhere near the european version of gypsies . 
  you may have lived around whatever gypsy clans there may be in the us but here in europe they are quite different . 
  so that 's where they come from : volcanoes !, 
   it 's their job to spin things ftfy, 
  turkey is getting ready to blend in with its surroundings like a chameleon :p, 
  plus it 's the sticks , there is nothing to do there .

  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtrocgb5qj8&amp;t=0s ), 
  you mean le pen ? 
  fiat 126p 's were never all that fast you know ... 
  gypsies are nothing like american blacks , i can tell you that much . 
  american blacks that have led a life of crime can and have been redeemed and are a positive boon to society . 
  there 's no redemption for gypsies , none . 
  no , that is experience , not claims . 
  we see them every day in various european countries scamming , begging , stealing , and more . 
  face it , most of them are thieves and criminals . 
  sorry it does n't jive with whatever narrative you may have . 
  they do n't assimilate at all , they do n't hold jobs , they do n't want to hold jobs but they need money so there you go . 
  everything in their culture encourages stealing . 
  it 's literally their culture to steal from others . 
  have you lived anywhere near any roma ? 
  roma tend to steal and they do so a lot . 
  wellllll ... when you have `` diversity '' literally shoved down your throat without so much as a by-your-leave ... 
   taxing people over 30 with no children we had that it was called `` podatek bykowy '' :d, 
  lem me shake my couch as i am sure i have a few hidden in there ... 
  or fair-to-middling poland ... 
  no , they can not . 
  we 'd like to keep our country safe since it 's damned impossible to tell the terrorists apart from the innocent people . 
  do n't blame us for not wanting to invite or take in people en masse just to have radicals blend in with the non-radicals . 
  here 's my choice : i do n't want to pay for some johny-come-lately 's education , housing , welfare , food etc. 
  it seems like that is what you are implying with `` the choices we 've been making so far '' . 
   run off to russia you 're implying that russia wo n't have an active role in making sure those ee countries run to russia in the first place . 
  we tried taking some in but they ran off to germany so you keep them , merkel . 
  well , when muslims act up in other countries it 's rather difficult to just say `` oh yes , they 'll be fine here , no problem ! '', 
  we hear about stabbings , shootings , bombings , rapes at festivals all happening in places that coincidentally have a sizeable muslim population so can you blame us for being just a tad conservative about this issue ? 
  i 've eaten it with ketchup !, 
  they stopped selling a lot of their good flavors here so yeah ... 
  well , something seems to be going right since some of those babushkas are still chopping wood and doing other activities ...

  furthermore , we just had an extremely strenuous election , and there was a whole host of more important topics ( yes , those exist ) to be debated . 
  let 's just wait for the new government to settle in first . 
  and if the symbolical head of state makes a symbolical gesture , that 's the most direct expression of an opinion anyone can ever expect from a nation as a whole . 
  what kind of separatist group in existence would put swabians and badenians [ german south-west ] in the same nation ?!, 
  we practically hate each other . 
  we 're talking about completely different things here . 
  just because emotions _ motivate _ people to take a certain stance does not at all imply that the point must be defended in emotionally appealing way , particularly if the displayed emotions are meant to sway the reader or beat down the opponent . 
  that 's eristic , and it 's the opposite of a good , productive and truthful debate style . 
  no , i just do n't like people not maintaining proper emotional distance to the subject of a discussion , and aggressive language is a sign of that . 
  that 's why i inferred a certain stance into your comment above . 
  discussing such things emotionally will never , ever lead to a conclusion applicable to the whole of a democratic society , only reason can . 
  strong emotions in politics lead to extremist regimes . 
  your tone was very confrontative , do n't you notice that ? 
  and you immediately started using vocabulary that has no place in a reasonable debate . 
  no , that the automatism to call someone a nazi / racist is worst in germany and scandinavia , respectively . 
  but considering your display of aggression , you probably think that 's a good thing . 
  true , but germany takes this to the extremes . 
  i think we 're on par with scandinavia in this context . 
  yes . 
  it is n't . 
  in the `` differences between the us and europe '' threads , those from the us often openly state that the friendliness is indeed superficial and formulaic and that statements like `` how are you '' are n't made to get an honest response . 
  europeans , as far as i got to know them , are n't friendly to people they do n't know and like , which i very much prefer above the us sentiment . 
  that 's not to say that one is inherently better or worse , they 're just two different approaches to social interaction . 
  i just said that _ i _ prefer this , not that everyone has to . 
  i much prefer european sincerity over us superficiality . 
  that 's not only reddit , that 's 90 percent of the `` it 's natural , _ maaan _ ! '', 
  crowd . 
  both . 
   why is it only english that 's so looked down on today ? 
  because there 's usually zero enrichment and only displacement . 
  i do think french has a native word for `` bike '' . 
  the black man ( if he 's the same as in germany ) is n't black by skin color , it just means `` shadow man '' . 
  i meant romanians in general , not you personally . 
   and what about people with immunodeficiency ? 
  those are exceedingly rare and leprosy is probably the least of their concerns . 
  if it does n't spread to or is carried by people with an intact immune system , they 'll never come into contact with it . 
  and tb is of course a very different animal and something that should be carefully screened for . 
   when germany made the agreement to take in 800,000 asylum seekers ... what agreement ? 
  that 's simply a projected figure of the number of `` unexpected '' migrants expected to arrive , no more no less . 
   for example , it 's not possible for a white to be oppressed/discriminated by a non-white the same way you ca n't be oppressed by your dog or a cat . 
  heh , that 's a nicely succinct ( if simplistic ) way of putting it . 
  leprosy is n't really that infectious , actually - you have to try to contract it if you do n't live in very bad conditions . 
  not to say that people should n't be checked for it , of course ; eradicating the disease is a global objective , but it 's not necessary to be fearful of it . 
   he took his wife to syria , then moved to romania for good , despite having the chance to live even in america . 
  wow , that 's how you describe your own country ? 
  and i thought germans had a fetish for flagellating themselves ... 
  ah , i had n't thought of mentioning motifs when submitting the post . 
  there are many very interesting ones as well , and they appear to be surprisingly similar across europe - for instance , the nightmare as an elf that chokes people in their sleep , the changeling as a demonic child that 's smuggled in as a replacement for a human child , and of course such well-known ones as vampires or succubi . 
  many of them are explained by either archetypical experiences or attempts to understand reality - for instance , the witches ' flight may be explained by dissociative experiences that are commonly induced by nightshade plants used in folk medicine . 
  i do n't have any obscure stories to share because my memory of what my grandfather told me is shaky , but i 'm sure what may appear boringly common knowledge to germans may not be as well-known in other countries . 
  also , there are of course many , many more popular legends ( like the nibelung saga or loreley ) and i could n't begin to write them all down , so feel free to share other german myths and stories as well . 
  - ** the return of barbarossa ** - it is said that the legendary emperor friedrich i. barbarossa , who never returned from his holy crusade , has not died but instead banished himself to a mountain hall under the kyffh\u00e4user . 
  there he sits in a magical sleep on a marble throne , awakening every hundred years to see if the ravens still circle the mountain 's peak . 
  once they are gone , he will return and reunite the reich by reclaiming his throne . 
  - this legend prompted the erection of the kyffh\u00e4user monument , one of germany 's most well-known monuments ; it symbolizes the second reich 's claim to have fulfilled barbarossa 's vision . 
  - ** r\u00fcbezahl ** - r\u00fcbezahl is the mountain spirit of the giant mountains , and there are many tales about him toying with the inhabitants of that region . 
  the best-known story is probably how he gained his name . 
  - the spirit once abducted a princess he fell in love with and made her live in his mountain fortress . 
  she soon became very lonely in her gilded cage , and in an effort to simulate a normal life for her , r\u00fcbezahl gave her magical turnips which could take any shape she desired . 
  the princess conjured up her friends and family and began to accept her fate . 
  but the magical creatures aged tremendously quickly , soon shriveling up and dying as actual turnips would have . 
  the princess was distraught and set the spirit an ultimatum : only if he could tell her how many turnips he had , and thus if she would be able to keep a court , would she marry him . 
  r\u00fcbezahl quickly began to count the turnips , again and again , arriving at a different number each time due to his vast fields . 
  meanwhile , the princess shaped one last turnip she had saved into a magical horse and fled the castle while the spirit was distracted , mocking him as r\u00fcbezahl - `` turnip-counter '' - from afar . 
  * ** st\u00f6rtebeker 's execution ** - the dread pirate st\u00f6rtebeker , who had terrorized the hansa for years , was finally caught and set to be executed along with his crew . 
  as his dying wish , he demanded that every man his beheaded corpse would walk by would be set free . 
  thinking such a feat was impossible , the senate granted his wish - and against all odds , the pirate 's headless corpse rose from the executioner 's block and walked past eleven of his crew . 
  only when the executioner tripped him , he fell ; and out of anger , the same immediately beheaded the eleven men who were supposed to have been saved . 
  the senate was in awe of his endurance and asked the executioner if the day 's work had not tired him , but he assured them that he had enough strength left in him to behead the entire senate as well , robbers as they were . 
  thus , he was executed himself . 
  - ** the earthen pot ** - different from the others , this is a short moral tale and the only one i remember well from my grandfather 's . 
  - an old man had grown feeble with age and was too weak to properly eat his soup . 
  his son and his daughter in law were disgusted by the sight and condemned him to eat by himself , sitting on the ground . 
  distraught by his banishment , the old man grew even more shaky and dropped and shattered his soup bowl . 
  the son became very angry with him and announced that his father would only be given cheap earthen pots from now on . 
  the old man began to cry , which the couple 's little son observed with interest . 
  later that day , the child was seen clumsily cutting away at some boards . 
  `` what are you doing ? 
  '' , his father asked him . 
  `` i am learning to be a carpenter '' , replied the child , `` so that when you are old , you will have wooden troughs that you can not break . '', 
  the man was deeply moved by this comment and invited his father back to the table . 
  oooh , so you spoke about a _ collective _ `` you '' that i must be a part of if i do n't appreciate your methods . 
  well , figures . 
  that 's probably the most absurd lie you could possibly have come up with . 
  absolutely nothing of what you say is true in any way whatsoever . 
  i do n't even get your reason for it , it 's not like anybody except me will read this in a deleted thread . 
  you need to include better directions or people wo n't find it . 
  it 's past all the inquisitive comments and past all the moronic hyperbole by people like yourself , then look for the one that supports the presented narrative . 
  that 's only about a quarter of what they were complaining about , the rest spun off into fantasy territory . 
  ah , i thought you meant outer schengen borders . 
  and as turkey or libya are currently deemed unsafe , that regulation may apply here . 
  it 's against the law , but shall not be punished according to refugee agreements . 
  confirmation bias is a horrible thing , is n't it ? 
  there are basically none of the comments you claim dominate this thread . 
  but if you had to argue based on reality , you could n't dole out the shame by the bucketfull - and then what would become of the world ? 
  they were apparently drunk and this is social housing , not a refugee center . 
  not much else can be deduced with certainty from the police reports . 
  it 's taz , they are known for their `` quality '' journalism . 
  apart from tabloids , they 're probably the worst paper in germany . 
  so nothing to see here , really ...

  and i 've to admit , duda as a new face for pis is probably the best that could happen to this party . 
  affect like [ the bill passed by the current sejm concerning help to frankowicze ( debtors who take loans in swiss franc ) ?

  official acts of the president shall require , for their validity , the signature of the prime minister who , by such signature , accepts responsibility therefor to the sejm . 
  the provisions of para . 
  2 above shall not relate to : 1 ) proclaiming elections to the sejm and to the senate ; 2 ) summoning the first sitting of a newly elected sejm and senate ; 3 ) shortening of the term of office of the sejm in the instances specified in the constitution ; 4 ) introducing legislation ; 5 ) proclaiming the holding of a nationwide referendum ; 6 ) signing or refusing to sign a bill ; 7 ) ordering the promulgation of a statute or an international agreement in the journal of laws of the republic of poland ( dziennik ustaw ) ; 8 ) delivering a message to the sejm , to the senate or to the national assembly ; 9 ) making a referral to the constitutional tribunal ; 10 ) requesting the supreme chamber of control to carry out an audit ; 11 ) nominating and appointing the prime minister ; 12 ) accepting resignation of the council of ministers and obliging it to temporarily continue with its duties ; 13 ) applying to the sejm to bring a member of the council of ministers to responsibility before the tribunal of state ; 14 ) dismissing a minister in whom the sejm has passed a vote of no confidence ; 15 ) convening the cabinet council ; 16 ) conferring orders and decorations ; 17 ) appointing judges ; 18 ) exercising the power of pardon ; 19 ) granting polish citizenship and giving consent for renunciation of polish citizenship ; 20 ) appointing the first president of the supreme court ; 21 ) appointing the president and vice-president of the constitutional tribunal ; 22 ) appointing the president of the supreme administrative court ; 23 ) appointing the presidents of the supreme court and vice-presidents of the supreme administrative court ; 24 ) requesting the sejm to appoint the president of the national bank of poland ; 25 ) appointing the members of the council for monetary policy ; 26 ) appointing and dismissing members of the national security council ; 27 ) appointing members of the national council of radio broadcasting and television ; 28 ) establishing the statute of the presidential chancellery and appointing or dismissing the chief of the presidential chancellery . 
  29 ) issuing orders in accordance with the principles specified in article 93 ; 30 ) resigning from the office of president of the republic . 
  that 's , like , your opinion , man . 
  * conservative andrzej duda was ceremonially sworn in on thursday as poland 's new president , bringing political change to the top office in this east european nation . 
  * * in his first speech as president , duda , 43 , promised to pay attention to the needs of the underprivileged . 
  * *** as supreme commander of poland 's armed forces , he said he was especially concerned about the nation 's security in the face of a resurgent russia . 
  *** *** `` we need a greater presence of nato in this part of europe , '' duda said . 
  *** *** he vowed to press for more nato security guarantees at next year 's nato summit in warsaw . 
  he called his program newport plus , in reference to a summit in wales last year that decided on a rapid reaction force in the region , which is still being formed . 
  duda insists that is not enough . 
  *** * within the european union , he vowed to make a `` correction '' and speak with more authority on poland 's goals and needs , in order to make them clearer to political partners . 
  * * a former member of the opposition law and justice party , he appealed for mutual respect and cooperation . 
  he will have to find ways to work alongside the liberal coalition government of civic platform and a small farmer party . 
  * * duda was sworn in before the national assembly of lawmakers and senators at the parliament building , in the presence of the government and of his predecessor , bronislaw komorowski . 
  duda 's wife , agata , was standing by his side . 
  his parents and daughter were also present . 
  * * duda 's electoral victory in may over komorowski was a surprise , and a warning to the ruling coalition that it may lose power in october general elections .

  i have to justify - for many years the only romanian we saw was gypsy . 
  and all the stereotypes are caused by our ignorance . 
   but , would it be that easy to get rid of the negative connotations ? 
  of course - it is changing now . 
   up until 90s most polish people knew romanians ( or rather they idea of romanians ) by the shady folks who came to poland to beg , steal , whore etc. 
  that is truth . 
  i remember when i saw for a first time a white romanian kid - the first thing that comes to my mind was : ` jesus christ , they kidnapped him !, 
  poor kid . ', 
  unfortunatelly for many people gypsy and romanian are synonyms . 
  my company is cooperating with romanian one - imho they are very profesional comparing to other ones . 
  i also met some people from romania and i have only positive experiences . 
  it looks like but it is not butter  . 
  the lard is made from [ fatback ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fatback ) and it has pices of meat in fat that taste like fried bacon . 
  you can compare pierogi to tortellinis but pierogi are bigger and can have different stuffing . 
  pyzy are made from grated potatos . 
  pierogi as in the pictures in russian are called ` plemeni ' . 
  russians pierogi are quite [ different ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pirog ) and [ pierozki ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pirozhki ) as well . 
  etymology of the word ` pierogi ' is not known for sure .

   as awful as it sounds , poland and the baltics would simply not be worth a nuclear wwiii . 
  imho no country is worth nuclear war . 
  but from the 1945 no one used nuclear weapon . 
  from that time there was ( and are ) many international conflicts in which nuclear powers were involved . 
  imho we can not let people do whatever they want only becouse they have dangerous weapons in their hands . 
  only determined attitude can stop the bandits ( like [ cuban missle crisis ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cuban_missile_crisis ) ) . 
  i know that eastern europe is far away , but we can discuss the same problem in relation to former russian influence parts like east germany ( fomer ddr ) - hope it will change attitude . 
  i do not want to justify the behavior of the crowd , but riding in a convoy with russian and soviet flags on ukrainian streets after the annexation of the crimea looks like a provocation and certainly is not a good idea . 
  it was stupid and rude statement . 
  polish public opinion was appalled by that . 
  the author - w\u0119glarczyk - apologized . 
   some `` just do n't like them and they crucified jesus '' , others go as far as to threaten jews with death . 
  i do not know anyone who uses the arguments about the crucifixion of jesus or ` threaten jews with death ' . 
  on the other side the argument ` antisemite ' is used very often as an argument ended discussion . 
  it is very roomy - houses the people who do not agree with the policies of israel , mentioning history of the jews , not only in the context of holocaust victims or dare to discuss the thesis applied by the environment of ` gazeta wyborcza ' ( the biggest polish daily run by pople with jews origins ) . 
  with this definition of antisemitism , i think your estimates are correct . 
  the population of jews in poland is negligible compared with the period before world war ii . 
  despite this , people with jews origins are prominent and important positions in poland . 
  i would like to mention , bartoszewski statement about polish present-day ` antisemitism ' : ` please mention another country of the european union , which in the past 15 years has had three foreign ministers - geremek rotfeld , meller of jewish origin ' . 
  i can add the names of the leading jewish origins journalists having a significant influence on the soul of poles such as michnik or urban . 
  i do not know rules on this portal . 
  i think that there is quite interesting discusion in this thread . 
  if your post will have some points then i will delete . 
  modern russia is the legal successor of the ussr . 
  to this day russia has not distanced itself from the activities of the soviets . 
  putin said that ` the collapse of the ussr was not only the greatest geopolitical catastrophe of the twentieth century , but also a real tragedy for the russians . ', 
  it seems that today you are trying to restore russian empire .

  and just how he `` reverts '' something he was saying from the beginning ? 
  you do n't have to belive , but at least you could try to be fair . 
  i repeat it 's not my problem , nor the fault of duda that someone misunderstood him or has no idea about how the president 's office works . 
  most of people do n't know a thing about politics and it applies to the voters of every party . 
  thanks . 
  i 'm not an economist , but it 's really wrong that the people who earn so little has to pay income tax and it 's ridiculous to tax the ones who gets retirement pensions or another support from the state . 
  yes , just like hundrets of others , he accused his political opponents for something they did n't done and had to apologise for it . 
  if every politician would be judged for false accusations , they 'd all need to apologise . 
  man , i 've just linked his speech and i could find dozens similar . 
  it 's not my problem if someone misunderstood it or just manipulates for political reasons . 
  so what if his opinion is that it `` needs '' to be lowered ? 
  personally i think it should n't be , so what ? 
  these are just opinions . 
  ridiculous ? 
  it 's just the way the system works . 
  it is a public job , no doubt about that , but it 's also not given just to anybody who 's a party member or a relative . 
  besides , the public universities are usually far better than the private ones . 
  ok , so which actions prooves that he lied ? 
  ... and above that ? 
  no , he obviously is n't . 
  you may not know the difference , but he should and probably knows , it 's just propaganda for campaign . 
  do n't know what other evidence you wants ... 
  he was promising exctly what he said , not what the gov and its massmedias heard . 
  difference is also that the parliament ca n't just ignore such a project like the `` civic '' party was doing with every , it has to be voted . 
  indeed , he 's much worse . 
  should i give you some examples , or will you start judging people after their deeds instead of words ? 
  how many people in poland earns 8k pln a year ? 
  20 millions ? 
  btw . 
  when donald rised vat he said it 's just for a one year . 
  obviously he lied , again . 
  it does matter , you 're just wrong or misinformed . 
  ... he said it from the beginning , i 've heard that many times and i know what kind of power has president in poland . 
  edit : [ here ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=taokvi52bso ) you have his speech from frebruary where he clearly says about a legislative project . 
  it took me just a minute to find it and i 'm sure that the gov propagandists knows it as well . 
  so you have n't seen promises of donald yet and in opposite to duda , he had a long time to proove what kind of liar he is . 
  you do n't have to love the new president , but ffs he just took the office today so how could he broke his promises already ? 
  what evidences ? 
  wrong or not , this kind of language belongs to some publicists , not to the finance minister . 
  opposition gets no funding in this way , there 're some rules about financing the political parties , but indeed the connections between these people does n't look good . 
  anyway , the ruling party had 8 years to do something about it , but they suddently discovered that there 's something wrong and conicidentally that was during the campaign . 
  even gw would be less biased source , no matter that both are just mouthpieces of the ruling party . 
  fortunatelly all the lefty massmedias `` discovered '' that even before he was sweared in ... why do n't they and you judge the gov which is ruling since 8 years ? 
  not every taxpayer earns 8k a year , that 's even below the margin of extreme poverty . 
  no , he did n't changed anything . 
  wish the other politicians would be judged as harshly as he is , even before he took the office . 
  then maybe we would n't have such pathologic liars like donald for 7 years in the office . 
  so , the work in university is not `` normal '' ? 
  i would n't say he was `` nobody '' , he was n't the guy from the first pages for sure , but even such a post communist paper like `` polityka '' appreciated his activity in parliament . 
  personally , i 'm tierd of these party leaders which run in every elections for the past 25 years and that 's even more impressive if duda could convince majority in such a short time . 
  sorry , but i do n't trust a finance minister which calls the credit unions a `` ponzi scheme '' . 
  he 's acting more like a propagandist than a minister . 
  about retirement age i think that 's a bad idea , but if someone would want to have lower pensions after less time of work , it should be allowed . 
  the real madness is to tax the people who already are being aided by the state and especially those who get as little as 8 thousand a year . 
  also , note that we 're talking just about the income tax , which is nothing compared to vat . 
  already the single mothers are being supported and this is the real reason why people are n't getting married , not that they need some `` civil unions '' . 
  demographics and emmigration are big problems in poland and nothing seriously was done to improove the situation . 
  please ... instytu obywatelski is a `` think tank '' of the ruling party . 
   common surname all across central and eastern europe yes , there 's even a slovak player in legia warsaw which name is ... andrzej ( ondrej ) duda . 
  conservative people elected conservative respresentant ... horrors !, 
  at least this one in educated , intelligent and knows foreign languages , unlike his laughtable predecessor . 
  finance minister already says that `` we '' ca n't afford a higher tax free threshold , which is a bullshit . 
  eight thusand z\u0142oty a year is nothing , it would be still the lowest threshold in europe and only few , shit poor people would benefit from it . 
  most of these people are already getting social aid or pensions , it 's just ridiculous to tax them . 
   one term president . 
  we 'll see about that . 
  for now we only know that komorowski was a one term persident , fortunatelly . 
  it 's absolutelly obvious that both the old gov and the new president use their position and unfortunatelly the public money for a campaign which is going on since presidential elections . 
  both of them will try to waste money for their promises , except that the gov has far bigger power to do so and president can only send a legislative project to the parliament , which means nothing . 
  i was an atheist before it was in fashion ... 
  i 'm not an intolerant totalist who prevents people from having their opinions or beliefs , the problem here is not that , but radicalism and it 's not any excuse if you attack clergy , especially in a place full of secular belivers . 
  i know history , but it 's not relevant for this issue and i 've clearly asked for example from present europe . 
  besides , the history of poland is different , there was always [ religious peace ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/warsaw_confederation ) here , our representation on the council of florence defended jan hus and rector of krak\u00f3w university , pawe\u0142 w\u0142odkowic argued that even pagans should n't be forcefully converted . 
  the country was `` full of heretics and jews '' as the papal legate wrote . 
  what makes me sick is what the national and international socialists did in here . 
  they never begin that `` journey '' anyway , so like i 've said , you 're just imagining things . 
  opinions are a one thing , actions are another and there 're many [ examples ] ( http://spanishnewstoday.com/bomb-attack-in-one-of-spain%e2%80%99s-most-famous-cathedrals_18802-a.html#.vb-esvoqpbc ) of anti theist radicals which i could provide . 
  would you be able to return the favor and instead of liniking ideologically driven comments , give me some facts ? 
  they 're very `` progressive '' and internationalist . 
  instead of just reporting about some events or people and parties , they always have to push some adjectives , positive or negative , depending on their agenda . 
  euronews is extremly biased . 
  also their live stream just sucks , it 's crashing all the time . 
  dw is far better even if they 're also pushing some agenda . 
   ruptly oh , come on ... this is a russian propaganda channel which pretends to show raw footage , but manipulates with the titles and presents some marginal groups of people like they 'd represent considerable parts of society . 
  what `` bigots '' and what trouble ? 
  your excuses are delusional , muslims are not just treated equally in europe , they 're like holy cows which you ca n't criticise to not be accused of `` racism '' . 
  they 're making troubles for the europeans , not the opposite way . 
   when looking at the reality you 're joking , right ? 
  atheist propaganda is not working for the muslims , it 's not reality but just your wishful thinking . 
   radical christians go completely nuts when their religion is criticized as well . 
  verbally , maybe , but it applies to the radical leftys as well , not to mention that it often goes beyond words and eds up in arsnos or bomb attacks . 
  also , i 've seen some peacefull christian demos which were brutaly attacked by the left extreme . 
  anyway , the problem is radicalism , not the opinions or beliefs , but somehow it 's more common amongst certain ideologic or religious groups than the other ones . 
  so are you saying that the muslims in eu are the victims of imperialism , `` racism '' and wars ? 
  now i get it , europe is a real hell for all of these poor `` opressed '' people and that 's why they 're joining isis . 
  so what 's the difference between a mistake and a failure in judgement ? 
  just semantics . 
  it 's really easy to play a smartass and throw accusations from the present perspective when we already know the consequences . 
  let the historians judge it , prosecutors should take care of german criminals and people will be remembering no matter this whole useless barking which is just spoiling the commemorations every year . 
  which ?

  too many various adjectives for trump . 
  too few of `` sad '' `` good '' `` bad '' `` beautiful '' `` great '' and `` yuge '' . 
  he 's not this eloquent, 
  which libya ? 
  eugh im 20 but when it comes to technology im about 70 . 
  thanks, 
  oh fuck yes please . 
  i have heared of a woman who named her child george written with d\u017c , d\u017cord\u017c, 
  garry, 
  do people still write much sms ? 
  i feel like it gets more and more redundant with time . 
  right now i call and text only my mum , grandpas and public institutions , with the rest i communicate through facebook or email apps only : / edit : now its clearer, 
  not much into that kinku , eh ? 
  that 's still a thing ? 
  then you should know more . 
  at least visit grandma 's village or something : /, 
   my favourite civ in civilization v they gave white eagle to austria and black one to poland . 
  well , maybe if you 're hurt so much by that , do n't show us a major fuck you like brexit next time you get annoyed with better skilled people taking over your jobs and tory austerity ? 
  just and idea, 
  confession , lavish temples , bishops , concordats , all kinds of traditions and rituals are not in the bible and they still have use in the catholic church, 
  santa lives in lapland , you silly , 
  you 're upvoting an article , not giving support to hamon whenever i hear this `` cos he/she 's a socialist '' argument i immediately lose any interest in further discussion . 
  that presents nothing more than doggedness and shortsightedness . 
  folks should focus on programs and actions not labels . 
  but i guess hating on socialists and leftists is now a hip thing to do among polish patriotic youth, 
  and it gets 5 points from / r/europe subscribers so far ? 
  again : also kingdoms of burgundy , italy and bavaria . 
  you said nothing to prove me wrong . 
  burgundy and italy were both kingdoms in personal union under the emperor and were de iure part of the empire, 
  also kingdoms of burgundy , italy and bavaria, 
  this is a different title . 
  emperor was both king of germany and italy, 
  very constructive comment . 
  please , tell more, 
  i looked up insides on google maps . 
  not impressed . 
  a vulgar mix of old and new . 
  from the outside it 's beautiful though, 
  polish one is not heraldically correct since it has shades not gon na lie , it kinda bugs me, 
  have you checked in jail ? 
  my point is that even with uk our gdp is smaller, 
  they already did in gdp, 
  there is a russian song on that https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dujyctyaqsi, 
  it rather looks like americans are more confused about the concept or do n't know what nato is at all rather than they dislike it more than europeans . 
  haha i would give you gold if i was n't a cheap asshole, 
   , but that 's it oooh thank fucking god, 
  95-99 % of folks in every bigger european state lived in the country before 1850s . 
  cities really became a backbone of economy through industrial revolution , before that nearly everyone lived of agriculture, 
  is n't that the case for most of big cities in europe ? 
  it 's duriing the industrial revolution when cities exploded in size , before that there were very few cities with populations larger than 100 000 . 
  the best part is poles do same shit about vilnius and lviv and dont see the hypicrisy, 
  that reminds me , i have an exam on public international law i should study to right now o_o, 
  many by percentage , not by number, 
  not moldova ? 
  since when ? 
  mountains , do n't speak serbo-croatian , boring and unimaginative flag , very clean ( especially compared to italy ) , quite rich, 
  god , this is dumb, 
  polls predictet a borderline win for clinton . 
  she was supposed to win by less than 10 electoral votes . 
  polls were going head to head, 
  of course you didnt have these events . 
  youre delusional to think people overe there in america had any less prejudice these ar\u0119 the same people for gods sake . 
  vast majority of you came there just 100-150 years ago, 
  washingtons letter ? 
  you really think there was no friendly gestures from eueopean leaders towards jews in 18th century and before ? 
  you cant use one letter to prove a point like this . 
  americans were as antysemitic as europeans dont kid yourself .

  with the little china maybe, 
  is there any nation that doesnt claim this stereotype to be their own ? 
  sad . 
  tibilisi of course . 
  its both capital and the biggest city . 
  how very insightful , original and relevant to the article . 
  eugh , that 's not a word , that 's maiden name of lord cthulhu 's wife, 
  you 're sick with blind heatred . 
  read few of your comments in this tread yourselfe . 
  it 's a political party , not an antichrist . 
  did n't the last ones died off around 1st century bc ? 
  edit : wikipedia says there still were some lions left in greece during herodotus life, 
  oh , i remember him < 3, 
   what ? 
  of course you recent ancestry means a lot ... in what way ? 
  you 're really vague . 
  i meant that if all 8 of his graed grandparents were from region x , that does n't mean all of his great great grandparents are n't from complittely different places . 
  you ca n't tell all of your family history by knowing only the most recent part . 
  is that a joke . 
  that 's more than 1200 years ago . 
  now that 's meaningless . 
  to show you how absurd that is , barack obama and dick cheney , george bush , etc have a common ancestors going back 2 or 3 hundred years . 
  you seem angry and i do n't know why . 
  they might have and that does n't relly contradict what i said in any way , buddy, 
  he has to be one of the best known dutch musician outside of the netherlands,

  i know some people really like camping and it 's not money issue , but going with / u/diamantus train of thought i would rather go to cheaper place and have higher standard than go camping in spain and count every cent . 
  i understand that people want to go abroad , but then why they do n't go somewhere , where money can go much further ? 
  for bragging rights ? 
  it 's not really your confirmation bias , but / u/letsstaycivilized has much bigger point here . 
  if they know something it 's often skewed understanding . 
  the most recent big example was discussion about paid maternity leave in / r/mapporn and seemingly americans could n't grasp that it 's mandated and paid by government , not by employer . 
  so it 's as valid as putting it in the title of money transfer . 
  you will go to court and say `` hey , i 've sent him money transfer , it says `` pay before x '' and he did n't return it '' . 
  and that 's why there is limit when you need proper contract . 
  i really do n't see your point here . 
  `` outlawed '' ? 
  no one outlawed them . 
  major banks just said `` fuck cheques '' and stoped printing them . 
  it does n't mean they are outlawed ( prawo czekowe dz.u . 
  you just seems not to grasp that countries have different laws , especially about contracts . 
  cheque with memo on it about loan never was valid contract by itself , no matter if banks phased them out , or not . 
  but that 's the problem - neither would be cheque with `` loan to be repaid by january 1 , 2017 '' written on it - according to polish ( and probably whole eu ) law . 
  again , it 's difference in law and worlds we live in . 
  you do n't need this kind of paper trail . 
  you make money transfer , it 's enough evidence . 
  if you are lending more than 500pln you need to have contract for proof ( signed by both parties ) , like it 's said in civil code . 
   that 's wrong . 
  you could n't send me money that way , because i have n't signed up for the service . 
  however , you could hand me a check without me signing up for anything . 
  i have to give you that , but we are basking in oddities here . 
  you can argue the other side here equally - if you do n't have bank account yourself you ca n't write cheques at all . 
  if we assume the worse case scenarion , you can argue any point , but are n't we living in first world countries ? 
  bank account is not some kind of foreing concept that no one knows about . 
   another reason people often use checks is the `` paper trail '' . 
  the bank saves a copy of the front and back of every check , so everything you 've written on there gets saved and is admissible in court , including your signature and whatever you choose to write in the `` memo '' field . 
  but it 's the same case of any other money transfer . 
  hell , i can pull e-signed pdf at any time and it will have same value , or it can be directly requested from bank if needed . 
   really , if you ca n't think of any scenario where a check would be better than another form of payment , then you do n't have a very good imagination . 
  maybe , or maybe we just simply live in completly different worlds . 
   let people do things the way they want , if they 're not hurting anyone . 
   in transactions where you must also provide extra documents , yes . 
  at least until everyone has a flatbed scanner in their house , or until all paper documents are eliminated . 
  that 's the crux of the problem - you ca n't do it entirely on-line and i can do most of the things . 
   you have to do more than enter a phone number to send money to someone . 
  you do n't . 
  i mean ... you have to put how much you want to transfer and you have to put phone number . 
  i 'm slightly pulling your leg here , because it 's only roughly one year old technology , but in november of last year over 130k transactions was done that way . 
  and you see , we have slightly different starting point here . 
  i value instant transfers over waiting for clearing the cheque , both as sender and recepient . 
  how long does it take nowadays in the states ? 
  2 days ? 
  3 days ? 
  but who said most cases have to be handled by being there in person ? 
  there are cases like that , because you have to `` exchange physical goods '' , for lack of better term ( that 's why i mentioned specifically car registration , because you have to take old registration plates and take out new ones , if it 's necessary ) . 
  your logic is flawed , you are arguing that if it 's good enough you do n't need to do anything about it . 
  somehow we , in relatively poor country , could handle such transition , but you ca n't ? 
  do you really think that handling things online would * increase * workload ? 
  that automatic payments are somehow slower than guy sitting in small room checking cheques is better than computer doing it ? 
   writing a check took 30 seconds . 
  entering a bunch of information about the person into a phone app would 've taken far longer . 
  how long are your phone numbers that it would take more than 30 seconds ? 
  how long she needed to wait until it was depostited on her account ? 
  that 's why i said people are defending cheques to no end . 
  nothing you said convinced me that they are better , it only convinced me that your system is dated - it looks like system we had not long after fall of communism , paper , paper , paper and some bureaucracy . 
  but it 's fail of your government/banking system , not some high utility of cheques . 
  even if i would need to do similar thing i would simply transfer money beforhand and it will be automatically accounted for ( depends on institution - either by personal account number , or simply by specific title ) . 
  hell , nowadays in poland i probably would n't need to send any paper , because i could do it online , or i would need to be there in person nonetheless , because it can only be done in person ( like car registration ) . 
  edit to your edit : maybe for you , but not for me , especially in this day and age . 
  if it 's my friend i have his contanct information , so i can easily do it with phone app ( and if he is in one of few banks i can do it by typing his phone number ) , if it 's for company i will either have their information stored already , or will get it with purchase . 
  then it 's simply 30 seconds and 0 cost for me . 
  and what is scenario in which personal cheque is the most convenient option , in your opinion ? 
  because i , personally , ca n't think about any . 
  i have doubts about it , mate . 
  major banks phased out cheques in around 2002-2005 and no one had problems with it . 
  you are , probably , in minority . 
  it 's rather common discussion on reddit and people are defending cheques to no end . 
  honest to god i talked here with a guy who was giving money to dad ( for some kind of car payment ) via cheque . 
  people are defending cheque ocr on their phones like it 's some kind of technology out of this world  and when i 've seen fee for money transfer via internet i died a little inside . 
  btw , [ wiki article ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cheque#north_america ) has quite a nice insight here . 
   in the us , an estimated 18.3 billion cheques were paid in 2012 , with a value of $ 25.9 trillion, 
   technically each bank should be able to give you a cheque book if you ask , not true . 
  even pko bp phased out cheques completly quite some time ago . 
  they can process them , but you ca n't get them afaik . 
  you 're quite right , kurwa . 
  and like you said , most of us have rather clear boundries when it 's acceptable and when not . 
  are you some kind of child prodigy ? 
  why do you even think that you are eligible for any financial assistance , especially that you want to study from your home country ? 
  this does n't make sense , to be honest . 
  if you like mountains there are definitely nice landscapes ( obviously we do n't have mountains as high as in some other countries ) . 
  and [ morskie oko/sea eye ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/morskie_oko ) is quite amazing . 
  in poland i would go with [ tatrza\u0144ski park narodowy ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tatra_national_park,_poland ) , or [ bia\u0142owieski park narodowy ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bia%c5%82owie%c5%bca_national_park ) . 
  [ whole list ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/national_parks_of_poland ) . 
  honourary mention , because it 's not np , but protected area : [ pustynia b\u0142\u0119dowska ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/b%c5%82%c4%99d%c3%b3w_desert ), 
   black pudding is congealed pig 's blood , no , it 's not . 
  it 's sausage with blood ( with quite a lot of ingredients ) . 
  you are describing it like there 's only blood and nothing else . 
   could you care less ? 
  at least do n't butcher the language in that way , because your question does n't make sense with fucked up expression . 
   their language sounds hilarous . 
  our language sounds hilarious ? 
  your language sounds hilarious , panie krecik/krtek . 
  `` ancestry '' gives you almost literally nothing in most of the countries . 
  i think even ireland cut it down pretty substantially . 
  all americans ? 
  obviously not .

  it 's insane how 30 % of poles are supporting turning the country into autoritharian shithole just because they do n't like some people . 
  stop introducing changes to law that break constitution and can be used to fake elections . 
  a law that allows pis to change all the highest court judges they do n't like , when it 's the highest court that decides if elections were ok . no problem at all ? 
  court is n't `` at power '' at the moment . 
  court is bound by law , which can be changed by parliament 2 . separation of powers is n't assuming one power is better than the other , it just assumes they are not dependent on each other to prevent absolute power 3 . historicaly absolute power was always eventually seized by total assholes . 
  even if you do n't believe kaczy\u0144ski is one - there will be one in future , and kaczy\u0144ski is preparing ground for him . 
  the difference is , when politicians do n't have any way to remove them from the office ( as guaranteed in constitution ) - judges do n't have incentive to remain cronies . 
  that 's why government breaking constitution and removing them mid-term is dangerous . 
  separation of powers is there so that one flawed power stop other flawed power from abusing their power too much . 
  it does n't require perfect people , just flawed people that are independent of each other . 
  do n't repeat lies , please . 
  see polish science academy ( pan ) scientists ' responses to most often asked questions about the case ( in polish ) : https://www.wykop.pl/link/3806329/odpowiedzi-naukowcow-pan-na-30-pytan-o-wycinke-w-otulinie-puszczy-bialowieskiej/ in the comments there are links to many related scientific publications - from sweden , germany , poland , finland . 
  all from before the current debate , so accusations of political motivation are besides the point . 
  tl ; dr : szyszko is just lying , scientific consensus is - logging is not going to help ( it 's not an industrial forest , ca n't easily cut down 80 % of threathened trees , cutting less wo n't stop the spread of the beetle ) , and bark beetle is n't that much of a threat there anyway ( because it 's not a monoculture , and the beetle is present there all the time ) . 
  good . 
  the fact that romans thought something is true does n't mean it 's true . 
  lichtenstein has no army yet it participated in no wars for centuries . 
  no matter if you like or dislike military , if you can ensure no war in let 's say 2 decades - it 's better to cut down your army size , and focus on research and economy , so that your future army will be bigger and better , than if you wasted that money on defending against nothing . 
  if you played strategy games you 'd understand that better - there 's an inherent tradeoff between your army now and your army in future . 
  basically the player that has the smallest sufficient army when it 's not needed - can afford bigger and better army when it 's needed , and win . 
  the problem is , of course , to predict when it 's needed correctly . 
  being in the middle of eu and nato helps with that . 
  skipping one generation is wise if there was no war in the meantime . 
  saves lots of money . 
  still , you lithuanians are weird . 
  you gave him the ability to make shitstorms . 
  why the whole `` ban polish ads '' , `` ban non-lithuanian letters on documents '' , `` ban polish language on signs '' ? 
  it 's not like we want to do hybrid war on you . 
  it makes no sense and enables people like him . 
  this is pseud-polish politician in lithuania supporting russian invasion of ukraine , if i understand correctly ? 
  yeah , seems legit polish politician , 
  well , complain to stalin . 
  it 's used as that in colloquial polish . 
  same as holand instead of netherlands , and russia instead of ussr . 
  why would i count parties that are n't in government on the government side ? 
   hovewer they shut up when you point them out that they have only about 12 % counted with the same method  that 's wrong , they have more than pis if you put them together , even counting the nonvoters . 
  poles did n't voted 37 % for pis to have them break the constitution and prepare autocracy for when the money for social spending ends . 
  s\u0105d najwy\u017cszy decides if elections were performed correctly . 
  this law will allow pis to immediately fire all members of s\u0105d najwy\u017cszy and choose new ones . 
  how far can they go before people understand it 's not ok ? 
  outright say `` in next elections only 1 party is allowed ? '' . 
  oh , btw , the law also allows s\u0105d najwy\u017cszy to remove immunity from politicians . 
  do n't like opposition leader ? 
  just put him in jail . 
  simple as that . 
  but all is well , so people do n't care . 
  and when they will notice it will be too late . 
  because then you can develop software on that keyboard . 
  in poland we had `` programmers ' layout '' , that is qwerty and has polish letters made with alt + respective latin letter , and `` machinetypists ' layout '' , that is qwertz and has some polish letters switched for [ , ] , etc , and some are still under alt + random letter ( cause not enough keys ) . 
  now nobody uses `` machinetypists ' layout '' , despite it being the only one used widely before personal computers become popular . 
  btw the existence of machinetypist layout probably costed millions of z\u0142oty in wasted it support time . 
  `` hi , my password does n't work '' , `` do you have z or y in it ? '', 
  `` yes , why '' , `` switch keyboard layout back to programmers ' '' `` how do you do it ? '', 
  microsoft enabled both by default and switching them has a shortcut that you can easily press accidentaly . 
  iirc in windows 95 machinetypists ' was even the default one in installator . 
  also qwertz vs qwerty would make sense if qwerty was developed with the ergonomics in mind in the first place , but it was n't , it was specifically designed to make typing slower , so that typing machines wo n't stuck . 
  so , putting z in place of y makes it less ergonomic for languages that use z more often ( which polish also do , btw ) . 
  first guy ( correctly ) wrote that some poles post hate comments about other nations motivating it by ( often wrong ) view of history . 
  the next guy stated it 's wounds passed by grandparents . 
  i told him to tell his grandparents to grow up in that case , because hate towards nations for past crimes makes no sense . 
  and you tell that this has nothing to do with hate . 
  if it was given as a reason for hate , then it has something to do with hate . 
  polish `` cursed soldiers '' who fought against communism after ww2 are celebrated in poland , despite some of them also collaborating with nazis ( see brygada \u015awi\u0119tokrzyska ) , and some of them murdering civilians ( see revange mass murders in ukraine and eastern poland , and also some pogroms on jews during and after ww2 by nsz and bch ) . 
  the only difference is scale - upa was killing hundreds of tousands , polish cursed soldiers - just hundreds . 
  but it 's equally revolting to hear them praised in public media novadays without mentioning their black history . 
      i hate russians     i hate french     i hate uk     i hate germans    those are the wounds still passed on by grandparents   grow up  what are you talking about ? 
  how is this about hate ? 
  try to read what you comment on . 
   those are the wounds still passed on by grandparents lol . 
  tell your grandparents to grow up . 
  it 's been 70 years . 
  might as well hate poles because of 1920 betrayal or lisowczycy murders . 
  poles abroad mostly voted more conservative than poles in poland . 
   throw in the fact that a leftist pole , hungarian , etc. 
  is probably an internationalist no statistic , but looking at the people i know that 's false . 
  both leftist and rightist poles are patriotic and do n't want to go elsewhere . 
  that 's why the nation is so divided , and why there 's the demonstrations etc. 
  they remember what pis did last time , and what communism really looked like ( not how pis portraits it ) . 
  there 's actually quite a lot of similarities between pis and communism in poland . 
  they use very similar rhetoric and propaganda , and have similar economic views ( especially morawiecki ) . 
  people 18-24 think communists in poland were left-wing liberals  therefore `` leftist '' and liberal michnik and soros ( who fought communism ) are bad ( it does n't help that they are jewish ) , but piotrowicz ( who helped communists during martial law , and now is in pis ) is good , because he fights `` leftists '' . 
  people older than 30 remember that communists were playing the anti-german , anti-jewish , and nationalist sentiment to keep the population under control , and that there was literally nothing liberal about them . 
  and it 's hard not to notice the propaganda in national media , if you experienced it before . 
  he was very controversial after may coup . 
  it 's pronounced kotzk, 
  fuck you . 
  france religious war killed around 3 000 000 of people in 16th century . 
  then they invented revolution and killed some more . 
  you should be proud of such achievements , then you can repeat them . 
   the government used widespread intimidation and electoral fraud to secure a large `` yes '' vote . 
  this included stationing brownshirts at polling stations and forcing clubs and societies to march to polling stations escorted by nazi storm troopers and then vote in public . 
  in some places polling booths were removed or banners reading `` only traitors enter here '' hung over the entrances to discourage secret voting . 
  in addition , many ballot papers were pre-marked with `` yes '' votes , spoiled ballot papers were frequently counted as having been `` yes '' votes , and many `` no '' votes were recorded to have been in favour of the referendum question . 
  the extent of this forgery meant that in some areas the number of votes recorded to have been cast was greater than the number of people able to vote . 
  hitler is gray area . 
  maybe he would have won without faking elections , but it 's hard to say . 
  actually he was appointed by hindenburg . 
  he was second in the elections with around 36 % . 
  ii do n't think there 's much difference in practice . 
  you can easily have parliamentary system dominated by one guy from the back seat ( see poland or hungary for modern examples ) .

  and as french revolution was murderous and had its own sins , it was needed . 
   americans would love it if europeans would stop meddling with their politics . 
  oh now that is ironic , is n't it ? 
  a knife ? 
  pepper spray ? 
  oh why would they need that ? 
  or rather `` you told us we were n't allowed to play with fire but you left me in the dark and cold place , what did you expect ? '', 
  and with po behind the wheel we would be turned into mexico of europe , paradise of cheapo outsourcing , nation of cleaners and maids without real industry and any real leverage in europe . 
  we would stay insignificant , nation of temporary workers . 
  we are * always * poor , no matter how much poles are working do n't you see ? 
  and what the hell is wrong with 500 + ? 
  money money money , we pay so elevated taxes but we * never * have money for anything , is n't it strange ? 
  why * any other country * can support their parents but we ca n't ? 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/child_benefit to hell with this all . 
  i like to be polish . 
  that was nationalism/supremacy . 
  it is like saying that socialism is bolshevism . 
  in 1989 socialist/communist system was overthrown but not people who were ruling over it . 
  we never had true decommunization going on here . 
  i would say something but rest english-speaking poles here would downvote me to hell . 
  i 'm not happy about what is happening right now but it is better than previous government in terms that previous government got too cozzy and full of itself . 
  and i like that comeback of national spirit . 
  the thing is we poles should , from time to time , show that we can be unhappy , just at we did by voting in pis : ), 
  nah , but i would n't mind [ minor saboage ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/minor_sabotage ) . 
  so what was that about nazi ? 
   independence of public media yes , we should do it slowly like germany . 
  employ right people from the right circle that really , really believe in ** x ** spirit , praise them for their ** x ** spirit and after a time you do n't need to tell them what to write , they will do so out of their free will : ), 
  constitution is broken . 
  deal with it . 
  if it was n't there would n't be chit-chat and venice commission would clearly say `` stop '' rather than `` make out '' . 
  most of the paintings in history , excluding maybe religious paintings of medieval , were made with profit in mind and on demand as painting as profession was expensive ( look : tyrian purple ) , subjects were strongly influenced by what the viewer found fashionable and in many times only way for an artist to express himself was by hidden message . 
  artists who could paint what they wanted to were horribly poor , horribly rich or had second solid income . 
  i 'm not sure , but i 'm sure it is your cake day !, 
  are you surprised ? 
  on the other side if muslim community had more people like that other woman we would n't have such problems . 
  so yes , people say that because there is a reason for that but when we do find moderate muslims that share our values and take part in building better and safer europe then we should praise them . 
  taking into account what a part of islamic world would like to do to her for what she did , that woman is a hero . 
  well , that is a load of cattle manure . 
  that is argument used by modern artists that can not express themselves by technique or idea and they are left with nothing but shock value of their art . 
  nothing less , nothing more but pantacide . 
  never forget 6 million erdogans !, 
  no , these are just people that really , genuinely believe that 's the right thing to do amd just somehow they ended in the right place behind a typewriter . 
  how many competitions have you seen lately , about posters and writting praising immigration , humanism and open borders ? 
  all you need to take those people that take a part in these competitions and that is all , no need to tell them to `` produce '' anything . 
  3 years ago . 
  but let me add that it was in oldtwon * and * near the river bank * and * at night . 
  at the day it was n't so cold ... http://imgur.com/a/mwbol, 
  i remember me and my so taking pictures for her diploma , here in toru\u0144 . 
  it was so cold that the objective broke ... 
  oh , the one where they made a plane disappear ? 
  i love cage < 3 . 
  but we do ban hard drugs to not take part in dirty business . 
  it wo n't stop wars , yes , but this way nobody can force down our throats to take responsibitily for what is going on . 
  we should n't make money by using slave labour , selling hard drugs or gun , it does n't matter if someone else will be doing this . 
  i wonder where silesia went ... anyway , we have enought to matter and imagine that if you are significant power vs another significant power then having a footing in the middle of europe makes you ** the ** power . 
  not ** that ** accident ... https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w38dghy5eau, 
  new equipment that was bought 5 years ago that was meant to work for next 10 is gone , it was removed as `` wybrakowane '' because some idiots did n't know what to do with that ( or worse , they sold it somewhere ) . 
  my father was a `` starszy chor\u0105\u017cy sztabowy '' before they restructurized this rank and as far as he tells and as far as i can tell there is strong need for restructurization . 
  we are one tasty piece . 
  i do n't mind arms copmanies as long as they do n't * directly * fuel conflicts . 
  i do n't see why they ca n't branch into , for example , construction machinery ... oh , i know why ... how to sell piece of iron and piece of wood for as much as you can ? 
  make a gun out of it . 
  every time i had to spend some time in warsaw it made my only more convinced that i do n't want to live in warsaw . 
   do you speak german and understand the song text completely or did you just see translations ? 
  i was asking about the song . 
  and as far as i know album was `` temporarily banned '' , forcing band to stock somewhere 85,000 copies . 
  how much would cost you to stack 85,000 cds somewhere ? 
  z\u0142oty is awsome and it stays : ) unless you rename $ for something like euroz\u0142oty . 
  so how about that , lets build bunch of drilling rigs in mena , lets build military bases and mines and just siphon these resources to europe . 
  because sovereingty is silly , is n't it ? 
  a german that does n't think that poland is just annoying spot on the map ? 
  a german that says germany is n't self-sufficient titan ? 
  oh my friend , we have some heavy drinking to do !, 
  and we should invite bunch like minded eastern europeans while we are at it !, 
  what is lost in translation ? 
  is there a reason to not love rammstein ? 
  well . . beside that accident ... 
  but still it would n't be magically un-infested as beetles does n't attack that part of tree . 
  does n't this beetle attack a bark of a tree an outer layer ? 
  i think you still could use rest of a tree and , if anything , you can turn that log into particle board . 
  beside national tv nothing was touched and i yet have to see a hunt for jurnalists writing against gov. 
  and it is only * one * kind of contraception * pill * that is getting * maybe * banned in * prescription-free * form . 
  not that i like it but it is blown out of proportion . 
  whatever , i will just enjoy my terror-free country . 
  do n't terrorists from some time use burner phones ? 
  even if you have everything transparent you ca n't tackle that . 
  you think if west was n't rich it would have time to build better society ? 
  with economic growth comes cultural growth . 
  it is easy for a rich person to be happy and nice . 
  whatever your federation would give you it seems it would n't rid you from your arrogance . 
  * oh and boo hoo , being closed for weast would be soooo xenophobic . 
  not very progressive . 
  eu hand was moved by stagnation and decline . 
  there was need to export , there was need for cheap labor . 
  longer it would wait the bigger would a chance for something akin to soviet union reemerge , for russia to spread its influence over former states of its block or worse for eu , ex-soviet states would create their own , intermarium union . 
  that was not enlightenment , that was headstart after wwii . 
  when countries could rebuild * other * countries under soviet clutch were drained from resources . 
  why ddr is still catching up to the rest of germany ? 
  because they were * unenlightened * ? 
  noo , that 's not it .

how about you fuck off first , commie ? 
  tons of obvious arguments ? 
  show me five reasonable arguments that i can agree with , and i ca n't prove them wrong . 
  `` stupid uneducated nationalists will ruin my country !!!! '', 
  or `` now we will fall apart and trump is nazi ! '', 
  do not count , sorry . 
  you just assumed i did something i did not . 
  now you 're mad about me doing the same ? 
  right , if you compare uk monarchy to nazis you should be out . 
  suggesting that saudi arabia , zimbabwe or north korea follows true monarchy . 
  poor argument . 
  i can say that democracy brings us rioters like in usa , where leftists , pro-democracy people , will threaten you , try to beat or kill you , because you do n't follow their ideas . 
  by the way , if we are reaching poor arguments , let me have one too . 
  you would love to live in nazi germany , wo n't you ? 
  there was democracy in times of hitler , were n't there ? 
  was n't he elected by democratic people ? 
  uh , why wo n't you just join neonazis then ? 
  well , if someone is scared of debating , it 's only his loss . 
  to me , staying in government that is essentially `` let total idiots be equal to people with greatest minds '' is absolutely absurd . 
  yet , you praise it , even thoug i am sure it 's easily beaten by monarchy . 
  no matter how crappy our king would be . 
  see , we got different lessons from history and general reasoning , it seems . 
  to me , let 's say , a king will rule at his best , not following his own self interest , but he will take good care of his country . 
  democracy has been proven as `` let dumb people rule the world '' , as people often do n't even know who they are voting for , they are not interested in it , they do not care , they only believe what they can see in their favourite tv programme . 
  after all , it 's easier to overthrow one person , than hundreds of them , is n't it ? 
  so of course one single person will be scared to rule bad , or to make his people angry . 
  if they get angry , he can lose his throne , or even more . 
  if hundreds of people rule poorly in democracy , we have to wait said amount of years to change anything . 
  but still , people can be fooled , paid or something else to vote for evil-doers , so nothing will change . 
  it 's long and complicated . 
  long story short though - i personally believe there should be just one person to rule , basically i support monarchism . 
  yes , i am against democracy . 
  not all of the people should decide , that is for sure . 
  most of them is too easily manipulated , bribed , etc. 
  and , as someone who is against democracy , i appreciate that some people 's voices counted more . 
  this is , however , not a trump topic , so i think we should go back on topic , if you do n't mind , to avoid offtop . 
  you know how it works in usa . 
  that is your system . 
  accept it , instead of demolishing your country . 
  still , that 's their system in usa . 
  that is how it works . 
  people should accept that . 
  worst ? 
  best , i 'd say . 
  he let people speak . 
  or your beloved democracy works only if the choice people made fits with yours ? 
  people wanted brexit and they have it . 
  people wanted trump and they have it . 
  be true pro-democrat and deal with democracy , or stop fooling yourself . 
  big respect for cameron , for following his decision , following the true meaning of democracy , and it 's consequences . 
  in your language `` most intelligent '' means `` worst '' or you have little to no idea what are you talking about ? 
  i voted for anti-eu party . 
  also , you 're so narrow-minded and egoistic , i am even more happy for britain to open their eyes . 
  you use hate speech your leftist brothers would rage about if you were n't one of them . 
  now i only can pray for our politics to leave your circlejerk company of selfish narcists . 
  if we would murder few millions of these people in inhuman ways - yeah , pretty much the same . 
  although , warsaw is capital , so i do n't think it 's good example . 
  also , historically been majority german ? 
  check your history books then . 
  they started the war . 
  do n't do it next time so noone will remove you . 
  you use the `` everyone/we both know '' argument . 
  i mean , you want me to treat your claims seriously ? 
  in germany , maybe . 
  why would i care for what it is in germany ? 
  in normal world of non-left it 's not specified . 
  i see you really do n't understand simple things and differences . 
  it is not worth my time if you follow your blindfolded logic that accepting people who are willing to blow up your country is good , while trying to repair your country is wrong . 
  ah , grammar arguments . 
  see , my language differs from english one . 
  i can speak english , people can understand me . 
  using grammar or language arguments proves you have nothing more to say and that i am right . 
  yeah , in here we had many reporters turning out to be liars . 
  you ca n't believe someone just because he 's reporter of your side . 
  we both know he could just made up entire article , but you surely have sources to back up your claims . 
  leftists say hate speech especiallty if someone from right side says something insulting ( or not , just to silence them ) . 
  it should n't be the same . 
  there is no group of mass suiciders who want others to suicide . 
  there are groups of murderers who want to murder others . 
  see the difference ? 
  policy is good , it 's execution - nah . 
  if thery 're losing track of hundreds of thousands unchecked people ... 
  they accepted them so they keep them . 
  we will take none of your guests . 
  they wo n't feel good in that , as leftists say , terrible fascist poland , will they ? 
  you were talking about scientific facts and denying such . 
  only two genders is fact , and it 's often being denied by leftists . 
  ugh , i suggest you learn to read first . 
  it 's hate speech for left side , not of left side . 
  either you 're not old enough to read properly ( and that woukd explain why you believe left side is right ) , or you want to troll , or you really are an idiot who only follows rhetoric of making fake claims and changing topic . 
  people die by traffic accidents ... and how is that anyhow connected to your proof that trumo is a liat ? 
  you think that he 's the cause ? 
  so , unknown anonymous diplomats who may even not exist say mean words about trump . 
  also , mexicans are mad . 
  you call people names . 
  hate speech for left side . 
  you said that dead is dead and there is no difference between suicide and terrorist attack . 
  now you write so much about the differences . 
  also , thery 're not running away from war , but for money . 
  learn something about the world first .

  does justification makes it okay ? 
   42 in younger generations , and they are a future . 
  true . 
  but first , it 's an universal problem - see at polish youth , it 's also radicalizing . 
  example : ~ 80 % are against refugees , compared to ~ 55 % among +50 people . 
  second : people tend to change their views with age . 
  so 35 not 42 % , notice that also includes `` rarely justified '' . 
  while `` never justified '' is 64 % . 
  and to be precise , question is about suicide bombing , not killing non-muslims ( of course it 's does n't mean it 's not wrong ) , and not about something being okay , but being ** justified ** . 
  mayonnaise ? 
  sriracha best condiment !, 
  ( mustard works too ), 
   belarus is not as bad as most people would think if we talk about average quality of life ( food , healthcare , low crime , social safety , corruption , etc. ), 
  in comparison to russia and ukraine - it 's definitely better . 
  it might be actually best country ( in this field ) of whole ex-ussr ( of course excluding huey , dewey and louie ... sorry , baltics ) and maybe georgia . 
  sorry , here my knowledge rather ends . 
  try googling some faqs ... and wait , there might be a subreddit . 
  indeed , there is [ one ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/pigs/ ) . 
  anybody surprised ? 
   how is is relevant ? 
  user with a croatian flair mentioning `` polish death camps '' . 
  see comment above yours . 
   jasenowac - croatian ( nazi germany allies ) camp created to genocide serbs . 
  also some jews and romanis , if i 'm not wrong . 
   us ambassadors have always been appointed that way . 
  true , although there are also ambassadors-professional diplomats ( called career foreign service officers ) . 
  actually there is probably more of career us ambassadors than sinecure ones . 
  it mostly depends on specific mission - `` calm '' ones are rather given to political appoiintees , critical/important ones to fsos, 
  it 's even more in bad taste , because there were actually [ croatian death camps ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jasenovac_concentration_camp ) . 
  actually pet pigs are quite long-lived . 
  they can easily reach 20 years . 
  if you think about nature , it 's one of nicer regions in poland . 
  lots of lakes and forests . 
  yup . 
  this one is ugly , but not oh-my-eyes-they-bleed-ugly . 
   the left owners lacks of taste ... that 's a big problem here in poland , which most people nobody really care about . 
  it 's not only about architecture , also ( or even more ) about * szyldoza * - ubiquitous presence of advertising signs and banners ( and i do n't mean billboards ) . 
  [ see for yourself ] ( http://bi.gazeta.pl/im/92/ab/f3/z15969170q,plac-rodla.jpg ) . 
  it 's changing for better , but very slowly . 
  it 's even worse on russian-polish/lithuanian borders , although of course you have to cross it first . 
  especially fields - barren in kaliningrad oblast , cultivated in pl/lt . 
  and it 's no surprise most of food in grocery shops there is imported ( also from belarus ! ) . 
  at least it was few years ago . 
  pigs themselves have no strong odor . 
  their pee & feces can be a problem here ( that 's why pig pen stinks ) . 
  they can be taught to do it in litter & outside , but it 's more difficult than dogs , more like cats . 
  and of course bigger pig = bigger feces = biger problem . 
  that 's why pet pigs are much smaller than livestock ones . 
  although `` small '' here could still mean more than e.g. 
  average dog , about 30-40 kgs . 
  ( btw , i do n't own a pet pig , although someone i know has it , and i do n't really know a lot about them ), 
  probably . 
  pigs are actually quite intelligent and friendly animals . 
   do you become radical muslim without your parents ? 
  have you even heard about `` youth rebellion '' ? 
  many islamic european terrorists actually grown up in assimilated families . 
  they did n't radicalize at home - but on street , prison ( notice many of them have criminal past ) , internet or underground/illegal mosques . 
   evil triumphs when good men do nothing . 
  or when good men do evil things . 
  so are we going to deport vegetarians too ? 
  yeah , because it 's families ' fault .

  because i 'm against collective responsibility ? 
  are we really falling that low ? 
  they look like a-team vans . 
  po never crossed the line . 
  never disobeyed ct 's ruling . 
  they tried to bend the constitution , but they never ** broke ** it . 
  period . 
  three years . 
   but we have shit like this article - not the constitutional tribunal affair , but hateful propaganda pieces like this article are making poland look like some backward shithole . 
  yeah , of course . 
  / s pis does nothing wrong , it 's all propaganda of polish traitors and enemies . 
   oh sorry then , but still , fuck us , why do we have to end up living next to russians . 
  never lucky . 
  [ commonwealth ? 
   bestonia  spain , italy hey , even we ( pl ) beat italy here . 
  i 'm really surprised . 
   when you have oil and can ~ ~ flip ~ ~ pay off the eu if you want too . 
  ftfy . 
  poland actually had longer periods of peace than war with turkey . 
  yeah , there were some big wars in 17th century ( including vienna 1683 , which was imho a political mistake - we should act like french and let habsburgs fall ) , but 16th & 18th century - peace . 
  and yeah , a brief war in mid-15th century , which was actually a shame ( we broke a truce ) and disaster ( king died in battle , which led to interregnum , because nobody has seen the body ) . 
  sigismund i and ii had good relations with ottomans ( first one even signed a lifelong truce , which was a rare privilege , ottomans mostly agreed only on 10-year ones ) . 
  later , in 1786 turkey even started war with russia , where russians leaving poland was one of their demands . 
  and in 19th century many poles , , e.g. 
  adam czartoryski , adam mickiewicz or general bem hoped for turkish help against russia ( unfortunately ottomans were no longer a serious power then ) . 
   armenians again , armenians lived under ottomans for centuries . 
  it was modern ( 19th century ) nationalism , what lead to genocide . 
  same about greeks - expulsion ( or actually exchange of population ) happened only in 20th century . 
   hungarians some hungarians allied with ottomans against austrians . 
  who was a worse enemy ? 
   look at the conquest of egypt , syria , ottomans bullshit . 
  ottomans were actually much more tolerant than western europe . 
  orthodox or eastern christians could prosper safely . 
  it was a rise of turkish nationalism what lead to armenian genocide , not islam itself . 
  and look where ( sephardic ) jews went , when they were expelled from spain or italy in 15-16th centuries . 
  terrorist islamism is a modern problem , appearing after ww 1 , and especially visible since 1970s . 
  our government pretty much criticises everybody around lately ( except hungary ) .

   shortly after its defeat in the battle of warsaw , the retreating red army , in order to delay the polish advance , ceded the city to lithuania after signing the soviet-lithuanian treaty on 12 july 1920 . 
  12 july 1920 . 
  that 's the very first time lithuanians have ever controlled the city - and very few inhabitiants of it wanted them to at the time . 
  bolshevik ruse was to give the city to lithuania to avoid poland reconquering it , polish ruse was prepared by gen. \u017beligowski . 
  in the end we were all fucked 20 years later . 
   before that , it was part of russian empire , and not poland , before that it was part of commonwhealth , and before that it was part of ldk . 
  exactly . 
  so what would be the reason for it to belong to lithuania ? 
  it was already mentioned countless times that the ethnic composition was polish-jewish . 
  should aachen be a part of france only because it used to be charlemagne 's capital ? 
   the name of the city originated from the vilnia river . 
  [ 2 ] the name of the river derives from the lithuanian language word vilnis ( `` a surge '' ) or vilnyti ( `` to surge '' ) . 
  the city has also been known by many derivate spellings in various languages throughout its history the name of the city los angeles is of spanish rather than english origin , but that does n't mean it should belong to mexico , or spain . 
  the name of berlin is of slavic origin , but would claiming it by poland make any sense ? 
   it 's vilnius , not wilno it 's called the way inhabitiants of the city wish to call it . 
  in this case - vilnius today , wilno 80 years ago . 
  the highest extreme is 200,000 , i deliberately picked a number in a middle to avoid such accusation . 
   the violence was from both sides . 
  and the violence from ukrainians was much more common , widespread and severe . 
  ukrainians are also the only ones who are gloryfying preparators of violence . 
  preparators of akcja wis\u0142a - kbw , along with gen. \u015awierczewski killed by upa are considered to be soviet puppets and supporters of occupants , definitely not heroes . 
  well , seems that signing the suwa\u0142ki agreement was our biggest mistake then , considering lithuania has just taken wilno from us the two months before , and we would have to regain the city one way or another sooner or later . 
  also , i wonder why you have not bolded the most important part :  the most controversial issue -- the future of the city of vilnius -- was not explicitly addressed . 
  you have n't seen serbian ones . 
  mind i would n't * actually * want to see anything like that - just replied in the same way someone has replied to me with all this false equivalence . 
  at least those 200,000 ukrainians were still alive unlike the 100,000 poles upa has murdered in volhynia . 
  there were also more than 2,000,000 poles resettled from areas grabbed by ussr to the new-western poland , higher than that by an order of magnitude . 
  it was already mentioned in the post i was replying to , so i felt no need to . 
  yes , it was initially , though it was gradually diminishing since the 14-15th century . 
  lithuanian language was not an official language in grand duchy , unlike polish and old ruthenian . 
  an eloquent one we have here , i have to admit . 
   how many ancient grudges do you want to dredge up ? 
  i do n't want to dredge up any ancient grudges . 
  i just want ukrainians to stop pretending that l'viv is an old and ancient ukrainian city , always ukrainian for the last 50000 years and totally has nothing in common with poland nor it never had . 
  because that describes how most of my experiences with ukrainians regarding the city were . 
  yes , lemberg was belonging to the austo-hungary throughout the 19th century , but even then it still was a polish city , seat of a polish autonomical government of galicia , and the second biggest after warsaw centre of polish culture in the world . 
  in fact , lw\u00f3w was a polish city for all of its history since the city was relocated in 1356 , until the expulsion of poles by soviets in 1946 . 
  i would like ukrainians to finally recognize it someday . 
  and perhaps stop worshipping scum and criminals like bandera . 
  i do n't know how math works in your remote northern country , but i 'm quite sure that ( 1807-1794 ) + ( 1918-1815 ) is much closer to 100 than to 200 . 
  116 years , to be certain . 
   poznan do n't think so . 
  the only time in history when pozna\u0144 was german was for about 100 years in 19th century . 
  by that time , the most valuable part was already built . 
   gda\u0144sk again , it have belonged to poland during the time it prospered the most and the valuable parts were build . 
  though even then gda\u0144sk always had a german feel to it . 
  ... and even on such map danzig is polish . 
  accept it ? 
  while ukrainians who are supposed to be our `` friends '' treat the very same people who have genocided our compatriots during the ww2 as heroes ? 
  2006 called and wants its political climate back . 
  it 's a sentence i hope is not bullshit . 
  it was the iirp coat of arms on a banner instead of the current one that did it to me . 
  if they paid attention to such details , there might be more to it than the usual `` stupid ultras wreak havoc in foreign countries again '' narration . 
  else i might just like defending lost causes . 
  well , i guess something about our fan culture has gone terribly wrong at some point then . 
  insulting the opponent is the norm in polish football . 
   but to provoke . 
  well , that 's the very point of fan banners in general . 
  and knowing our ultras , they really ** do ** care about remembering and honouring the loss of the cities . 
  and again you too , my dear adversary , would find i 'm of the exact same opinion which i stated in this very thread though in a different post . 
   the point of this post , as i see it , is to show how stupid and inappropriate behaviour it is to go to the capital of other country and raise the revisionistic banner . 
  oh , but if you read my other posts in this thread you would know that i 'm of the exact same opinion . 
  i do * not * endorse such displays on football matches with foreign teams . 
  that 's too heavy banter artillery . 
  i find the enusing historical discussion in this thread very interesting though , especially the desperate though futile lithuanian efforts to prove they were right in the interwar conflict . 
  precisely , glad we agree there . 
  which means lithuanian claim to wilno/vilnius at the beginning of 20th century even more void , considering the ehnic composition of the city and countryside around it at the time which was polish majority , large jewish minority , small belarusian minority and negligible lithuanian minority . 
  and where i said anything like that ? 
  the city indeed was destroyed in 1350 - by a ** lithuanian ** duke liubartas demetrijus during his raid . 
  i 'll remind you that lithuanians were still pagan and had no connection to poland at the time . 
  [ i meant that there were many areas where both rural and urban population was polish which ended up on soviet part of the border . 
  the map uses german data from 1916 and deep red indicates polish majority . 
  soviet union had absolutely no right in redrawing the borders of poland , and yet it did it . 
  we have lost our eastern territories in an aggressive invasion of soviet union in 1939 . 
  we have gained our western territories as a war compensation after the country which inflicted tremendous damage upon our country , including murdering 20 % of our population was defeated in a defensive war . 
  defeated , by an odd twist of fate , by the very same country which has invaded and took the eastern half of our country in 1939 , so the compensation was also in some way for the areas they took from us . 
   conquered inherited . 
  though there was some fighting connected with securing the succession . 
  areas of wojew\u00f3dztwo ruskie , which roughly corresponds to eastern galicia were an integral part of poland since 1340 . 
  and i doubt there 's more than few buildings in lw\u00f3w dating before 1340 . 
   however the boarder would have been drawn , somebody would have gotten fucked over . 
  [ in that case poles did , as the border was drawn by stalin in a way which left the highest possible number of poles behind the border and still looked remarkably plausible . 
  map shows percentage of poles by county in 1931 . 
  ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/76/polish_language_frequency_in_poland_in_1931.png ) and i wo n't even mention that any redrawing of our border was an act of aggression as we were a sovereign country before the war . 
  no , it 's football banter disguised as remembrance . 
   well , if that 's the case , i 'd love to see german footbal fans in warsaw holding the banner with 2nd reich coat of arms saying `` stettin , breslau , danzig '' . 
  well , i 'd love to see that too . 
  maybe polish fans could reply with the a banner with the 3rd reich coat of arms saying `` auschwitz , treblinka , planned destruction of warsaw - we took our compensation '' or something like that . 
  people like you do n't realize the fundamental difference between those two situations . 
  the fact that someone considers the unjustified annexation of then polish cities 70 years ago unfair is not revisionism . 
  i am , along with most poles , of the exact same opinion . 
  what stalin did to our eastern border in 1945 was ** very ** unfair . 
  now , revisionim is saying that `` we should invade ukraine/lithuania and take lw\u00f3w / wilno back '' . 
  that 's a very silly and pointless idea and with abysmal level of support in poland . 
  it 's not possible to bring lw\u00f3w or wilno back , as they were changed into l'viv and vilnius respectively during the last 70 years . 
  polish flag over l'viv of 2014 wo n't make it lw\u00f3w again . 
  well , then all this banner is even less of an issue than i thought previously . 
   we could also talk about east prussia , if you insist on revisionism . 
  feel free to , the circumstances along us getting parts of east prussia , and us losing kresy were vastly different . 
  and i have n't seen a single pole in this thread even remotely talking about revisionism .

  ca n't speak much about race , since it 's kind of non-issue over here , but eu gender equality declaration states , roughly paraphrasing , `` all sexes are equal under law , but it does n't exclude favorable treatment of one of them . '', 
  ( i ca n't believe they did n't use `` but some are more equal than others '' ) . 
  edit : [ source ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/justice/gender-equality/files/gender_balance_decision_making/report_gender-balance_2012_en.pdf ) . 
  exact phrasing is * `` with a view to ensuring full equality in practice between men and women in working life , the principle of equal treatment shall not prevent any member state from maintaining or adopting measures providing for specific advantages in order to make it easier for women ( as underrepresented sex ) to pursue a vocational activity or to prevent or compensate for disadvantages in professional careers . ' '' * - article 141 ( 4 ) from treaty of amsterdam . 
   '' and we are offering a new solution to manage and refit the soviet-era aircraft carrier admiral gorshkov [ renamed as ins vikramaditya ] , which is 50 percent cheaper than the russian offer . '', 
  russian prices for maintenance and spare parts for military equipment are fucking bullshit , but i 'd be really weary of such deep discounts , when offered by ukraine - only a few days ago , investigation in croatia started , after mig-21 overhaul deal they contracted to ukraine ( since their offer was much cheaper than russia 's ) ended up using second-hand parts ( some serial # are registered to yemen air force ) and falsified documentations . 
  what a load of bullshit . 
  exactly the same talking points were presented in poland 's association agreement talks , and we turned out alright . 
  as long as similar steps ( phare-like programme , strict adherence to copenhagen guidelines , stretching out of entire process - it took 14 years for poland ) will be followed in ukraine , i see no reason they would n't succeed either . 
   have you ever seen one of these in the wild?is it common ? 
  they were almost extinct . 
  they bred them really intensively out of like last six specimens that were stashed away in various zoo 's . 
  nowadays , there are like 1000 of them in total , half of which live in the wild . 
  there were initial problems with respiratory illnesses and parasite weaknesses , due to very shallow gene pool , but it seems to work now , with outlook positive and more and more specimens getting re-introduced in various european countries . 
  no idea . 
  i just recall reading something like that in news post when we signed a deal in ethiopia or nigeria . 
  there 's bound to be some differences , as i just checked prices on our local ebay-equivalent and some of those western ones have sticker prices up to $ 250k - if i were to drop that kind of cash on vehicle , it better has at least leather interiors . 
  that 's just propaganda . 
  everyone knows that romania 's name has nothing to do with rome , but rather come from romani/gypsy people . 
  sorry , we were first  first ursus tractor was built in 1921 , while beer brand was created in 1927 . 
  both are named after latin for `` bear '' . 
  press release is very vague , but from the way they worded it , it looks like they wanted small `` mission accomplished '' party , with un acknowledging their efforts that led to liberation of important world heritage site , and the council went `` we do n't think that 's needed '' . 
  basically , imagine football club being salty after sports newspaper do n't print result of match they have won . 
  those soviet brands have kind of renaissance - they are popular among certain kind of crowd ( apart from those that simply ca n't afford something `` better '' ) - one does n't have to dismantle half of car to change a lightbulb and when car has issue while on the road , most of the time , a hammer and bit of metal wire is enough to get it moving again . 
  poland has been exporting millions of euro worth of agriculture tractors to africa recently ( `` ursus '' brand ) - while they do n't have bells and whistles like for example dutch or french ones , they make it up with price and reliability . 
  they do , for each country 's tld respectively - my friend was running several `` escort '' sites in gulf states and they all got closed . 
  . com / . net / . org in theory are independent , but in practice fall under usa jurisdiction - for example megaupload 's first domain got taken , i know few people who are dropshipping `` replicas '' from china and they have their domains confiscated occasionally too . 
  polish one is working without issues , but they use subdomain of their main . com site . 
  their articles get 2-5 comments on average , with many made by `` generic '' facebook accounts without profile photo ... we can safely assume that not even a dog with lame leg is reading this `` quality journalism '' over here . 
   i 'm not a rabid patriot or a nationalist of any means , i just object to the way the flag has been appropriated by thug groups like the edl to act like it is a standard for racism and white power that some edl members preach . 
  you know why that works ? 
  because those groups were only ones who were flying it . 
  being proud of one 's heritage was displayed by media as something to be ashamed of . 
  we had similar `` problem '' over here , with various fascist groups organizing march on independence day . 
  few years ago , left-leaning media really overdid their narrative however , with nasty smear campaign . 
  as a result , kind of `` let 's take back that day '' movement started . 
  nazis got kicked out , families with kids got invited instead . 
  each year situation improved ( sure , there were/are still some masked hooligans , but nowadays they simply drown in majority of `` normal '' people ) - last year `` damages to city '' bill was like 10k eur , which is pretty impressive , considering close to 150k people participated . 
  stop complaining about `` nasty '' people using your flag to push agenda you do n't agree with , and take it back . 
   it would be utter political suicide for anyone to do it without public approval which is an extremely long way off . 
  [ euro support in poland is constantly falling ] ( http://i.imgur.com/p1wuizz.jpg ) and it does n't look like the trend will reverse anytime soon , as more and more people get entrenched in `` strong no '' camp . 
  at this point , acceptance of euro is n't even a point of contention during political campaigns , with even most euroenthusiastic parties mumbling `` we will accept it when we 're ready '' in tiny voice . 
  welcome to eu infrastructure , cohesion and structural funds . 
  pretty much entire central-eastern europe is one huge construction site nowadays . 
  my voivodeship ( kinda state-like administrative unit . 
  we have 16 of those ) has 10749 completed projects with partial eu funding . 
  that number is 203071 in total for entire country . 
  you do realize that world oldest oil well is in poland ? 
  built in 1852 in siary village , near gorlice town . 
  same with oil refinery built in 1854 in ( mentioned above ) gorlice town . 
  gun laws got changed recently as well , making it quite easy for population to obtain gun permit ( `` shall issue '' instead of `` may issue '' type ) . 
  ** poland will rise again **, 
  economics-wise they were very similar ( with main difference being that the only product available on shelves in shops in poland was vinegar , while in romania it was canned beans . ), 
  main difference was how we went about system change - in romania 's case you shot the previous leader following violent revolution . 
  in poland transition was relatively peaceful , after `` round table '' talks . 
  [ have you taken those into account , or only `` brown '' people count ? 
  ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/may/13/ukraines-refugees-find-solace-in-poland-europes-most-homogenous-society ), 
   what was the worst of this is that dutch f16 's were not allowed to give airsupport , despite being on the scene . 
  the french general in command of the nato airfleet ( including the dutch f16 's ) made a deal to not give airsupport to srebrenica because the serbs had french hostages . 
   after this the dutch changed military doctrine , within every nato operation the dutch sub - officer reserves the right to at any time withdraw dutch troops and material from nato command .

  in poland it 's kind of popularity contest . 
  pretty girls complained that they got drenched so many times and have no more dry clothes to wear next day in similar manner to how i can complain that it 's hard to buy condoms big enough for my massive dong . 
   for a child , to get a hold of a bucket , and free source of water and lots of friends ... thats not boring at all :d all is fun and games until [ local fire department decides to participate ] ( http://i.imgur.com/f5l4s3c.jpg ) . 
  i 'm pretty sure americans are allowed to participate in any of their ancestor 's traditions up to 1/64th bloodline . 
  anything more than that would be cultural appropriation . 
  i would love to read those asylum applications - i ca n't think of a single group that was persecuted back then . 
  even employees of secret police and other communists were n't hanged , like it was the case in other former warsaw pact countries - change of leadership was relatively non-violent . 
  economy was in pretty terrible state , i give you that , and many people had to work two shifts to make ends meet , but i 'm sure you 'd agree that simply being poor is n't enough to warrant asylum . 
  actually , there were quite a few - initial fights saw large population movement to romania and hungary . 
  in later stages of ww2 , when russia and germany were no longer best buddies , many refugees went as far away as [ india ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/digvijaysinhji_ranjitsinhji ) , [ iran/persia ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yv2mkvl5ray ) or [ uganda ] ( http://kresy-siberia.org/galleries/refugees/polish-refugees-in-africa/ ) . 
  the difference was that those were ** real ** refugees - children , women and elderly - with healthy men stayed behind to engage in guerrilla warfare or organized abroad into fighting corps ( see [ anders ' army ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/anders%27_army ) whom took part in allied war effort and contributed to victory over nazis many times . 
  needless to say , all refugees returned to poland as soon as the fights were over ; somehow i do n't see the same happening with current economic migrants the west is hosting now . 
   i 'll remember to tell the next polish guy i see to get out . 
  please , do . 
  you have no idea how hard it is to find decent construction worker over here nowadays . 
  best ones have `` waiting lists '' that go well into months . 
   that does n't at all explain why ukraine and russia are so red in the map . 
  `` insurrection '' / `` separatism '' , or however you want to call it , in eastern ukraine is n't classified as `` war '' for various reasons by international bodies , so every shooting out there is treated as terrorist attack . 
  in russia 's case it 's mostly by separatist movements , like in chechnya or mafia mob bombing the shit out of each other , while fighting for `` turf '' . 
   poland received in 2015 10,300 asylum applications . 
  it then approved refugee status to 9.9 % of these . 
  so that 's about 1,020 people . 
  most of those refugees were actually from eastern ukraine ( donetsk etc. ) . 
  the ones from mena were only a few hundred ( including 50 families of syrian christians flown over directly by private fundation ) - most of those already left to germany . 
   we had over 300 % yearly inflation rate and no , that 's not a typo . 
  we had 600 % in 1990 . 
  polan # 1 again . 
  polish-hungarian border existed starting from times boles\u0142aw 1st the brave was a ruler in poland ( circa 1000ad ) up until hungary joined habsburg empire in 16th century . 
  in current form of both countries ' statehood , it started again in 1939 , when during munich agreement , czechoslovakia got effectively partitioned among it 's neighbors , with carpathian ruthenia going to hungary . 
  polish-hungarian border was a thing when ww2 already started , with famous p\u00e1l teleki quote , refusing to let germans use hungarian railoads to open up eastern front in poland for nazi invasion , as a matter of `` national prestige '' . 
  after ww2 , those lands went back to czechoslovakia and ukraine respectively , and we no longer have shared border . 
  a minor setback . 
  we used to have shared border for 100s of years . 
  only after ww2 , when poland moved westwards , to make space for ukraine , czechoslovakia squeezed in between us . 
  hanging , when done by professional , is painless - rope snaps spinal cord and victim dies instantly . 
  amateurs on the other hand ...

   property tax would immediately cause bigger supply , lower unit cost and decreased interest rates due to less lending ... which would actually decrease rents . 
  i can not agree . 
  property tax could lead to decrease in property investments . 
  it is also quite easy to avoid paying it - you just have to give those properties to your family members . 
  this way peoiple will try also to avoid paying other taxes associated with running a bussines ( which people like my family pay ) . 
  enforcing the law will require more bureaucrats , thus increasing costs of administration with lower revenue from taxes ( pit particulary ) . 
   i think it 's going to come in the next time we are close to the constitutional debt limits ( 3 years ? ), 
  increasing taxes is not a good idea . 
  it will be like with exise tax - increasing taxation results with lower revenue . 
  in some way we are fighting those losses by increasing exports , i thought ( according to tradingeconomies.com data ) that we 'll have a surplus for the first time in iii rp , but we should cross this trade rubicon this year ( we were close to this groundbreaking change , though ) . 
  again , increasing taxation did n't do us any good . 
  we ahve to change the whole structure of budget expeditures and optimalize taxes , because since the grand tax reform , all changes ( apart from deleting 3rd treshold by pis , which those idiots want to bring back ) were stupid and led to decrease of revenues . 
  the thing is , that we should try not to increase taxes , but to make sure that everyone pays them . 
  we do this by making taxes less hurtful and easier to pay . 
  sorry for a textawall . 
  :-( ah , one more - renting for tourists is fine , it will be an addition to a pension for my parents . 
  we 've invested a lot of money into this bussines , there were times when it was tad better , but it 's not thet bad at the moment either . 
  there is no reason to sell it , tourism in poland is becoming more and more international , so we do n't have to be afraid of demographics , too . 
  not me , my mum . 
  and still , this is not a typical `` landlord-like '' situation , it 's tourism , not housing . 
   not according to eu rules . 
  how so ? 
  also , the facts is what matters . 
  with rest of your post - i agree , however you do n't have to write exact same words five times in the same topic . 
  ;-) more taxation hits middle class in the first place , while little to nothing is achieved . 
  well , i would n't describe myself as a libertarian . 
  neither would i think that making as much money as possible , at whatever cost to society is good . 
   into the pockets of landlord scum . 
  no wonder you 're in favour of them i 'm not a landlord , nor anyone in my family is . 
  as i 've said , we rent to tourists . 
  and if i was a landlord , you would have just insulted me , not knowing me at all . 
  way to go , pal . 
   that is someone else 's problem , like romania for example . 
  when they cross a border , they become your problem too . 
  in poland , historically , there were n't a lot of gypsies . 
  after 1989 there was large influx of them from romania , hundreds of thousands . 
  fortunately , most of them came back to romania . 
  but you 're right , giving them a house is a waste of house , because large portion of them is not integrated at all . 
  we could have an agreement with some of them - you 'll get a house , but you have to work and your children have to go to school . 
  but usually social services are not prone to do anything above granting them shelter . 
  you 're mentioning something very important - some of those unoccupied houses , as well as those that are situated in touristic or desolate places , has got little to no value in terms of helping homelessnes and/or increasing the rate of individual property ownership ( although / u/pringlepringle is probably suggesting abandoning medieval concept of private ownership of land and handing the housing of its people to the government [ sorry for sarcasm ] ) . 
  even if in europe is twice as many unoccupied building as there are homeless , that does n't mean , that they are of any value . 
  those places has to be in cities , where is work . 
  also , it has to be a low-profile work , because vast majority of homeless is uneducated . 
  also , it is worth mentioning , that large portion of those homeless are either homeless , because they do n't want to live in a society , as we do . 
  we can not force them to live in a house and work for a living . 
  the second big group are those , who are deeply troubled , either by addiction or mental illness . 
  providing a house for them is also useless - we need facilities that can take care of them , because they can not do this on their own . 
  and i think that charities are doing great job in this matter and we have to support them with our money . 
  it 's better to give your money to a homeless shelter , which will not only provide a roof over a homeless person 's head , but also help them by teaching some useful skills , cleaning them and feeding , instead of giving it to a beggar . 
  idealistic ? 
  i would n't let the state to do a thing with my property , nor would i expect it to do anything for me . 
  let me live my life without interference . 
  last time i 've checked people were greedy , no matter , if they wokred in government or not . 
  and handling millions of properties as a government run enterprise would be both very prone to corruption and inefficient . 
  the only way out of this mess is providing government credits for young couples looking for their own place . 
  not killing a housing and tourist bussines , which are productive ( by providing places for people who do n't have money to buy their own place , or do n't want to do so , for various reasons/providing places in tourist regions for people who does n't have money to live in a hotel ) . 
  such uniform , state-run and socialist proposal as yours , is revolting to me . 
  maybe food and clothes should be also provided by the state ? 
  so then we would have no rental investments , and people who could n't afford buying a home would n't have a place to live in . 
  prices of rent and holidays would rise inevitably . 
  one of the main sources of income for my family is tourist bussines and it 's not that easy , if we had to pay even more taxes for that , prices would have to be rised . 
  and many people would lose their only mean of income . 
  even more , it would benefit the wealthiest house owners , who have large mansions , where they rent only part of it and in the same time live in it . 
  when we have ( my family ) one studio apartment , one two-rooms apartment and a cottage we rent , we would be ruined . 
  and in the meantime , a guy i know , who has got a large guesthouse with dozens of rooms , would be a-okay . 
  not to mention some hotel-owners i know , for them those taxes would be easy to bypass , by , for example , giving some of the properties to their children or spouses . 
  so you think that commies are better ? 
  or current government , which is representing only itself and bureucrats ? 
  do n't get me wrong , i do not support pis , but still , i think that we need a change of ruling party asap . 
  well , they still use this symbol in their national airlines ' logo : http://blog.bilety-lotnicze-online.pl/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/aeroflot1.jpeg,

  its better to do , as you did , to show that the top figures approve of this . 
  me saying , `` lets wait and see '' was more along the lines - only time will tell if they will pass it or not , i wont change your mind and you wont change mine ( im completely against this abortion ban , but i think there is no chance in hell it will get voted in ) . 
  is anything that i said incorrect ? 
  did they prepare , help collect signatures ? 
  plus , talk is cheap , especially coming from politicians . 
  lets just wait and see what happens , if it gets voted in . 
  again with these lies . 
  this has nothing to do with the current government , they didnt prepare this project , they didnt help collect the required signatures and they wont pass this in . 
  its a civic project that has to be at least acknowledged by the parliament . 
  just like the other civic project that liberates abortion . 
  the article seems pretty good and a fair assessment on the polish side , dont really know enough about internal workings of hungary . 
  why would locals help migrants ( they are not refugees ) that attacked the locals and then attacked the police ? 
  the article clearly states the migrants were the ones who started this and then attacked the police , but who cares about facts , right ? 
  it really shows your true colors that migrants attacked the locals ( who had far right views ) and then attacked the police , but the locals are the bad guys , not the migrants ... is it ok to physically attack people that have different views to yours ? 
  thats true , but people who dislike him joke about him being single with a cat , not having a driving license etc. 
  but they rarely admit what he has achieved in politics ( which is a lot ) .

  in theory , these people are `` running away from war '' so europe has to help them , but if they get paid some money , its suddenly ok for them to go back to `` war '' ?

  childrens sweat , tears and blood make the fabrics super soft and nice . 
  didnt you edit your previous post ? 
  it said something like `` fact : not a single human has ever been harmed as a result of an idea/words . '', 
  if you dont mean physical harm , then your `` fact '' isnt true . 
  there are plenty harmful ideas , words , ideologies etc. 
  am i understanding you correctly , its ok to say whatever you want because there is no physical harm ? 
  well then we disagree on this . 
  imo people should be responsible for what they do . 
  im not saying necessarily jail for saying something stupid , but some type of consequence , depending on what they said . 
  like verbal threats , slander , `` hate speech '' is also becoming more in more popular in some countries , etc. 
   but they were n't trying to make it completely paralyzed and subservient to the government , well that depends who you ask . 
  there are a couple theories about this . 
  some more probable than others . 
  the one supported by pis voters is that po added the extra judges to have as many as possible ( which they already had a strong majority ) to be able to block important pis reforms that they promised during the elections . 
  another , more probable is that it was a political trap for pis and if thats true - pis fell straight into it , but it hasnt done too much damage ( their poll results are constantly high ) . 
  po claims it was just a simple mistake . 
  not a political action . 
  now what the exact truth is we dont know and most likely never will , but personally i dont think it was just a simple mistake on po side . 
  that being said , all sides are to blame , including the constitution . 
  its cute how you think the eu is a one way street . 
  do you really think the richer countries are `` giving '' money to the poorer countries out of the goodness of their heart ? 
  so when you said :  whatever chief judge is appointed by pis will just be another notarian , like the president and the pm you didnt mean the rulings they will make ? 
  you still didnt answer my question ... stop with the illuminati bullshit , you are the only one bringing it up . 
  out of curiosity , do you think all the ct judges are bias or just the ones picked by pis ? 
  i disagree . 
  its not comparable at all . 
  people in general dont care much about the ct court , especially in the last years wiith some of its decisions , the elections are a completely different thing . 
  pis ( and any other party ) would never just ignore election results . 
  i would say all sides are to blame here , from the parties - pis and po , the ct judges and the constitution itself ( poorly written ) . 
  i wouldnt hold my breath if i were you . 
  maybe not most , but there are some people out there , that truly believe poland is going to be a dictatorship any day now . 
  ive heard many extreme but serious claims what the government will be doing soon , including shooting protesters, 
  really ? 
  have you not heard what the hell is going on over there ? 
  delusional ... 
  bullshit , thats not how you have a rational discussion . 
  arguments should be important , not saying untrue and unfair extremes . 
  there for those comparisons are wrong and unfair . 
  im not saying its impossible , but i dont see it that way . 
  theres a lot to criticize pis for , but turning poland into a dictatorship imho isnt one of them . 
  poland is far from being a dictatorship or anywhere close to be like the listed countries . 
  do you think that currently the situation in poland and turkey are comparable ? 
  i dont recall `` police state '' but things like `` dictatorship '' , being compared to russia/iran/turkey etc. 
  happens quite often . 
  that is also bad , but its a lot harder to control greece borders . 
  my point still stands , they are crossing from serbia ( non eu country ) to hungary ( eu country ) , so why is protecting your own borders and the outer borders of eu a bad thing ? 
  is that a reason not to protect their borders and the eu outer borders ? 
  great , but obviously that isnt enough . 
  but what do our politicians fight about ? 
  taking them in , which is the worse option . 
  which i reply with - why the hell isnt the eu focusing on this ?!, 
  this is the most effective way to help the largest amount of people . 
  dont be mad at ee countries for not paying much , be mad at the people who are organising the help for migrants , they are the ones fucking things up by focusing on the wrong things and ignoring the best solutions . 
   again , a safe country does not equal a roof over ones head . 
  this may sound harsh , but `` and ? '', 
  it sucks people dont have where to live but as far as i know , not having a roof over your head doesnt qualify you as a refugee and doesnt mean you can go live anywhere you want . 
   says every country beyond turkey ... and they are right to say it , its true . 
  after that point they are not escaping war . 
  instead of taking them all in , which is pointless , lets try to help and create appropriate conditions over there , which is a lot more economically effective and we will be able to help more people that way . 
  its sad but the amount of people living in the world at the lowest level of poverty is huge and we cant fit them all in europe , there isnt enough space , not evening mentioning money to do so . 
   irrelevant , poland could and should unilaterally give more . 
  your argument comes down to `` nobody is officially telling us to do it so we do n't do it '' . 
  we could , but how much ? 
  how would we decide what a good level is if no one is talking about this ? 
  my argument is that the eu cant have any beef with us for not paying enough money since this was never brought up . 
  the only real issue they have with poland is that we dont want to blindly take in immigrants that dont want to live here and make them stay . 
   country of origin and common fucking sense . 
  ok , we know the country of origin ( ignoring the large numbers that only pretend to be from syria ) , whats your fucking common sense ? 
  tell me how do they get from syria ( ongoing war ) to hungary without passing a safe country ? 
  when they try to enter hungary , they are not fleeing war anymore . 
  please explain , im really curious what you will come up with . 
  get off your high horse . 
  you are not personally responsible for every person in need in your city . 
  you want to help others , great !, 
  but dont pretend you would take anyone/everyone in , even if they break into your house . 
  yes , illegally breaking into someones house is a very good excuse not to help them . 
   what hungary is doing is installing a new lock and buying pepper spray to keep them out . 
  i think you would do the same thing if suddenly people started to break into your house ( illegal border crossing ) without your permission . 
   why did n't they just stay in europe ? 
  i dont know , maybe because whole europe was in war and it was more peaceful there ?

  markel told poland to take in migrants . 
  we already did took some . 
  they fleed the next day , probably back to germany . 
  illegals are looking for highest welfare money , they will not stay even if they get some free housing and work and free school . 
  this already happened in poland . 
  so , germany wants to stop that and wants poland to ** guarantee ** that illegals will stay here in our camps . 
  but they will be trying to run . 
  so we need to catch them and put them behind fences ... they will not be happy , so obviously we will have to use gas and eventually weapons . 
  how do you call a place , where you hold large amount of only minority people , behind fences and under armed guards , and you disallow them to leave that place ? 
   if i tell you to kill someone and you do it , i 'm responsible too , i ca n't just hide behind freedom of speech . 
  if this is an army , i 'm a private and you 're the general then sure . 
  how ever if a guy is free person , then the blame is only on him , maybe less if he is threatened or mentally retarded and ca n't take responsibility for own actions . 
  this is in general what is fair , even if i dislike how islamists and illegal islamic immigrants are using this speech to conqueror europe ( and are winning in france , uk , germany ) - still we should punish for actions if we want to have any moral ground . 
  though we could of course use prejuice or what ever where it comes to giving things , e.g. 
  withdraw any `` welfare '' to anyone that does shit like it . 
  if they would not be going for welfare - and only highest welfare nothing else will do - then they could just stay in any other country on the way . 
  the registration process in germany is also getting longer and longer due to how fucking many of them there are in line . 
  i read articles how illegals in sweeden ( or was it other nordic country ) are given nice houses ( normal houses , or partments/flats ) . 
  and some yet complain e.g. 
  that this one is not nice enough . 
  well i think my country should pay for the countries that it invaded on orders of usa , and i can only hope in future shitty democracy process will not lead us to again be mercenaries for usa . 
  maybe all countries who attacked this countries should pay . 
  but that is one thing . 
  taking in immigrants and giving them any welfare money is absolutely out of the question . 
  also , there are countries that did not participated in this invasions and crimes of usa , from europe , probably switzerland for one example . 
  and there is really simple way to honestly find out : remove welfare , especially the one for immigrants . 
  give them 0 money . 
  if they want to just work , they can come and work . 
  if they do not want , they can not come - or leave . 
   contrary to what you seem to believe , most migrants are n't coming to claim welfare , they want to work , no , almost all of them are here to collect the welfare . 
  basically none of this new illegal islamic migrants wants to work . 
  we can really easily find out : give absolute zero money . 
  provide simple tents ( plus blankets ) , give them water and some basic food . 
  they start a fight - kick them out . 
  they wonder around the city - kick them out . 
  they do anything illegal - kick them out . 
  they rape local people ( like they did italy ) - hang them . 
  then i bet at most 10 % or less of current amount will come , if there is no free money to be given by silly eu-socialists . 
  ok , poland indeed was playing a disgraceful rule here , but more like a dog on a leash of americans . 
  for iraq and all the other wars , usa is to blame as leader of it . 
  fortunately we play lesser role recently , e.g. 
  with the destabilization of libya . 
  also , this is not a reason to join another disaster lead by germany this time . 
  well let 's start with money . 
  if you cut the money , then they will just stop coming , they are not refugees , they are just here for the money . 
  you seen the videos where angry illegal immigrants throw food at police , or set own government-given tents on fire because they want to be given money and nice houses instead ? 
  if not then look around on youtube before it 's censored by politically correct socialists . 
  after free money and free housing is removed , if there would be few actual refugees , really running from war from war ridden country , then after through background check they could be maybe helped , but then too after some time they should just go to work like everyone fucking else . 
  sooner or later all recorded now messages with rsa , and dh and ecdh will be breakable on quantum computers . 
  though alternatives are emerging that will be not susceptible . 
   the known hate preachers yeah let 's shit on any freedom of speech . 
  no , freedom of speech is not just freedom to say things that you or society deems `` nice '' or anything . 
   and radicals who are leeching benefits ok , removing the illegal immigrants with different and violent culture is a good idea . 
  since they want ( in majority ) to force the sharia law they can do it somewhere else . 
   how is this different to phone wiretapping ? 
  people should be allowed to build phone lines that can not be broken into . 
  people are mostly idiots . 
  people who care are minority . 
  and in democracy this minority is ruled by the mob of scared gullible morons - this is why democracy does stupid shit like socialism , and later moves on to fascism , which we can see in uk for example ( and in all of eu that regulates everything under the sun and wants to close immigrants in concentration camps like markel said ), 
  it 's allowed in poland too , afair you have to have separate room for smokers . 
   what matters is who 'll be the first to leave . 
  indeed  i wish poland would , but since we have now socialists as leaders again ( pis instead of po ) i 'm afriad it will take a while . 
  probably hungary will be the first one to go . 
  then send them 1000 $ , what are you waiting for ? 
  the eu are hard core neocommunists , they are still at stage of creating this problem , germany is actually inviting all this people and gives them free houses and lots of money , more then people earn in some other countries in europea . 
  if our `` leaders '' would ever want to actually stop this flood they just need to stop inviting them . 
  stop giving them free stuff . 
  and problem solved . 
   when they know they 'll live the good life in europe pssst , maybe first germany should stop giving out free food , free houses , and free cash to all the illegals ? 
  they are `` earning '' for `` being illegal immigrant '' more then many polish workers . 
  so it 's obvious people will come . 
   we can stop them if we wanted to . 
  yeah , eu can express highest worries about this matter . 
  maybe even send an angry letter or two !, 
  how scary !, 
  why should eu countries participate in your problems ? 
  we have nothing to do with syria . 
  as well you can ask japan or australia to help . 
  maybe except uk and france and usa , this guys started the problems in syria and libia . 
  but not other countries . 
  so how much did you donated to turkey 's social help center yet ? 
  start the change with yourself . 
   there is literally no country , not even eu ones , who are really successfully stopping them from moving on . 
  hungary seems to succeed in not letting them in . 
   if you want the eu to do something , give it the power to do it . 
  no , just dismantle that failed neo-communist/socailist project already . 
  and let countries rescue themselves . 
  germany is probably lost anyway , especially with markel at helms . 
  france is definitely lost . 
  not sure about uk . 
  but other countries can do just fine , if they simply will not take these not-refugees welfare seekers ( and isis terrorists likely ) . 
  yes , death penalty is a good idea - but you need to have good court system , very good ways to avoid mistakes , and only apply that penalty if the case and evidences are obvious . 
  death penalty is only thing that can try to stop terrorists . 
  also without it a man sentenced to lifetime has no problem trying to murder other people ( e.g. 
  prison guards or anything ) , it 's not like they can punish him more . 
  as a bonus , it could get the country out of eu , which is a worthy goal on it 's own : } but back to immigrants . 
  he cares about own nation , because he protected his nation from this flood of dangerous people , while other nations just stay and take it ( especially captain sweeden yes !, 
  and germany ) . 
  other then that you are just calling him names , without proving your point . 
  getting the gypsies to obey law is a good goal too , they keep causing problems everywhere in poland where they are present in large groups .

  nature hates futility . 
  europe will start making babies again when the industry ( especially the heavy one ) is going to come back from the far east as the chinese salaries grow and profitability of producing sth there ... decreases . 
  the article says something opposite : * but italy is special . 
  old-age pensions swallow 14 percent of the country 's gross domestic product and 57 percent of all social spending . 
  no other country in europe spends so much on making its past comfortable . 
  * beside that , i was right about the attitude . 
  thank you , good night . 
  it will make anti-immigration parties more popular and it will spread ethinic and religious conflicts around europe . 
  if that 's your goal , fine , you 're going to have your problem fixed . 
  no such thing will work becouse a person is not only a procuder but also a consumer . 
  so less people means less market and that means less sales and that means less jobs . 
  the problem is with ineffective economic solutions and overregulation . 
  more free market is what europe needs but no barroso will tell you that . 
  maybe a generation change in politics would change sth . 
  it 's a maybe becouse lots of young people have a demanding attitude for social benefits and it could stop any reform for years . 
  eurosceptic parties are needed to bring up what should be fixed . 
  singing ode to joy and holding hands in a circle wont get us anywhere . 
  this kind of mirror is really quite useful if you 're willing to hear different opinions . 
  that 's my impression , that 's why i 'm more like to be ` righty ' than ` lefty ' becouse i see more good sides on the right . 
  but to be fair : fanatical idealism with rapid changes in certain circumstances also can make a change for sth better . 
  two examples which occurs in my mind are american revolution and polish solidarity movement . 
  the thing is that those movements did n't actually quite give their followers what they wanted in the first place , but their leaders used the popularity of such movement to do what had to be done to make difference . 
  in many ways with use of contrary solutions . 
  nevertheless , my impression is that usually it leds to more chaos and sometimes slaughter which could have been avoided - and here i 'm pointing towards my last example , the french revolution or the year 1917 . 
  i 'm not a pacifist if you 're asking , there are wars which are mistakes and wars which have a practical sense , i can only speak about a war given as an example . 
  `` wars are needles '' is a statement to general for me . 
  my opinion is based on the historical division when in france the proponents of current status quo ( monarchy ) sat on the right , and social engineers which wanted to rebuild the society under the idea of republic sat on the left . 
  today ofcourse the republic is the base status quo which a hypothetical revolution would demolish . 
  it 's funny how uk and france ended pretty much in the same place , but one has a tradition of stable governments under the crown and another had to have several slaughters and rapid regime changes over xviii and xix century . 
  it depends on who you are . 
  if you 're a left-wing you 're gon na throw national socialists into right to humiliate someone you do n't agree with . 
  it works vice versa as well . 
  generally right is to like order , hierarchy and making small , practical changes , not fanatical in following a chosen idea of any kind . 
  all ideas have some interval when they work and some interval when they do n't , so you can take from one or another but not to build a new society , only to fix some actual issues . 
  just to keep the cash flowing and order on it 's place . 
  left is more likely to implement changes in society by revolution or rapid changes according to a chosen ideology . 
  it does n't accept hierarchy of any kind and tries to redefine society . 
  it 's not easy to cast this on the political scene . 
  ` left ' is something useful when you want to gain power , to push rapid changes on some matter and you naivly think that your solution will do all the job . 
  but then again all parties tend to be more ` right ' in action when they rule long enough . 
  members are getting older , they start to see holes in their ideology , at the end they follow only those aspects which they think are right and throw away the other . 
  they just manage the country . 
  china communist party is a good example . 
  it started as extreme left , but as the years past by , they 're not really following communist ideology all the time , if opening a market seems a good choice , they are likely to do it . 
  well im pretty ` righty ' . 
  but in the traditional meaning of it . 
  today national socialism is called ` right ' and i do n't approve it . 
  anyway i would like to see a pan-european conservatists with free market on their lips behind the wheel instead of barroso-like guys . 
  i would n't like to see the european diversity vanish when we would unite . 
  i do n't see any statistics , so it 's just a gab + political ambitions of few . 
  if the technical civilization wo n't collapse i do n't see any escape from eventually uniting the continent . 
  with technology you 've got extremely fast communication , media unifying the culture and other factors . 
  eventually the last borders will be oceans and vast low populated areas . 
  this wo n't however happen tommorow nor in 200 years , but it will . 
  no comments ? 
  oh , wait , it 's not about usa , it 's about snowden heroic rescuers . 
  and kidney sales . 
  about that gdp . 
  as a nominal factor gdp pc is 2,5 higher than in germany . 
  is it becouse many people from surrounding countries are driving , working or even living in luxembourg ( which has a small population of it 's own ) , pumping their gdp but after that this gdp is divided only by actual citiziens ? 
  so the outcome gdp pc is not making lux citizien as rich as it seems compared to it 's neighbours ( or every other country on this planet ) ? 
  the ussr would not just ` dropped out ' . 
  it would be a pyrrhic victory for germany anyway . 
  i do n't think that they could manage to keep their territory for long after that . 
  you 're also forgetting about the a-bomb , what would hitler do seing that dropped on japan ? 
  probably the same what japan did . 
  the western allies were trying to win with germany using ussr to get both sides weaken . 
  why land with your troops to soon if you can just ... wait and do your small part in africa . 
  i 'm just saying that the western front could have a completely different shape in that scenario . 
  even in this scenario , d-day was originally set in greece/balkans but churchill had n't got enough power to force that idea . 
  germany would lost anyway by many reasons . 
  starting from national socialism which was not effective economically in long term , through a false ideology taking back human relations back to pre-medieval times to a simple fact , that germany had to few people to manage all that `` lebensraum '' . 
  especially with the awful nazi behaviour which automatically creates partisan movements everywhere . 
  but if they 'd defeat ussr before they would implode ? 
  it would be splendid if you ask me . 
  i do n't see any possible scenario that would be worse for my country than this scenario that actually happen , if i would believe in national socialism strenght then there would be such worse scenario ( germany winning permanently ) , but i do n't . 
  iii reich being the bigger evil is truly a west-european point of view . 
  that 's becouse they did n't ever suffer from the so called `` lesser '' evil . 
   every normal person would stop reading there that 's what i did . 
  what about you ? 
  ;-) anyway , i do n't know a single grandpa who would remember ww2 and who would say a one good thing about red army . 
  even polish communists are often sceptical about soviet made `` liberation '' . 
  it depends on the number of errors made by main-stream politicians . 
  if main-stream parties wo n't answer some issues , which are important for people or they will pretend that those problems do not exist and far-right parties will answer them - then their role will increase . 
  as simple as that . 
   is it true that polish nationalists believe they are the masters of the world ? 
  that 's a similiar joke . 
  polish nationalists are wining that poland got it 's ass kicked so badly in the past and nobody cares . 
   sure there are plenty of nutjobs anywhere , but you ca n't make this a solid argument . 
  i 'm not making this an argument . 
  i was just asking about sth i 've heard . 
  is it true that lithuanian nationalists believe in consipracy that russia nad poland want to partition lithuania 's economy together ? 
  if it 's true , they really have some entertaining potential . 
  the map is not complete , 
  ` we ' have the power . 
  france is right now preparing to go to war in central africa against islamists . 
  we do n't always have the political will however to do these things . 
  literal colonialisation means to force own administration and law over somebody . 
  there 's no need fot that , it should be done by creating those institutions for africa and as u said , guidance . 
  africa collapsed after colonialism becouse they did n't had any educated staff in any matter , only a bunch of people who could only maintain simple jobs , white farmers and some black warlords , nobody to run a modern country .

  however they pour toxicity into public debate . 
  no no no , your words in italics should posh high queen 's english !, 
  there are some creationist ultracathos in poland . 
  difference is americans do n't rape pillage and plunder like russians . 
  central europeans !, 
  corporations are perceived evil because they do evil things . 
  ... or overpriced video games . 
  for me - yes .

  oh my , i wonder why /, 
  i will have finished my exam just in time . 
  if you do n't see difference between human brain and animal brain , i do n't see a reason to continue discussion . 
  good night . 
  developing brain is not the same as lack of brain at all . 
  ------ i was right about you being emotional about the issue . 
  you then extrapolated it and projected some of your experiences implying i never admit to mistakes . 
  which is false . 
   ok , why then underdeveloped , premature fetuses are being taken care of ? 
  because they have organs for example ? 
  like neuronal system or brain ? 
    i was right . 
   sure , as always . 
  you 're projecting some of your experiences onto me . 
  stop . 
   but about the developement of medicine no , development of foetus . 
   you have personal issue with abortion i was right . 
  there 's difference between prematurely born kids that can survive with medical help and embryo that 'll will die because of lack organs like brain , lungs , heart or neuronal or digestive system but i 'm not going to argue any more , you have personal issue with abortion and i do n't want to cause unnecessary distress for the sake of winning internet discussion . 
  what ? 
  where did you get this idea ? 
  there 's no logical connectiob between my comment and your conclusion . 
  a `` human '' ? 
  it does n't matter . 
  when it can survive outside the womb . 
  `` dependant '' does n't necessarily mean `` will die the second is separated from the mother '', 
   i am a libertarian who believes marriage should n't be handled by the state `` and that 's why oppose gay marriage , because supporting status quo will certainly help my cause ! '', 
  me too . 
  i 'm not supporter of abortion ban , but i think it 's necessary evil . 
  serial suicider got them !, 
  kazakh are just steppe russians anyway . 
  treating arabs like people is militant antisemitism . 
  oh , now i understand the whole sentence !, 
  no , that makes them kim apologists . 
  * ka\u0142 * now means `` feces '' but originally it was just `` mud '' or `` swamp '' . 
  now that you mention it ... 
   in case of war that 's not true . 
  the conservatives and social-democrats in german parliament would defend a nato member against a war of aggression , especially poland where there is a special feeling of responsibility for the integrity of the country because of the crimes committed against it . 
  oh i know . 
  but their actions during peace made us quite reluctant . 
  germany and merkel are n't fans of putin , but they value good deal with russia over poland . 
  so we 're team ameryka . 
  american troops in belarus ? 
   so would you rather be a muslim lesbian in poland or in russia ? 
  what does it have to do with personal liberties ? 
  like freedom of speech or freedom to protest that is notoriously violated in russia ? 
  but yes , as a muslim lesbian i would choose warsaw over moscow . 
   russia is not soviet union ( which was ran by , among other criminals , feliks dzier\u017cy\u0144ski ) . 
  and ? 
  germany repented their nazi ways , shunned their history etc. 
  meanwhile russia still refuses to acknowledge red army as anything but `` liberators '' . 
  moscow archives about katy\u0144 remain closed , not to mention russian behaviour about smole\u0144sk tu-154 tragedy was spitting into faces of poles regardless of the cause of the crash . 
  also if you think one pole suddenly makes rest of russian oppression even a bit of justified you 're nothing but a shill . 
  and it 's not even me who played the history card !, 
  you started this argument when you mentioned indirectly nazis . 
   i 'm sorry , let 's just call them ` extreme right-wing racist nationalists ' . 
  we got ta be politically correct after all . 
  that 's not `` politically correct '' that 's just `` dictionary correct '' . 
  treating polish neonazis as anything but margin of a margin is russian propaganda , it 's that simple . 
  i wo n't speak out about pravyi sector though .

  being mocked is one thing , but here we actually have put up to mockery . 
  but i 'm actually glad about polandball being named for poland . 
  more relevancy !, 
  and of course , it 's most often really funny ( at least on subreddit , ca n't say that about some other webpages ) . 
   it 's hardly surprising ptsd should be treated , not used as an excuse . 
   i 've just heard a lot of bad things from black people visiting/living there . 
  black people are rather safe . 
  problem starts , when you 're resembling an arab ( which could include being latino or mediterranean ) . 
   according to the prosecutor 's statement . 
  that 's the problem , who we should believe here . 
   the papers which reported it did it it was first reported by local nowiny24.pl  looks like it was a part of the current internal political struggle you seriously believe ** all ** these cases were politically motivated ? 
   gosh , why do you people use dubbing ? 
  still better than voice-over . 
  which is a standard here ( is it anywhere else , except poland and russia ? 
  ) , and one of reasons why i do n't watch polish tv . 
  it 's kind of feedback loop . 
  on one hand , pis is going with the popular desire , on other it 's fueling it , and using as an internal weapon , both against opposition and eu . 
  they are sustaining `` besieged fortress '' syndrome , and exaggerating the problem to cover up everything else . 
   being drunk does n't justify it , i sometimes get drunk with good friends and it does n't make me want to beat up people . 
  exactly . 
  alcohol could make somebody losing control and attacking somebody , but not create thoughts , reasons behind it - those are already there . 
   its scary how easily people trust politicians , as long as they cater to their fears . 
  definition of scaremongering . 
   yet more problems may arise with north and sub-saharan african and middle eastern muslim refugees . 
  throwing these two groups is a mistake ( e.g. 
  syrian population is better educated and more urban , than rather rural/illiterate moroccan , algerians ) , unfortunately done very frequently . 
  cologne attacks , which were done mostly by north african ** migrants ** , not syrian refugees . 
  it 's even backed in history - french forces made of north african recruits were responsible for some nasty attacks on [ italian ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/marocchinate ) or german women during late ww 2 . 
   no big party supports refugees in poland . 
  but pis ( and kukiz ' 15 ) are openly ** justifying ** , encouraging , and feeding on anti-refugee sentiment . 
   also ... i do n't think it 's very effective boogeyman . 
  it was effective before and during elections . 
  of course , refugee crisis ( and agreement to take 7k ) was n't a single reason why po lost , but it was one of major ones . 
  i do n't think pis would n't win anyway , but they might not get majority then . 
  unfortunately yes . 
  such assaults ( luckily no fatalities yet , and let 's hope it stays so ) are becoming more frequent . 
  lately a portuguese student ( erasmus exchange ) in rzesz\u00f3w was attacked , because somebody took him for an arab . 
  few months ago a syrian man ( christian , living legally in poland since few years ) was beaten up in pozna\u0144 . 
  few weeks later a chilean dancing teacher was assaulted . 
  a sikh tourist in auschwitz , slapped and spat . 
  colombian student in cracow , beaten up . 
  egyptian in wroc\u0142aw ( legal stay ) , broken nose . 
  polish-angolan reggae singer in szczecin , broken jaw ( taken for syrian refugee ) . 
  yeah , most of these assaults happened late in the evening or at night , and attackers were often drunk ... but some in broad day . 
  these are just most serious examples from few months , and all this is happening before any ** actual ** refugees would come here . 
  definitely not you . 
   eu throwing 160k muslim migrants into our country ( which they wanted to do ) is something we would likely never be able to fix . 
  it would be extremely ** easy ** to fix . 
  90 % of them would move to germany , sweden etc. 
  as soon as they could . 
  first , because that 's where their families or friends already are . 
  second , because they would feel endangered in poland . 
  refugees are a boogeyman used by pis to subjugate poles . 
  that 's a dictionary example of how scaremongering works . 
  still , i think that we should help in refugee crisis , just because of european solidarity . 
  not to germany , but to countries really struggling here - greece , bulgaria , hungary , italy etc. 
  ecb board is appointed by governments of eurozone states . 
  i 'm talking about euparliament and affiliated institutions ( mainly eucommission ) . 
  yeah , traitors of sanity . 
   the loud minority traitors and because of exactly such approach streets are only solution left . 
  because government is anti-eu ( not exactly talking about polexit , but definitely pro-more loose union ; and of course very anti-refugees , although unfortunately this stance is shared by strong majority of poles = very effective scaremongering ) . 
  welcome in our alternative reality . 
   even their original name was `` center agreement '' it was always kaczy\u0144ski 's tool . 
  in the early 1990s he thought that wide centre platform would get him more votes . 
  it did n't work ( mostly because centre was taken by ud & kld then ) , so eventually he moved onto more conservative and populist stance . 
  that 's what i meant . 
  which says something about a razem , actually ( good about their integrity , not necessarily about will to work together and compromise ) . 
   so if there are anti-democratic laws , why kod can still protesting on streets ? 
  because ban or forceful dispersion would only give more support to kod . 
  even kaczy\u0144ski is n't so stupid , he knows that . 
  although some pis politicians would welcome it gladly . 
   is n't there usually another demonstration in poland that says the exact opposite what the first one says ? 
  pis was announcing a big pro-government ( anti-kod ) demonstration repeatedly few months ago . 
  i wonder why it has n't happened yet ... 
   the eu needs a good wakeup slap tbh . 
  it 's not the eu who needs a slap , but national governments . 
   pis did not win by having big support , they won due to weakness of the rest of the political scene . 
  pis won because big number of votes ( 16 % ) was left under threshold ( lewica , korwin , razem ) . 
  that 's why they won majority of seats with only 38 % of votes . 
  po had more votes both in 2007 and 2011 ( as well as sld in 2001 ) , but due to different distribution they all had to form coalition with smaller parties ( actually the same one - psl ) . 
   * majority being 37 % of 51 % , but let 's gloss over the details opposition ( kod-involved parties ) received 45 % . 
  kod said it was 100k . 
  which looks quite true . 
   was n't jesus replaced with lech kaczy\u0144ski recently ? 
  nuh , lech kaczy\u0144ski is our muhammad ( pis be upon him ) , assumed into heaven at al-wawel . 
  she was even `` crowned '' as a queen back in 17th century . 
  and now there is a small movement to `` crown '' jesus as king , because some catholic mystic woman 100 years ago ( might be not precise here , sorry ) propheted that it would make poland great again . 
  by the way , i had ( past tense , because broke relations long time ago ) a distant uncle-antisemite + fundamentalist catholic , and once reminded him that both mary and jesus were jews . 
  it was fun . 
   dictionary definition of what is left and what is right problem is that dictionary definition does n't really apply to present polish politics . 
  more precise would be to place different parties on ** four ** axles : worldview ( liberal/conservative ) , economic ( etatist/laissez-faire ) , social welfare ( high/low ) and radical/moderate ( this one actually place left + right against centre ) . 
  but it would be too complicated for daily use . 
  however , notice that in many western countries stance on economy & social politics is pivotal in placing who 's left and who 's right . 
  however , in poland it 's ** worldview ** what 's making a difference . 
  seriously ? 
  if pis was centre , it would mean that everything else ( except far-right : rn , onr etc. ), 
  was left . 
  names do n't count . 
  was east germany democratic , because it had `` democratic '' in name ? 
  no problem , because these names can be really confusing .

   unless you can say the same about poland , i suggest you should stop sucking american cock and snap back to reality . 
  oh , but that 's precisely why we are `` sucking american cock '' . 
  still an improvement compared to being raped by a russian one . 
   they could fuck up your country in a matter of days . 
  we could fuck lithuania or slovakia up ( similar size and power disparity as between poland and russia ) in a matter of days , but that does n't make us a superpower . 
  that does n't mean they are not dangerous . 
  quite the contrary . 
  they still can fuck shit up heavily in this part of europe , even if they lack global power projection capabilities and have no chance to win in the end . 
   i do n't know if you 're aware , but navies are part of armed forces . 
  you just ca n't say `` we are as well equiped as them '' and disregard what proves you wrong . 
  navies are much more useful on atlantic or pacific than on small inland sea . 
   you do n't know that the atlantic is connected to the baltic ? 
  yes , through the denmark straits . 
  so what ? 
  it 's also connected to pacific through atlantic . 
   some f-16 were broken still bitter that we have n't bought your mirages ? 
  seeing as you are now actively arming our enemies i feel we have made a good decision after all . 
  and yes , f-16 are n't perfect , and i would even say they are quite outdated , but we urgently needed to expand our fighters forces beyond the old mig-29s before a fifth generation fighter we could buy was developed . 
   i 've made my point but you do not want to listen . 
  i just hope reality wo n't come back to bite you in the ass in the future , underestimating your ennemy and over estimationg your own forces is a terrible error . 
  that 's what russia seems to be doing right now . 
  so you are saying that they have a better navy . 
  like no shit , they are a wannabe superpower with a small dick complex . 
  of course they have a big navy . 
  where do you think * our * navy would operate ? 
  on baltic sea which is basically a lake ? 
  i do n't expect hypotetical war with russia to be a naval one . 
  next you 'll be telling me they also have nukes which we do n't because unlike them we are bound by some anti nuclear proliferation treaties . 
   su-35 we have f-16 ( i know they are much older than su-35 ) and we are buying f-35 soon . 
  as i said before , russian military overall is undoubtedly stronger than polish one , but that advantage is due to their bigger manpower , not because they have superior equipment or better training which they do n't . 
   wow , you really do n't know what you 're talking about . 
  russian army , while not better equipped or skilled is much more numerous than ours . 
  that was the case for the last several hundred years and i do n't expect it to change . 
   you 're far behind them in manpower , we are also far behind india in manpower . 
  that does n't mean india has higher standards when chosing their military equipment than us . 
   technology we are n't really big enough to make - with capabilities we currently have - developing our own technology profitable . 
  that 's why we rely on import nato technology - for now . 
   and experience . 
  while russia has experience from chechenya , ukraine and georgia , we have some from iraq and afghanistan too ( one of the main reasons we have sent quite sizeable contingents there ) . 
   if our things are good enough for armies the like of the russian one , surely they 're good enough for poland . 
  i 'm quite sure our army has higher standards than the russian one . 
   http://www.newsweek.com/we-gave-americans-blow-job-got-nothing-says-polish-foreign-minister-255863 hardly a surprise after obama has cancelled the already agreed by bush administration missile shield deal . 
  from purely egoistical polish point of view , i much prefer republicans ruling usa to democrats . 
  that 's the one we use in poland too . 
  more like 60 or 100 . 
  our society is getting even more conservative lately . 
  that 's why we 've been working hard since 1989 on having usa closely allied to us . 
  usa wo n't see russias incursion as justified . 
  yes , because it 's different . 
  how do you imagine implementing communism without every single member of society actively working towards that goal ? 
  how do you imagine implementing common ownership of the means of production without violently forcing change of ownership from the current owners to `` everyone '' ? 
  how do you imagine creating a moneyless and classless society without everyone complying ? 
  how would you enforce it ? 
  i like my cash and my private means of production and even my class status . 
  there are many people like me . 
  how would you force me to comply with your system ? 
  there is hardly any * less * extremist ideology as communism . 
   the reason being for that is that they were following the soviet example . 
  many of them being under the direct influence of the ussr . 
  `` this time we wo n't make mistakes we have made the last 20 times . 
  we promise . '', 
   so i 'm an extremist for wanting a different system ? 
  for wanting a system as extremist as communism ? 
  of course you are . 
   every side has it 's horrific nutjobs the problem with communism is that every time communists have managed to take power , it turned out they were horrific nutjobs . 
  and by now we have a quite large sample size . 
   it 's like comparing all religious people to religious extremists . 
  all communists are extremists though . 
  that 's what communism is about . 
  oh , i despise trotskyism , leninism , maoism , polpotism and juche equally as much . 
  marxism too , as the pseudoscientific mother of all that evil ideologies . 
  your inability to recognize that stalinism used communist symbolism reveals a lot about this whole thing . 
   all nazis support nazi germany . 
  i 'm sure there are many nazis who say that `` nazism is a good idea , the third reich just implemented it wrongly '' . 
   most communists do not support or even defend the ussr . 
  the communist symbolism has unequivocal connotations with ussr , the evil genocidal regime . 
  i have no doubt most communists do not support or even defend the ussr as it 's the best proof their ideology is a dangerous piece of shit with little to no merit . 
   i am having trouble seeing how this is so hard to understand , really . 
  probably because you are not living in a country formerly occupied by a communist regime . 
  most communists are n't . 
   what a disingenuous comparison . 
  the guy was probably wearing a t shirt with a swastika on it or something . 
  in a bar . 
  apparently being a nazi is illegal in germany now . 
   if someone is going around brandishing the logo of ss or whatever ? 
  totally different . 
  but you can just tell that `` nazi symbols '' would include anything from a swastika to the reichsadler . 
   but you are an exception from that persective . 
  many other socialist government did n't need it , and continued a more steady growth . 
  the crisis of the 80s however , hit everyone equally . 
  nowhere were state socialist economies able to compete with a vibrant consumer economy . 
  you can actually still see it in cuba . 
  well , that 's exactly what i was trying to say . 
  that socialist economy is inefficient and inferior to capitalist economy in every aspect . 
   socialism was able to compete on other aspects like steady industrialisation which made it possible for you to not end up like southern america . 
  socialism did make you rightfully deserve the label , `` second world '' instead of third . 
  or perhaps made us deserve the label `` second world '' instead of first . 
  because situation in europe was vastly different than the one in south america . 
   that might be true , but we are still talking about significant funds which put a dent in the narrative where it 's only glorious capitalism that is bringing poland forward . 
  we were growing very fast before 2004 too ( with an exception of 2001-02 slowdown , where we still were growing , just slower ) .

  just get used to it since , apparently , the police does n't appear to be doing much ? 
   i will call them dumb , stupid , idiotic , ignorant , racist , sexist , anti-scientific , in support of religious bigotry , jingoist and authoritarian because these are some of the things they are . 
  objectively . 
  what kind of mental gymnastics are you performing in order to apply your subjective labels to a rather large group of people , all the while claiming it 's objective ? 
  but can you sway the may ? 
  ha ... ha ... i laugh now please ^ do n't ^ anschluss ^ me :p, 
  it 's an idiom :p, 
  which is funny because they live in a country that , in a way , may be seen as the end goal of the eu : full federalization and integration and a monetary union of states . 
  brexit means brexit / s sorry , could n't help it : /, 
  lol , most vpns might keep logs so good luck with that . 
  sure , there are vpns that claim they do n't keep your logs but how can you be sure ? 
  politicians should * definitely * be monitored . 
  they are unscrupulous little creatures who will take any amount of money if they think no one 's looking . 
   move your imagination for poland should be `` pay moni , gtfo , come again , gtfo again . '', 
  depends on how they constructed the survey . 
  while it is just a tv show , yes , prime minister brilliantly illustrated how by asking questions in a certain way you can have a person agree with what you want , thus , skewing the results , . . 
  we might not have an antifmafia commission but we have something close , the cba `` centralne biuro antykorupcyjne '' or `` anticorruption bureau '' . 
  because finland does n't exist !, 
  we have germans all up in our country all the time .

  forget things that could affect the civilized world ... muh toblerones !, 
  well ... we do have those old `` polish death camps '' just laying around . . why not convert them to `` polish holding camps '' instead ? 
  which one is polska a and which one is polska b ? 
  germany - nice people , decent tourists when they come to poland , for the most part . 
  ukraine - hard workers , they assimilate easily into polish society if they choose to emigrate here . 
  czech republic - their humor . 
  hungary - they used to be our neighbours and we have one of the longest lasting friendships so they get included . 
  maybe i was in the wrong state a couple of months ago but i was in florida and there did n't seem to be anything in the air as far as `` nationalist angst '' is concerned . 
  personally speaking from my own experience of having lived in the us for over 20 years and from my recent two month trip over there , i do n't think there is that much of a rising nationalist movement going on , trump 's antics notwithstanding . 
  i think a part of it might be the media capitalizing on some of this shit , but again that 's just my personal opinion , 
  i am not saying that the us will never go full nazi but i kinda doubt people will let it just slide into that kind of mentality . 
  trump is unpopular in the us and the charlottesville thing is actually a protest tied to the removal of a confederate general ( the torches are not helping the protest 's image i will admit ) . 
  people are also constantly protesting against trump in the us in various places so , as of right now , there is no need to worry about the us going full nazi . 
  also , the us is one of the least racist places you can go to these days .

  we want our own marshal plan with blackjack and hookers !, 
  `` golds '' would be a literal translation for the name of our currency :d, 
  we have `` oiros '' . 
  it 's a linguistic corruption of the word `` euros '' ... other examples : `` eurasy '' . 
  if it was n't for your czech flair , i would 've assumed you were a polish person describing the situation in poland .

  [ reees in polish ], 
  before wwi , we were still not on the map thanks to the russian empire , austria , and germany . 
  interbellum : we were doing ok-ish , if `` finally existing as an independent state '' is considered ok-ish , until we had to fend off the goddamn bolsheviks in 1920 because commies just wanted to share their worthless revolution with their neighbors . 
  we would have to define `` unreasonable '' in this case , i suppose . 
  unless german law already has that properly defined :p, 
  we have the `` pan slavic '' edgelords here ... 
   kelly  kevin proper portuguese names those :p, 
  of course . 
  but do n't most civilized countries have some sort of self-defense class for women that would most likely teach them the proper use of pepper spray/mace ? 
   it also can harm the `` attacker '' . 
  oh no , we should totally worry about that poor attacker being harmed by pepper spray or mace . 
  ok , i can see why guns would be illegal but why would your country outlaw pepper spray or mace ? 
  their economic situation , apparently . 
  already living in one , thanks . 
  against it because if i am reading the various sources about it correctly it could impact our ports in that larger ships will not be able to come due to their undersides going too deep and we would n't be able to properly expand our ports later on because the pipeline would be in the way .

  try the feminine version instead `` cyganka '' :p when you call her a `` cygan '' , you 're calling her a male gypsy :d, 
  i see it on youtube comments , 4chan , and sometimes reddit .

  it was the same plane however , original flight was cancelled because of weather ( there was an extreme rain ) . 
   the irony as polish people are really scared of refugees because we are an extremely heterogenous nation for last 70 years , and most of poles know muslims only from media . 
  guess how they are portraited there . 
  lack of first hand knowledge leads to xenophoby . 
  saw a girl in hijab ( just simple headscarf , long dress etc. , nothing extreme - on the other hand , it 's a very rare sight in poland , may be except warsaw ) on urban rail few weeks ago . 
  it was pretty crowded , and still there was a visible space around her . 
  she did n't even look middle eastern , obviously was a tatar or polish convert . 
   you 'll never be more german than they are ( no offense , it 's just ... the truth lol ) .

  still , military junta is even worse news . 
  erdogan might be an ass , but he was elected fairly . 
   a coup , even a failed one , will only afford legitimacy to the akp . 
  actually another coup ( somewhen in 1990s ) was a fuel to future akp . 
  they often have criminal ( non-terrorist ) past , even connection to drugs and `` party life '' , plus long term lack of legal employment . 
  i bet some of that will surface about nice attacker as well . 
  just curious : what 's your stance on form of government of scotland , if it would get independence ? 
  republic like ireland or monarchy like canada/australia ? 
   exactly . 
  as we all know , even the peasants walked around in shining armour back then , not just a small elite warrior caste . 
  `` help !, 
  help !, 
  i 'm being reppressed !, 
  by the way : i 've seen somewhere in past results of research or poll with question `` do you feel to be an equal citizen '' , made among muslims in different western countries . 
  results were lowest in france ( highest in us or canada ) . 
  ca n't find it now :(, 
   holding no ground did n't impede al qaeda much did it . 
  still , al qaeda was much less successful in `` lone wolf '' propaganda . 
  they pretty much had to organize attacks themselves . 
  in the result those were much more rare , although spectacular . 
   the attacks wo n't stop if isis has no territory . 
  no territory = much less money . 
  also , notice that their propaganda is based on `` building a successful islamic state '' . 
  in syria & iraq . 
  isis is losing ground as we speak . 
  it could take months , weeks , may be few years - but i 'm sure we 'll win . 
  so why it 's happening in france and belgium , but not ( or on much lower scale ) in germany , uk , sweden or netherlands ? 
  there must be some differences - either between muslim populations in these countries , or state policy concerning them ( not necessarily present one , there might be some mistakes done already decades ago ) . 
  endure . 
  it will pass . 
  i know it 's not an easy answer , but it 's the only one . 
   getting more help from within the muslim community problem is that those people are n't necessarily involved into local muslim communities . 
  very often they are lone wolves ( single , unemployed etc. 
  ) , brainwashed via internet . 
  still , more caution among muslims might help . 
  so french president 's barber earns more than polish president , prime minister and parliament speaker ** combined ** . 
  i do n't even know how to comment that . 
  true . 
  on the other hand , `` english '' curry is not really similar to original indian kind . 
  this . 
  also , they also want us to hate european muslims , so they will feel forced to either flee to is , or fight us . 
  rise of islamophobia is is 's fuel . 
  kebab , couscous and harissa . 
  it wo n't do anything . 
  these people are already in france , born there ( 2nd , 3rd generation ) or even native converts . 
  unfortunately french can only persist .

  it looks like lone wolf attack , ** inspired ** ( not directed ) by is .

  * ( polski fiat/fso ) [ 125p ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polski_fiat_125p ) ( `` large fiat '' ) - quite decent car , crude insides , but good and reliable engine . 
  * ( polski fiat/fso ) [ 126p ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fiat_126#polski_fiat_126p ) ( `` small fiat ; a little one '' - ** maluch ** in polish ) - nothing really good ( although it was easy to maintain & park ) , but legendary because it was our `` car for the people '' , symbol of private motorisation . 
  over 3m of them built . 
  * fso [ polonez ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fso_polonez ) - crap , especially later years . 
  mostly because our industry fell into oblivion then . 
  fso tried to sustain & modernize it in 1990s ... but if you had a choice between this , even new , and second-hand good western/japanese car ( or later , new quite cheap korean ones ) ... choice was pretty obvious . 
  aka the worst car sold in the 1980s west until we tried to sell polonez ?

  lindgren was ( and probably still is ? ),

   if we can keep our language you mean swamp german ? 
  or just want to go where already lots of their compatriots live . 
  because they are pretty much assimilated . 
   xenophobia tends to be a problem of mono-cultures . 
  rather problem of getting knowledge from mass media . 
  but those countries have less unfavorable views with muslims already inside . 
  which was blown out of proportions by media . 
  so why percentage of anti-muslim views is lower in places where there is already visible number of them ( which means people interact in person ) , and higher where there are few , or none at all ( and local people know muslims from media or second-hand reports ) ? 
   dont forget hungary had the most applications and handled the most refugees during last year , it was a huge stress on that country , much bigger than any other country would have been able to handle .

  no , but the catholic church has long-standing tradition of going hand in hand with ultranationalists , from backing antisemitic pogroms before wwii , to recently inviting onr to main cathedrals . 
   nobody in russia knows that ( and nobody even think about romania , to be honest ) well obviously . 
  if your kid has no place in kindergarden , you need to wait seven months for a doctor , there 's no work in the country for you , do you think of romanian occupation and the inefficient system they introduced in russia ? 
   there was a big ass mosque open in warsaw a year ago , there are dozens of various protestant churches in poland . 
  people also burned a jew in effigy in wroc\u0142aw and set fire to a mosque in bia\u0142ystok . 
  so i would n't be too happy here . 
  well , are you suggesting pis would open fire on them ? 
  i see it more defensively . 
  for centuries the germanics tried to invade , enslave ( hence the word ` slave ' ) , and finally eradicate slavs , with other western powers ( most recently usa ) playing their games in eastern europe . 
  i believe there should be an anti-german , perhaps even anti-western alliance of slavic nations , not necessarily involving russia but being an equal partner with them . 
  of course i realize that odds of this happening is 0 % . 
   cartoonish oppression and mismanagement of the soviet union have you even been to russia ? 
   i think we should try to all identify as european and highlight the similarities between us all , because there are a lot of them why as european and not as slavic ? 
  what 's wrong with slavs ? 
  what makes you think that they do ? 
  let me start again when making an argument , we have basically what 's called a premise and a conclusion . 
  a premise is an assumption that something is true . 
  if the conclusion can be logically derived from the premise , then the argument is true . 
  however , it does not necessarily work the opposite way . 
  the sentence `` susan is able to give birth , therefore she is a woman '' is not the same as `` susan is a woman therefore she is able to give birth '' . 
  you seem to be confusing the premise with conclusion . 
  ... you really are an idiot , ai n't you . 
  but let me reiterate for someone who ca n't spell ` you are ' : 1 . 
  not everyone who wants to leave the eu is a xenophobe . 
  there are people who are xenophobes . 
  these people tend to be against open borders and eu . 
  xenophobes want to leave the eu , but not everyone who wants to eu is a xenophobe . 
  do you understand now ? 
   please explain to me why wanting to leave the eu is xenophobic it ; s not , but xenophobes want to leave the eu . 
   no , it is n't . 
  that 's just completely and utterly wrong . 
   then why can eu courts attempt to overturn the democratically elected government of my country ? 
  of course they burned them alive , in synagogues or during warsaw ghetto uprising . 
  who am i hating ? 
  but suuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuure germany is not invading eastern europe . 
  oh , okay so poland is just another failed state propped up by western money ? 
   with that said , no , i do n't agree with you . 
  so you think that because poland is a failed state propped by eu grants we are somehow better ? 
  there 's more to patriotism than money . 
  so you want poland to leave eu ? 
  at least we agree on something . 
   one mass in one parish does n't speak for the whole church you know who controls the cathedral ? 
  the bishops . 
  the same bishops who hunt for jews in the ranks of the church or praise the nsz, 
  this makes me physically sick . 
  some countries are just better than the others in eu , but when others step outside the line are immediately to be sanctioned . 
  there are europeans of the better sort , and poor eastern scum , just like hitler wanted . 
  i meant the polish parliament . 
   there 's no reason for a government entirely without a left-wing presence to be tolerated in a progressive , united europe . 
  ... for the past 8 years germany did n't mind a government without a left-wing presence . 
   they had like one onr ( far right organisation ) sympathizer and banned him from speaking asap . 
  they openly support onr and invite them to cathedrals . 
   it was designed this way by regime of general jaruzelski in early 80 's during martial law no , it was introduced in 1985 as part of perestroika in poland . 
  these changes introduced also tribunal of state and polish ombudsman ( rzecznik praw obywatelskich ) . 
  also :  during martial law to retain power in case pro-democratic opposition would win how deluded would you have to be to think that `` solidarity '' would win during the martial law ? 
  pfff , like this is going to change anything . 
  * kaczynski will do whatever he wants because he has no restraints other than these imposed by catholic church . 
  he might be an intelligent man , but he is effectively a dictator of poland now , as he always wanted . 
  i suspect that since the death of his brother he makes irrational , personal decisions . 
  * the polish church is in bed with onr and other neo-nazi organizations , if anything they 'll push only further to the right . 
  * constitutional tribunal disbands by the end of this year , their only hope is that pis falls apart or loses parliamentary majority . 
  * this is n't going to happen , any disloyal pissers left already , and if anyone leaves pis , they can simply form a coalition with kukiz . 
  kod can protest whatever they want , without actual civil disobedience they 're impotent , and it 's evident that whatever kod started as , now it 's simply a movement to support po / . n coalition . 
  * nationalists are going to veto any sanctions against each other , with possible concessions to each other in ee , until brexit and/or victory of nationalists in the west . 
  then the eu can be reformed , effectively dismantled in its present form . 
  * poland will have a debt to hungary . 
  i do n't believe that poland was a ` nascent power ' ( the real power in the region was always germany ) , but the significance of poland in the region will decrease and hungary 's rise . 
  v4 might experience a pro-russian turn regardless of kaczynski 's stance on russia . 
  poland 's relations with nato depend on who wins the american elections , kaczynski is explicitly pro-trump , but it 's unclear that american isolationism will make nato withdraw from eu . 
  because ? 
   so nice try fudging the issue , again . 
  all of you eastern europeans in the eu , all 10 nations of you , here 's a guy who hates your guts and want to see you kicked out of the eu . 
  and he calls himself a federalist . 
  give me a break . 
  and the problem with that is ? 
  eu/eec functioned for years without eastern europe . 
  eastern europe can survive without eu . 
  fair enough . 
  could you give me a quote where tusk endorses federal europe ? 
   imitation stalinist wow, 
   last remaining small patch of primitive forest only it 's a huge swath of forest and a lot of it is completely fine in belarus . 
  except it 's not , because it also has been infected with the woodworm and belarussian government does nothing . 
   there 'd be something sad if we let tigers go extinct . 
  go and tell it to the hungry tiger . 
   the difference is that nobody takes it sertiously , it 's always some slogan or a chant on a protest or such ocasion when the de facto leader of the country says so publicly it 's not serious ? 
   supreme court gets politicized by the former governmen democracy does n't mean that there are two political bodies and third one is apolitical . 
  it means that there are three politicized bodies which work out compromises and keep each other in check . 
  look at what / u/o5kar is writing to see the mentality of typical ~ ~ slaver ~ ~ neocon . 
   last terrorist attack in poland was in the 30s . 
  just before kaczynski was going to run for the mayor of warsaw there were two mock bombs found in the metro . 
  are you kidding me ? 
  for the past ages you americans have been calling poland a shithole , polish people idiots , and accusing us of cooperation with nazis . 
  you reap what you sow . 
   i think you underestimate the will to maintain the status quo in the general public . 
  perhaps it 's kind of ... stockholm syndrome ( \u2022 _ \u2022 ) ( \u2022 _ \u2022 )  \u2310 \u25a0 - \u25a0 ( \u2310 \u25a0 _ \u25a0 ), 
  what new poland ? 
  there 's really no such thing as ` longest word ' , since you can stack prefixes and suffixes on any word . 
   i thought the member states are all equal ? 
  who told you that ? 
   now i see why you refuse to acknowledge poland growth , law and justice supporter , do n't assume your side is 100 % correct and all information that opposes your views is propaganda .

  but still - we own 20 % of the list , hehehe, 
   germany ( ... ) can overrule france it actually can not . 
  not on it 's own . 
  it 'd need to build an alliance across the eu and seeing responses so far it seems that france will have it much easier to build their own alliance against the proposition . 
   every stupid eu policy -- like the euro or the common agricultural policy i chuckled .

  [ story ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/colonization_attempts_by_poland#second_polish_republic ),

  they published prices for household consumers , including taxation . 
  ( [ direct link ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/electricity_and_natural_gas_price_statistics#natural_gas_prices_for_household_consumers ) ) but mind you - it 's a country average , so might not match exact values on your bill . 
  quite interesting map considering that in poland people think that we 've got the highest gas prices in the entire europe .

   the immigration law was changed something like 16 times during the previous government .

  nice . 
  it will save a lot of money - now you can just take all the banners , posters , stickers , t-shirts , etc. 
  from `` yes '' campagin in scotland , paint over stripes into stars and we 're done !, 
  pretty much all of the headlines are just as applicable . 
  corrected . 
  it 's also the one that degenerated more in terms of quality . 
  and as far as i 'm aware neither of these newspapers publish anything in english . 
  well on wikipedia list of examples [ poland does n't have one ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/newspaper_of_record#examples ) and i tend to think that 's because simply we do n't have one . 
  back in 90s we had some newspapers that could be considered * newspaper of record * but in ' 00s quality really declined . 
  i guess two closest would be [ rzeczpospolita ] ( http://www4.rp.pl/ ) and [ gazeta wyborcza ] ( http://wyborcza.pl/ ) though sometimes quality of the articles is so awful you can be certain that even interns would n't write crap like that ( and i 'm not talking here only about quality of the content , but even grammatical and spelling mistakes ) . 
  that 's not the case though . 
  [ russia clearly wins ] ( http://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/natosource/the-nato-russia-exercise-gap ) in terms of exercises conducted and nato does n't even attempt to come anywhere close to them . 
  less than in most of other eu countries , in fact poland has one of the lowest percentage of people wanting to leave the eu of all member states . 
  `` 100 jets '' sounds perhaps huge , but in reality it 's 3 times smaller exercise than the one russians make in terms of personnel involved . 
  [ imdb ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2802154/ ) - i actually own a copy of this movie but never got around watching it ... 
  i feel encouraged going back it , 
   ex machina is the smartest science fiction movie since prometheus . 
  that 's a weird * compliment * considering that prometheus made a name for itself by having the dumbest run away scene in a history of sci-fi . 
  it 's stupid to the point where `` prometheus school of running away from things '' became a meme and a reference to just how stupid a scene in a movie can become . 
  that fits perfectly what he said . 
  in poland there is no discussion about `` staying in the eu '' - we are a part of the eu , period . 
  it 's not a matter of `` in/out '' , it 's `` we are '' . 
  so what we consider `` eurosceptic '' in uk would be considered `` pro-eu '' . 
  [ until you realize that ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polish_population_transfers_%281944%e2%80%9346%29 ) . 
   i was talking about latvian constitution , oh , i know , i just tried to explain how it is in poland , because you did n't know  sorry , my post was slightly confusing . 
   i do n't know about polish constitution , but here it can be changed just as easily as any other law , no , it can not . 
  you 'd need 2/3 majority with over 50 % mps present , which was n't possible to obtain for any proposed changes of the constitution since 90s . 
   and even if it was n't the case i fail to see how legislation being harder to change makes marriage illegal rather than unrecognized . 
  same here . 
  i 'm not an english expert , but `` illegal '' means forbidden by law , usually used in a context of criminal law . 
  here it 's not recognized - you can make a wedding on your own , you wo n't be punished for that , but civil registry will not grant you any official ceremony nor documents confirming your marriage ( which means you wo n't have any privileges related to it ) . 
  / u/nieuchwytnyuchwyt has a point - `` unrecognized '' would be closer to truth than `` illegal '' . 
  this and a fact that spain suffered very painful terrorist attacks make it perfectly understandable . 
  hahaha , good joke , i laughed , 
   would be such a huge boost would it ? 
  last time i checked someone was talking about additional 0.5 % gdp growth in the eu . 
  i can live without that 0.5 % ... 
  russians divide tanks to 5 generations , canadians or chinese to 3 generations , poles and germans do n't at all , etc. 
  there is no split of tanks into generations in the way jet fighters do split . 
  it 's 152mm tank gun . 
  here is an [ image of an earlier prototype equipped with 152mm tank gun ] ( https://i.imgur.com/wl8hve9.jpg ) . 
  artillery is a separate topic , separate design priorities , even though it 's using the same caliber . 
  and i do realize how large it would be , but i also realize it 'd be build on a new platform , designed from ground up to handle this gun , it would n't be an upgrade to leopard 2 . 
   you can apply band-aids hardly a band aid once you know how little the first production version of leopard 2 and current a7 share . 
   but western tank development only got away with it due to an utter lack of opposing tank and anti-tank development programs by which standards are set same can be said about everyone . 
  and considering that western tanks are arguably the best in a world - your conclusion might just as well be that all worldwide inventories are '' * for all intents and purposes 20 years old * '' . 
   in any case , any tank that potentially replaces any of the major western tanks would likely incorporate so many new features previously unavailable for existing tanks we 're talking here about western tanks , not russian . 
  there might be some fundamental upgrades , but vast majority of tech is ( or will be ) available for older tanks just as well . 
  current nato tanks already incorporate tons of newest technologies , you ca n't really make a leap like russians did . 
  they badly needed a new platform as t-72 was crippling their efforts to incorporate modern or even some of the older technologies . 
   you can be sure that the media itself will pick up on the `` next generation tank '' hype i prefer not to judge things by media hype . 
  otherwise i would believe that a-10 is the best thing in the universe for infantry soldiers ... 
  no , i did n't . 
  but i did n't mention it precisely because of the purpose you already listed . 
   you are correct about this possibility , however it 's still nowhere near as involved for national industry as developing own tank from ground up is . 
  in the end though - it will be mostly political decision , and i ca n't really predict that . 
  every tank is a compromise . 
  i gave 155mm as an example precisely because of nato standardization - 155mm rounds are a nato standard , so some could potentially be used out of the box . 
  of course you 'd need to develop few new rounds , like apds , but it 's not a whole new family . 
  and you ca n't be serious with that 100t text . 
  t-14 weights 48t and it 's already build to handle 152mm main gun turret . 
  of course it will be heavier with bigger gun , but `` approach the 100t mark '' is a gross overstatement . 
  as for the overkill aspect - we 're talking here about making a tank that will serve next 30-40 years and a current one already is said to have too low caliber gun . 
  next step would be 140mm , but nato does n't have any standardized rounds around this caliber , so natural choice would be 155mm . 
  but do n't get me wrong - i think that raising caliber is what 's necessary , not exactly raising it up to 155 , it might be more feasible to develop whole family of ~ 140mm rounds , though that 's far greater logistical challenge than it looks on a first glance . 
  in either case - you do n't need a new tank for etc gun , if germans are developing something new - it 'd be in their best interest to build it ready for higher calibers . 
  here 's the whole movie - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idyprhozqby - watch all of it , really worth it , 
   quite the opposite . 
  there are a number of limitations with the challanger 2 i never said that challenger 2 does n't have any limitations . 
   it has after all been around 20-30 years since the last generation of tanks no , it was n't . 
  first of all - tanks do n't split into the generations like jet fighters do . 
  and secondly - the latest `` generation '' ( if you prefer to use that ) of european tanks is less than 10 years old . 
  you are n't up to date with leopard 2 upgrades . 
  the fact that tank is build on the same frame does n't mean that it 's the same tank . 
   there is a likelihood that a new gun might keep the same 120mm calibre but ... if turret would be capable of upgrading to larger caliber gun . 
  they might do it in a way russians did - release tank with proven gun first and then make an upgrade to higher calibre when it 's ready / deemed necessary . 
   but instead incorporate new methods for the gun mechanics altogether as an etc tank gun 120mm etc gun does n't offer the same energies that conventional gun of ~ 150mm caliber can . 
  and you do n't need a new tank for using etc gun - leopards 2 could be upgraded for that . 
   mbt-70 project was a whole other kettle of fish yes it was , i mentioned it mostly as an example of another nato large-caliber mbt development , not because it 's similar project to this one . 
   while a combined franco-german project makes sense to a degree it does , to a degree it does n't . 
  imho overall it might be more beneficial not to do a joined project but just some components , like targeting systems .

in polish it is `` ma\u0142pa '' .

  i know they are very friendly people . 
  i know many people keep guns after the war and practice by shooting at road signs . 
  that is why they have holes . 
  many streets in tirana have holes because of stolen sewer doors ( metal round things ) . 
  many buildings in tirana are colourful because the mayor wanted the city to be more colourful . 
  the country is very beautiful but there is much litter everywhere because people dump things wherever they want ( rivers , lakes ) 6 . 
  in albanian the name of the country is shqip\u00ebria . 
  people in albania like to have nice and expensive cars and keep them very tidy . 
  that is why you can find a car wash on every corner . 
  for me kashubians are just poles . 
  i am happy they have their own language but do not treat them as different nation and especially not different race .

  some legend ? 
  germany lost land , poland lost too . 
  we lost our finest city of lw\u00f3w , we gained mostly german cities , wroc\u0142aw , danzig and stettin . 
  i am surprised that poland is not worse . 
  good job heimat . 
  i am not saying helsinki is the most beautiful city , just the best for me . 
  i always try to assess a city with a question `` would it be nice to live here permanently ? 
  of course this is very subjective but in helsinki i like : * fresh air , * small traffic , * no high buildings , skycrapers * all in a walking distance * city with see but not in a ` miami beach way ' , * metro , trams are present  * proximity to nature , * finnish people have good quiet vibe to them . 
  i could just move there ... but finnish taxes ... 
  yes many people go there for weekends . 
  brits mostly but you have direct flights from amsterdam . 
  hehe nope it is not . 
  krakow is great though . 
   problem with helsinki is that it 's more expensive than any other place in finland , and it does n't have enough apartments because people from all over finland want to move to helsinki , but rarely away from there . 
  also most of the helsinki is in peninsula which is fixed in size and there is no more place to put new apartments there . 
  hence the prices . 
  so in my opinion helsinki is the best city i have been to . 
  but what do i know i am from poland . 
  why are there no finns ? 
  poor finland ... 
  the worst is that people fear going out in their own city . 
  polish unemployment rate is 9.7 % and is the lowest since 2007 i think . 
  yes but the goods and amount of goods that is exported by rich countries is way higher than by the poor ones . 
  some day this situation can balance , for this day to come faster than later funds are provided . 
  we ( poor countries ) did not make these rules , ue funding countries did , we just accepted and joined . 
  i am not a native , maybe deserve is a bit too strong word . 
  what i wanted to say it is fair if it is bilateral . 
  as a pole i think we new countries deserve funds . 
  it is not one way deal - rich countries pay but get something in return . 
  they get free access to new markets , because of funds these markets get richer and spend more . 
  the trick is to take back some of these funds back in export profits . 
  for all of you interested in recipe i give you offical one from poznan site ( translated ) : ** dough ** * 1kg wheat flour * 6 eggs * 0.5 butter piece ( 125g ) * 2 spoons of sugar * 50g of yeasts * 1 glass of milk ( 250ml ) ** filling ** * 1.5 glass of powder sugar ( 375ml ) * 200g of nuts and almonds * 100g of white poppy procedure : add yeasts to a small amount of milk . 
  mash eggs with sugar and mix with molded butter . 
  while mashing add flour , milk and previously prepared yeasts . 
  work on dough to the moment when small air bubbles appear . 
  after that leave dough until it `` grows '' . 
  boil almonds , nuts and poppy , mash and sugar and sour cream until it is dense . 
  roll the dough and cut into squares . 
  put the filling on each of the squares , form croissants and leave in warm place . 
  put into a warm oven and bake in 200-250 celsius degress until rogale are golden .

  yes and trying to somehow link soviet occupation with recent migrant crisis by `` far left '' factor despite no connection between those two things . 
  bullshit and you know it . 
   those people have experience of what can be caused by far leftism implying the protest against immigrants was organised because people fear far left instead of just being xenophobic .

  they did , they do n't .

  jewish organisation often are offended when someone suggest the holocaust was n't * the * worst thing that ever happened . ~ ~ edit : fuck , i did n't read the article properly . 
  while my comment can be overall true , that 's not the case with unified hungarian jewish congregation here . 
  they can fuck themselves with halal sausages . 
  maybe . 
  2nd generation are considered polish if they know language , history etc. 
  by majority . 
  you changed india to japan . 
  moving goalposts much ? 
  `` all i see are untermensch ! '', 
  he 's french you moron . 
  it 's just not the same without your supervising though . 
  thanks for the idea for polandball comic, 
  tell that to russia . 
  hungarians are bratanki , second best country in world after poland . 
  czechs are godless gay wanna-be german who speak funny . 
  they did n't fight hitler like poland because they wanted to be andchlussed anyway . 
  slovaks are confused czechs who spent too much time in mountains . 
  go-to country to have an abortion without local rosemary club picqueting the hospital/clinic . 
  why there 's such distinction ? 
  yeah but banks are owned by jews . 
  lizards are n't people . 
  yes but banks themselves are n't . 
  we have other stereotypes for you, 
  i ai n't gon na repost your own comments , sorry . 
  no , i 'm not denying facts , i 'm denying bullshit conclusions of yours . 
  your babbling reeks of projections . 
  there are better ways to deal with having nazi grandparents you know . 
  just ask your northern neighbours . 
  apparently that 's how austrians deal with their nazi guilt . 
  blame shifting . 
  you mean medieval spain ? 
  but that means teaming up with bulgaria and romania and they have gypsy . 
  i did n't say i do n't like banks . 
  i like them , they 're useful . 
  they are n't people though . 
  banks are n't people . 
  it saddens me we have to have migrant crisis to finally get v4 going . 
  please do the rest of uk population a favor and also leave the isles . 
  i like your username . 
  racist, 
  yes but only in britain . 
  and i 'm tired of my country being pictured as 3rd world shithole by daily mail but i guess we have to bear our pet peeves . 
  correct . 
  -- joke -------  you, 
  maybe unifying family reunion laws for whole eu would ( at least partially ) solve problem ? 
  it is for poles, 
  \\  tfw polish 2nd most popular language in both british isles, 
  accomodating foreigners is literally white genocide , do n't ya know ? 
  question was `` what country is ok to live '' . 
  not good just good enough . 
  let 's all live in germany . 
   integrating in uk that would mean eating english food .

  not just any gun , a beautiful one https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tp-82 https://www.google.pl/search?q=tp-82&amp;num=20&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch though the last few years they did not have any current ammo so they took some normal pistol . 
  and story how they stopped http://spectrum.ieee.org/tech-talk/aerospace/space-flight/how-i-stop-cosmonauts-carrying-guns, 
  the hermes space plane was supposed to fly on the ariane 5 . 
  now there are talks bout the very similar dream chaser to fly on the ariane 6 but its a long way off ( 202x ) elon might get to mars sooner . 
  actually it 's only wmds that are forbidden . 
  you can have guns and missiles . 
  soyuz up till a few years ago carried a gun on board for self defense ( from wolves and bears etc. ), 
  after landing . 
  though they stopped since it was used like onece in the 70s and it 's easier to quickly search for the capsule today . 
  so far they got someone that back tracked on a lot of promises and even deleted some quietly from his platform on election night . 
  future performance so far is not guaranteed , though i would at least wait for the complete cabinet to judge the ( dis ) appointments . 
  the new christ of nations . 
  i 'm sure glad we can pass on the mantle . 
  the eu did n't start with both france and italy claiming savoy and germany claiming and occupying parts of south tyrol . 
  but it sure will we interesting to see how they manage . 
  looks great, 
  of course countries jumped on the occasion to to push their interests when the situation got hot , i 'm not arguing against that . 
   and the so-called peace-full protests turned very violent within weeks or even days are you arguing that the arab spring was some kind of conspiracy ? 
  do the arab people have to be manipulated to demand more rights ? 
   following the invasion , iraq is in a worse condition than it has ever been . 
  before , dissidents were in trouble , now almost everybody is in trouble . 
  i agree . 
  that 's why i mentioned iraq as a mistake . 
  more then once . 
   it is naive ( or dishonest ) to claim that we can impose democracy on a country that has no democratic traditions . 
  i 'm not arguing for regime change when the states are working . 
  but we can and maybe should stop active crimes against humanity like genocide and ethnic cleansing . 
  assad was fighting more then half the country and bombing civilians left and right before anybody outside got involved , the same with qaddafi . 
  maybe we should try to end civil wars if the only good quality one side has is that it kept peace with an iron fist before ( but not anymore ) . 
  but there are not really any examples of the last one working and making places better to live , but civil wars tend to do that . 
   or was there indeed a discrepancy in abortion law between the exclave and the rest of the soviet union ? 
  yeah there was , it was still part of germany in 1920s, 
  like i 've said questionable . 
  but so is not interfering during an ongoing crisis . 
  what do you think of standing doing nothing at rewanda , srebrenica or pol-pots killing fields ( or in this case even opposing vietnam intervening ) . 
  sa does not conduct conduct large scale killing of its citizens . 
  have some perspective . 
  i 'm not trying to defend sa btw it 's a shitty dictatorship but unfortunately it would probably be a worst place to live for it 's citizens and it 's neighbors if the monarchy was removed . 
  there are places where the humanitarian cost outweighs humanitarian gain , sa is one of them so is dprk , iraq was . 
  libya and syria were fucked either way when arab spring came in my opinion . 
   that if congress did explicitly demand that the president attack russia , can it even do that ? 
  i generally got the impression that the checks and balances in the us default to inaction . 
  requiring action of another branch seams like breaking separation of powers . 
  it appears finally we are central europe . 
  so is shooting civilians on the streets , and that happened in all those places before they were attacked . 
  iraq is the only place of those that did n't have an ongoing conflict directly before the intervention though it did have a brutal dictator that was guilty of significant past crimes against his ( and other people ) . 
  the interventions did n't help to stabilize those places outside of serbia but do n't misrepresent it as the interventions being the root cause of the violence there . 
  do dictators have a larger right to brutally oppress their people then other states have to prevent that ? 
  you might argue the hypocrisy of only attacking certain dictators or the utility of doing it the way it happened that only replaced organized brutality regime with prolonged civil war . 
  but the moral position is questionable both for and against intervention . 
  and yet obama still did not send the arms to ukraine , one year after the congress voted on it . 
   odawliec took me a while, 
  on demand abortion is already illegal in poland . 
  has been for ~ 20 years . 
  now we need another map when it 's been forbidden again . 
  it 's not really a website it 's a cms that also offers hosting services like blogspot . 
  it 's just easy to use so almost everybody can put up stuff there . 
  again wtf :d my face did o_0 0_o and settled on 0_0 , at least the church had some level headed things to say . 
   `` this is clearly the work of the devil , '' said cardinal audrys backis . 
  well now after a bit of a laugh i 'll go back to praising our polish king and savior jesus christ . 
  it 's not easy going back to feudal times . 
   order and justice i wanted to say looks almost like they stole the name from out law and justice and i went to their website and saw their logo . 
  wtf . 
  for me it looks more like a bacteriophage . 
  i would say that was the other way around . 
  the us collaborated . 
  actually they collaborated with a despot compared to the british system . 
   you sure you want to commit the sama analytical mistake ? 
  of course those people lost and the gains in production mostly went to the owners . 
  what to do with those people , or more aptly what to do to help them do something valuable with themselves is one of most pressing problems of our near future . 
  but the only mistake is thinking it can be reversed through protectionism . 
  they did loose to factors that will not be changed by passing laws and throwing out immigrants . 
  if a car drove past you in horse race , shooting the faster horse before you wo n't change that you will finish after the car . 
   the one which production can be arranged around robots you missed the part where they are expanding to previously only slightly automated industries . 
  the range of production that can be automated is growing with more flexible robots and new manufacturing techniques that are easier to automate . 
   good luck building a robot that can lay a floor in a less-than-simple floorplan , to return to my example . 
  direct installations in remote location and tight places will be immune to automation much longer then other sectors ( well into sf future territory ) . 
  but those workers will face competition from the humans pushed out of the activities that can be automated . 
   you can argue this both ways though someone with a betting habit can be blackmailed , someone with a drinking problem can be blackmailed . 
  you ca n't because someone without a porn addiction can also be blackmailed based only on their sexual preferences and tastes . 
  please do n't equate simply watching any porn with addictions . 
  especially ones that have such significant health and financial consequences . 
  porn addiction like any compulsion should treated but prohibition has n't really helped before and i do n't think it will this time . 
   this is n't about banning porn it 's about bringing online stores in line with physical stores . 
  most porn sites i assume already will check your age if you actually want to pay them through a credit card requirement . 
   if people want to argue that porn should be available for all ages then do so but this is n't about that it 's about making sure there is n't one rule for one and another for someone else . 
  this law will not change to who the porn is available . 
  torrent sites will not impose an age check . 
  neither will mega or any other file locker . 
  will uk ban vpns ? 
  will there be a english channel firewall ( https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20160914/16515735519/uks-gchq-takes-page-china-plans-to-build-great-british-firewall.shtml apparently there will be ) ? 
  a complete ban on porn did not stop turks watching porn so why do you think a partial one will stop brits . 
  the only thing being done is a huge privacy violation and preparing infrastructure for state censorship with no gain for the public . 
   yes , it manifestly did . 
  a lot of production moved to mexico with nafta , for example . 
  yet the us still produces more then it did before . 
  specific production types that relied largly on human labor moved but overall it still grew . 
  it actually grew fastest just after nafta https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/indpro  you were talking about an ai before , not better infrastructure . 
  kind of a huge difference . 
  the point is decades and decades is a lot of time , internet in that time completely changed whole sectors of economic activity and is still doing it .

   but allowing dentists to do cleaning on your soil is a missed opportunity . 
  is it ? 
  one single mistake in medication and her patient may be dead . 
  because maybe some names are similar , but of different drugs . 
  it 's too dangerous . 
  whatever fits you , good luck , 
  it 's not that bad since 90 % of popculture young people consume in poland is in english . 
  i watched a material about ukrainian lady who was cleaning buses . 
  she was dentist in ukraine and she earns better in poland cleaning . 
  she would have to know polish almost perfectly and get a 3 or 6 month intern to be dentist here . 
  she says it may take her many years to learn because she work many hours daily . 
  strange . 
  just like some polish educated people washing dishes in uk . 
  wtf man . 
  i live in poland . 
  my english is far from perfect . 
  and i work remotely for americans and canadians . 
  and i found many of my clients here on reddit . 
  if cost of living in serbia is similar or lover than in poland , you can live pretty nice life doing telecommuting job . 
   ( occasional adult movies have dubbing too , but most of the offer are subtitles ) by adult movies you mean teenage and adult movies . 
  movies that are rated 12 + are dubbed , because many 12 year olds ca n't read quick enough . 
  psa to all services around the world : my firefoxes spell check tool underlines word `` olds '' . 
  i had no intention of googling 12 year olds other than spell check . 
  i could google 18 year olds , but it would require putting more thinking in my relaxed time ... that is over now because of this and i 'm putting thinking into this comment now ... 
  even if it does n't look like this , fuck this shit . 
   how can a single voice not ruin the whole movie ? 
  what 's the point of it ? 
  after you get use to it , so somehow stop registering the lector voice . 
  it 's like people living next to an ocean stop realizing there 's constant sound of the sea . 
  you hear the lector , but you mind focuses on the original sound . 
  it 's like when listening to a song , you can focus separately on drums , piano , voice . 
  you still hear the same song , but focus makes the one instrument hearing better . 
  you know what i mean ? 
  and the same thing is when you listen with a lector . 
  by the way , i still prefer subtitles over lector and obviously the best experience is without any of them , if you know the language . 
  lazy people who did n't go to vote . 
  why did you include lazy cunts ? 
  me too , but what can you do if most of your countrymen have a different worldview . 
  we as other countries in our region , had no voice in international affairs for 5 decades after wwii . 
  cccp had the voice . 
  in my opinion it really damaged view of our country and our neighbors . 
  deliver , get sweet karma and let me know , i wan na see this . 
  but i imagine this timelapse as made in many days , so you see the change of colors . 
  or maybe you could see this in one day timelapse as well ? 
  damn , imagine timelapse of this . 
  do n't forget about tricity , pretty cool too . 
  not every building was destroyed during wwii in poland . 
  most of the warsaw was because germans got mad after rising , but most of the poland stayed intact . 
  it would be wasting of resources to demolish civilian buildings . 
  you can go to any country next to poland to get paid tests and eventually an abortion . 
  there 's so high demand that clinics close to border hired polish speaking staff . 
  depends . 
  unskilled workers get really low wages , but specialists earn decent money . 
  it 's still less than in the west , but the purchasing power of money is different in poland , for example unprocessed food is much cheaper . 
  i have different view of poland being treated here . 
  eventually it always comes to polandball and `` poland stronk '' . 
  i 'm sure most of you did n't notice that the joke is even on sidebar , roll over polish flag on the map . 
  but to be honest , i do n't mind . 
  many countries have this shit . 
  i imagine the french must hate jokes about white flag . 
  and brits do n't get this shit for brexit only . 
  you have it for the surprise in after match , raising google trends about leaving eu after voting , that your politicians lied to you and many believed etc. 
  and much lover prices than in switzerland . 
  so you think first world countries can absorb hundreds of millions if not over billion people and it will not affect scientific progress to really help the poorest ? 
  think again . 
  they do it for years . 
  it 's speculated that there are up to 100 thousand abortions annually of polish women , either illegal in poland or abroad . 
  study says that one fourth of polish women had an abortion . 
  edit : i see downvotes , i can provide sources , but in polish only . 
  eventually some polish institution would have to pay for this and if the description of a procedure would be accurate , woman would face a prison , according to current draft of the bill . 
  abortion on demand is still illegal in poland and i guess they refuse to pay for it now as well . 
  on the other hand clinics next to polish border already hired polish speaking staff some time ago to meet demand . 
  from what i 've learned , abortion costs $ 350 in slovakia . 
  previously ruling party was po . 
  pis and po . 
  biggest parties in poland . 
  number one and number two . 
   how much could it possibly cost , anyway ? 
  we can make it out of snow . 
  ask george rr martin . 
  i know i 'm late to the party , but this is important . 
  this bill may lead doctors to avoid making prenatal diagnosis because it would become pointless , since they ca n't do an abortion . 
  so instead of safe pregnancy , a lot of women may be left without knowledge and if they would n't go to private doctor , their lives may be in danger and they wo n't know about it , especially since there 's almost no sex education in public schools . 
  if 60 % of your body organs would be sick , would you talk about anything else ? 
  from top of my head : praga in warsaw , nowa huta in krakow . 
  there are places in poland where you being polish born and raised , you can be mugged and/or beaten by poles just by being in a wrong place and a wrong time . 
  for example walking in a bad neighborhood in the night . 
  just like in many places in the western world . 
  i 'm hoping it 's an isolated incident of an aggressive , insecure idiot , nothing more . 
  similar here , i live in upper silesia and many families here have relatives in germany , general perception of germans is good . 
  but what i can see of young poles from other regions , especially poorer ones , they still despise germans thinking about ww2 what happened 70 years ago . 
  what i think is `` damn , move on '' . 
  i visited germany many times and my impression is that germans are a bit distant , but fine people . 
  despite many germans saw my car with polish plates on my car in a parking lot or gas station next to an autobahn i 've never experienced even nasty look and if i asked something in english , they were helpful . 
  i would n't go that far . 
  they just have smaller variety of dishes that require flour and they simply do n't do dishes that require untypical type of flour . 
  it 's just different cuisine , not better or worse . 
  i learned this thing about flour when living in belgium . 
  one type of flour available in their shops was pain in the ass for poles . 
  but on the other hand belgians have huge variety of goffers and truffles , so they could say poles suck at desserts .

   buy why would you be purposefully ( and needlessly ) nasty ? 
  as quoted : `` i disapprove of what you say , but i will defend to the death your right to say it . '', 
  it 's not about being nasty , it 's about defending freedom of expression . 
  the nasty behavior itself just comes from spite because people feel that concept being threatened . 
  it 's like if your neighbor would constantly harass and call the police on you for being to loud when you 're well within limits . 
  many would react by making sure to stay just below that limit as often as possible to get rid of that annoying bellyacher even when they 're a friendly and quiet person by heart . 
  `` why would you be unnecessarily loud ? '', 
  is an accusation that is just completely out of place here as the law allows that behavior and the one complaining is at fault . 
  suggesting to make the laws more strict to accommodate the annoyed neighbor is just spreading the other cheek - they will soon move on to the next thing to complain about and now have precedent that their will must be respected . 
  i do n't know what 's so difficult to understand about this , your question gets repeated again and again in every thread on the topic and always yields the same answer ( that is then usually dismissed with `` dae muh freeze peaches xd '' ) . 
  no , i 'm saying that freedom of expression - _ particularly _ of hurtful ideas !, 
  - is one of the core values of the enlightenment . 
  we ca n't sacrifice that so we do n't hurt people 's feelings - because if one of those cores goes down , the rest is up for debate . 
  in the analogy above , it 's just a friendship that 's being ruined ; in reality , we 're risking everything we stand for in this debate . 
  the old quote `` i disapprove of what you say , but i will defend to the death your right to say it '' sums it up perfectly . 
  it 's unfortunately been repeated so often it 's beginning to sound trite and people are beginning to circlejerk against it to feel a bit of superiority , but that does n't damage the sentiment behind it . 
   but that 's not relevant , right ? 
  it 's cute how you 're stereotyping me . 
  with a touch of different upbringing , you 'd be the one yelling about evil muslims here . 
  you think that human emotion is an argument to convince _ europeans _ that they will receive sympathy for being exterminated for their differences ? 
  we were the masters of unapologetically doing that for a _ very _ long time . 
  ( edit : and by the way , the reason that allowed us to do so is slowly dying out and we 're doing _ very _ well with that . 
  it 's idiotic that we 're re-importing the same thing under a different name . ), 
  there is absolutely no logical or scientific way to disprove god , give it up . 
  the whole concept of religion is axiomatic - if you believe in the axiom that an omnipotent god exists , everything that follows can be explained one way or another because that 's the nature of omnipotence . 
  the entire universe could have been divinely created in its current state a planck era ago and there would be no way to prove or disprove it . 
  if you do n't believe so , of course the rest does n't make any sense . 
  it 's ultimately and exclusively a question of belief , period . 
  i 'd tell him to get the fuck over himself or look for people who like to hear him whine . 
  which is precisely what people are doing when drawing muhammed - only that there is n't a meaningless friendship at stake but thousands of years of cultural development . 
  that you so stubbornly want people to shut up about it is what demonstrates a fairly irrelevant issue to be symptomatic of a huge one . 
   i 've never seen that in schwaben when i used to live there . 
  i thought it was the east that had the `` anti-germans '' . 
  i 've seen it as a teenager at the lake of constance and as a young adult studying in karlsruhe . 
  but they like to bus people to every `` protest '' , so i do n't think it 's limited to a region . 
  of course they 're fringe , but it 's imho symptomatic of certain flaws with the country . 
   i do n't think there 's a single german who would be willing let germany fall you do n't know how many leftists here run around with posters saying `` bomber harris , do it again '' and `` deutschland verrecke '' ... and there are many , many more who have bought into the propaganda that _ any _ kind of war is bad , defensive or not . 
  i just fear we 've been lulled to sleep and become a nation of hippies , which runs completely contrary to the concept of `` wehrhafte demokratie '' ( well-fortified democracy ) that was one of the major lessons from the third reich . 
  the first way is the only way that 's indisputably `` for the country '' ( unless you 're a traitor by heart or in extreme circumstances ) , so it 's logical to assume the question referred to defense . 
  ( and wars of aggression _ can _ be defensive - if france and england had attacked us after the poland invasion , it 'd be called `` defensive retrospectively . 
  they just rarely are . ), 
  i really do n't understand why 80 % of my fellow countrymen would spread their cheeks for any invader , and i 'm frankly disgusted . 
  anyone who would attack central europe today is someone who must be fought at all costs . 
  at the lake of constance it 's rather common among young people , all girls get two or three kisses from both genders and close male friends as well sometimes . 
  see my edit , sorry . 
  this is purely a salami tactic of yours . 
          muslims and roma are the least tolerant towards the countries and cultures *** they move to *** what ? 
  that 's what you replied to . 
  besides , whether this is about immigration or not is completely beside the point . 
  you were talking about a `` we '' group that discriminates against a `` them '' group and said the `` we '' is exclusively at fault . 
  of course you did , the comment you replied to specified the statement being about immigrants and you refuted it without mentioning that part . 
  and paraphrasing you is n't a strawman argument , i 'm getting fucking sick of people thinking they understand what fallacies are ... it 's the goto killer `` argument '' on reddit . 
  and lastly , you said much more than '' _ we _ ( as opposed to the original comment 's `` they '' ) should stop discriminating '' - you said that that would be the only necessary , `` clear and concise '' message necessary to end all ethnic conflicts . 
  edit : granted , the part about `` progressives '' was a strawman , but just a tangent and not relevant to the basic point ; and i did n't include it randomly and unreasonably . 
   messages against racism must be simple and concise . 
  something that you either agree or disagree , and disagreeing clearly makes you a racist . 
  yeah , clear and simple messages such as `` every integration problem is caused by the natives ' racism '' . 
  clearly , everyone who disagrees with that is a racist !, 
  what you 're really saying here is `` we need to bend this heavily loaded word beyond any recognizable definition so we can label anyone who disagrees with me as a horrible person by default '' . 
  and people like yourself think of themselves as `` progressives '' ... a word which , by the way , follows the same despicable approach , just inverted . 
  i mean `` i was n't making as political statement '' . 
  oh wait , i misread your comment , i was n't making a political statement and just dislike the niveau . 
  that made me twitch as well . 
  they say that _ unironically _ ? 
  `` le cringe '' here is pretty much in responses like `` lol '' , `` k '' and `` toppest kek '' ... 
   it 's ... obvious that any country comparison will be uneven . 
  it 's obvious when you think about it , but comparisons such as this are often made to manipulate people into an emotional response . 
  and with such responses usually comes complete disregard for obvious facts . 
  hm , no , that applies to none of my friends - they 're conservative but not extremist , do n't talk much about polish politics and study at german universities . 
  or do you mean they were describing those people ? 
  because they themselves seemed not too fond of people from warsaw and the general northeast , for instance ; and that was with three different groups with no relation to each other , so i figured that was a common sentiment among silesians . 
  my guess : the theobromine in it is similar to caffeine , and stimulants reduce appetite . 
  though you wo n't get much of it with the chocolate you find in the supermarket . 
   the barely contained anti-turkish racism is so over the top here . 
  oh my , an eyewitness of mass rape was racist against the turks ? 
  what had the world come to 562 years ago !, 
  the guy below is right , you sound like a caricature . 
  i just looked it up - strictly speaking , yes . 
  it 's a portmanteau from `` metropolitan '' and `` sexual '' , and the `` metro - '' is from greek `` meter '' which means mother . 
  ( also made me realize that `` demeter '' just means `` mother of the earth '' . 
  i need to learn more greek base words . ), 
  though ( at least as i 'm told by silesians ) there 's quite a bit of actual animosity between different parts of the country . 
  except for half the germans under 25 . 
  why do they appear to be _ sober _ ?!, 
  i do n't see a single crate of beer in that video . 
   niderlandy god damn it , you even steal our words ... 
  ok , if you look at it like that , there probably are few people in the world who actually speak latin . 
  that 's not uncommon in germany at all , the percentage would probably much higher among natives . 
  turks making pizza ? 
  too cold for d\u00f6ner carts ? 
  jesus christ , i was hoping for you to be an uncreative troll but you actually appear to be serious ( and completely nuts ) . 
  so did tnt . 
  well yeah , exactly - the prize was founded because he saw the destructive potential he had created and that people realized how dubious his inventions were . 
  to award it to someone who basically did the same as someone who ( as per the mission ) `` benefited mankind '' is what i meant by `` thoughtless '' . 
   latvian/baltic german nobel prize winner vilhelms ostvalds developed the ostwald process in 1902 , which led to the mass production of explosives you can get the nobel for developing explosives ? 
  that 's a bit ... thoughtless , is n't it ? 
  right , and that means the comment you replied to was literal apologism of the third reich . 
  come on , you 're squirming like a worm to avoid confronting my point ... 
     what did they get for their countless atrocities ? 
  fuckload of money and rebuilt infrastructure .

  pro-russian propaganda over here gave out the impression that they are some nsdap-style far-reaching party that de-facto rules in many regions of ukraine . 
  much of online news coverage over here was dedicated to their antics , like waving nazi flags or bandera support marches - similar to how golden dawn in greece was displayed at peak of their power . 
  personally , prawy sektor would be the only ukrainian party name i could recall without problems . 
  glad to see it 's only a vocal minority . 
  exim bank and bank of china ended up footing the bill ( as well as additional interest for three years it took to settle it ) , as they were the contract guarantors . 
  that whole mess was huge embarrassment for china , who really wanted to enter european markets after construction boom slowed down in their mainland , and they were unofficially blacklisted for every major construction work in poland for as long as that issue remained unsettled - they got turned down for several billion euros contracts like new coal energy bloc for tur\u00f3w power plant , jaworzno power plant enlargement , s2 highway in warsaw . 
   chinese company has made an offer to build a high speed rail network for way less than the relevant governmental agency predicted it would cost . 
  be careful with that one . 
  covec won a bid for euro 2012 road construction in similar fashion and it ended up with a scandal  in poland , covec , [ 3 ] won the bid for construction of a highway , linking warsaw with city of \u0141\u00f3d\u017a in september 2009 , but didi n't managed to complete construction and withdrew its operations from poland , and is now facing threat of a $ 200 million compensation claim , which include four month of projected toll losses and 10 percent fine . 
  [ 4 ] highway was planned to be ready for use at the time when uefa euro 2012 in poland would begin , b\u00d6gl a kr\u00ddsl took construction after covec reneged contract and finished it on time . 
  you forgot `` russia is doomed '' one . 
  i have n't seen many posts shitting on turkey recently - most are about glorious sultan 's antics , but maybe i 'm not paying attention enough . 
  well , we have politicans slinging mud at each other ( elections are coming ) , end-of-vacation summary ( record profits for tourist business thanks to great weather , 237 people drowned , traffic jams on major highways ) , farmers got fucked by the same drought that helped hotel owners , new law got passed that taxes shitty advertisements in city centres , and finally - nazi gold train got found ( they did n't actually release any good info yet , so there 's not much to discuss ) , but that one got posted a few times already . 
  overall , it 's very slow period right now . 
  see : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/silly_season, 
  again , you have n't answered my 3 questions . 
  now , as for the matter of money ...  even if we just take 1 billion from you , you will have fucking 5 star refugee shelters . 
  plenty of them . 
  no , ** you ** will have plenty of 5 star shelters , since most people over here wo n't agree to build them ( around 70 % of population is against mass immigration from north africa/middle east ) . 
  as for 1billion ... how much do you think china would pay us for tariff-free access to european markets ? 
  ( hey , you broke the rules of agreement first , so we can too ... ), 
  i think you 're overplaying importance of eu money here . 
  i do n't have any data to back this up , but i believe that if we were to had a referendum in poland where population would decide between having to accept tens of thousands of refugees from africa or stop receiving any funds from eu , results would n't be that favourable towards accepting refugees . 
  now , if you do n't mind answering a few questions : 1 . 
  how would such situation you 're proposing be different from australia bribing papua new guinea to `` store '' their refugees there ? 
  when new members joined the eu , both sides signed a deal that envelops many different sectors ( and contrary to your idea , it involves both giving and taking - new members opened up their markets , adopted eu regulations , dropped protectionism in key industries - western europe benefited from those deals as much as east from temporary influx of money ) . 
  none of talking points involved taking up refugees that want to move to germany/sweden/uk . 
  now , imagine you are happy with your isp - you pay bills on time , and receive quality internet connection in return . 
  then , one day the isp agent calls you and announces that they turned on ( upselling ) a new voice call service for your account , and you either have to accept it , or cancel your account . 
  do n't you see a similarity here ? ... 
  what if the allocated refugees do n't want to stay in new country and escape west anyway ? 
  should we put them in prisons ? 
  it 's mostly real estate . 
  many polish jews owned tenement buildings which they either left behind when fleeing or if they died in holocaust , should be passed to their descendants . 
  after war , when communists took over , they gave them away to other people . 
  nowadays those buildings , or land where they used to be , is worth literally millions of eur ( prime locations in city centres ; many of those lots house expensive buildings like shopping malls etc ) . 
   it 'd be surrounded by moldova and ukraine , both which would be western-leaning and most probably hostile towards russia . 
  would it even survive ? 
  and if , then how ? 
  same way the kaliningrad oblyat is doing right now . 
  standard border checks , maybe some visa-free agreement for people living near borders . 
  live and let live . 
  if oil crashes to 22,5 $ / barrel entire russian economy falls like a house of cards . 
  for now citizens have it rough , but are used to much harsher conditions and simply adjust accordingly . 
  central bank has huge reserves from previous years when oil price was record high , but they do n't plan to defend the exchange rate until it reaches 80 rub / $ ( it was ~ 35 when this whole mess started ) . 
  ukraine got hit very hard ( most important industry/mining factilities are located in eastern regions , where the fighting occurs ) and hryvna was worst-performing currency of 2014 , but got 20 % debt haircut recently and there are projections that 4th quarter of 2015 should have positive growth . 
  they also seem to get stronger ties with west/eu , so , unless some big russian offensive happens and they take over kiev , the time is on ukraine 's side . 
  ... or [ teutonic knights ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/teutonic_order#against_poland ), 
   i think its good to be careful when reading any government owned media , although pbs and bbc seem to do a fairly good job . 
  it varies from country to country . 
  in poland , the public channels are seen as relatively unbiased ( low-profile politicians often accuse them of bias when alloting screen space during election period ) , compared to most popular private one - tvn , which very clearly pushes current ruling party line ( there are rather unidentified links connecting them to former communist secret service people , but it might be tinfoilhattery - i never bothered to read about it further . ) . 
  second most-popular , polsat , is somewhere in the middle of those two . 
  good to know . 
  will check it out next time it 's around . 
  i see . 
  never ate it , from the looks in movies , i thought it 's similar to that chocolate cream , like the hazelnut variant we have ( peanuts do n't grow in our climate ) . 
  very rarely used in poland ( i do n't think i 've seen it in any store ) . 
  people use nutella-like chocolate cream for sweet sandwiches instead . 
  does n't stuff financed from eu funds come with those big '' ( partially ) funded by eu '' signs with project details ? 
  ( [ someone made this image when news broke down that witcher 3 expansion received some eu funds ] ( http://i.imgur.com/5dplruz.jpg ) ) my hometown is major receiver of both cohesion and structural funds and those signs are everywhere ( on ( un ) related note - are there any rules about how long those signs have to stay up ? ), 
  this is very interesting point . 
  are n't the store owners afraid of backslash/boycotts ? 
  over here , it 's one of most `` mild '' groups politics-wise , and they rarely speak out even in matters that affect them directly , like worker 's laws etc. 
  - they use various `` associations '' that represent them , but individual stores/chains are almost never named . 
   decision to start wars does n't come from pure military standpoint in a vacuum , there 's always more dimensions , including political . 
  and here you are , getting close to core of problem . 
  you see , majority over here do n't believe that western european countries will come to help if poor little eesti will get bullied ( anyone remembers `` why die for danzig ? '' ? ... ), 
  - in march this year some agency in poland published poll results and only like 45 % of poles trusted that nato will fullfill it 's military obligations in the event poland gets attacked ( 55 % answered `` definetely no '' , `` rather no '' or `` hard to say '' ) . 
  i do n't think the chances of poland getting attacked are that high , but that ca n't be said about our north-eastern allies - having some personnel from western countries over there creates political pressure in case `` green men '' start stirring trouble , and increases chances that nato/eu 's response will be stronger than `` deep concern '' . 
  that 's what that move is all about . 
   boars are very scared of people . 
  http://i.imgur.com/jizianx.jpg it probably varies by region , but in north-eastern poland ( warmia , masuria and coastal regions with forests ) there are signs everywhere , reminding people to not feed the boars . 
  they regularly raid trash cans and wreck grass in public parks . 
  few weeks ago i saw boar family ( momma-boar and like four stripped piglets ) happilly digging up acorns ( or more likely - thrown out remnants of kebab and other `` touristy '' food ) around 5 meters away from major pathwalk leading to beach , with 100s of people walking past them , some stopping to snap photos - all that in one of largest baltic seaside resort town . 
  there are malaria-bearing mosquitos in greece ? 
  til . 
  i 'm pretty sure australian commenting in this thread could be considered cheating ... also , this is / r/europe - i know we let you participate in eurovision , but do n't get full of yourselves . 
  we do n't really have anything too dangerous . 
  zero scorpions , biggest spiders are the size of thumbnail and are n't venomous , we have two species of snake , [ one of which is venomous ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vipera_berus ) , but it 's relatively rare one ( it was protected species in 90s , dunno if something changed since then ) and the venom is n't that strong to begin with - as long as you do n't suffer from some heart disease , you have very high chances of survival even without doctor intervention - just lay down for a hour or two ... out of `` big '' mammals , we have wolves and bears in small amounts , but they never mess with humans . 
  boars and bisons can be dangerous , but most people are sane enough to stay the fuck away from them , and they are n't usually aggressive to begin with , as young as you do n't try to get too close to boar 's piglets . 
  i do n't know exact numbers , but most deadly ones will probably be something domestic , like cows , due to farmer 's work accidents , or maybe wasps/hornets ( alergic reactions ... ) or ticks ( they spread some diseases , but many people are vaccinated ) ? ... 
  mosquitoes are aplenty , but they do n't carry malaria or dengue . 
  yea , our fauna over here is totally boring and unexciting . 
  i hope it stays that way . 
  reminds me of old joke ... * old grandma with poor eyesight visits state building and notices the portrait hanging on wall . 
  * * - no , towarisz , it 's not pilsudski . 
  it 's josif wisarionowicz stalin . 
  * * - and what did this stalin do , so that you hanged his portrait here ? 
  * * - he chased out the germans from poland . 
  * * - oh , i wish he chased out russians too . 
  did n't italy recently busted `` ham mafia '' who repackaged polish and romanian meat and sold it as authentic italian produce ? ... 
  pretty much yes . 
  when poland joined schengen , they had to relocate almost every border/customs agent from western border with germany to eastern ones . 
  all checkpoints got dismantled and the only thing that will let you know that you crossed to different country is `` welcome to poland '' roadsign . 
  no , i 'm not really an activist type . 
  also , most embassies are located in warsaw , which is roughly 200km away from my town - no point in riding that far . 
  i just remembered about it when i read this article . 
  have n't been in turkey yet , but i assume it 's similar to egypt , it 's not even a case of scammers ( those are aplenty in every tourist town , no matter the country ) , but there 's very different dynamic when it comes to selling/running a shop in middle east versus scandinavia - there 's this `` bazaar merchant '' vibe , where people get in your way , shout at each other , praise their wares , trying to get you to enter their shop ; if they get you to enter , they will constantly follow you around , praising the current thing you 're looking at , as soon as you lay your eyes on something for more than few seconds and so on ... 
  it 's very interesting a first day , since it 's completely different culture , but it gets very tiresome quickly , especially for people further north , who are used to much wider personal space area . 
  dunno about other birds and regions , but similar news made rounds over here two years ago about mass killing of storks in lebanon ( or was it libya ? . .

  lastly , it also true that imaginary differences are often used by people as an excuse for what is in fact sexist prejudice . 
  i know all this . 
  however , i think some people have jumped to the opposite extreme . 
  one may be of the opinion that the observed gender disparities are completely cultural , but the current body of scientific evidence is far from making that certain . 
  therefore , to treat this as a fact and to call any suggestion of significant contributing biological factors sexist , is dogmatic . 
  you 're replacing one kind of narrow-mindedness with another . 
   because either there 's a cultural component that affects hiring and remuneration ( hence , discrimination ) how about a cultural component affecting voluntary choices ? 
  gender equality only means people should be able to pursue whatever path they want without facing prejudice . 
  it does n't mean people of different genders necessarily have to make the same choices . 
  therefore , the lack of a 50-50 split by itself is n't enough to conclude there 's discrimination . 
  edit : oh , and for the other part :  or you believe that women are naturally not as good as men ( hence , sexism ) do you dogmatically reject any possibly of there being differences in biological predispositions between sexes , or are you saying a notion can be sexist even if it is true ? 
  i 'm not familiar with the issue but that 's what the bbc commentator says :  impeachment is a big word for what even the most objective observers of czech politics will admit was a political attack on the country 's most controversial figure - the conservative , fiercely eurosceptic vaclav klaus . 
   it would n't be compulsory ( right now you are free to not have any private health insurance ) and it would n't cover non-paying consumers . 
  so if you could not afford it , a simple operation , even life-saving , would put you under debts . 
  ok , so that 's a lot more radical than i expected , i 'm very surprised a mainstream french party dared to suggest something like this , it seems suicidal . 
  i actually find it hard to believe there was no safety net proposed , are you sure about that ? 
   i want to live in a country where people know how to count , read , have a basic grasp of history and economy before they are allowed to vote . 
  i am willing to pay for that , as is the majority of the population . 
  i am willing to do so even though i do n't have kids and would probably homeschool them if i had rather than putting them into the education system . 
  of course !, 
  i agree with most of what you said about society , you really need n't have made the effort to type all that . 
  i 'm afraid you are still misunderstanding my point . 
  primary education * should be * guaranteed and paid for by taxes - by everyone . 
  however , parents should be able to send their kids to private schools with no extra charge . 
  there is a certain amount of money devoted for each pupil and these existing funds should be allowed to be used for any school , regardless of who runs it . 
  in other words , the money follows the pupils wherever they go , just like the dutch voucher system i described above . 
   public healthcare , like private healthcare , has rules about what you need to do in order to get reimbursed . 
  private healtcares to complement the public healthcare are common . 
  what the right tried to do , is not to replace public healthcare with a voucher system , but to remove altogether public healthcare and let people choose their own private healthcare that they pay for monthly . 
  thanks , this finally clears it up for me . 
  ok , so instead of paying a monthly social insurance tax , you pick your own insurance and pay for it . 
  this means healthcare indeed would n't be * public * any more . 
  the question is , would it be * universal * ? 
  was the insurance supposed to be compulsory ? 
  what would happen if you could n't afford it ? 
   with education , you usually either put your children to a public school or to a private school , but you still have the choice in france , and this is a good thing . 
  however public school is free , private school is paid for . 
  that 's what i mean . 
  you pay for education in taxes but if you want to send your kid to a private school , you ca n't use that money and have to pay separately . 
  that 's not right . 
   the ump tried to make public school less functional and less funded . 
  you make it sound as if they were going to just cripple the public schools and give nothing instead . 
  what was their rationale ? 
  what were they going to do with the money it saved ? 
  please explain it in a little more detail . 
   what are you talking about removing the freedom of choice when funding healthcare and public school ? 
  that does n't make sense . 
  you paid for education in taxes but it only covers public institutions . 
  if you want to choose a private school , you have to pay double for it . 
  that 's not a fair choice for people and it 's not a level ground for private enterprises to compete . 
  why ca n't your tax money be used to pay for any school you choose , both public and private , like in the netherlands ? 
  do you please have an english source outlining the reform plans you are talking about ? 
  i still suspect think you are still confusing things . 
  as i said , healthcare being provided by the private sector does n't mean it is n't guaranteed . 
  here in poland , i have public health insurance but when i go to a doctor i often do n't even know who owns the place . 
  sometimes it 's public , other times semi-public or private - whoever offered the best service and was awarded a contract from the nfz , i.e. 
  the national health insurance . 
  i do n't care who runs it , all that matters is i have insurance . 
  same with education : schools being privately-run does not contradict public education . 
  that 's the system in denmark , the netherlands , and sweden . 
  do you know that in the netherlands most children attend independent , private schools ? 
  that 's because the funding does n't go to schools themselves but follows each pupil directly . 
  parents receive a voucher and can send their child to whichever school they like , regardless if it 's public or private . 
  most parents choose private institutions . 
  what 's wrong with people having this freedom of choice ? 
  how do you justify taking is away ? 
  not only is there no reason for it , it is * immoral * . 
  i think it is amazing how the left wing tries to spin this issue . 
  they 've somehow managed to paint restricting people 's choice to a government monopoly as good and caring , while allowing people to choose is portrayed dangerous and greedy . 
  in countries that have dismantled the government monopoly on health and education services nobody , not even hard left , talks about going back . 
  once people saw that allowing private sector to compete does n't mean the service is n't guaranteed , it became obvious that the left-wing rhetoric does n't make any sense . 
  when people become free to choose , restricting this freedom just seems stupid . 
  really , parents were supposed to pay directly out of their own pocket to send their 6-year-olds to school ? 
  are we talking about the mainstream right-wing , the sarkozy 's party ? 
   socialism is when the state is a big economic agent and provides a broad range of services . 
  that 's social democracy . 
  calling it socialism is a misnomer . 
   i do n't see the difference between your definition and communism . 
  care to elaborate ? 
  communism goes further than socialism . 
  in communism there is almost no private property , everything belongs to the state and the people are the state . 
  in practice , it has never existed . 
  the so-called communist countries of eastern europe were really socialist . 
  the reason the were called communist is that originally socialism was supposed to be only a stopgap , a transitional period between capitalism and the eventual communist utopia . 
  this was the goal way back during the russian socialist revolution . 
  of course , the socialist government socialism soon deteriorated into a totalitarian regime which was n't going to give up its power , so the next step never happened . 
  and so it has been in ever socialist/communist country since then . 
   several european democracies have successfully implemented it . 
  no european country is socialist in the proper sense of the word , i 'm always baffled by the french left wing calling themselves that . 
  all modern european countries , with the exception of belarus , are predominantly capitalist , i.e. 
  their economies consist mostly of private enterprises . 
  socialism is means of production being controlled by the government : every factory , every shop , and every service . 
  socialism is when people ca n't open their own companies , when a hairdresser ca n't have their own salon and must only work for one run by the government . 
  i do n't think anybody believes in that any more . 
   hmmm , i ca n't comment for other countries , but the right-wing party in france has been pushing for private healthcare systems and for more private education . 
  what do you mean by that ? 
  unless they are pushing for basic health insurance not being guaranteed or for scraping public education - neither of which seems likely - it 's not relevant to the question at hand . 
  the fact that healthcare is guaranteed does n't mean hospitals must be run by the state . 
  the fact that education is guaranteed does n't mean you ca n't go a private school . 
  i 'm saying it is ridiculous to say , as you just did , that if someone thinks austerity is necessary then they do n't understand macroeconomics .

culture of work which i respect deeply . 
  i thought china would be shifted to the left, 
  let 's do it , new gov ca n't be worse than current one ( or can it ? ), 
  yeah i hate his rhetoric too , he needs to change it imo . 
  but it got him elected though . 
  do n't confuse mikke 's personal opinions with party programme . 
  listen to wipler , wilk or dziambor . 
  thanks . 
  much better then i expected . 
  why force them ?

  16,91 % turnout in pl after 10/14 hours . 
  16,91 % turnout after 10/14 hours of voting in poland . 
  exit polls : po-33 .7 % , pis - 32.5 % , sld 8.9 % , psl - 6.9 % , knp-jkm - 6.8 % . 
  it is n't hard to be most pro-eu country when your economy is benefitting so much from it .

  7,31 % turnout in poland so far . 
  are n't they commies ? 
  junk contracts are not a problem . 
  there 's a reason why people choose them over normal work agreement . 
  problem 's with work agreements , not the `` junk '' ones . 
  dis gon b hard . 
  yet people vote them . 
  voters ' logic . 
  poland . 
  we have senate ( upper house ) and sejm ( lower house ) . 
  senate has 100 senators , sejm has 460 deputies ( some argue it 's too much ) . 
  you do n't hear almost anything about senate in media , everything about politics is going on in sejm , even though the laws needs the aprobate of both sejm & senate to pass . 
  we have 5 % elections threshold for parties ( 8 % for coalitions , no % for minorities ' parties ) . 
  mps are elected for 4-year term , and have very advanced immunity ( they ca n't be sued for anything ) . 
  vote for third party . 
  unless you want to go full murika mode . 
  low turnout means that people who have an idea what they are doing will be bigger part of total votes . 
  why somebody who has no idea about economy society and law should vote ? 
  without basic knowledge in these topics you ca n't vote consciously . 
  i think low turnout is good . 
  finnish win is all what i asked for . 
  tommorow . 
  i do n't think i 've ever felt bad about my nationality , this is probably the first time . 
  i 'm ashamed that we did n't support rest of v4 . 
  i 'd rather replace an idiot for an even bigger idiot to give the first one a warning than have him reign without fear of consequences . 
  questions were more or less as follow : 1 . 
  are you for introducing single member constituencies in sejm elections ? 
  are you for upholding current way of funding political parties from government budget ? 
  are you for introducing a presumption in favour of the taxpayer in disputes over the tax law ? 
  current results from 33/51 districts are : 1 . 
  80 % yes 2 . 
  16 % yes 3 . 
  94 % yes turnout : 7,48 % for the referendum to be binding for the government , turnout needs to be higher than 50 % . 
  in my opinion this was a pointless referendum . 
  as a 3 times ` no ' voter , staying at home instead of voting made more sense to me ( i could help ` yes ' voters pass the 50 % mark !, 
  better have 99 % voting yes with 49 % turnout than 51 % voting yes with 51 % turnout ) . 
  they 'll propose a 2nd referendum , just like in ireland !, 
  why not randomize the order , then ? 
  this is indeed a better question than original one . 
  time for minority government . 
  if they win elections , they have pm ( or at least i think that it 's how this works ), 
  the horror !, 
  this is an underrated content, 
  i need to visit norn iron one day . 
  are you unironically linking badhistory ? 
  broadly : surrendering your individualism for the greater good of the state . 
  socialism advocates for the same , but instead of `` state '' we have the good of `` workers '' , `` collective '' or any nice alternative name for the institution having a monopoly on aggression . 
  altough i can see one arguing against that . 
  it 's very subjective imo . 
  nazist maybe not , because of the racial aspect . 
  but fascism comes very close to socialism , although both nazism and fascism do n't place themselves very well on left/right axis, 
  that 's true though . 
  yup . 
  when people vote right wing , they only do so because populism ( :, 
  i do n't know why you 're getting downvoted . 
  poland wanted to pacify germany in 1936 but france declined . 
  good for them !, 
  only women can become adults by marriage , and since you ca n't marry people of your own sex in poland , you can become an adult before 18 iff you marry a man - that 's what i meant . 
  wanted to avoid confusion . 
  fun trivia : in poland , concept of being an `` adult '' in light of law , and being over 18 years old , is separate . 
  you can become an adult either by being over 18 years old or marrying a man before that age . 
  you 'd be able to vote in elections after that . 
  we 'll force you to legitimize the system !, 
   poland is a country where free market evolved into its 19th century flavour . 
  oh , what i 'd actually do for that to happen . 
  do n't speak for all europeans as a whole . 
  you 'd hardly find someone in poland believing in such enlightened and progressive values such as martial infidelity . 
  we 're all backwater here . 
  why the quotation marks ? 
  soviet policy towards eastern europe from 1945 to 1989 was occupation . 
  you act like those things ca n't be provided by the market . 
  germany invading little sooner than it happened irl was the alternative . 
  would baptize myself . 
  i hope germany will intervene with army if pis wo n't resign . 
  you ai n't liberal then you are fascist . 
  pis is utter shit and it broke the law but eu please fuck off from our internal issues . 
  seems like eu wants one more exit referendum . 
  hope uk will give reality check to eurocrats . 
  there will be time for us to hate each other when incidents will happen on sino-polish border :d, 
  yeah , i did n't say anything about public opinion , just wanted to address the stereotype that anti-abortion people are religious . 
  it 's kind of funny that one of most conservative countries in europe has a working compromise as an abortion law .

  and i criticized them when they were doing stupid shit , including protesting on the streets when po tried to ratify acta . 
  you appear to see no evil in whatever pis does ( or you just do n't care about your country , and would prefer if everybody behaved the same - that 's apparently what `` intelligent '' people do ) . 
  effective nationalization of farming land - non issue . 
  removing the requirement of open competition for jobs in civil service - non issue . 
  taking over public media - non issue . 
  breaking constitution by president and prime minister - non issue . 
  project to criminalize saving lives of pregnant women when the pregnancy is threathened - non issue . 
  plans to sign ttip - non issue . 
  what exactly would be an issue according to you ? 
  poland and ireland are both imbalanced , they lean right-wing . 
  maybe it was a compliment ? 
  why people always assume evil is bad ? 
  this one-sided western morality is so last century , we should have moved on long ago . 
  if russia has right to its own version of civil rights - finalnd has the right to its own morality . 
  that 's the problem with direct democracy . 
  people are ignorant , and the more ignorant they are the more they think they are competent to decide on sth . 
  it was not description of their stance . 
  it was description of general polish stance , and predicted pis attitude . 
  why would he criticize himself , anyway ? 
  wprost quotes were manipulated out of context ( missing important parts ) , see there : http://x3.cdn03.imgwykop.pl/c3201142/comment_asjcrbvbunluzuvg0xf5isykjuedmz3a.jpg to confirm download the actual mp3 and listen to the relevant fragment , if you do n't believe me . 
  wiretapped private conversation vs public speech in tv . 
  it 's like the difference between usa president saying `` let 's nuke russia '' over a beer , and same president saying it seriously in tv . 
  not that imho it 's that big of a deal . 
  both pis and po has done much worse things than that . 
  `` real life ad-block considered dangerous .

  good thing pis will tell them how primeval forest works . 
  if it 's really a bomb he 's dead either way ( knocking out people do n't disable explosives ) . 
  it if 's not - he 's fine either way . 
  may as well have some fun . 
  who cares what majority thinks about minority ? 
  polish citizens . 
  and if you somehow care about their ethnic background - in 1945 there was anothe wave of emigration - or rather tousands of polish soldiers in allies countries decided not to return to poland and instead to stay in uk , canada , usa . 
  and they were quite reasonable - many of these that decided to return were murdered by communists or persecuted . 
  really , poles for last 200 years were a nation of refuges . 
  1968 then . 
   i do n't like the taste . 
  70-80 % so you do n't even fell the taste . 
   imposing incredibly high standards with regard to personal privacy  europe is too free m8 , give me your data, 
  bitcoin . 
  usd . 
  gold . 
  there 's many options . 
   i 'm not willing to accept the deaths of tens of thousands . 
  i want to prevent that . 
  i do n't really understand how one is willing to accept deaths of tens of thousands so that we can trump on our chests about freedom . 
  that kind of cost is way too high . 
  are you supporting ban on driving cars , then ? 
  24 000 people died in car accidents in 2014 . 
  for comparison : terrorists killed less than 1000 in last 2 years in whole eu . 
   and to people who think this goes too far against our civil rights . 
  what about the rights of the 35 dead people in brussels and the 130 dead in paris `` the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few '' and if you disagree - immediately ban driving cars , because they kill a few orders of magnitude more people than terrorists , and driving a car is not an essential human right unlike the right to privacy and to fair court . 
  i find it funny how people are ready to give up essential liberty because of a few hundred deaths a year , and yet decline to give up some small convenience to save tens of tousands lives a year . 
  but then again , nobody said people are rational . 
  defeating terrorism is impossible , no matter how much freedom you sacrifice . 
  there were `` terrorists '' in 3rd reich . 
  defending christian values in uk  you 're a few centuries late . 
  you 've already traded them for ( much more reasonable ) secular values . 
  there 's not mention of the actual rate in the article ? 
  if by europe you also mean russia - hell yes . 
  if no , it 's very , very , very dumb idea . 
  the change was : `` same drug is available on prescription '' vs `` same drug is available without prescription '' . 
  and it 's not like that drug is the only option . 
  imho that change wo n't change natural growth one bit ( main impact will be - less doctor time for serious matters ) . 
  how do you know ? 
  the rule is `` democracy or oil = you 're in '', 
  i do n't even know where to start . 
  `` europe '' provided humanitarian aid , took tousands of refuges from poland , created `` radio free europe '' , and supported solidarity . 
  they also took loses and reduced our debts once we got our independence , which is one of the reasons poland did as well as it did in 90s ( compare russia that had no such luck ) . 
  i was n't alive in 1981 , but i was in 84 , and in 89 i already knew that communism sucks . 
  neither of these have anything in common with the subject . 
  try actual arguments next time . 
  in poland it 's mostly regular , either - ak , - anin , or - a\u0144czyk added depending what sounds better . 
  that 's for male citizens . 
  female would be - anka . 
  examples : gda\u0144sk - gda\u0144szczanin katowice - katowiczanin warszawa - warszawiak pozna\u0144 - poznaniak most poles outside of lublin do n't know that the lublin is exception , and that the proper name for a citizen of lublin is lubelak instead of lublinianin or lubliniak . 
  people from kielce are sometimes called `` scyzoryki '' ( swiss knives ) , there was a rap song about that , i do n't know if it was the start of that name , or it was earlier . 
  it has bad associations in any case . 
  btw the longest polish word is supposed to be the diminuitive from the name for female citizen of constantinopole - konstantynopolita\u0144czykowianeczka , but it 's not really the longest word , and it 's not the proper denonym either ( should be konstantynopolitanka and dimnuitive would be konstantynopolitaneczka ) . 
  i thought they are incompetent . 
  i have n't voted them . 
  i did n't expected this . 
  they were n't this insane last time they were in power . 
  til . 
  still i do n't like this and i 'll protest . 
  poland has lots of coal and not much other fuels . 
  it 's cheap . 
  infrastructure 's already there . 
  people die of cancer decades later , so no feedback mechanism . 
   this needs courts approval according to that law you can be detained for 14 days with no court approval and no charges . 
  depends how long the court makes the decision . 
   and again , suspected terrorist abw ( internal security agency ) decides this . 
  honestly , i do n't care about terrorism .

  there is very high chance a lot of them wo n't be coming back . 
  that 's whole other issue , but you ca n't ignore the fact that as the attacks became more frequent the more people grew even more hostile towards them . 
  you ca n't and you should n't have to protect people 24/7 . 
  government is bad for whole lot of different reasons , you can be against immigration but they are doing it in the worst way possible , at least considering european standards . 
  however , right now it got to the point i 'd say it 's better not to send them here . 
  there is much higher chance that they 'll get beaten and discriminated than there will be any terrorist attack in poland . 
  forcing migrants on anyone wo n't really make it better if anything you would see a lot of baseball bat `` accidents '' in near future . 
  show me a country were it 's rosy ... 
  i can give you similar examples from germany towards poles , from france from pretty much anywhere . 
  if there is significant minority around somewhere there will always be assholes around . 
   their staunch opposition to accepting asylum-seekers , and criticism of brussels for trying to enforce the scheme , are popular among their nationalist-minded , eurosceptic voters . 
  yeah , no . 
  majority of polish citizens are pro eu and many of their voters only voted for them cause they got fed up with po . 
  the fact that people do n't want migrants comes from fear as they look at the the attacks in western countries . 
  if they were so `` nationalist-minded and eurosceptic '' they would be hostile towards anyone coming here , which is not the case . 
  to be fair vilnius was never really a polish city apart from interwar period . 
  it was part of the plc , which was divided into crown of the kingdom of poland and lithuania and vilnius never belonged under the crown it has always been in lithuania . 
  also `` according to peter oliver loew ( 2011 ) the common language in danzig until the partition was german and the knowledge of german was the premise to become an integrated burgher , however , according to maria babnis ( 1989 ) the majority of the population in the city spoke both polish and german and spoken language did n't determine national identity . '', 
  actually during the first partition the city fought to remain polish , so even though the majority was able to use german we can also assume most of them were able to use polish and they wanted to stay within poland as they did for hundreds of years before being capture at the end of xviii century . 
  people perceived nationality very differently back then . 
  stettin , yes it was german for the most of it 's history , but it 's almost 100 % polish now and so is gda\u0144sk . 
  it 's legally polish territory right now . 
  it 's just tiresome to hear these claims every time the city name shows up anywhere . 
  it 's more about good manners and not pointing out all the time that you want some of other people 's clay or that it was yours at some point . 
  body parts tend to shrink when left in sunlight for too long , but i guess they had a surplus after revolution . 
   feierabend i suppose it 's fajrant in polish, 
  yes we have lipiec . 
   my point is that terrorist can get in your country even as tourist in theory and the only way to stop any muslim to enter would be by closing the borders and say fuck you to schengen . 
  they certainly do n't do it now so why increase the chance . 
   do you really like the island idea ? 
  it would n't just mean deporting illegal immigrants but taking refugees as well and they could go to poland , just to be sure you understand what that would mean . 
  afaik when you are granted asylum somewhere you are obliged to stay there not roam around the continent like there 's no tomorrow . 
  when somebody obtains refugee status it does n't mean he has the same right as eu citizens and can do whatever the hell he/she wants . 
   you do n't see how helping refugees escape from war help them or are you talking about us ? 
  if you are talking about us , we are not helping them to gain something , we are doing it just because it 's the morally right thing to do . 
  i 'm talking about both them and us . 
  you ca n't really tell if mena stabilizes anywhere in near future . 
  will you be taking everybody every time there is conflict ? 
  north africa has such a high fertility that we will get drowned in people . 
  it will cause problems , racial tensions , integration issues and worse if not in near future then further down the road . 
  it 's not about gaining anything , it 's about not losing what you have . 
  having high moral standards is great and all but these decisions may have extreme repercussions in the future and acting based on feelings or morals might not be the best idea . 
  i 'd rather show restraint than happily trust everyone . 
   by the way , if i were pedantic i would say that border controls are quite tight here since we do n't have boats arriving in italy without us knowing it . 
  the problem is what we do with the boats we find but certainly not finding them . 
  you are pedantic here and you did say that . 
  i think you know what i meant there . 
   only eu citizens ... so like tourist coming to italy and taking a train to poland are n't part of the freedom of movement ? 
  what about an italian citizen born in morocco ? 
  what about a refugee that has a job in germany and wants to go visit poland ? 
  if i were to think of every possibility that comes to your mind and then write about it i would be doing nothing else for the next few days . 
  tourists are freaking tourists they do n't intend to stay here by design . 
   what 's next ? 
  will romanians have to flee the country because of the hate for gypsies too ? 
  what ? 
  i 'm telling that poles are not as tolerant as west is , it takes years of exposure to multiculturalism to become tolerant and we did n't have that . 
  we are almost completely ethnically homogeneous and if you we ca n't guarantee that migrants will behave then we ca n't guarantee their safety . 
  lots of people here wo n't restrain themselves to igniting candles or tweeting as a sign of solidarity . 
   right , when was the last time we had an islamic terrorist attack in italy again ? 
  and we even have the pope in the country . 
  i do n't know and frankly i do n't care , all i know there are enough western countries where muslim from mena or their descendants are a problem , which right now we do n't have . 
  why should we ever willingly expose ourselves to terrorism hazard even if the chance is relatively low . 
   and the water is wet , any other breaking news ? 
  do you think only poland cares about the lives of its citizens or am i missing something ? 
  no , i just think bringing problems to your own soil and then trying to solve them is not a solution . 
  i 'm a simple citizen , i do n't know how to solve it , i just know that i do n't like the idea of having people from area ridden with fanatics and/or radicals come here . 
  i 'd gladly agree to island idea , i 'd love to see tighter border control , immediate deportation of north african immigrants etc. 
  i do n't see how bringing more and more people with very different cultural background helps anyone . 
  it will just tear eu apart . 
  jews are special case because it can be both religion and ethnicity and most of antisemitism is aimed towards ethnic jews rather than converts . 
  we can speculate all we want but it 's clear we are talking about muslims from more radical or dangerous areas . 
  nobody has a problem with balkan muslims , tatar or any other integrated muslim minority . 
  they 've been here for hundreds of years , they are indistinguishable from any other european ( for the most part ) . 
  if you take a lot of people from a place that does n't share our culture and values you 'll have a hard time integrating them into your society and that leads to even more hate and discrimination . 
  we are bound by treaties with the eu to provide freedom of movement and be tolerant towards eu citizens , there was never anything about taking anybody else . 
  poland as an democratic country is young , we are happy we finally have our independence , we are safe for the first time in a long time and we are adamant about protecting what we 've achieved . 
  if there was even one islam related terrorist attack here it would be such a shitshow that even integrated muslim would need to flee and you 'd see the real racism . 
  i think that even though we might be morally obliged to help real refugees we are really not responsible for what is happening in mediterranean sea , however , it is governments responsibility to protect its people and the moment someone dies here , it 's on their hands . 
  i realize that italians or greeks feel that poles are turning their backs on them , but you have to understand that we have n't had a single terrorist attack yet and again and again we are looking at civilians , children being murdered in broad daylight . 
  even if there was a single terrorist among 10k refugees , if he kills someone then nobody will give the lost lives back to his victims . 
  islam is not a race , it 's a religion . 
  until now we 've had no problem banning ideologies that are considered dangerous and when you take people from countries that do not share our standards and principles and who are prone to radicalization the i 'd consider this whole situation dangerous . 
  country should first and foremost protect it 's own citizens . 
  if it 's 80 % i would n't call it vodka . 
  traditionally it 's 40 % in pretty much every slavic country . 
  you can tell it 's neat because the way it is !, 
  there are many ethnic groups that are considered polish by general population even tho some ultra nationalist will tell you otherwise . 
  people of vietnamese , tatar , german , ukrainian or belorussian decent for example . 
  there is difference however between someone who wants to be pole , thinks of himself as a pole and is a part of society and people like most of the roma , who just happen to live here , exploit the system and are very often mixed in shady stuff . 
  they are even eating pizza while talking to him . 
  you 'd think that there need to be some respect and manners while talking to a president of university . 
  racism aside , they do n't let him talk , they eat , laugh , shout , what the fuck is that ? 
  i just read some more about it and indeed it 's not incredibly meaningful and rather hard to visualize . 
  we can just say it 's a measure of statistical measure of genetic divergence . 
  anyway i find it a bit weird that southern slavic countries are closer to , let 's say , france than any western slavic country . 
  i wonder if it is because slavs assimilated many native populations when they reached balkans . 
  well yes , but what are the units of x axis ? 
  that distance has to be measured somehow . 
  i would n't count on reasonable when it comes to anything involving our healthcare . 
  it works like this .

  do you have the link ? 
  i got the feeling they are not the absolute top and we compare countries in lower tiers where your case as you described can happen , but it 's not a rule . 
  in a tv set . 
  does it count ? 
  i live in country where polish ( white by default ) are like 98 % + of population , so black/yellow/red person is quite rare view . 
  every now and then , mostly at the main market square = tourists . 
  examples from the top of the list , please ? 
  there 's a huge gap between prices of soft taken from the west ( 60 euro for a game lol it wo n't fly here , i have to work like 3 days for it in it ) and our wages ... so take a guess ? 
  last time i checked , we had something like 50 % of all installed soft pirated . 
  i would say it 's slightly better these days ( we got slightly richer ) as it was enforced by eu to fight it , but it 's widely tolerated , but nothing to boast about . 
  thank god - never and let it stay that way . 
   each european country has different degrees of corruption , but denmark recently scored as the least corrupt country in the world . 
  good for you . 
  i guess it 's somehow correlated with wealth of one 's nation . 
  france - too odd/hard language ( for my standards ) and too much `` bomb `` astic multi-culti . 
  well ... it might be a sign he 's into s/m then :p . he 's a rare breed as there 's around 20k germans learning polish . 
  and new star wars . 
  and chocolate cakes !, 
  swamp ones :p . 
  in a city where i live there are quite many such things , but i think nearby wieliczka salt mine and auschwitz-birkenau ( 2,5 mln people died here in gas chambers , on unesco list ) death camp fall in ` mind blowing ' category . 
  for the same reason i prefer english technical books instead of boothed polish translations . 
  ok sure , but it 's quite hard to learn ( grammar is stupid af ) and in business english is a king . 
  the only justification for this is finding a wife here , but chicks fawn over westerners ( $ $ $ ) anyway , so polish is not needed to to so . 
  i simply see no reason to learn it if you do n't have ancestors from poland . 
  wages here are crappy compared to the west . 
  we want more of them . 
  the more , the better at least here in poland . 
  western europe knows shit as they are away from russia . 
  it 's nothing new we do n't see eye to eye with them on this matter . 
  not the first one and probably not the last . 
  8/10 , but why ? 
  why ?? 
  ukraine if anything . 
  they are culturally close to us . 
  poland is one fuckin outsourcing colony and cracow is in top 10 of it best places to oursource ( cheap well-trained young workforce ) . 
   you even see major differences between both germanys today . 
  agreed . 
   i believe , paintings , books , etc are always returned to the owners or their descendants . 
  in ideal world . 
  as far as i know , polish gov. 
  has a fund to buy stolen national treasures from private owners , but how did they got their hands on these ... is often a mystery . 
   rivers of money came from the us to transform western germany in a fantastic country with an incredible economy . 
  two reasons : the us needed a handling partner , western germany had to be a perfect border to communism . 
  i like to think that current flow of eu money is repaying favour . 
  after all , germany is polish no . 
  1 trade partner export-wise . 
  as far as i know a lot of nazis fled to the south america and you know to get by there you need money ( gold ? 
  besides there 's more than just money which would be nice to get back as it was pillage during ww2 like books , paintings etc. 
  i still find it amusing that germany is well off better starting that war than poland who was the very first victim and paid dearly for opposing hitler . 
  i think it applies to every more populous nation like the usa , china , russia or ... germany . 
  especially if such view is backed up with prosperous economy . 
  and stolen nazi gold / s, 
   we complain about everything . 
  that 's not something unique in europe . 
  sorry , i 'm on mobile and did n't watch . 
  is it like ballermann hits ? 
  i live in so-called buffer zone which according to plans of nuclear conflicts russia vs. usa & friends would turn into nuclear desert . 
  a good reason to be afraid . 
   lovely place at times it 's ` breathtaking ' - literally .

  i treat all european citizens the same . 
  we should be paid comparable amounts .

  it depends if you have any family ties with poland . 
  without it you can increase your chances of getting citizenship learning hard and so-so useful language ( b2 level is a must ) , better be christian , being non-white has its drawbacks on local level . 
  being a rare specialist or having a unique set of skills can make you appealing for government . 
  at very least 5 years , unless you are a sport star or somebody of thic caliber then it goes faster . 
  with decent grades from school you have a fair chance to get on uni and graduate from it - without fees or debt ( very uncommon here ) . 
  public transport : -50 % and slightly less on trains . 
  some shops offer -10 -15 % discount for students . 
  uni years also count towards more paid days off when you start working ( counted as 5 years , masters ) 8 + years = 26 paid days off . 
  for rent it 's just 5 % , but with paying off my credit instalment it goes up to 50 % of my salary . 
  high salary in it my ass -_- ...

  elusive a/the - my biggest wtf of english ? 
  we do n't have articles in polish . 
  so many tenses and in fact you use like 3-4 in day-to-day situations ?

the independentist parties have a total result of 47 % so majority of catalans do n't want independence ? 
  why are we even discussing this than ? 
  personally i hope that - if the independence is declared - all secessionist leaders will be arrested and put on fair trial for flagrant violation of spanish constitution . 
  ** unilateral ** declaration of independence is a crime . 
  edit : article 155 of spanish constitution clearly states :  article 155  1 . 
  ** if a self-governing community does not fulfil the obligations imposed upon it by the constitution or other laws , or acts in a way that is seriously prejudicial to the general interest of spain , the government ** , after having lodged a complaint with the president of the self governing community and failed to receive satisfaction therefore , ** may ** , following approval granted by the overall majority of the senate , ** take all measures necessary to compel the community to meet said obligations , or to protect the above mentioned general interest . 
  with a view to implementing the measures provided for in the foregoing paragraph , the government may issue instructions to all the authorities of the self governing communities . 
  unilateral secession of comunidad autonoma de catalunya would be `` acting in a way that is seriously prejudicial to the general interest of spain '' , so the officials who would commit such an act would be basically commiting high treason . 
  if it comes to this i think secession would be bad for both spain and separatists - i ca n't image any nato country ( which spain is member of ) or eu country ( which spain is member of ) or any country dealing with separatism or any country willing to do business with spain recognizing catalunya . 
  spain could put separatist government under great political and economical pressure , not to mention that spain has an army if it comes to the worst case scenario . 
  nationalism is not an answer to any problems . 
  should is secede when c. 55 % is for secession but 45 % against ? 
  is this really in accordance with the will of the people ? 
  should the 45 % minority be allowed to in turn secede from catalunya and join spain or form their own country ? 
  this is a very nuanced issue and ultimately it 's about legitimacy of state and its laws . 
  the will of the people is a fuzzy concept , i personally tend to prefer more legalistic approach . 
  it is partially responsible but what is the alternative ? 
  to give all ccaa possiblity to secede legally so that in the future basque country could secede and then galicia and andalusia and so on ? 
  it 's just not a viable option for any country , especially countries so varied and with such history as spain . 
  now of course it can be discussed whether `` spain '' as a concept is more important than right to self-determination but it 's hard to expect from people who swore an oath to protect constitution and territorial integrity of the country to allow secession . 
  nationalistic-driven separatism once out of the bottle would be very hard to contain . 
  it 's their business , i 'm just sharing my opinion on internet forum created to share opinions , so i do n't get what your problem is . 
  yeah right , madrid = literally hitler etc. 
  i would n't blame madrid really - if they would allow secession this would set a precedent which could lead to the dissolution of the state . 
  they would break the law ( constitution inter alia ) by agreeing for something like this , so it 's not like they really had a choice . 
  i do n't know how familiar you are with spanish history but position of madrid is completely understandable . 
  true . 
  however we 're a not talking about individual case ( s ) of civil disobedience but of secession which could potentially lead to collapse of the kingdom of spain , so the stakes are much higher for both parties . 
  i 'm not a citizen of spain so it 's not like my opinion matters that much but personally i think that this would be damaging to both spain and catalunya . 
  good to see you  as for the discussed issue - yes , if they want to declare independence they may do this only unilaterally but it will still be a crime . 
  have the spanish constitution changed in this regard ? 
  than i see no connection . 
  thank you for your service ( and contribution to discussion ) o7, 
   so any country that exists in the world was build by criminals ? 
  how states come to be is much more nuanced issue than that . 
   borders change , just read some history man , and laws ca n't stop that . 
  i know `` some history man '' and i have n't said a word about how possible is the secession to happen . 
  i just stated the obvious - what the separatists want to do is a crime as per spanish law . 
  do n't expect much from the dutch , i assume that avarage dutch citizen knows close to nothing about ukraine . 
  i 'm not talkig of what * ought * to be but what * is * the law . 
  meneth ? 
  * that * meneth from paradoxplaza ? 
  damn the reddit is a small place . 
  if the independence is declared i hope all secessionist leaders will be arrested and put on trial for flagrant violation of spanish constitution . 
  ** unilateral ** declaration of independence is a crime . 
  edit : article 155 of spanish constituton clearly states :  article 155  1 . 
  ** if a self-governing community does not fulfil the obligations imposed upon it by the constitution or other laws , or acts in a way that is seriously prejudicial to the general interest of spain , the government ** , after having lodged a complaint with the president of the self governing community and failed to receive satisfaction therefore , ** may ** , following approval granted by the overall majority of the senate , ** take all measures necessary to compel the community to meet said obligations , or to protect the above mentioned general interest .

  unilateral secession of comunidad autonoma de catalunya would be `` acting in a way that is seriously prejudicial to the general interest of spain '' , so i do n't see how someone can say that this would be legal . 
  every country which imports food is doomed to fail when the climate change and environmental degradation plus growing demand from 9,000 mln people make it impossible to feed population . 
  btw if you think egypt is the worst case scenario [ than you should read about saudi arabia . 
  ] ( http://www.vox.com/2015/9/14/9323379/saudi-arabia-squandered-its-groundwater-and-agriculture-collapsed ), 
  oh my , is it semana santa already ? 
  very interesting , thanks for the link !, 
  yeah , there will be pis majority government most probably . 
  it 's not about immigrants , it 's about how eu is making decisions . 
   straight north !, 
  so ... sweden ? 
  well yeah except it 's the president who chooses pm and `` gives him a mission to create cabinet '' , so there will be no coalition with po in it . 
  if you want your promises to be treated seriously you do n't break them the day after you made them . 
  that 's the main problem with how this thing was dealt with by our government . 
  the difference is that he is the president and she is still a candidate saying these things during elections - i would rather have duda and szyd\u0142o as pm issuing a joint statement in november and taking real steps in order to resolve the issue . 
  i meant damage to polish reputation after backstabbing other v4 countries . 
  so who 's going to earn money taxed by government and spent on grandparents ' pensions than ? 
  it depends on the result of the elections and which parties will have how many sabres in the sejm . 
  right now pis is expected to get c. 30 % votes , so a coalition is a must - the questions is with whom ? 
  right now it 's impossible to tell . 
  i feel sorry for russians ( it 's not really their fault ) but on the other hand i * am * polish and these news are bad for russia , so ... 
   instead they have become a white alcoholic saudi arabia that ressembles more and more like idiocracy . 
   such a waste , it makes my blood boil . 
  well , what did you expect from russia ? 
  the damage is already done . 
  i guess new pm could say that we wo n't accept immigrants and we will have to pay the fine but it 's hard to tell . 
  personally i did n't expect much from our current cabinet but what they did was indeed betrayal of v4 . 
  quick translation : during eu summit in brussels on tuesday poland accepted decision concerning immigrant quota , while czech republic , slovakia , hungary and romania voted against and finland abstained . 
  according to secretary of state in ministry of foreign affairs rafa\u0142 trzaskowski c. 7 thousands immigrants will be relocated to poland . 
  in opnion on beata szyd\u0142o , candidate of pis ( law & justice ) for pm , this was a mistake . 
  ** - the decision made during eu summit is scandalous . 
  it was made against safety and without approval of poles . 
  it means that those quotes enforced on national states become a precedent and in the future may lead to ( ... ) national states being told to accept more groups of peoples without any consultation ** - she said . 
  beata szyd\u0142o remarked that immigrants will be trying to invite their families , which - in her opinion - will lead to the real number of immigrants who will come to poland to be much higher . 
  ** in opinion of ms szyd\u0142o the most scandalous is however the fact that `` polish government betrayed countries of visegrad group '' . 
  ** - on monday there were declarations that ( the government ) will protect the principle of voluntary participation in accepting immigrants . 
  on tuesday this principle was discarded - she said . 
  in opinion of ms szyd\u0142o by agreeing to quotas poland disrupted process of creating solidarity in the region . 
  - foreign policy must be pursued bravely . 
  one must create alliances and seeks agreemnts . 
  but the basic principle in foreign policy remains the interest of citizens and security of our homeland - she said . 
  pis candidate for pm also promised that if her party wons the parliamentary elections in october the security of poles will always be a guiding principle ( for her ) . 
  **** also for our baguette friends here 's version in french i found : http://www.7sur7.be/7s7/fr/1505/monde/article/detail/2464974/2015/09/23/une-decision-prise-sans-l-accord-des-polonais.dhtml, 
  damn party poopers . 
  is this the new dank ? 
  i 've never seen them before . 
  jewminati , no doubt about that . 
   i agree on pretty much everything the right wing says and now i see a dictator as the good guy . 
   german flair * sigh * goddamit , not again ... 
  i know . 
  it 's more of a pretext though , not a unique historical even of great importance ( like say 1776 or 1569 ) on which identity of a nation is based . 
  it 's not exclusive , that 's what i 'm trying to say , so it 's not like other nations joining v4 is out of the question . 
  ayyyy,

  i wish one day they will become big player in the gaming market ( but pls no ea-ubisofterino ), 
  thanks !, 
  you did n't get deal that bad after all ... , remember polish car manufacturer `` fso '' ( polonez ) ? 
  you would n't be able to develop skoda to this level without volkswagen partnership . 
  fso tried and was slowly outcompeted by other car manufacturers like opel , daewoo and skoda , 
  woah , never heard of that book/movie , thanks !, 
  the quote is from one of our controversial politicians so i cant really say if he took inspiration from wibberley novel . 
  my point exactly , but ue will probably play hard ball on that ( leave eu no more easy trade ) . 
  according to these [ statistics ] ( http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/international-transactions/outward-foreign-affiliates-statistics/how-important-is-the-european-union-to-uk-trade-and-investment-/sty-eu.html ) you export 44.6 % of your domestic products to the eu which is a lot . 
  i wish uk would stay to counterpart germany and france policies that they impose on brussels . 
  i 'd love uk to force ue to change on a lot of matters . 
  [ edit ] on the other hand the world is changing . 
  europe will mean less and less , and if we will operate as separated countries we will wake up in a world where we are not that significant anymore . 
  there is a running joke in poland that we should `` decalare war on us and then surrender so they 'll fix our country '' , 
  immigrants are only part of the eu benefits the biggest one is as i said before the one that opens whole ue market to the uk . 
  they dont contribute more i never said that . 
  immigrants boost your economy . 
  if you are low cost worker yourself in britain you earn far more than in eastern eu ( thats one thing ) and you have far greater welfare benefits than we have here because britain has much bigger budget and gdp ( per capita mind that ) . 
  you have to realize that you have it far better than we are , and while you are not happy with your country in every aspect mind that uk is one of the richest cuntries in the world . 
  trust me you do , eu helps greatly to boost your economy ( most visible one is ton of cheap labour ( also skilled ! ), 
  coming to your country ) your gov. 
  would love to sign out from eu ( that is perceived like german-french partnership ) but you also cant allow youselves to loose economical benefits and brussels may play hard in these terms . 
  ugh , do you realize that you get more than us ? 
  we get money for infrastrucutre , business , sicence and agriculture subsidiaries ( which is good ) and useless shi * like `` pc '' media campagains . 
  in exchange we have open markets and we are prone to the monopoly of big corporations that our companies cant compete with . 
  after 2020 when poland will receive far less ( due to gdp growth ) but our economy still wont be able to compete with german , french or british corporations ( heard about any polish corporation operating worldwide ? ), 
  some say that capital has no nationality . 
  i call it bs . 
  edit : also south korea and japan grew to power by highly controlling their home markets and letting their companies grow ( eg . 
  they could do that because products that were imported were highly taxed and national products were cheaper and subsidized this caused these countries to develop very quickly . 
  eastern and central europe gave ourselves into your hands to pull us out of the ussr shithole in return we have german skoda and in my country there is not one polish owned supermarket retailer . 
  seeing and hearing all this makes me very dissapointed . 
  yet we had the biggest jew population in europe . 
  im from lodz the city that had very influential and rich jew community . 
  i wont deny that we had growing antisemitism especially during the 30 's but that was unfortunately the growing trend of nationalist ( like onr ) rising to power in poland and many parts of europe . 
  mind that in the pre-war period many admired hitler ( even in usa ! ), 
  and supported his filthy practices . 
  comapred to the other countries at the given period , yes it was but you can always correct me with the given sources . 
  if someone from other country can come to the germany/france/uk etc. 
  and work while living decently then i see no reason for anyone to be homeless other than alcocholism/drug addiction or chosen lifestyle . 
  welp i heard that turks were only temporary solution to boost economy ... 
  it was actually early 2000 's ( sorry , i was 10 at the time ) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rywin_affair they never had more than 10 % approval after that , people were very dissapointed . 
  during the interwar period poland was actually one of the most progresive and tolerant countires in europe . 
  thats why we had one of the biggest jew population in europe also our goveremnt tried to stay secular and did n't seek the church approval in every matter . 
  catholic church became very influential back in the 90 's due to the fact that the church was one of the biggest allies of communist opposition and had a lot of representation in the parliment by the far right that made things like abortion illegal ( tho there are exceptions like rape and life threating pregnancy ) . 
  most poles are quite tolerant with gay people but adopting or having children by them is big no-no . 
  we still have issues to legalize domestic partnership which is stupid but our goverment is famous for not trying to do anything against the church but that is due to the fact that we have wery weak left-wing parties ( which is because of their communist heritage and corruption scandal back in the late 90 's ), 
  your goveremnt should be . 
  german people only wanted to help . 
  i wonder where was that famous german rational thinking . 
  this stuff is hilarious i really wonder what the smugglers promised them . 
  paychecks in euro and nice houses in big cities ? 
  well played , sir, 
  the score is based on survey questions asked in selected countries , this map source is bad in terms of looking for anti-semitism statistic . 
  http://global100.adl.org/#compare compare poland to sweden and look at the scores , yes many polish people has such opinion and i agree with some of them ( eg . 
  influence on us politics-and answering yes makes it anti-semitism lol ) , but noone will spit on you or curse for wearing a kippah like in some areas of paris https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=altyhmrifgo, 
  agreed but you cant do that without forcing people into certain things , like make muslim parents to teach their kids that it 's ok to be homosexual ( because thats tottaly nazi thing to do / s ) or that women should be treated equally as man . 
  poverty is n't really an issue since many muslims on welfare ( british/german/french etc. ), 
  can afford more than average polish or given former soviet block country citizen . 
  western eu has failed to integrate many muslims , do n't get me wrong i have nothing against them as long as they are honest citizens but some of the stories about muslims that people share here makes me shiver . 
  it 's not even about small fraction of them that commited `` honorable '' killing or beaten people up for not respecting sharia law , it 's that others muslims find it acceptable makes it so bad . 
  because this topic is very important and the way we will deal with it will impact the europe for yers to come . 
  immigration wont just stop , if we do n't change our policy we will have serious issues within the eu ( terrorism , ghettification , lack of integration etc. ) . 
  john oliver with his video makes people trying to contro this crisis look like the bad guys , we call them in my country `` helpful idiots '' people like him make it easier to push stupid policies because of biased point of view . 
  hes great entertainer and when he stays on point hes show is a pure joy to watch but same as / u/wonglik said i am dissapointed by his cover on european immigration . 
  they are very splitted in terms of geopolitics , thats why you can cooperate on some level with russia and we ca n't . 
  our country makes russia headache , putin would dream of poland being weak like ukraine and easy to bully to make pressure on germany . 
  lost of influence in central europe is one of the reasons why russia is now only `` regional power '' . 
  as a whole ? 
  sure w dont stand a chance but we only have to reach the military potential that will make russians hurt if we ever get attacked . 
  you ca n't continue to fight without supplies and you ca n't send every single russian soldier for an invasion . 
  russians need reasons and profits to go for a war , we just have to make their calculations big red `` not worth it '', 
  our current pm ( ewa kopacz ) became leader of ruling party po ( civic platform ) thanks to the d. tusk that became president of the european council thanks to the merkel so you should get the idea . 
  well some people are patrioits and there are brits out there that will respect you for being one and i think this may make it worth to be a soldier . 
  yeah being european is sooooooo hard , you have to : * dont treat woman like 2nd class citizens * respect the law and culture of the country you live in * be tolerant i always liked the way migration works in my country . 
  integrate or live alone , there are no ghettos for you to live with ur kin , you have to live among us . 
  i think he meant that but did n't say it precisely . 
  it 's sort of like self-explanatory . 
  you can pull of modest living in blearus but in the long run it 's rather meh due to the high prices of imported goods ( lots of poles trade used cars in belarus due to the way higher prices ) . 
  their economy is shrinking right now and lukashenko has quite an issue with growing debt . 
  he 's solution is trying to bargain with putin , china ( chineese are inetrested in belarus due to the silkroad project ) and eu . 
  no idea how it will play out in the long run , can only wish them good luck as long as they stay away from the russia . 
  hope the pickles will be very good this season . 
  bugbear , remendy and frozenbyte made some well received games . 
  i think that remedy is the most popular with their max payne and alan wake games but these are ` murican as they can be . 
  would love to play something based on finnish mythology ( i still remember quest for kalevala donald duck comic ) . 
  i drive no kia if that helps . 
  well there is a reason it 's called a service and not a job . 
  even more so considering they have no eu funds . 
  yeah in outsourcing companies , you can easily find a job if you have a degree ( in anything really ) based only on the fact that you also know spanish . 
  mind that you wo n't earn a lot compared to the western eu ( if you are not a desired specialist ) but the costs of living are low and living in big polish cities is quite nice if you earn decent wage . 
  it doesnt even look super silly imo . 
  there is a little bit of grace in that , hah . 
  yeah like 20 years ago ? 
  right now we are safer country than most of the western eu . 
  relevant username :  ), 
  poland is fun , from extreme hot to extreme cold . 
  yep thats why every other european news broadcaster mentioned about it and then german media caught up . 
  this is so funny that you keep trying to justify censorship . 
  i am not fan of my goverment and not proud of current state of the public media but if you think that your country is better in this regard , think twice .

   what you achieved under socialism ( or at least what most countries achieved without debts ) you achieved on your own . 
  that was actually one of the problems with socialist economy . 
  we had to achieve everything on our own instead of with cooperation with the rest of europe . 
  and we were forced into many unfavorable trade deals with soviet union . 
   today it seems the most succesful ex-socialist states have a little marshall plan going on . 
  50 years too late . 
   not just that , the west bailed you out for half you debts i believe . 
  in a way , poland and the baltics are a poster child . 
  other states are not so lucky and continue the struggle . 
  good of the west to do so then . 
  maybe they still feel responsible for their betrayal in 1945 . 
   and do n't compare the socialist government with quisling or petain . 
  alright , socialist government was even worse . 
  petain had at least some appearances of legitimacy , polish socialist government has came to poland from moscow in a train defended by soviet bayonets while the real government of poland was on exile in london . 
  where it had to stay for another 45 years . 
   europe was divided like a cake and just like our governments your government did what it was supposed to do . 
  * you simply did n't end up so lucky . 
  * that nicely summarise the mood of collective depression present here for the last 70 years . 
   of course , i hear you say , we had democracies . 
  and that 's true . 
  but we already had them before the war while most of you had fascist autocracies and poland had some kind of autocratic thing going on that looked a bit like a demoracy but really was n't . 
  after the war countries like spain and portugal continued to be lead by autocrats and in greece the west supported reactionary pseudo fascist in the civil war . 
  western european autocracies , while no democracies , were quite nice compared to living in a stalinist regime . 
  they were also ousted like 15 years before ours . 
   while stalin largely left the republican fighters to die . 
  because `` that was the deal '' . 
  stalin supporting the `` republican fighters '' ? 
  then that countries indeed got lucky that he stopped supporting them , because they would be changed into another copies of soviet union 's regime had they prevailed . 
   i would really like you to imagine the perspective of the polish population in 1946 . 
  voted immensely in 1947 for a heavy suppressed ( with hundreds murdered pre-elections ) kinda-pro-western psl in elections . 
  elections were then falsified by communists who were in control since 1944 thanks to the red army stationing in poland . 
   if true independence was n't an option , and the future uncertain , could you honestly say they should have put their trust in the west ? 
  probably not after 1939 . 
  all the trust we had in the east was lost about three centuries earlier though , so west still seemed like a better option . 
   both sides were morally tainted in their own way . 
  and yet the prevailing sentiment in poland during the soviet occupation was that we ended up on the wrong side of the iron courtain . 
  barely anyone really took the socialist ideology seriously - it was something you were making fun of privately . 
  ussr was despised and usa idolised . 
   that 's true , but how could one possibly say that becoming indebted to western banks and international finance capital is a socialist measure as that was the only possible way for our quisling-like government to finance and sustain the socialist economy ( and russian occupation of poland ) it seems to me to be quite in the spirit of socialist measures . 
  socialist economy can not work without constant outside source of wealth , be it extensive exploitation of natural resources or enormous foreign loans . 
   and is n't poland now by far the biggest consumer of eu funds ? 
  in present day : nominally we are . 
  per capita - not at all . 
  baltic states , hungary and even greece and portugal all get more than us . 
  we are more populous than all the other 9 countries that have joined the eu in 2004 combined . 
  it would be weird if we were n't the biggest consumer of eu funds . 
  and counting combined since the eu funds were introduced , spain was given much more money than poland , and i would n't be surprised if it was true for portugal and greece too . 
   your country had completely different borders back then , it 's seems a bit of a pointless comparison . 
  yeah , the poor and underdeveloped kresy were switched for eastern germany . 
  if we managed that level of wealth with the pre-war borders , that only further proves my point . 
   which is actually the same level of growth under socialism ** if it was n't for the crisis ** of the eighties . 
  if it was n't for the crisis is a keyword here . 
  the crisis was a natural consequence of socialist `` economy '' . 
  earlier `` growth '' was mostly artifical and was financed from tremendous loans which could n't possibly be paid back . 
  when the west stopped lending money the inevitable collapse happened , and we had a chance to experience how the real socialism without free foregin money works , a decade of hunger , poverty and lack of basic consumer goods . 
  wonders of socialist economy indeed . 
  ca n't even imagine how far could we be today had we a normal capitalist economic system for that 40 years . 
   your pre socialist level of wealth was about 7 times smaller as your wealth today . 
  * relative * level of wealth . 
  you know , gdp per capita higher than spain , overall gdp almost twice the size of the dutch one . 
  still a long way to go . 
  your graph ends in 2002 . 
  our overall gdp * today * is about 6 - 8 times what it was in 1989 ( some of this growth is just inflation , surely ) . 
  and as a bonus we do n't have to endure living in socialism anymore . 
  20 more years and maybe we will even reach our pre-socialism relative level of wealth in europe . 
  during the 25 years of capitalism so far we have experienced one of the highest levels of constant economical growth in the history of mankind : http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9f/gdp_growth_per_capita_ ( annualized ) . png it 's just that after the 40 years of socialist ineptness and soviet occupation we were almost subsaharan africa level poor . 
  now we are close to the poorest western european countries . 
  if that 's not an improvement , i do n't know what is . 
  it was similar , but not exactly the same . 
  communism really was a great blow to our economies and while we are catching up quite fast , it will still take decades to close the gap caused by it . 
  [ for example , right before the ww2 poland had higher gdp per capita than spain or portugal and was quite close to italy - even though we were one of the most severely striken by the great crisis countries in europe . 
  ] ( http://i.imgur.com/d3ficwj.png ) ^ [ ( source ) ] ( http://books.google.com/books?id=xhrakdnpo3ic&amp;lpg=pa17&amp;ots=p0pzmp4hlg&amp;d&amp;pg=pa17#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ), 
  half of finland buys their booze in estonia . 
   the denominations `` central europe '' and `` eastern europe '' are generally accepted to be cultural and historical boundaries ... and we ( along with czechs and hungarians ) have always belonged to the historical area of `` central europe '' - even if we were the most `` eastern '' member of it . 
  it 's was the cold war and soviet occupation which moved us to the `` eastern europe '' in common conscience . 
  that 's why describing poland this way pisses us so much , the `` distancing from belarus/russia/ukraine '' factor also plays a role but it 's not a primary motivation . 
   it is still very much a slavic nation the fact that you somehow connect speaking a slavic language with being `` eastern european '' shows best how harmful was the fact that there was no slavic speaking nation spared from being ruled by a communist regime . 
  finland has managed to avoid soviet occupation after the ww2 , so finno-ugric languages are not perceived the same way the slavic ones are . 
   it 's also a way for poland to try and align itself with more western ideals than eastern ones in way to gain favour in the west . 
  it 's a way for poland to try and align itself with more western ideals than eastern ones because that 's what we 've been doing for the last 1100 years . 
  lithuanian is indo-european ... 
  probably because we are not in eastern europe anymore than sweden , austria or southern italy . 
  neither of the three ever called that way . 
   a decade ago it was ski jumping we still watch ski jumping . 
  it 's the second most popular sport in poland after football . 
  though it might drop to the third place now . 
  oh , it 's this shitty map again . 
  on one hand it completely ignores numerous still existing pockets of polish language in lithuania and belarus , and on the other hand it marks entire eastern border region of poland as belarusian/ukrainian even though about 99.8 % of population in that area speaks polish ( [ not counting the hajn\u00f3wka county , which indeed has quite sizeable belarusian minority , but is marked as `` tatar '' for mysterious reasons ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hajn%c3%b3wka_county ) ) . 
  also , i have seen this map multiple times and i still do n't recognize which language could possibly be that small brown pocket in silesia . 
  and those are just the errors regarding the polish language . 
   why is being eastern-european considered bad ? 
  being called `` eastern-european '' when in fact you are not `` eastern-european '' is considered bad . 
  it 's in asia . 
  i did n't suspected anything like that , i 've just noticed that you have divided pomerania a bit differently than how i am used to . 
  the eastern half of pomerania , also called west prussia or pomerelia , is quite densely populated and well-off economically so it does n't really match your description . 
  after a bit of googling i realized that you were using another definition of pomerania , and found it interesting . 
   two dictatorships unite just to wreck poland when the two most powerful dictatorships in the world have to unite just to wreck you , you know you have done something right . 
   lets see how it went in 1939 you seem oddly proud of your alliance with nazi germany . 
   the german industrialization advantage most of the german industrialization advantage was lost due to extensive war damage in 1944/45 . 
  and then russians have stolen most of the little remaining industry .

actually , no problem with you . 
  i know some guys from erasmus , they are ok . why have you been called a racist , and where do you live ? 
  what the hell are you talking about ? 
  those words are just normal nomenclature , i am scared od this whole political correctness . 
  what 's wrong in calling black people black or for example polish people `` poles '' ( as same as calling turkish people turks ) . 
  btw : racism is only when you discriminate other race , e.g. 
  you are insulting black people just for being black ; racism is not when you insult other nation . 
  it 's called xenophobia . 
  uneducated people use `` racism '' as a word for every discrimination , i am sick of that . 
  that is why i just inform you that we prefer to be called central europeans - we are trying to change people 's minds about the region . 
  what is the first thing you think about when someone tells about `` eastern europe '' ? 
  for me it is definitely voodka , terrible roads , lots of snow and people in some commies ' hats . 
  i might have said it in a wrong way - i do not feel insulted by being called eastern european , however , i would feel better if someone called me a central european . 
  anyways , thank you for understanding my point of view , i get that for most of people we are considered to be eastern - and that is why i am trying to somehow push any non-aggresive campagin in the internet about us being central , 
  i get that you do n't want to insult us - therefore i do not get any upset when someone call me an eastern european - i just inform that i preffer to be called central european . 
  that is what i exactly meant . 
  and calm down bro , i understand that it is all because of the brutal history , but gosh , nowadays we are all european brothers . 
  have a nice evening  !, 
  because it is an insult for us . 
  is it any hard to understand ? 
  russia/ussr has always been an enemy for us , we always associeted our country to be central . 
  also , nowadays when we are part of the western world it is really unfair to call us eastern europeans , so people may compare us to for example ukrainians , who still have some connections with russia . 
  i would really appreciate if you stop calling poland eastern europe , as same as baltic countries . 
  sounds kinda familiar for me , however there are a few diffrences : - gosh , washing hands after peeing is obligatory here . 
  - going to the pub without having a cig ? 
  no way , cigarettes are must have . 
  -11 pm curfew ? 
  that 's very early , people are leaving pubs at like 1-2 am . 
  also , who the heck would pay a service charge in a pub ? 
  did you mean central europe ? 
  because it is going to do significant changes in our societies . 
  and accepting them as a refugees ( even those who are n't refugees and are just economic migrants ) is a green light for further migration of africans to europe . 
  the biggest problem is that they have no willingness of integration here - just take a look at statistics from your country - http://www.cbs.nl/nl-nl/menu/themas/dossiers/allochtonen/publicaties/artikelen/archief/2015/zeven-van-de-tien-somaliers-in-de-bijstand.htm i guess noone would be bitching if those migrants were coming from asia ( so let 's say vietnamese people ) . 
  most of current refugees just seek for social benefits , which you can see from many interviews with them . 
  in addition , we ca n't save a whole world from war/poverty . 
  accepting shitload of migrants here is not any going to change situation in syria and generally africa . 
  not to mention that such a huge braindrain is somehow catastrophy for them . 
  diffrent calculating methods . 
  heh , i am going to move to the uk for the uni in the next year , so i 'll declare war against all those conservative islamic nazis . 
  let 's see who 'll win - one man army pole , or bunch of retarded extremists . 
  i do n't give a shit about being called islamophobic , since i can call them xenophobic and slavophobic , 
  ow shit mate , are n't you tired after literally 8 years of po 's government ? 
  their explanation of everything was `` it 's because of the pis '' . 
  the most carcinogenic in polish politics . 
  have n't you even considered this nowoczesnapl ? 
  i think your perception of our country is kinda skewed . 
  according to eurostat , our unemployment is 7,8 % ( whilst eu one is 9.8 % , in eurozone 11,3 % ), 
  march guards . 
  we got 2 mosques in our capital city , warsaw ( having over 2m population ), 
  police could form a shield like on this video : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfjez17xhbq, 
  could n't they call for water gun support to prevent them passing through the border , like hungarians did ? 
  they do n't give a fuck about our rules , laws , and stuff . 
  europe , please , wake up . . 
  heh , this is all because of our mentality . 
  we do know that wealth comes from work - in that case we are similar to germans . 
  claiming benefits and waiting for someone to help is not in our culture , we have been under annexation for 123 years , then we had this 20 years of freedom after wwi , then wwii and 45 years under other annexation , being satellite of soviet union . 
  we always had to noodle around . 
  well , i 've been very pro-eu lately . 
  now i ca n't say i am eu-sceptic , but i am not as eu enthusiast as i used to be . 
  frau merkel literally fucked our `` european dream '' . 
  luckily denmark supports v4 according to refugee quotas . 
  they probably didnt ask about denmark . 
  no data about you . 
  but from what can i say , people generally have nothing against you . 
   the problem is - like most normal people - i 'm scared to voice such opinions for fear of being called racist or xenophobic . 
  so , like the rest , i stay quiet and just read other people 's comments . 
  until writing this post , of course . 
  that is where the freedom of speech ends . 
  when you are scared to share your opinion because of the fear of being called a racist for example . 
  western world became sick , it does not respect it 's basic values anymore . 
  tell me why people from central/eastern europe can use a common sense and not be afraid of being called xenophobic or so ? 
  we are not guests in our own countries , we can decide whether we want to take 10 000 of non-integrating people ( because to be honest , the only non-assimilating people in europe seem to be from the middle east . 
  have you ever seen complains about asians , so let 's say chinese or vietnamese ? ), 
  we are open-minded to every migrant , who does not cause a threat , and is integrating with the society . 
  how much complains have you heard about ukrainians , vietnamese , chinese people in poland ? 
  i have n't heard much , noone really wanted to kick them out or so . 
  we just do n't want fighting islamic africans . 
  300 people attended on pro-immigration march , 
  islam is a whole system , defining every aspect of your life . 
  it is not just religion and faith . 
  it is a danger like nazism or communism , if being fundamental . 
  i 'd send our army to help our hungarian brothers . 
  i live in warsaw , poland , and i got 120 mbps for 69 zl / month ( circa 15 pounds ) . 
  my max would be 250 mbps , but i dont need that much . 
  no , it 's not . 
  it is about all refugees . 
  they can be either syrians or some other africans . 
  the thing is you ca n't verify them since they destroted their papers somewhere in the sea , when being smuggled . 
  and you do n't know where to send them back . 
  statistics ? 
  i 'll give you a few examples . 
  http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/8054403/britains-coping-classes-at-breaking-point.html half of muslim men and three quarters of muslim women are unemployed . 
  do you need more to understand that they are basically sucking our fruits of labour ? 
  what the hell are you talking about ? 
  they are already safe in countries like turkey . 
  they just want welfare , most of them are economical immigrants . 
  i would have no problem with them if they shared our cultural values , and work normally , like others . 
  also , the thing is that they do n't want to stay in poland - they openly say that their destination is germany . 
  i am going to protest if my country will accept 10k of possible threat . 
  no way we will accept them .

make money , not war . 
  smells like / int / here, 
  id love to visit some employment office in norway !, 
  im so glad that norwegians kept their heads cool and were really reasonable about this . 
  also , people of krakow recently voted if their city should apply to host winter olympic games . 
  luckily , they voted no , mainly for economical reasons , realizing that most of the sports objects that would have to be built for this event would be financial black holes . 
  its so good to hear that there are still people who can consider all the pros and cons of these ` opportunities ', 
  i am surprised that there were people from the west who wanted to spend a year in russian schools . 
  whenever i see these kind of charts , i immediately think of that game of thrones scene where robert compares multiple armies to one . 
  cant blame people for hoping , can you . 
  i am not ridiculous . 
  i dont think syria will agree to any airstrikes . 
  so basically , russia is defending isis on the international scene . 
  seems we have a new axis of evil . 
  finland confirmed as the fifth column of the eu . 
  so , about that missile shield ... 
  are scottish people pro or against the eu ? 
  i dont think poland and britain are intertwined in any way . 
  the reason why such a large amount of poles went to the uk to work is the language , not some historical friendship . 
  british and polish people have different mentalities , and even a different approach to the question of unifying europe . 
  it seems that respecting a treaty that russia had already broken is more important than safety of allied countries . 
  its sad that we will remain second category members . 
  i envy those russian soldiers , who wouldnt want to go on vacation driving a tank ? 
  if you are useful and contribute by paying taxes , then welcome aboard . 
  if you arent , then go back where you came from . 
  i think that is the only fair way of dealing with this issue . 
  certain nato members dont want nato bases in easternmost members . 
  wouldnt it be possible to create such bases not within the nato framework but as a result of an agreement between two countries ? 
  i read no russian propaganda . 
  russia attacked because of the new , pro european government in ukraine . 
  its a punishment and a way of forcing the country to stay as a russian satelite . 
  poland wants nato troops . 
  romania wants nato troops . 
  poland is in nato . 
  romania is in nato . 
  i think you need to look at the broader picture - nobody expected the changes in ukrainian government that led to this war in the first place so there wasnt any reason why there would be an armed conflict in europe . 
  as i said earlier , i can not discuss the effectiveness of anything since it is not something i have knowledge of . 
  but in my opinion a country has every right to create defensive mechanisms that would prevent an attack - in any form or shape - or make such attack less successful . 
  if such system is viewed as a threat by another party , then it just proves that it achieves its goal . 
  i guess we will have to agree to disagree . 
  but where is the proof ?!? 
  sarcasm aside , nobody is going to die for ukraine . 
  noone wants to risk an open war with a country that has nuclear weapons and is unpredictable - yes , i think russia is unpredictable , who wouldve expected a war in europe a year ago ? 
  instead , i think eu should respond in a way that is proportional to what russia is doing - sending troops would be too much , but i think we should send them weaponry , train their troops and provide them with economical aid . 
  i dont think that building defensive systems which make you less vunerable to a nuclear strike is the same as upsetting nuclear balance . 
  but should the other side think that it is , i think we should strive to achieve similar capabilites as those who might potentially threaten us . 
  i am not gon na discuss whether or not such shield would be an effective defense mechanism since i am not educated in this field . 
  i simply think appeasement is the worst thing to be done . 
  in my opinion , we cant resign from defensive systems just because they might anger russia . 
  if , in case of their aggression , we want other allies to help us , we should prove to them that we did everything we could to protect ourselves . 
  since it causes so many disagreements , eastern nato members should purchase or develop such system on their own , not as a part of the nato framework . 
  other alliance members wouldnt be able to block it and our safety would be improved . 
  are there gon na be green people in bulgaria now , wanting to liberate all these monuments ? 
  ` and we are able to attribute them to an aggressor nation ' but those are just ` local patriots ' !, 
  they should fine beggars as a penalty . 
  probably those that are too far away for russia to invade, 
  you of becomings honorary polan now . 
  i think eu should , but cant , become a single country . 
  there are just too many differences - language , culture , national egoisms , economical differences . 
  can you imagine how dissatisfied public opinion would be in germany or france if their tax money was spend on creating jobs in poland or romania ? 
  separatists are russian forces . 
  why are they unable to collect taxes , provide social security , education , medicine , order ? 
  because they are being attacked by a stronger country . 
  ukraine had no trouble of doing these tasks in peacetime . 
  following this thought pattern , stronger countries can simply invade weaker ones just because of their military advantage and then say ` in a practical sense , country x does not have any control over this area . 
  all their bases are belong to us . ', 
  and then we are back to 16th century . 
  just because they arent strong enough to fight off this aggression doesnt mean that it ceases to be a lawful part of ukraine . 
  would it be so shocking to acknowledge that ukrainian people have the right to decide about their country without russia interfering ? 
  im not saying you cant , i just think that a joke repeated as often as this one is , just ceases to be amusing, 
  even if there was no document stating ` we are declaring a war against you ' , it was very clear who is who in the conflict , what do they want to achieve . 
  nobody was hiding their colours , pretending to be someone different . 
  not too soon , it just ... kinda gets old , i think . 
  these situations are in no way relevant to what happens in ukraine at this moment . 
  also , they led to openly declared wars , which is another difference from what we are witnessing . 
  okay , if one countries military enters another country without its permission , doesnt that mean war ? 
  or did it change at some point ? 
  isnt russia more dangereous than , for example , iran at this point ? 
  i think russia has become the most unpredictable rogue state in the world . 
  perhaps the russian nation just doesnt need freedom ? 
  a bully is not gon na stop if hes left unopposed . 
  russia does not get to ` allow ' what other states do on their own territory . 
  not anymore . 
  in my opinion , the sooner uk leaves , the faster eu integration will be able to progress . 
  imagine the social outrage !, 
  lets agree to disagree, 
  he is speculating , not stating a fact . 
  if a polish institution proposed such changes , they would be immediately dismissed as ` russophobia ', 
  afair something like this was done recently with lithuanian cheese, 
  ` please come in , our gulag camps need you ', 
  forgive me for expressing myself in a confusing manner . 
  reliable source ? 
  interesting . 
  source ? 
  i wonder if/when ukrainians are going to begin launching guerilla attacks against the aggressors . 
  dear europeans , lets all express our concern . 
  it seems russian troops are already there . 
  if you know what i mean . 
  surely , it is another provocation from ukrainian facists . 
  it is obvious , that russian military was merely conducting a routine exercises when a ukrainian jet deliberately flew straight into russian rockets path .

  facepalmed all the way through . 
  it 's often the smallest subreddits that end up being the least cancerous, 
  pretty common among the younger generation , just like in your country op . 
  still many people stick to `` normal '' smoking . 
  lol, 
  i 'm in accounting as well , but i ca n't see myself staying here for long , the company im working for is already moving most of its operations to india and firing most of its old polish staff . 
  guess even we got too `` expensive '' . 
   do you want to stay in the same career or move around ? 
  i 'm the type of a person that 's addicted to constantly experiencing new things so definitely the latter . 
   would your salary be significantly different in other countries ? 
  in the west ? 
  absolutely . 
  i hope i can work there someday , polish job market is incredibly toxic if you 're not in it . 
  no , i tried drinking it once because everyone told me it 's as good as mineral water now and i ended up with a stomach ache for a whole day : /, 
  fuck yeah , love me some grilled oscypek with cranberries, 
  seconded, 
  there is next to none regional identity in poland . 
  people who say otherwise are mostly role playing to fit in . 
  for me it 's poland --  europe i guess , but i do n't feel particularly strongly about either . 
  i 'd wait , but i know a lot of people would just pass through, 
  i remember i made the biggest progress in middle school ( which happened to be one of the best at teaching languages in warsaw ) . 
  we had english lessons every day of the week in relatively small groups , plus a seperate lesson with the native speaker . 
  the school also signed us up for the fce test for free . 
  daily contact through media and entertainment ( in my case video games ) also helped . 
  i still did n't feel comfortable using the language in speech/writing until i was an adult though . 
  now i have a similar problem learning german ... 
  i hope i 'll get over it eventually lol . 
  never heard of it . 
  those studies are generally useless since they rate the difficulty of learning x language from the pov of an english native speaker , which is silly when you consider that english speaking people are the least likely to learn a new language ... 
  i once known an ukrainian student from odessa who i had no idea was a foreigner until like 6 months into my college programme . 
  in other words , i think most foreigners in poland ( the little we get ) do make an effort to learn the language . 
  the only person i 've ever known who lived for a long time in poland * and * never learned the language was a british native speaker from my middle school ( gimnazjum ) . 
  halloween is often `` celebrated '' at college parties . 
  well , in poland the reformation does n't have nearly as many negative connotations as in western europe , primarily because we avoided most of the religious wars and religious tolerance was a law since 1573 . 
  i mentioned luther since i believe the social revolution he kickstarted had a tremendous effect on the future of western civilisation as a whole . 
  i was n't really aware of mozart being controversial , the austrians stuck his face on absolutely everything last time i was there lol, 
  fine then germany : martin luther france : napoleon netherlands : rembrandt united kingdom : charles darwin spain : salvador dali czech republic : alfons mucha austria : ~ ~ hit ~ ~ amadeus mozart italy : dante alighieri portugal : vasco da gama lithuania : ( trigger warning ) adam mickiewicz serbia/croatia : ( trigger warning # 2 ) nikolai tesla denmark : hans christian andersen sweden : richard bergh norway : edvard munch russia : piotr czajkowski ( pardon the polish spelling ) my art fascinated high school self totally isnt leaking here , i swear, 
  living or passed ? 
  best : most of western europe really . 
  then again my expectations arent particulary high to begin with . 
  worst : croatia , had some unpleasant experiences in bars and gas stations, 
  op suggested to start with the french revolution so i did . 
  the least eventful was probably the 1956-1968 era , after stalin 's death and when w\u0142adys\u0142aw gomu\u0142ka was the leader of the polish communist party . 
  as we say here in poland , `` the situation was poor , but stable '' . 
  2010s are quite a mixed bag , but more on a positive side all things considered . 
  honestly if not for pis and their quasi-communist shenanigans i 'd say it was the best decade in our recorded history yet ( the second being the 00 , and the third - 90s ) . 
  it recently became a meme due to an interview with one particulary backward memeber of the government . 
  i only know two personally ( my cousins ) . 
  regarding your second question , it 's seen as a lifestyle choice more than anything . 
  it 's seen as odd , but most critics shut up as soon as you start explaining the health benefits and such . 
  also , while not strictly vegetarian , there is a catholic tradition of not eating meat ( minus fish ) on fridays , which is relatively popular in poland . 
  one way ticket to western europe or usa together with my family . 
  my schools had neither . 
  only a red plate with the school 's name hanging on a wall , sometimes with the white eagle emblem above it . 
  myself i first learned about it from my university professor ( an expert linguist who speaks about 20 [ sic ] languages fluently , including romanian ) . 
  ( rough ) translation :  in the romanian language one can find many words of slavic origin , such as da ( yes ) , ceas ( hour ) , r\u0103zboi ( war ) , nevast\u0103 ( wife ) , duh ( ghost , spirit ) etc. 
  these words form about 14 % of the standard romanian vocabulary , although in xix century there used to be over 50 % [ words of this origin ] however , the english wikipedia seems to avoid the topic altogether ( i suppose it must be quite controversial ) . 
  take it with a grain of salt if you wish so . 
  humour . 
  just kidding , polish humour is terrible . 
  they had an in-deph language reform in xix century which replaced most slavic words ( which constituted about 50 % of the old romanian language ) with their latin equivalents and replaced the previously used cyrillic script with the latin script . 
  the only division used is 1 ) people who lived through communism 2 ) people who did n't, 
  probably the cases , despite my native language also having them . 
  double fatality being cases + articles , since the latter basically boils down to pure memorisation . 
  what i found is it 's actually very difficult to adjust the sentences `` on the fly '' without speaking the language natively , which is why i 'm grateful that the current lingua franca does n't use this system lol, 
  i liked the caesar one too . 
  it had a pretty awesome polish dub lol, 
  my bad , it 's so much more than just your old run of the mill far-right !, 
  they 're shameless constitution breaking scumbags that will hopefully be put before the state tribunal after their term ends . 
  ca n't wait to see macierewicz rot his last years away in prison . 
  classical liberal is conservative though ... ? 
  socially they 're also very much conservative . 
  during the last 8 years they did n't do jack shit to liberalize the abortion laws for example . 
  the only thing they really excelled at were foreign relations , as evidenced by tusk 's eu career . 
  on the official level - somewhat . 
  then again it varies greatly on the political party in question . 
  i got an impression that po ( our conservative right party ) was more careful to be pc towards our european allies than pis ( far-right ) , which is antagonistic towards pretty much everyone except usa . 
  on the informal level - nah , not even close . 
  hurr durr katyn , hurr durr cursed soliders , hurr durr grunwald and other assorted wewuzzery all day along . 
  i think the difference is most americans with polish ancestry ~ ~ are ashamed of ~ ~ do n't care about their polish heritage past , like , the 2nd generation max , so the polish-americans we interact with ( or polonia as we like to call them ) that still identify as such tend to speak fluent polish at very least . 
  i visited greenpoint in new york a couple of years ago , if it was n't for architecture i could swear i was still in poland lol, 
  i think this phrase best describes your condition https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/uncanny_valley i personally found the american cultural quirks to be oddly refreshing compared to what i usually experience in poland . 
  i might be in minority when i say this , but i 'll take american `` fake '' friendliness over polish honest rudeness any day of the week . 
  is it even confirmed that guy is an american ? 
  i got the same feeling when i first went to the usa back in 2010 . 
  honestly , the funniest thing about that trip was discovering how wrong the people who scream about the `` americanisation '' of europe really are . 
  i 'm now convinced none of them ever actually stepped foot in that country . 
  oh , and it 's also now funny to talk with people who pretend to know everything about the american culture because they happened to watch a couple of american movie series on the internet or listen to some american music . 
  they 're exactly like the animu/manga weaboos everyone laughs at , except for usa . 
  edit : i now have a strong urge to recreate the american weaboo pasta in polish with the american context instead, 
  i heard from my brother who went to beijin that they also burp very loudly and that traffic rules basically do not apply here . 
  i love this with some bread and lemon . 
  definitely an acquired taste though . 
  oh and it 's called * n\u00f3\u017cki * in polish . 
  in far-rights mind ( american or otherwise ) poland is basically the white man 's paradise \u2122 and the last true bastion of the european culture \u2122 . 
  so yeah , they do fetishize the country a lot , but in a different kind of way than countries like sweden and germany . 
  it 's the same in polish , which is partly why this word became a meme . 
  well , that 's a new word for my vocab  thanks for correction . 
  flag waving in general is rather uncommon outside of nation-wide holidays like the independence day . 
  unless the polish translation is really sloppy - no .

  vat is a turnover tax ? 
  looks my english names of different taxes need some polishing . 
  i was thinking about tax , a very small percentage , paid from all revenue , not just from profit . 
  thanks for info about ccctb . 
  it does n't matter . 
  it 's simple , just put a franchise central in tax heaven , and charge national branches with fees so big , that they wo n't shown profits and so not pay taxes from those in other countries . 
  turnover tax for international business could help with that , but this kind of tax is not allowed in eu . 
  for comparison , how `` lektor '' ( voice-over ) works , check and compare those for unique polish 90 's alike experience : [ kung fury - hd - lektor pl ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ixx25s2ip4 ) [ kung fury official movie [ hd ] ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bs5p_laqivg ) i had no idea voice-over is barely used outside poland . 
  so why recruitment have already started , even people i know got invitation letters ( with `` cursed soldiers '' mentioned in first paragraph , lol ) from wku in rzesz\u00f3w ? 
  pis set a new standard with firing people , they fired freaking everybody , and what is worse , they replaced them with complete ignorants . 
  pis literally destroyed civil service . 
  `` according to a proposition of act , commander of territorial defence army is one of three main commanders , territorial defence army , in contrast to other branches of armed forces , are not under commander-in-chief command '' no wonder people are joking it 's a reincarnation of ormo or zomo . 
  they have wasted monies on creating ak-armed poorly equipped arm of defence under direct macierewicz rule to fight russian armoured units !, 
  current czech president , milo\u0161 zeman is a bit controversial person . 
  do you mean having a president - meme generator ? 
  looks like this is trend now . 
  it 's funny coincidence ( or maybe not , some remains of polish-lithuanian commonwealth ? 
  ) , the same name is used in polish , `` czechy '' . 
  i have met roumania too in some a bit old books about wwii . 
  it was hard to ban it , after all then we had three other countries at once ( \u0361 \u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361 \u00b0 ), 
  i swear this map appears on a regular basis here . 
  4 years in the worst case ... 
  exactly . 
  also first time pis had a government with two other parties and still it was not enough to have a majority in parliament . 
  people were saying about kaczy\u0144ski and pis for almost decade , or about brexit or whatever . 
  actually these days hearing phrase  never get elected . 
  make me fell nervous or excited in a bad way . 
  i disagree . 
  it is considered to accept a restriction of freedom , if that 's collide with others ' people freedom . 
  so insulting a somebody `` touch somebody '' personally . 
  discussing about historic facts do not , historic facts are not a person with rights . 
  i honestly completely do not understand what is this fuss about . 
  let 's assume god created everything 10000 years ago , but with all past history ( skeletons of dinosaurs and everything else ) . 
  then it ca n't be proved wrong or right , but also change absolutely nothing for science from creationist point of view , because if god created those skeletons of dinosaurs and our minds , then i guess he wanted us to freaking dig for them and use our minds to think about damn skeletons . 
  so both creationists and normal people should use their brain to explore the world . 
  so what 's the fuss about ? 
  are those so dumb creationist they really thinks evidences for evolution are just scam or their opinion of god is so low , they thinks god is some old bored dude who is just playing with people by giving them mind and hoping they wo n't use it ? 
  think about what can happen when some right nutjobs gets +50 % seats . 
  freedom of speech and insulting somebody by calling names are a bit different things , are n't they ? 
  not really , having a 1 % parties dictating a conditions can be a serious problem too . 
  but i agree , there should be some mechanism to prevent a situation , when too many votes do not count . 
  temporary lowering a electoral treshold or something like that ,, 
  nah , scaremongering was secondary . 
  free cash for kids . 
  pis was constantly saying how bad situation was in poland for 8 years , and because people have golden fish memory , some people forget time they have been ruling and bought that crap . 
  and proposition of free cash for having kids . 
  did i mentioned a free cash ? 
  anyway , funny thing is , that they barely won . 
  three parties almost got enough votes to get in parliament , but not enough , and 15 % of votes was wasted . 
  that have turned pis result ( around 40 % ) into over 50 % of seats . 
  you give a macierewicz too much credit . 
  he is a simply guy who completely went nuts . 
  well , if something happen to mr prezes , i can image several pis politicians fighting over who represent a true inheritance of his ideas . 
  gon na be fun . 
  i doubt it , sikorsky belongs to lockheed martin and apache is a boeing product . 
  ca n't wait to see lw\u00f3w / lviv under the same flag :d seriously , visiting this city without waiting on border would be nice ( plus city need some painting ), 
  no chance for poland with pis , those guys are economic ignorants and massive budget spenders . 
  anyway good luck romania , maybe it 's their time to shine . 
  i 'm reading local newspaper ( article about idea to built it also in [ rzesz\u00f3w ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rzesz%c3%b3w ) ) and it is described as a `` material '' using a luminescence , so i guess it is not simply a paint , but whole material . 
  that 's make a point , paint will quite quickly grind off . 
  oh , we have a `` hag summer '' too ( babie lato ) , but it refers more strictly to time when spiders webs are flying in air . 
  i love this season , `` the golden autumn '' . 
  by the way , so you also have a name for it ? 
  well said . 
  or we should try made current education system more effective . 
  so far eurocrats arenot messing with polish constitution , pis thinks that having 50 + in parlament makes kaczy\u0144ski a caesar and tribune of the plebs in the same time . 
  barely got a half of parliament , that 's quite far from getting 2/3 to change constitution , and trying to loophole constitution is not democratic , no matter how do you spin it . 
  sometimes politician are pushing some crappy idea or eu monies , like airport , and then it just stay useless . 
  like airfield in polish city [ radom ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/radom_airport ) . 
  from polish perspective , i think most people will not oppose ko\u015bciuszko being a hero for belarusians , after all , he was from that area and fought for peasants too . 
  anyway a bunch of nobility had ruthenian/lithuanian heritage and were self-polonized , so drawing a a clear line who was who from xx century perspective is pointless to begin with . 
  you know , mickiewicz case . 
  well , i have never checked this before , but it looks lithuanian army did not make it in time . 
  well , i still assume in some units , who were recruiting/hiring volunteers lithuanian were present . 
  [ looks like this guy was there ] ( https://lt.wikipedia.org/wiki/juozapas_boguslavas_slu%c5%a1ka ) , but i 'm not sure it is enough . 
  [ history of belarus in 5 minutes ( with english subtitles ) ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxlagbg9qkm ) i think this may be a example ? 
  i do n't see what to argue about with simple presentation of border changes ... so i 'm going to boast in vienna battle thread . 
  by the way , it was a commonwealth of both nation victory , so you can join party too , 
  poland was in strong alliance with napoleon , and we wish it . 
  we even have him in our anthem . 
  [ here you go ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5fszao1llfy ) , but not in the best quality and this battle : [ siege of jasna g\u00f3ra ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/siege_of_jasna_g%c3%b3ra ) , depicted in movie , is quite well known , jasna g\u00f3ra is one of the most known , or simply the most , virgin mary sanctuary and one of the country 's places of pilgrimage . 
   you seem to treat mistakes from pragmatic point of view , while i just want to point out what you already know is true : that poland was acting based on its interest as oppossed to high moral standards . 
  yes and no . 
  i indeed look at it from a pragmatic point too , but from pragmatic point of view , as said by machiavelli , enemy have to be destroyed or tolerated , bur not harassed , from the other hand i 'm surely not pragmatic to that extent , that could allow me to pick up `` destroyed '' option . 
  i rather do not simply join `` polish did nothing wrong '' or `` poland was imperialistic bad country '' narrative , but , depends on individual case , argue with both , and for both moral/pragmatic reasons . 
  so these days i notices indeed ii rp is a bit mythologised as wonderful country ... 
   on several occassions silesians wanted to join germany or become autonomous . 
  when ? 
  silesians as a separate nation is some xx creation with no big popularity , so i guess you are referring to germans living there before war ? 
  and they autonomy before war . 
  so poland could not break wilson 's right of nations ' self-determination because there were no such nation . 
   i did write ` pre - and post-war ' . 
  when did poland expelled jews before war ? 
  about vilnus , after studying conflict , it became pretty obvious , that giving it to lithuanians would have the same point as giving constantinople back to greece , i mean none . 
  also , unlike lviv case , city was n't separated from poland by vast areas inhibited by lithuanian majority , but polish/belarusians . 
  i like to read about mistakes made by poland , unfortunately pretty often it simply mirroring a `` poland did nothing wrong '' by presenting everything told as wrong as told , without checking . 
   establishing puppet government in lithuania , it was understandable way to help local population again anti-polish nationalistic lithuanian goverment . 
   meddling with eastern border , we should not simply left eastern neighbours without even autonomy , fair point  suppressing silesians , could you explain what do you mean ? 
   acting against czechs closing their schools was bad , taking zaolzie was bad , but quite understandable from prewar perspective , we could play this better though . 
   and slovaks , true , for dream of common border hungary we only got a few villages and whole country and south border completely opened for germans  expelling germans without measure , you mean after war ?

  yup , kod marches have lots of eu flags along with polish ones and they are pro-eu . 
  do n't forget masons and gays . 
  but the funny thing is - pis is n't even extreme right-wing  they are socialists with conservative social views . 
  nobody in kod wants that . 
  unconfirmed ! = exaggerated, 
  kod - po has in poland the same relationship as catholic church - pis . 
  they support each other but it 's not fair to say one = the other . 
  yes . 
  also anti-terrorist act that restricts civil liberties , and stricter regulations on farming land and forests trade . 
  also libel laws for historians . 
  basically against everything pis does , 
  according to socialist conservative pis and their supporters - they are right-wing , and everybody who opose them are `` leftist '' . 
  just a quirk of polish political scene , i reccomend to substitute meaningless labels for left and right anyway ( for example `` blue '' and `` orange '' ) - it makes for less biases and misconceeptions . 
  numbers not confirmed , like all the manifestations ever . 
  still obviously a huge manifestation , bigger than the previous ones . 
  your point ? 
  timothy snyder deserves to at least be heard , he is one of the best western writers on c&e european history ( bloodlands , and reconstruction of nations are great books , possibly the best on that subject ) . 
  let 's all vote on brexit then , 
  my point was n't - `` they are evil because they are like a virus '' . 
  my point was `` here 's the evolutionary reason why they are doing these evil things '' . 
  and ostracism towards innocent people ( kgbt for example ) is clearly evil . 
   having more kids is a natural state of living organisms it 's not . 
  there are many reproductive strategies , from `` spray and pray '' , to `` have few kids but reduce risks for them '' . 
  some species eat their kids when they have too many . 
  and anyway `` natural '' ! = `` good '' , and `` unnatural '' ! = `` evil '' . 
  it 's natural for some spiders to eat their mates . 
  male cats have spikes on their penis because strong pain induces ovulation in female cats . 
  is it good ? 
  it 's certainly natural . 
  it 's natural for aids and malaria to kill people . 
  it 's natural for sick people to die . 
  so - why is being `` natural '' even an argument when it comes to morality ? 
  i 'm pretty sure if spain left eu eu would support independence for catalonia too . 
  religions are like viruses - they need hosts to survive . 
  so the ones that encourage more kids ( and more strict religious upgringing to prevent `` curing '' ) are more succesfull in the long run . 
  so - most discourage anticonception and homosexualism . 
  good luck hungarians . 
  these are the only 2 posible outcomes . 
  well , it 's `` flowery-one '' . 
  maybe flowers appear later in czech republic , 
  yeah , and that 's all fault of current government , which has like 30 % support right now ( despite unporecedented level of social spending ) , and just 2.5 more years to go . 
  let 's just imagine they are our mistake . 
  every country has right to their bush or trump . 
  what all this has to do with polish-usa relations , though ? 
  po ( previous , very pro-eu government ) had good relations with usa as well , and even postcommunists from sld did ( to the point of letting them put cia prison in poland :( ) . 
  usa in poland is seen as ( sometimes quirky , but still useful ) world policeman . 
  i 'm actually very anti-pis , never voted them , protested on the streets against them , and i still think highly of americans . 
  so i wonder - why do you think all these facts are related ? 
   you can check the trust ratings of other countries towards the us . 
  they have pretty good reputation in poland . 
   ( quebec and mexico ) are generally thousands of miles away . 
  i thought they have this melting pot going on ? 
  pis making idiots out of themselves ( and poland as a side effect ) - part 103 . 
  so , i should care for people terrorists wants me to care about that i would n't care for otherways because terrorism is fucked up ? 
  i think your logic is weird . 
  the main difference is - russia just 20 years ago conquered the country and gave away the power there to a corrupt friend of putin with terrorist past . 
  that 's a long shot from your hypothetical situation . 
   he 's saying earth would be warming up regardless of human activity , and that the effect of man-caused co2 emissions on climate is minimal . 
  and he 's wrong . 
  in unrelated news cigarette producer says smoking is actually healthy . 
  * some, 
  pink is female , blue is male . 
  it 's funny because the biggest pink area in poland is rural lublin region . 
  can confirm - lublin 's full of single women , 
   the influence of communists on the modern elite of poland the last time actual communists had any influence on poland was in 2003 when sld was in power . 
  i guess you could mean singular guys totally dependent on pis or po , like piotrowicz or przy\u0142\u0119bski but they have no influence whatsoever . 
  i 'm all for letting them go , but to claim some post-communist conspiracy is just dumb , it 's the post-solidarity politicians that rule poland , and they fuck things up on their own . 
  as for elections - i 'm quite sure pis will mess with the electoral law to win them . 
  and nobody can stop them because they dismantled constutitional tribunal . 
   already think that democracy in poland is really endangered but it fucking is , that 's the point . 
  constutitional court is paralised , the institution that 's supposed to control neutrality of public media is owned by government party , general persecutor is pis member , in media there 's campaign against independent judical system so that pis may nominate their own judges for the krs . 
  kaczy\u0144ski is not dictator , but he 's slowly turning poland into authoritharian country . 
  the whole idea of one guy keeping all legislative and executive power without any responsibility is already a problem , and then add all the thing they make to also own media and courts . 
  by `` half '' you mean less than 10 % , 
   if i had a dirt on my shirt , i would n't run around , showing people , how nasty it is . 
  if you had 30 % of your country destroying it for the rest would you complain ? 
  public tv recently canceled already confirmed invite for opposition member szczerba for tv debate because ( quote from their sms ) `` pis bureau decided they wo n't participate with debate with you so you 're not invited '' . 
  this is public tv , paid by taxes . 
  and government decides who can be invited to it ... current pis is much worse than any of the government we had last 25 years when it comes to media freedom . 
  another example - tvp rarely invites anybody from opposition . 
  comparison from one show red - government , green - opposition , left - before pis ( when they claimed it was extremely biased ) , right - after pis ( when they claim it 's `` true pluralism '' ) . 
  http://x3.wykop.pl/cdn/c3201142/comment_jm89xilk9ciurkfemcmz6ppagc3kkrii.jpg below is a table with all political shows from tvp , polsat , tvn , and tvp before pis . 
  rz\u0105d-opozycja = government - opposition , rz\u0105d - reszta = government - the rest . 
  net loss to germany , net profit to poland . 
  spiegel 's got nothing on tvp since that guy 's party got power . 
  i have n't seen such obvious propaganda in poland since 1989 . 
  and waszczykowski is just stupid . 
  he invited venice commision to poland to prove that there were no detoriation of civil rights and the rule of law , and when the commision said there were - he first said the opinion was in fact favourable , and later when it was obvious it 's not - he accused the commision of being `` leftist '' and biased . 
  he recently said the he has `` expertises '' saying the elections of donald tusk as the head of the european parliament were `` falsified '' , but have n't specified what he meant till this day . 
  before these elections he insisted poland is n't isolated in eu and they have allies . 
  after the elections his government lost 1-27 he said it proves eu is not democratic . 
  in the meantime the `` allies '' he meant ( orban ) said he wrote a letter to polish pm that he wo n't vote against tusk . 
  but neither pm nor waszczykowski said anything about this letter . 
  they instead said most of the 27 countries were forced by germany to vote tusk . 
  and the list goes on and on . 
  when he was a diplomat in iran he started initiative for polish embassy to be a proxy between american and iranian diplomats . 
  he did n't informed polish government , nor american government about it , just went to iranian embassy directly . 
  there was a scandal . 
  he accused tusk in one interview of `` being responsible for refuge crisis and brexit '' , `` not doing anything for poland '' , and that `` his possition is strictly representative , he ca n't do anything , so we do n't need to vote him '' . 
  oh , by the way - his party put former pis member kurski as head of public media and he immediately fired lots of journalists and demanded that the media present `` government pov '' .

  it 's getting more and more pathetic . 
  more likely germany elected himself . 
  according to google translate both means the same, 
  i mentioned this before you commented . 
  biega\u0107 does n't mean `` to flee '' uciec means that . 
  go to google translate : more precisely it should be : b\u0117gti / b\u0113gt / \u0431\u0435\u0436\u0430\u0442\u044c / uciec, 
   b\u0113gt / \u0431\u0435\u0433\u0430\u0442\u044c those are basically the same words related to east slavic , more than to anything . 
  and if you are doing shitstorm and manipulation over one word , then i must quit is discussion very fast . 
   my comment : what east slavic languages have the word `` b\u0113gt '' ? 
  your answer : russian `` bezhat '' latvian `` b\u0113gt '' lithuanian `` b\u0117gti '' polish `` uciec '' czech `` uprchnout '' all of those words mean `` to flee '' are you a funny manipulator do n't you ? 
   latvian and lithuanian are n't east slavic languages . 
  you should educate yourself . 
  and then is my response :  ** who said that ? 
  ** latvian and lithuanian are part of baltoslavic branch , which consists of all slavic languages and baltic . 
  once again . . who said that latvian and lithuanian are east slavic ? 
  i provided you a link explaining you that they are balto-slavic , which have similarities with east slavic , as you could see in the example i wrote . 
  before you will start manipulating once more , start to read properly . 
  thank you !, 
  wtf ? 
  what are you even trying to convince me to ? 
  ca n't you get simple facts , which i provided you in wikipedia , instead you are giving me graphic from the same link ? 
  seriously . 
  not only you ca n't read , but also you are giving me link about the same , while saying something different . 
  once more : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/balto-slavic_languages do you really read what you write ? 
  do you really think when reading ? 
  ca n't you read what i wrote ? 
  seriously . 
  once more : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/balto-slavic_languages, 
  thanks for corretion , 
   latvian and lithuanian are n't east slavic languages . 
  you should educate yourself . 
  who said that ? 
  latvian and lithuanian are part of baltoslavic branch , which consists of all slavic languages and baltic . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/balto-slavic_languages as you see . 
  they are similar to east-slavic languages i 'll remind you once more : russian `` bezhat '' latvian `` b\u0113gt '' lithuanian `` b\u0117gti '' polish `` uciec '', 
  you 're wrong . 
  to flee `` uprchnout '' - czech `` uciec '' - polish, 
   it 's probably same in all slavic languages . 
  russian `` bezhat '' latvian `` b\u0113gt '' lithuanian `` b\u0117gti '' polish `` uciec '' czech `` uprchnout '' all of those words mean `` to flee '', 
  in polish it 's uchod\u017aca for refugee . 
  however uciekinier is for deserter , from uciekanie `` fleeing '' , the word deserter have negative meaning but `` fleeing from war '' is often used for refugees and it has no negative meaning . 
  i think `` b\u0113gt / \u0431\u0435\u0433\u0430\u0442\u044c '' is more common for east slavic languages . 
   `` b\u0113gt '' - to flee in polish `` biega\u0107 '' - to run . 
  interesting similarity . 
  ssa\u0107 in polish means `` to suck '' ssak - `` someone/something who suck '', 
  well apparently we have the easiest word for that . 
  ssak it . 
  you 're too late there was nothing there from 2 hours . 
  my grandfather died in auschwitz , he fell out of a tower . 
  passing right into both of your towers . 
  there is like 3000 km from perth to singapore . 
   australia is possibly the worst country in the world to live in if you want to travel and explore new zealand , japan , singapore , bali , thailand , china . 
  indeed worst ... 
  i was joking, 
  but it apparently does n't have a good chocolate and guns . 
  australia is much better . 
  they have more sane laws . 
  more freedom , more radical immigration policy ( which is good ) and good climate . 
  living in australia you can travel to many exotic places and live in a very developed country . 
  and it 's also cheaper . 
   there is no country good enough to live in in europe we both have different definitions of live . 
  for ones vegetation is enough , others want to travel explore , and having 100 % happiness from life . 
  no european country yet provides that . 
  australia above all !, 
  did you ever been outside of europe ? 
   what do you think is the best european country to live in ? 
  australia , there is no european country enough good to live in . 
  but if we talk about only european countries it might be iceland - quiet , safe , without stupid laws and bureaucracy and with strong economic recovery . 
  til according to your logic alexander the great was macedonian . 
   and even lviv/lw \u00f3w was n't 90 % polish yes , it was for 90 % of time from it 's foundation with a large jewish minority . 
   while great duchy of lithuania conquered other southern ruthenian principalities ( 14th century ) . 
  well , not grand duchy of lithuania was made after mongol invasion destroyed kievan rus , which gave the opportunity for random duchies to unify to rebuild the structures of a statehood . 
  that 's why they created grand duchy , which was made of several smaller duchies . 
   most of this lands were inhabited by poles yes , such cities like lw\u00f3w , kij\u00f3w were 90 % polish . 
  even the smaller towns and villages which were properties of a nobility had mostly polish-speaking population . 
  i 'm talking about all lands that are now in ukraine . 
  even those who are ukrainian since 1945 . 
  sure , but i 'm a fan of history ;p, 
  i think there was never such thing as ukraine before and it 's name delivers from polish name of borderlands . 
  i think the word `` occupation '' is pure nonsense , poland never invaded ukraine , because it did n't exist and most of this lands were inhabited by poles . 
  when poland was strong , germans was too scared to attack and poland was not interested in conquering them . 
  when poland was weak germans suddenly had an opportunity to grab our land . 
  i see a pattern here . 
  deluge was part of great northern war , which was disasterous for sweden . 
  sweden officially surrendered and promised to give back all stolen things . 
  but they did n't . 
  i always thought wings gave them more stability when charging . 
  dude , he 's right . 
  swedes not only fought against regular armies , but burned , slaughtered entire cities , robbed all valuable things , gold , arts , etc. 
  it 's estimated that 30 % of poland died as a result of swedish invasion . 
  poles won and sweden was destroyed economically and military , but the results overall were tragic . 
  today , many of polish things are in swedish museums . 
  interestingly all of those battles except vienna were fought in modern day ukraine . 
   tartars were muslim [ did n't know the dental plaques believed in allah . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/calculus_%28dental%29 ), 
  yes , finally an article unrelated to islamic immigrants . 
  my upvote . 
   nobility in commonwealth was about 10 % of population , highest percentage in europe , comparable only to spain still a marginal portion of a majority of population . 
  and the nobility lived in all parts of the commonwealth , not in one place as you suggest . 
   big cities had higher percentage of nobility than countryside true , but many nobles had their mansions and their private villages far away from big cities .

  read again , that is not even remotely what i implied . 
  yeah they piss me off to no end . . the simple fact that those nutjobs are even allowed to stay in front of the bundestag with their megaphones and silly posters , with thousands of tourists seeing them every day just shows how they are plain wrong . 
  a pdf with some more info : http://ec.europa.eu/regional_policy/sources/docgener/evaluation/pdf/expost2013/wp1_synthesis_factsheet_en.pdf, 
  80 % of my friends and family are on telegram . 
  works well if the other app has good arguments . 
  i know . 
  i mentioned them as `` no significant role '' because some of their drama in the refugee crisis was in the media quite prominently and thus could have had a liiittle influence . 
  it 's a spectrum , do n't think so binary . 
  if you want to add more parties to the cdu ( center-right ) and afd ( far-right ) , you can add the csu ( bavarian-right ) or the npd ( extreme-right ) , both of which played no significant role in this election . 
  german mainstream media i read today said the same . 
  more than 6 % surplus seriously affects stability and is bad for the eurozone . 
  it also states that most of the demand comes from other eu countries . 
  so it 's not being sweeped under the rug . 
  i agree with you on the armchair economists though :d, 
  - the initial plan of abolishing roaming fees in spring 2017 left open possible limitations - the eu commission today made a proposal on how such limitations may look like - according to the commission , eu citizens who are abroad will only be able to use their phones without extra charge for a total of 90 days - after 30 days , the phone operator should be allowed to ask the costumer to join the local net again - flatrate costumers should be allowed to use their average consumption - these limitations are in place to avoid that people can get cheaper phone contracts from other eu states and permanently live with them in their home country . 
  -- personally , i think this is a bad move and that the problem they seek to address with it can be solved differently , for instance by requiring a physical address ( residence ) in the country where you get the contract in for example . 
  ( edit : maybe not so good , see below ) if you have friends all over the continent , or live abroad , we should be able to freely contact them with our standard contracts in the area of the common market no matter where we currently are . 
  our constitution can be changed , most of it . 
  some basics must remain the same though ( like federalism , also art . 
  1 and art . 
  it needs 2/3 of votes in both chambers for a change . 
  just because you have a sense of global or european identity does n't mean that you loose your uk / cornwall / regional / village / family identity . 
  would you not agree ? 
  we should ban assault camels first , everyone has a constitutional right for camels . 
  well she is right though : `` the phenomenon of islamist terrorism , of is , is not a phenomenon that came to us with the refugees '' . 
  - it is a phenomenon that was here , or would be here no matter what . 
  800 germans went to syria for isis before the refugee crisis even started . 
   `` we have said clearly that an islam that works and lives on the basis of the constitution ... belongs to germany , '' merkel said . 
   she added that a type of islam that did not stick to the constitution or accept equal rights for women had no place in the country . 
  this is why i hate cellar bars and clubs . 
  went to prag the other month and it was full of basement clubs and bars that only had one exit . 
  does n't feel comfortable at all . 
  ( german media reported it was a cellar bar ) . 
  yes . 
  as a welcome , you get discount on sand castle railway and have the right of beach towel placement 3 hours before actually taking the spot . 
  special offer : two-hour slot in left lane of autobahn with your caravan if you pay your taxes on time . 
  yes . 
  you get your swamp id soon . 
  the funny part is that you did n't include a source for this statement . 
  aha , so you heard that ? 
  if this is not local news , i do n't know what is . 
   a doctor had been shot at and the gunman ( * a patient * ) had killed himself . 
  you know in a german thread there was a guy listing all knife attacks in the past days , i think it was like one knife attack every two days committed by ( in your terms ) `` normal '' people . 
  and no , it was not a machete , it was a knife used for kebab from the shop . 
  any large group of people will have some individuals that commit crime and unfortunately that will include men that kill women . 
  most of those stories will hardly get any coverage . 
  so the fact that this has gained ** a lot ** of traction in germany - does n't it mean we are in fact , not in denial ? 
  but what it turned out to be , a relationship drama , a crime of passion , then that 's what it is and that is what it will be called . 
   `` ca n't be sure it 's muslims '' ... when was the last time you saw a white person do this in europe ? 
  with `` this '' i assumed you meant mass-shootings , not screaming allahu ackbar or `` god wants it '' . 
  also the allahu ackbar thing is unconfirmed by police . 
  apparently the `` allahu ackbar '' was screamed by someone else and was in fact `` alle runter '' which means ` everybody get down ' . 
  apparently the `` allahu ackbar '' was screamed by someone else and was in fact `` alle runter '' which means ` everybody get down ' .

   it 's only speculation ... 
  yes , which is why it 's not being talked about at a press conference . 
  this is directly from the police press conference live stream . 
  that is such a retarded statement . 
  it 's as pointless as saying `` if you were never born you would n't have made this post ! '', 
  his mother was german . 
  new press-conference , i just tuned in so missed some things . 
  here is all i got from it : - 18year old still went to school - glock 17 , where it came from will be invesitgated - he had ~ 300 rounds , amount of shots fired and shooter skill unclear - he did not have a gun license - no indication about relation to wurzburg attacks - possible winnenden ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/winnenden_school_shooting ) glorification , there was intensive material found on former rampages , lots of media from his computer will be investigated - possible psychological condition , he was in treatment - attacker had one brother , him and his parents lived with the perpetrator - all relatives of victimes notified - victims mostly young , 14 - 21 , one woman of 45 ( inaudible ) - deaths happened inside & outside mcdonalds and in the mall . 
  - about allahu-ackbar : there are no hints pointing at connection to islam , everything * right now * points at rampage , not is . 
  - gsg9 was requested according to plan ( terror ) by police . 
  they were used for clearing the suspect 's flat and were ready to respond to further gunmen - nationalities of victims unclear , not sure if he aimed for specific people ( except young ), 
  no , it 's most likely related to w\u00fcrzburg attacks that had people from hong kong injured . 
  continued : ** q&a ** reporter : `` stacchus situation ? '', 
   chief : `` according to reports , there were shots , but as in all other cases , these claims were unsubstantiated '' reporter : `` you said 18-year old german-iranian from munich , can you tell me about him and also about the firefight with police ? '', 
   chief : `` we are at the beginning , until we are not sure about security we could not conduct crime scene investigations . 
  it began at the fast-food restaurant , moved over to the mall and then the perpetrator fled . 
  in this time he had contact with officers in officers in plain clothes on patrol who engaged him . 
  but we have to check all of this before we can make sure what exactly happened . '', 
  reporter : `` can you tell me more about the person ? 
  has he been living there for longer ''  chief : `` yes ! '', 
  reporter : `` can you elaborate on this ? 
  how long ? 
  more than two years ? '', 
   chief : `` yes '' . 
  reporter : inaudible ; talking about video of the parking lot . 
   chief : i ca n't confirm any of this at the moment . 
  reporter : was this person known to police ? 
   chief : no , he was not . 
  reporter : can you talk about the gun and how he did it ? 
   chief : he started in the fast-food restaurant , went outside to the mall ( see explanation above ) . 
  reporter : statement on islamist ties , motives ? 
   chief : needs to be subject to investigations of course , no hints at this point . 
  reporter : type of firearm ? 
   chief : apparently a pistol , rest is up to investigation . 
  reporter : family ? 
   chief : unknown at this point . 
  reporter : so the long-weapon theory was wrong ? 
   chief : we have absolutely no indications about long weapons . 
  reporter : what about the back-back ? 
   chief : found that , but no rifle inside . 
  reporter : bombs ? 
   chief : no . 
  reporter : ammo on him , given the amount of deaths ? 
   chief : well there are firearms with larger magazines , but theoretically he can reload of course , we will have to see how often he fired , how many shells were ejected , then we know more . 
  reporter : reports about [ inaudible ] car  chief : there was a car in the beginning that left the scene with high speed . 
  they were completely unrelated to the case , as much as all other reports .

   many people that are coming to europe right now are also not authentic refugees  they 're just economic migrants , many probably pushed by war there but definitely not eligible for gaining a refugee status . 
   1 million ukrainian refugees in accordance with the dominant politically correct narrative within the west that conflates refugees with immigrants . 
   if greece does not wish to be part of this solution ( ... ) then we 'll have to discuss with the bulgarians and macedonians '' said szijjarto . 
  oh they want to build a fence on the bulgarian and macedonian borders with greece ? 
  just wait until they start crossing into romania on a boat from turkey via the black sea . 
  free market and capitalism !, 
  well , he was georgian ... 
  then we 'll tax the shit out of german banks and corporations operating in poland , how about that ? 
  let polish companies rise up and take their place . 
  it 's too bad czechs do n't like poles as much as poles like czechs . 
  you really think we can form a single country with ukrainians ? 
  remember what happened last time ? 
  it would be nice if it could happen ; we 'd have a larger population than france and similar to germany , and we 'd have a powerful military-industrial complex . 
  but it would be like forcing cats and dogs to live together . 
   there are no meaningful left wing media in poland . 
  thank god for that ; the last thing we need is new leftism in poland so they can start turning the country into the volatile multikulti mixture that exists in the rich west . 
  that 's what 350 years under the russian boot does to a country . 
  the eu was never about unity . 
  originally it was about containing the franco-german competition , then it was about containing a reunified germany , and now it 's about serving rich eu economies ' interests . 
  german elites would like poland to experience the wonders of multiculturalism too , and for that an amenable government and media is necessary in order to propagate new left ideologies and self-flagellating attitudes to leave society meek and impotent . 
  it 's just some `` brotherly help '' . 
  absolutely haram . 
  resistance is futile , you will be polonized . 
  seems like he went to london expecting it to be an english city when it 's actually not anymore . 
  i would be down for a game of civ v. 
  no one picks on eesti-chan and gets away with it , right ? 
  it 's because having kids is too expensive and gets in the ways of careers . 
  another way to ramp up the pressure . 
  poland just finished its lng terminal and can use it to supplant russian gas in central europe . 
  blockading the baltic would stop lng shipments to poland . 
  poland has nsm anti-ship missiles stationed on its coast . 
  in case of hostility , russia would have to say goodbye to a huge chunk of its baltic fleet . 
  lmao they would never buy from poland , out of spite if not anything else . 
  [ the two safest countries in the world are also some of the most homogenous ... ] ( http://www.oecdbetterlifeindex.org/topics/safety/ ), 
  everyone east of the oder-niesse is a second-rate european . 
  [ alarming intensifies ], 
  i think a show that 's like game of thrones , but set in the polish-lithuanian commonwealth would be pretty cool . 
  there would be a lot of political intrigue between powerful magnate and noble families , from poland , lithuania and ruthenia , plus characters and envoys from neighboring countries . 
  too poor for clean energy , gib moni pls . 
  the other german dude got the joke ; clearly you did not . . you did start to sound a bit defensive there though ... 
  asean has more people than the eu and that gap will widen by a lot . 
  if the west continues to hand out its technological advantage in return for short term financial gain , we 'll end up in a situation where we are outnumbered and without the tech advantage . 
  yeah instead we 'll have a franco-turkish-japanese-german vs polish bloc and america war ... 
   in macedonia alexander the great kek, 
  that 's some half-life 2 shit right there . 
  same , i wash them by hand . 
  wan na take bets for how long till they jump to germany ? 
  a feminist converting to islam is like a chicken converting to kfc . 
  makes sense , reddit is an english-language and american website . 
  we need to fuse saiyan-style with ukraine for that to happen . 
  poland , turkey and japan : fucking russia up from three sides ... 
  but you better stay out of se europe . 
  friedman 's predictions slowly coming true ? ... 
  it 's because finland put its airspace so close to russia ; maybe you could move it a bit to make them feel better . 
  2 million poles moved out since we joined the eu in 2004 . 
  ** 2 million ** that 's 5 % of the population . 
  and more want to leave . 
  meanwhile , because we 're in schengen , it 's more difficult for us to have a liberal visa regime with ukraine , belarus and russia . 
   it is on us to accept them . 
  yes , ** however ** that is on the condition that they integrate themselves into our culture . 
  so if you want to move to and live in poland , you can be accepted as long as you become polish . 
  how can a person expect to move to a different society and be accepted as one of them if they do n't align themselves with that society 's traits and beliefs ? 
  really , if you do that , you 're imposing your culture and beliefs on the host society ; how can you expect them to like that ? 
  a lot of these people coming into europe are coming here not to live as europeans and become part of our cultural sphere , but to access a higher standard of living . 
  that 's it . 
  they do n't love europe for its values or culture ; they love europe for its advanced economy . 
  many of them downright dislike , or even hate our culture , but the quality of life is just too good to give up in order to live somewhere where the people share your values . 
  careful , that 's not kosher thinking . 
  more visible political , military and economic cooperation , plus an emphasis on historically good polish-romanian ties in the media and schools . 
  for example , poland and romania had a military alliance in the interwar period , and they actually offered to help , unlike * cough * some allies . 
  how is that racist ? 
  poland and romania are growing incessantly . 
  both countries are projected to maintain solid growth rates of more than 3 % for the next several years . 
  when a man has money , he can provide stability and receives love ... 
  no , they just find our security concerns a matter of secondary importance . 
  their distance to russia allows them to be more complacent , at our expense . 
  now just waiting on slovakia so we can into visegrad galactic empire . 
  #prayfordiesel #policedoghero #dogheaven #peoplewhousetoomanyhashtags #onlineactivismdoesntdoanything, 
  i just think they do n't want the demographics of their country changed permanently , especially when it 's kind of forced by outside forces . 
  it would show polish troops if it was about the battle of daugavpils , which it is n't . 
  it 's about the latvian riflemen who served as part of the russian imperial army and fought against the germany army during ww1 . 
  on a side-note , it would be pretty damn cool if there was a joint polish-latvian production about the battle of daugavpils . 
  he 's probably in germany . 
  poland can accept western european refugees . 
  true . 
  in that case we were n't enemies though ; just france being an unreliable ally . 
  poland and france have always found themselves on the same side in every war they were both in , so we have a good history there . 
  i feel like le pen just got handed the presidency . 
  [ meanwhile , poland and romania grow ... ] ( http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/11/13/centraleurope-economy-gdp-idusl8n1382jk20151113 ), 
  so many to choose from , depending on what you like . 
  for historical fiction , check out sienkiewicz 's trilogy , the teutonic knights or quo vadis . 
  fantasy , sapkowski 's witcher series or dukaj 's l\u00f3d . 
  for science fiction , stanislaw lem 's solaris or his master 's voice . 
  those are just the ones i really like . 
  other great books include prus ' s the doll , \u017beromski 's coming spring , reymont 's the peasants , and more . 
  the baltic sea is a guy taking a piss . 
  if turkey got into the eu , then the eu would have land borders with syria , iraq , [ isis ] , and iran . 
  no wonder russia wants a piece of that . 
  germany should never again have control of that region . 
  it would completely undermine poland 's defense westward .

   i think kaczy\u0144ski had a cabinet of ministers picked the next day if i were our government caught on tape , i 'd say he 's been probably tending to his boner from the moment he saw that microscopic possibility of taking power . 
  ^ could n't ^ help ^ it . 
  ^ really ^ very ^ sorry . 
  make no mistake , miller and palikot would like too ... ^ i 'll ^ show ^ myself ^ out ... 
   the abw thugs instantly raiding the magazine 's offices . 
  well , under our law , recording people in private without their knowledge nor consent * is * criminal . 
  but , by the same law , journalists are bound to protect anonymity of their sources , so probably they could obtain a court order before they raided wprost 's office . 
   no law actively prohibits what they were * doing . 
  * did i miss something ? 
  they were just * talking * . 
  considering various options . 
  and last year there was n't a pole who would n't want rostowski kicked out for all his deeds , so the ones who now feign outrage are giant hypocrites . 
  if anything , i think that those tapes may eventually work for their benefit . 
  as ridiculous as it sounds , i think many people may actually realize that they 're not as meek and blind as it appears . 
  some strong opinions , something they really believe in and get worked up about ? 
  that 's good . 
  they want something for us at the expense of another country ? 
  well , i 'm afraid that 's realpolitik for you . 
  we * hired * them to take care of * our * business . 
  i 'm all for being nice and making friends with other countries , but we must be realistic . 
  i think the part with the blow job was spot-on if crude . 
  they actually made multiple accurate points that most people would agree with , but i 'm afraid many wo n't be able to see past profanities , and then there is pis and all of its spin-offs . 
  they 're making a show of monstrous outrage based on cringeworthy form and implying that 's also the case with the content . 
  of course the language was appaling but , * hey * , i 'm no saint . 
  thank god nobody eavesdrops political disputes in my house ... and for the record , i 'm not a fan of our government by any stretch , i did n't vote for them , but after hearing those i might just be a fan of sikorski . 
  lol . 
  by the way , my favorite parts , sans expletives , were sikorski saying that kaczy\u0144ski * welded * himself to macierewicz , and rostowski calling danuta h\u00fcbner an * old commie * , for which he publicly apologized to her and she replied she 's not offended by the * commie * but she wo n't comment on the rest ... , 
   we call it ue same here . 
  * hahaa * :d we had this running joke in high school : what are your first words while in germany ? 
  * the teacher , german himself , facepalmed . 
  we also had french classes , i was * sooo * excited that one day someone 's gon na * parlez-vous francais ? 
  * me and i 'll be able to respond with my impeccable french ... [ * dreamy eyes * ] but that quickly turned into * je ne comprends pas * ... 
  i still love french music , though . 
  aznavour performed in warsaw yesterday , i 'm told he still * has it * !, 
  become a mime and play charades . 
  lalala la la. . . * my german german teacher would be proud , i bet . 
  * i think , i 'm good . 
  * yep . 
  *** \u0142 **** aska * - grace/mercy/favor *** l **** aska * - walking stick/cane/blow job/or a really attractive girl ... in this context it 's unequivocal . 
  another way to say this is * zrobi\u0107 loda * ... [ * l\u00f3d * - ice cream ] btw . 
  that 's why we laugh our asses off when we hear czechs speaking , * l\u00e1ska * in czech means love  edit : and on a side note , * zrobi\u0107 komu\u015b \u0142ask\u0119 * has a rather pejorative meaning . 
   i visited hern\u00e1di [ zsolt , president and ceo of hungarian state petrochemical company mol , currently tried in croatia ... ] this is precious . 
  did n't know that !, 
  well , looks like he 's won in that ` do n't take yourself too seriously ' thing . 
  ** edit : ** did some research , waldorff 's dog was * puzon * [ trombone ] , not * fagot * [ bassoon ] . 
  for the interested : [ jerzy waldorff ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jerzy_waldorff ) was a highly respected music critic and author . 
  happened to be also gay , an aristocrat and an interesting figure in interesting times . 
   waldorff put on paper and elaborated the unwritten memoir of his own friend , the polish eminent pianist w\u0142adys\u0142aw szpilman , titled death of the city ( \u015amier\u0107 miasta ) , first published in 1946 . 
  szpilman , you know , the guy from [ * the pianist * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_pianist_%282002_film%29 ) . 
  we do n't want them any * more * sadistic , believe me ... 
  fun fact : * fagot * is polish for bassoon ... 
  i did n't know the word bassoon once while talking about music so i told them about faggots ... 
  a 16yo with some serious self-esteem issues at that . 
  hang them all * because * we care . 
  ftfy , 
  by that he meant `` not the best relations '' with our neighbor , not that they 're gon na invade us , come on ... he 's the one who said that he fears germany 's inactivity more that its power , that germany is what powers europe today . 
  he 's far from being paranoid . 
  and frankly , knowing that he 's disillusioned about our relationship with the us is somewhat comforting . 
  people have been accusing him of being americans ' pawn and * blind * for quite some time now . 
  wiki to the rescue ( coz i 'm lazy ) :  these names literally mean `` bird 's milk '' or crop milk , a substance somewhat resembling milk , produced by certain birds to feed their young . 
  however , this is not origin of the name ; rather , ptasie mleczko is also a polish idiom meaning ** `` an unobtainable delicacy '' ** ( compare english : `` hen 's teeth '' ; also , a similar idiom can be found in bulgarian -- \u0442\u0443\u043a / \u0442\u0430\u043c \u0438 \u043e\u0442 \u043f\u0438\u043b\u0435 \u043c\u043b\u044f\u043a\u043e \u0438\u043c\u0430 , meaning `` even bird milk can be found here/there '' ) . 
   in poland , jan wedel , owner of the e. wedel company , developed the first ptasie mleczko in 1936 . 
  [ 3 ] wedel 's inspiration for the name of the confectionery came from his voyages to france , when he asked himself : `` what could bring greater happiness to a man who already has everything ? '', 
  then he thought : ** `` maybe only bird milk . '' ** . 
  hah ;d i love it when i open a thread with the intention to write a particular thing and there it is already , verbatim . 
  cheers !, 
   law and order lol :d i think you meant * law and justice *, 
   never used foreign towels i just went to see where my towels are from ... some say * kronborg of denmark * [ made in indonesia ... ] and the rest is * made in belgium * . 
  holy hell ... can not into domestic towels .

  got probably a little overexcited ...

  english ambivalent feelings ... 
  how did it start ? 
  well , some dude thought it 's a * brilliant idea * to impose catholicism on everyone and get them united . 
  he did as he thought . 
  lots of nasty wars with everyone around but somehow they always managed to bounce back . 
  one time , almost a thousand years after the * brilliant idea * , some not-so-nice guys also had an idea - not a new one - to annihilate the country completely . 
  you know what , * not a new one * is rather generous , that 's a goddamned clich\u00e9 . 
  but , not to be so repetitive , they came up with a reverse strategy . 
  if it did n't work with killing and burning things down , stealing clay and stuff , not even with eradicating the language , they chose to start from the other * end * and get a rid of said catholicism first . 
  such * immaterial * thing ca n't be attached * much * , right ? 
  why , of course it did * not * work . 
  just the other way around . 
  they safely secured it for centuries to come , and managed to produce a pope in the process . 
  you see , it appears , when you squeeze something too hard , weird things come out . 
  how will it end ? 
  with the * holy spirit * floating in nothingness , mumbling * not yet lost , kurwa . 
  but the scene in [ * red * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/red_%282010_film%29 ) where helen mirren 's character produces a bottle of sobieski vodka to clean bruce willis ' wound is * neat * . 
  totally agree . 
  i do n't think comparing herbal infused , meant to be distinctive , vodkas with a classic best neat is even doable . 
  let alone an appropriate thing to do . 
  but , here 's the thing , i 'm not a big drinker either . 
  and moreover , i 'm not a big fan of vodka ...  [ still polish , i swear ! ],

  - huge increase in labor costs with nothing to warrant them . 
  now that i covered it , i 'm kind of surprised to see lack of major infrastructure and other public services ( police , firefighters , etc ) reform references . 
  tl ; dr i think the program tries to save too many failed public systems when the approach could be cheaper and more efficient when mixed up with the private market . 
  too socialist , not liberal market-enough for me . 
  im unaware of loyalist support level in eritrea , but you may be right . 
  it 's not strictly about better/worse education , only that you should n't get an overwhelmingly better education if you pay for it . 
  it 's less about the quality but more about private education going against the ideals of inclusiveness . 
  people fear a system the likes of american schooling system where students are head deep in debt , too . 
  you did n't come off as combative , it 's all right . 
  personally i 'd like to see a threat of an enforced coup if human rights are not upheld - mind you , coup , not war - followed by one-time supervised democratic elections . 
  upholding human rights should be enforced by un and membership should depend on one 's fulfillment of them . 
  incorporation to ethiopia should be considered as well . 
  eh , but knowing life , russia or china would veto this , which is why i think un should be rebuilt first to include the premises of human rights protection . 
  i believe higher education should do just that , anything else is extra . 
  it should pay off , and no better to pay off than by teaching job skills . 
  as for the investments , i 'd have to come back to you later , my master 's awaits :p, 
  it 's never impossible . 
  human rights should be an enforced world standard , imo . 
  accepting them and integrating refugees is fine but one should not blame a country for being unable to do so , this should be purely voluntary . 
  i mean hourly minimum wage is fine but it has to be adjusted yearly to the current living wage . 
  let me rephrase - public industries are fine if they can compete on the market on market terms , imo . 
  private schools need not be exclusive , just because the schools are not state-owned does n't mean they 'll end up like the american ones if you have some laws in place to prevent that . 
  at the moment it 's clear public schools hardly teach skills relevant to the market and private schools existence is paramount for both types of schools to update their curriculums . 
  polish schools create great generalists but no specialists , unless it 's a trade school . 
  by populist i meant that a few of the ideas speak of putting money for fancy goals that most people would like but without covering the base of how will that investment pay off or where the funds would come from . 
  working hours are directly connected to efficiency . 
  it 's duh that it works for scandinavia or france who are obsessed with quality , but our tools and methods of production are n't effective enough and the hours of work reflect that . 
  eh , for example i 'm more for a flexible living minimum wage , not a static minimum wage . 
  i do n't believe in public industries . 
  i also believe private schools should compete with public ones or replace them entirely should they be more efficient . 
  a lot of the tax ideas seem really populist ones , i do n't think i ever saw a country apply such huge taxes and new costs for corporations without ruining the economy . 
  we 've got issues attracting investors as is . 
  35 hour work week is a pipe dream at the moment . 
  a lot of public expenses that will not pay off like public tv . 
  just to name a few . 
  before reading this i thought i was anti-corporate , but these guys seem to hate their guts . 
  this really boils down to an ethics question - chances are those refugees will be forcefully conscripted into a 30 year army service or subjected to torture or forced labor . 
  should other countries like norway feel guilty for sending them towards that fairly certain fate ? 
  probably not . 
  but should the rest of the world fucking do something about a blatant human rights violating country ? 
  probably fucking yes . 
  glancing over the program , it feels like a lot of expenses but few realistic ideas . 
  i 'm a social liberal , so i 'm all for a social safety net , investments and incentives , but not babysitting and economic interventions and some of these ideas look really unfeasible at least economically . 
  man , i 'd so like to vote for a leftist party but all of them are either populists , old establishment post communists or farmers . 
  why ca n't we get a socialist/social liberal party the likes of the scandinavian ones ? 
  disagree that it exists ? 
  because it 's largely a mentality/traditions thing , it 's not much of a disagreement rather than saying the differences between the two `` polands '' are overstated and not that significant as the map might suggest . 
  you can always count on students to be the anti-establishment voters . 
  what can un or the world leaders profit from that ? 
  as did any non-right wing candidate in polish election history . 
  bloody german and russian occupation still affecting polish voting mentality tens of years after independence . 
  conservative . 
  czech republic also noted 2.8 % growth in this quarter largely from growth in manufacturing , so i assume a lot of it is growth in that region , ie south-western portion of poland ( which is close to czech republic ) where most of the heavy industry is . 
  just a theory i would like someone more knowledgeable to confirm . 
  so i 'm guessing it 's largely connected to the recent growth in czech republic ? 
  there 's just no way of getting by with a part time job in poland . 
  in my experience it 's just a full time job or an unpaid internship . 
  women also prefer full time jobs , independent women is a bit like our thing . 
  still this number is rather surprising . 
  that ... is actually an interesting perspective . 
  why would it anger you ? 
  not any time soon beyond maybe 10 % total no . 
  both po and pis are like that if they get a large majority vote ; they avoid conflicting issues and try to be as generalist as possible . 
  voters still do n't know all legislative power is in the parliament . 
  because he 's the least messed up , not because he 's any good , sadly . 
  komorowski is as mild , generalist , toned and pc in terms of political opinions as you can get among these candidates . 
  touche . 
  guess i 'm not voting at all then . 
  one should n't be taunted by korwinists . 
  guess we have the candidates we friggin deserve , fml . 
  hard to tell if that was the phrasing in which the matter was discussed , to be honest . 
  right . 
  got the words mixed up . 
  a ~ ~ transvestite ~ ~ transsexual , not a drag queen , but yes , that 's true . 
  was meant to be a symbol of his party 's progressiveness , turned into a bit of a joke in the media though . 
  better send weapons than people , i 'd say . 
  and if they need it and offer a good deal , i do n't see why not . 
  that said i do n't find the matter a vote-swaying issue . 
  not too early for a discussion . 
  left wing left a bitter taste in voters ' mouth after they squandered their rule in late 90s and early 00 's and created an impression they 're all nepotist , post-communist corrupt dbags . 
  since then only palikot has gained any traction from the left side , but even he lost a lot of support due to accusations of populism . 
  i 'd like a young , unrelated to the current left side candidate for a change . 
  ~ ~ i 'm actually voting for tanajno . 
  despite being a bit of a niche proposition with less than 1 % chance of winning , i 'd prefer anything over the conservative right and populist left , and after kukiz , the only pretty much independent candidate presumably left , that 's my fuck you to the current stale candidates . 
  direct democracy ideals are of course a big plus . ~ ~ edit : after digging a bit deeper into tanajno , guess i 'm not voting at all . 
  current left wing is kind of fucked : /, 
  spelt like that it could also mean `` no fucking way '' in polish lol . 
  norway and old cars does not compute . 
  it 's a gold mine of comedy . 
  one need n't look beyond the top comment . 
   socialism at its best . 
   `` you vill all like it . 
  ve are all norvegians from norvegia !, 
  but ve are not german . '', 
  neighboring fm stations in neighboring countries are going to have a field day with norwegian advertisers . 
   stupid is as stupid do . 
  way to discredit an initiative bro . 
  you really convinced those dirty socialists who 's boss . 
  well considering us debt and norway 's savings that 's a totally valid statement . 
  yeah .

  apparently communism thrives only in sub-zero temperatures ... 2 . 
  if you still wonder - warsaw and berlin have basically identical climate . 
  both cities are on the same latitude . 
  warsaw is located 600km to the east of berlin , and thus it 's a bit deeper into the euro-asian landmass . 
  hence summers are warmer and winters colder ... by a whooping average of 1 degree celsius . 
  it 's not that much about physical phenomena like temperature or precipitation . 
  for me positive/negative perception of weather is dominated by one factor - amount of sunlight you get during the day . 
  fall and winter in berlin , as in warsaw , is depressing mostly becasue it 's fucken dark . 
  there 's a very similar job in india - it 's called [ chaiwala ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/chaiwala ) . 
  it can mean a person who sells freshly brewed tea directly in the street , but also someone serving a whole office or building . 
   in the deep south ( sicily and environs ) there also used to be the prefiche , women paid to mourn other people at their funeral !, 
   that 's not so uncommon . 
  it used to be a thing in poland too . 
  woman crying on a funeral for money ( or other form of gratitude - it 's not like it was a legit business ) was called `` p\u0142aczka '' ( literally `` a crying woman '' ) . 
  the practice of hiring ` wailers ' for mourning was ( is ? ), 
  in fact a fairly common practice in many cultures . 
  as a fellow `` god abiding catholic '' you 've probably well aware that this religion of ours is oftentimes more about symbolism and pretence , than serious belief . 
  what a better way to make the deceased look important , than hiring some wailers ... or building a pyramid . 
   i think it 's because centuries ago it was quite common that entire neighborhoods burned down because someone had n't had their chimney swept . 
  yup , it makes a lot of sense . 
  it 's just weirdly specific in poland - for whatever reason one needs to grab by the chimney sweepers button ... are there any weirdly specific superstitions connected to particular jobs in germany ? 
  inglisz kurwa , du ju spik it ? 
  yup , same in poland . 
  just a small observation ... 
  it 's one of those cultural quirks that take you off guard , but i was pleasantly surprised by a visit of a schornsteinfeger in my flat here in berlin . 
  particularly by the fact that he was all about business ( in this case checking the airflow in my flat ) . 
  in poland chimney sweepers , apart from usual thing , also try to sell you a calendar or engage in a somehow doggy `` charity '' money grab scheme ... all that coming from a fact that , pulling a chimney sweeper 's button is traditionally believed to be a good omen . 
  / u/longbowrocks / and / u/lgf92 / - what you refer to is actually a fundamental concept of modern philosophy , and ethics in particular . 
  you may actually heard about it !, 
  it 's usualy refered to as [ `` categorical imperative '' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/categorical_imperative ) . 
  it was first formulated in 1785 by immanuel kant in his groundbreaking `` grounding for the metaphysics of morals '' ( it 's for modern ethics like netown 's shit to physics ) . 
  it was originally going like this : `` act only according to that maxim whereby you can , at the same time , will that it should become a universal law . '', 
  ( it 's much more sexy in german ... u have to trust me on that ), 
  i salute you / u/x71p3qvf / -- after all this shitposting , i imagine you now know the difference between slovenia and slovakia or can find andorra on a map . 
  soon you will be able to tell the difference between beethoven 9th [ by furtw\u00e4ngler ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhdxdbswu0e ) and much more conservative [ von karajan interpretation ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frzax6-dsn8 ) . 
  one of us !, 
  cheers , and good luck !, 
  hear you soon announcing the cruising altitude of my flight . 
  have you tried / r/aviation or / r/flying and such ? 
  i 'm pretty sure actual pilots will have more valuable insight , than some random european dudes on the internetz ... also / u/sphornet closed the thread imho - do n't be impatiant , consult authorities, 
   if anything the uk is nerfed by sending separate teams you know what is `` nerfing '' england ? 
  over 60 % of you are overweight and more than 30 % clinically obese . 
  keep this shit up and soon clarkson will have to drop all of his worn out yanks routines and replace it with `` zany '' fart antics . 
  i 've been living in berlin since few years now . 
  no matter the part of the city i rented in , one can be absolutely sure of two things - there 's an aldi/lidl market as well as a well-lighted , semi-professional football pitch within a walking distance . 
  guess which of these two is open longer ... there is over 53 million people in england ( and we slavs work hard , so that there 's even more of you . 
  have you seen this fine , blond and slender dna samples we 're injecting into your inbreed , islander , gene pool !? 
  with your esteemed tradition , superb infrastructure and obscene amounts of money invested in football there 's literaly no excuse for the shit show your national team accustomed us to over the years . 
  yet here you are , pushing this ridiculously naive agenda , meant to induce a pleasant itch under your foreskin . 
  yup , me silly `` continental '' can not into scottish/welsh/this-one-part - of-london-where-people-speak-with-a-funny-accent-that-sounds-like-a-dolphin-squeak . 
  that 's all the same . 
  sure thing m8 , get together all of the former commonwealth dominions . 
  build an all-star team . 
  have a tea . 
  feel better . 
  it should n't be , if that 's what you mean - but coming from eastern europe , racial diversity is certainly not a common theme here . 
  it does n't necessary leads to overt racism , but in largely homogeneous societies , like poland for example , being different ( racially , religiously , sexualy ) is still very much a thing . 
  for some people it will be interesting ( much more than it should ) , some will find it disturbing ( simply by the virtue of novelty ) and sadly , there will be people for whom it will pose a threat . 
  short disclaimer for us redditors i guess , but keep in mind that in our socialist wonderland a lot of what one would consider an insurance is guaranteed by law . 
  that of course does n't make it any less of an insurance in a technical sense , but for majority of us it 's pretty transparent . 
  you do n't really think about it on a day to day basis - it 's just there . 
  health insurance , social insurance ( pension/retirement fund ) and for some eu countries unemployment insurance is mandated by law and comes with every long-term employment contract . 
  if i think about insurance first thing that comes to my mind is traveling outside eu . 
  pretty standard thing to do . 
  sometimes it comes with a `` travel '' oriented credit card . 
  when you 're booking a plane ticket , airlines will usually try to sell you an additional luggage/whatever insurance ( anyone does that ? ) . 
  life insurance - heard about it , but seriously do n't know anyone who has it . 
  i 'm guessing that it 's a thing in more life threatening lines of work ( also pretty sure , that in some countries there are professions that require a mandatory life insurance ) . 
  car insurance , again mandatory all over eu . 
  fun fact - i 'm all for gender equality , scandinavian style - but , when eu ruled for a gender-neutral pricing in insurance industry , it 's women drivers who got royally screwed . 
  in the long term they will pay more , as statistically men are more prone to cause accidents . 
  so yeah , so much for lousy `` woman driver '' bs . 
  but if you want to know about insurance game in europe , just wait for german redditors . 
  it 's crazy there ... 
   posher accents tend to be thought of as sounding smarter , i guess , and thick regional accents can make you sound less educated . 
  1 . please correct me if i 'm wrong , but is n't hammering out a local accent an ( unintended ? ), 
  byproduct of acquiring a higher degree in england ? 
  2 . you say `` posher accents '' in plural ... wait , there is more variety to it than proverbial bbc english ? 
   i can tell apart a few english accents , but i could n't tell if someone is from poland or russia by their english accent . 
  this is somehow understandable ( nah , i 'm just being polite - blasphemy ! ) . 
  i 'm wondering though could you distinguish between polish and russian ( sans english , as intermediary ) ? 
  i 'm always baffled when people in berlin ask me what language do i speak when it 's literally less than 1h drive to the polish border . 
   using an english nav voice would be seen as a bit weird , i think , but that 's it . 
  like using the english setting on their facebook . 
  agreed , though you do mix in quite a lot of english while speaking casual german , and in a very unpredictable way ( at least for non-native speaker ) . 
  i 'm always a bit lost when i hear for example `` checken '' , instead of a perfectly suitable german word . 
  and as mentioned , most of the times it just feels random, 
   that should apply to all schengen countries but i do n't know whether they 're just allowed in visa-free for tourism or whether they can work visa-free too . 
  does anyone else know ? 
  schengen is only about passport/visa-free movement between participating countries . 
  labour movement regulations are something entirely different ( and a part of eu-membership itself or bilateral agreements like with norway or switzerland ) . 
  yup , for the time being we should move it to washington dc , much safer ... [ lol , no ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/crime_in_washington,_d.c . ), 
  one more interesting aspect to your question , that you probably did n't take into account , is that there are still a few countries in europe with obligatory conscription ( switzerland , finland , norway ? 
  how this adds to the equation ? 
  simple , if you do n't want to serve your country in the military you can choose a civil service alternative , which among others , means you can be shipped to a developing country to help build a school or teach children english and such . 
  and this usually happens right after you finish high school . 
  at least that used to be the case in germany ( until they canceled conscription ) . 
  i 'm not 100 % sure how this works/worked so maybe some german redditors can chip in . 
  when i was finishing high school in poland , the mandatory conscription was exactly what you wanted to avoid - that 's why you went to a university right away . 
  it all changed now , but back in my days it was n't unheard to choose whatever crappy studies just to avoid military service .

this is a game changer . 
  but there is no cliff . 
  the people in it were lied to that there is . 
  so you 're rich ? 
  the exact same shit as trump . 
  it 's absurd . 
  well , we do have esa . . 
  not much unknown about it . 
  vote to leave the uk and join the eu again , that 's what you can do . 
  poor baby may does n't like when someone gives her a taste of her own medicine . 
  poland is not pis . 
  i love this woman . 
  dumb , old , religious people . 
  at this moment it 's basically a propaganda tube . 
  so not credible at all . 
  it 's actually shocking what stuff they show there . 
  before out current government it was a pretty decent , not the greatest but still . 
  they were n't thinking . 
  they are complete idiots . 
  `` started a debate '' aka `` everyone is laughing at us '' . 
  that is so embarrassing for the government it 's insane . 
  they are complete idiots . 
  absolute complete morons . 
  you completely missed the reference . 
  hahaha i love this . 
  one thing we 've learned about dictators from history is that they are never `` never leaving '' . 
  i very stupidly misspelled my original comment . 
  the weirdest thing is that anti-semitism is still strong here in poland . 
  like they are not stupid now . 
  they really would . 
  castles were mostly build with function in mind , churches however we 're designed with spirituality in mind . 
  once they figured out how to make sharp arches they started to make churches us high and elongated as they could , making them `` reach the heavens '' . 
  very high ceilings were made to resemble the sky from the inside and the whole inside was heavily decorated . 
  gothic churches also has huge windows everywhere , because they did n't need to serve a military purpose anymore . 
  you would n't have all these things if people needed just castles and watch towers . 
  there should be basket , like in that bond movie . 
  monstrous beer bellies that is . 
  maybe london is making up from the rest of the country , cause it 's fuckin huge . 
  that 's a really dumb thing to say . 
  he 's a complete joke here in poland . 
  he got elected just because he has an ability to manipulate young , stupid men + sheer stupid luck + ignorance of the majority of the population . 
  against roma people yeah . 
  in general there is a lot of casual racism here because we never really had that much diversity . 
  everyone was always white in poland . 
  now it 's slowly changing and people know better . 
  older people not so much though . 
  ai n't that the truth . 
  ha i feel so smart now for having studied some greek ( ancient though ) for my exams . 
  but that is not a problem . 
  if you want you can go to a private clinic and pay . 
  and they launch satellites there too . 
  haha i would never guess people had it outside poland . 
  poland knows what it 's taking about . 
  i remember the crazy parodies people made with this show and a voice synthesizer in poland . 
  buka !, 
  my god i literally learned to read with these books . 
  in poland too . 
  polish dub was so good too . 
  so many classic jokes in that one . 
  all of the movies had amazing dubbing . 
  poland here !, 
  everyone here loves asterix & obelix . 
  comics , cartoons , love action films and animated films , we love it all . 
  politically yeah . 
  but our current government won the elections by making people believe that the country is in ruin ... 
  but they are . 
  they have new roads , new jobs , new trains , new entertainment , new homes , new businesses , new stores , grants , freedom of movement , freedom to work anywhere in the eu etc. 
  they lied . 
  i am polish and have never heard of this . 
  i am ashamed of my country . 
  are you also a teenager living with your mother ? 
  can you explain to me what is the basis of such opinions ? 
  do you have any evidence ? 
  that 's why we need proper integration , not bans . 
  you 're gon na ruin it for yourself . 
  sounds like the current government of poland . 
  and they 've already started . 
  the polish words comes from an old ukrainian and belarusian word meaning a really horribly freezing cold . 
  as a person learning latin right now , i hope it will be useful at least in one place on earth . 
  the cloud filter is just a noise algorithm . 
  you can make insane stuff with it . 
  no they did n't . 
  30 % of 50 % of the population voted for them . 
  and you ca n't vote `` for him '' . 
  he 's not a president , he 's not even a prime minister . 
  and yet he is both those things . 
  do you even know what propaganda is ? 
  that 's very much were it is going right now . 
  i do n't know what can we really do right now . . 
  i do n't think russia wants to necessarily invade europe . 
  they definitely would love to take ukraine but they wo n't go further west . 
  they want to influence europe and break it apart from the inside . 
  here in poland it seems to be -100 . 
  europe is pretty indifferent about china . 
  the only thing we really do n't like is communism . 
  apart from that we just joke that everything is made in china . 
  a lot of chinese tourists here too . 
  boy , does he give us poles a headache . 
  democracy is on it 's knees in our country . 
  not all electors are legally bound to vote like that .

  and a couple of obvious culinary terms like paczki and pierogi ( s ) . 
  they were originally shipped from principality of prussia ( hence `` z prus [ ksi\u0105\u017c\u0119cych ] ) by hanseatic merchants . 
  it 's tasty but sadly quite unhealthy . 
  this one gets me every time  most trustworthy : germany  least trustworthy : germany, 
  every country in western europe suffers from varying degrees of smugness . 
  easterners are probably the least smug . 
  that security camera in the upper right corner is just a cherry on top . 
  nationalism and religiousness . 
  in america , the quality of food ( or rather the lack of thereof ) . 
  i firmly believe american accent was the best thing to ever happen to the polish language . 
  so cute and immidately reconisable !, 
  on which subreddit ? 
  certainly not this one . 
  even people with eu flair usually tell where they come from . 
  they 're everywhere , especially in the countryside . 
  we 've got nothing on italy though , which i swear has a virgin mary chapel in every second backyard . 
  it became a breakfast staple in my household together with cereals , eggs and pancakes . 
  the taste reminds me heavily of my favorite childhood [ peanut-flavoured crisps ] ( http://static1.money.pl/i/msp/znaki_towarowe/214/400054 ) ( sadly not sold anymore ) , so it was a love from the first bite so to say , haha . 
  the peanut butter sold by a polish company sante is excellent and the only one we really buy . 
  i like the smooth variant the best , but most of my family seems to prefer crunchy , which is sweeter and less dense . 
  kao the kangoroo back when i was a kid . 
  it aged like milk though . 
  this right here . 
  my grandma was a policewoman during commie times , and she always told me how she hated guns even though she was taught how to use one , so that affected my opinion a bit too . 
  i 've been to majority of western europe and a decent chunk of central-east europe ever since i started traveling at 3 y.o. 
  from memory i count 20 european countries i 've visited ( not just passed through ) until today . 
  after all these years , my favorite is still spain . 
  you just can not not love the climate , the people , the cuisine and the beautiful cities . 
  my least favorite is ... probably my own , sadly . 
  we dont really have anything that is n't done bigger , prettier and cleaner somewhere else . 
  i found both prague and budapest to be more impressive than krak\u00f3w for example . 
  not much in terms of nature either . 
  the masurian lakes can be pretty cute though . 
  special mention goes to la defense in france . 
  while i otherwise like the country , that place fills me with dread . 
  never again lol, 
  fuck no . 
  since october 2015 i wish for an early election every single day . 
  probably anyone but that puppet szyd\u0142o lmao . 
  southern warsaw and the municipalities surrounding it ( like [ konstancin-jeziorna ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/konstancin-jeziorna ) ) are the most well-off in general . 
  a small town [ nowy s\u0105cz ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/nowy_s%c4%85cz ) in lesser poland hosts the most millionaries per capita in the country though . 
  edit : here 's a map of [ purchasing power in poland in 2016 ] ( http://pliki.portalsamorzadowy.pl/i/09/07/19/090719.jpg ), 
  according to / r/europe 's poll poles are the third or fourth most common european nationality on / r/europe . 
  i assume it 's not much different here on r/askeurope . 
  so despite coming from one of the less notable european countries , i do n't feel underrepresented at all , 
  russia easily , considering a large chunk of their country is in asia . 
  that post was a joke/follow up based on [ this thread ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5b4cwt/poland_belarus_eu_and_georgia_are_the_top_most/ ) . 
  good eye lol . 
  that 's what i get for quicktyping on my phone ... 
  kaunas/kowno 's tree is nicier . 
  sometimes less is more . 
  yes , but they 're ( literally ) dying out . 
  polish sld ( `` union of social democrats '' ) is comprised of people who used to be the memebrs of the polish communist party ( and they 're not even hiding it ! ) . 
  also , the current ruling party ( pis ) has apperentely the most former communists as active party members . 
  and yet they still call anyone they do n't like `` communists '' lmao, 
  hard to say , but things look pretty grim so far . 
  the french elections are going to be a major turning point if le pen wins . 
  they do n't call them po-bis for nothing . 
  people here prefer to game on pcs or smartphones because everyone has one and you can pirate all of the games for free . 
  i find / v / 's mustard rice meme funny in the polish context knowing the kind of toasters people usually game on in poland . 
  speaking about personal experience , i used to hop between both sides of the `` barricade '' rather frequently . 
  when i was a kid i used to play on both pc ( first my parents amiga , then my own pc ) and consoles/handhelds ( ps1 and gameboy ) . 
  nowadays i tend to stick to just the nintendo handhelds ~ ~ and smartphones ~ ~ , which is unusual in poland to say the least . 
  genre wise i tend to favour jrpgs , dungeon crawlers , vns , puzzle games and some rhythm games , but i 'm willing to play almost anything as long as it 's good . 
  not perceiving race as important = / = not `` seeing '' race . 
  i 'd argue cultural / ethnic background strikes much more controversy in europe than having a slightly brown skin does , whereas in america it 's the other way around . 
  not a federalist but i think it 'd be impossible to unite humanity like that unless we find aliens . 
  ( edit : or they find us ... ), 
  yes and no . 
  it was a complete waste of time of course but you could say it was there due to `` popular demand '' . 
  most of my close friends are / were at least somewhat religious , though it was impossible to tell at first . 
  by far the most ridiculous was my high school - me and one other student were the only two out of like 30 who opted-out of the religion classes , and i got called a `` godless heathen '' when i told one of the girls in class that i did n't do the confirmation yet ( still did n't lmao ) . 
  two of the boys were planning to become a priest after finishing high school and one of them told me his dream is to become the next pope ( he was n't kidding ) . 
  our polish language teacher was a religious right wing cunt who 'd go on long-ass rants to prove god exists . 
  mind you , this was all in warsaw , the supposed capital and `` progressive '' centre of the country . 
  i ca n't even imagine how bad things must be in the countryside . 
  so basically everything, 
  because nintendo consoles are virtually unknown here and the political discussion is insanely cancerous in nature ( think youtube comments tier ) . 
  i think we have a winner here !, 
  english is a european language 2 . 
  loan words are not a good example of language being used less 3 . 
  in everyday conversation , native language is undisputed king , unless you work for an international corporation or something . 
  on the internet its a matter of choice . 
  i 'm fairly sure that unless you speak something very obscure every european language has lots of it 's own content to dig into . 
  english is often preferable for things like tv series and video games due to slow translation process though . 
  not really ... there is n't much keeping us together other than hate for mena immigrants ( which are n't even interested in settling down here ) . 
  i 'd wager that even in case of eus breakdown , new union ( s ) would start being worked on the very next day . 
  so yes , it will survive , even if under a different name . 
  that our entire history consists solely of being trashed by germany and russia . 
   now, 
  it represents pretty much everything i hate about poland except even worse, 
  i like it for having all gen 3 features + the battle frontier mostly and fuck you flygon is my boy, 
  they generally begin slowly rolling out their christmas-themed decorations/ads/merchandise after the all-saints day ( 1st of november ) . 
  no christmas music yet but i saw christmas themed chocolates in shops already . 
  i love the entire original spyro trilogy . 
  i still replay it from time to time , i swear it never gets old . 
  pokemon emerald for gameboy advance i 'm still salty gamefraud dropped the ball with the 3ds remake, 
  i do n't have a credit card and i do n't know anyone who does . 
  everyone uses debit here . 
  i read that they banned it because sometime during ww2 shady bakeries put sawdust inside bread to reduce production costs .

  yet they did n't . 
  why ? 
  because ** no un law was broken ** and ** no right was abused ** . 
  i highly recommend you to read [ samanta power speech in un ] ( http://www.businessinsider.com/samantha-power-russia-ukraine-un-security-council-2014-3 ) - it will shed you some more light on the issue . 
   no , the ukrainian parliament does not need to agree , under the un charter any group of people have the right to self determination , it must be supported by the un and all countries within the un , and ukraine is a signatory to the un charter . 
  and as such it 's satisfying this un charter by granting undisturbed right to wide autonomy of crimea . 
   why would russia have to abandon the sevastopol base ? 
  i never said that they would have to nor meant to imply that . 
   putin seems to have a bad habit of doing things without thinking first . 
  oh , quite contrary . 
  he had everything well thought . 
  that 's exactly whey you see the results you do : crimea basically is in russian hands right now , and crimean parliament become russian puppet with illegal `` prime minister '' . 
  to be fair - this fact got very long historical basis . 
  russians were always pushing quite hard on electronics and it is simply a next stage . 
  their superpower ambitions and wanting to be independent of us in every possible way certainly also played a role . 
  no slightest idea . 
  i do n't know almost anything at all about radio maria . 
  though afaik jews are higher on their `` to-hate '' list than islamists . 
   says the guy who downvotes all of my posts whilst having a tantrum ? 
  do i ? 
   so do you believe that catalonia should be forced to stay within spain if madrid does not agree to a binding referendum ? 
  i know nothing about catalonia co i prefer not to comment on that . 
  how about this : if crimean way to referendum would follow the steps of scottish , and be done in a way where lack of any external pressure would be reassured and both : ukrainian government and crimean parliament ( not just illegally chosen so-called crimean prime minister ) would agree on it like they did in great britain - i would totally support it happily look how they , crimeans , vote independently on their own future . 
   un enshrines the right to self determination in their charter , stop repeating false information . 
  un never gave right for any region to secede from it 's parent country without it agreeing . 
  the need for self-determination is already satisfied by crimean autonomy and un charter stays in complete agreement with that . 
  stop implying that they only way of satisfying self-determination is secession from ukraine . 
  it 's not . 
   it 's called self-determination . 
  and we 're back home ...  as long as they forge their own destiny in the direction you want them to . 
   what ? 
  you even know what 's going on there ? 
  cause the more i read the more certain i am that you have no slightest idea . 
   you 'd grow out of it as you mature in your ideas . 
  parenting . 
   or do you believe they should be forced to stay within their larger states with threat of force as well ? 
  british government agreed for scotland to have referendum and set up conditions for it to happen . 
  both parties cooperated years for it to happen and there was ** no ** external pressure what so ever . 
  also scotts live in their land for centuries , not 70 years or so . 
  and if some of them think that they 're russians and they belong to russia - there is a country that they can go to , unlike scotland which does n't have it 's own country . 
  that 's radically different situation than the one in ukraine for these and many , many other reasons , some of which already been mentioned . 
  out there foreign government is the only one that legitimized referendum prepared by separatist minority ( yes , people you see now on tv were from a minor party in crimean parliament - there was no record what so ever of crimean parliament even gathering to vote on said referendum ) . 
  and right now noone can guarantee truthfulness of it 's results , not even un . 
   gee , i bet those tartar communities in poland would have something to say about that you xenophobic git . 
  yea ... years of conflicts back in the day . 
  but for some short period we managed to get along to some great effect . 
  right now there 's just a small minority in podlaskie voivodeship - and most poles are n't even aware of that . 
  currently pretty much whole political right-wing is anti-islamist , with maxtv ( most popular polish right-wing youtube `` tv '' ) being primary example of radical anti-islamists . 
   if the crimeans wish to leave ukraine , forcing them to stay is oppression of the people and suppression of their wishes . 
  i wish upper silesia would join germany . 
  so . . assuming i can find enough people to vote on it - i 'm being oppressed and my wishes are suppressed by the government ? 
  sorry , you really need to learn how the world works . 
  cause it 's definitely not as you think it does . 
   it 's sad that you ca n't understand that and believe it 's okay to not allow them to forge their own destiny . 
  they forge their own destiny through crimean parliment since 1992 . 
   yet you wo n't extend the same courtesy to those in the east . 
  western ukraine did n't separate from eastern just because they did n't like government . 
  they chose to dispose it and get a new one . 
  crimeans are free to take part in forming new government just like every other region is . 
  territorial integrity of ukraine or any other country is something no region can tamper with without agreement from said country government . 
  you allow that and you open pandora 's box in entire europe . 
  suddenly law means nothing everywhere . 
  there are no troops with russian markings , no trucks with russian markings , no ifvs with russian markings anywhere near any ukrainian bases . 
  yet somehow there are troops with standard russian-army issue equipment , professional military training , and heavy equipment used by russian army . 
  your choice which version you want to believe - russian troops or pro-russian troops ( aka `` militia '' or `` troops without markings '' ) . 
  wikipedia : best source of russian propaganda . 
  lol, 
   that 's not what self-determination means , i think you are completely clueless yourself what it means . 
  even wikipedia agrees with me : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/self-determination  the principle does not state how the decision is to be made , or what the outcome should be , whether it be independence , federation , protection , ** some form of autonomy ** or even full assimilation . 
   actually , yes they can , the un charter is very clear about the principle of self-determination . 
  yes , and one of the ways to satisfy that need is autonomy - autonomy that crimean ** already have ** and ukrainian government ** wants to extend ** by it 's own initiative . 
  my position : * no region in the world can decide on it 's own to which country can it belong * still stands truth . 
  un charter never allowed any secessions . 
   i 'm not even going to address your point about `` real '' crimeans because it 's just a preposterous and desperate position to take . 
  \\* facepalm \\* if truth is * preposterous and desperate * then i have nothing more to say here . 
  oh ... so that 's why uk embargoes sierra leone . 
  cause '' * a significant section of the market is involved * '' . 
  makes sense . 
  maybe i do ... ah , these nuances . 
   if you think war is that black and white never is , never was . 
  noone denies that . 
  you read way too much in my post . 
  4 paragraphs trying to respond on a single sentence is a slight overkill in implying me words i never said . 
   feel happy we even had a damn treaty and even came to help you you came to help us ? 
  last time i checked : ussr was the one marching through poland killing nazis . 
  on the other hand i quite specifically remember poles helping british soldiers , be it during battle of england or various campaigns in continental europe . 
  just in the end to give up poland in russian hands to the occupation that we finally ended ourselves in 1990 . 
  highly recommend reading through this : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/western_betrayal . 
  one highlight if you really think uk was so great for poland in 1939 :  * france and britain did not launch a full land attack on germany , and did not declare war on the soviet union when it invaded poland on 17 september 1939 ; contrary to the terms of the alliances with france and britain *, 
   that 's still denying their right to self-determination no region in the world can decide on it 's own to which country can it belong . 
  it always needs to be agreed with central government , and ukraine ca n't afford loosing crimea . 
  also : according to all of the international treaties - including these signed by russia itself , like budapest memorandum - crimea belongs to ukraine . 
  majority of russian-speaking crimeans were brought there by stalin middle xxth century ( 1944 ) just to have peninsula re-assigned to ukrainian ssr soon after ( 1954 ) . 
  `` real '' crimeans are crimean tatars that lived there before infamous 1944 and some of them started to move back when ukraine become independent . 
  they do n't want to see crimea back in russian hands no matter what - due to all the pain they suffered from russian hands through the history . 
  only problem is that they 're at the moment minority on crimea . 
  so what - freshly imported russians are about to determine a fate of peninsula populated on stalin 's order ? 
  you 've got to be kidding me . 
   if it could be proven to be free it ca n't . 
  that 's the problem i try to point out through all these posts .

it works pretty well for all 28 members . 
  and krakow is far worse than wroclaw . 
  ^ but ^ it 's ^ still ^ worth ^ to ^ visit ^ them ^ all . 
  i would n't expect that - `` not angering russia '' would anger polish electorate . 
  poles generally do n't give a fuck about russia , but recent russian actions are taken seriously here ( but kremlin 's cold war rhetoric is viewed as ridiculous , because economy of russia is worth less than 5 % of eu+us ) . 
  my first impression - brad pitt from inglorious basterds, 
  oh shit , tiny poland assembles 5x more cars than russia . 
  lol, 
  in other words - money transfers inside eu are cheap , fast and standardized now . 
  this is huge step in the integration of eu economy . 
  i also recommend georgian wines . 
  maybe there 's cunning russian plan - they want to increase alcoholism in our countries ? 
  flaki !, 
  well , it 's more like digg before demise . 
  this recording is in a way coherent with what he said at bbc : eu/pl defense should n't depend on us taxpayers . 
  well , poland is probably the most pro us country in europe , but its blind infatuation comes to an end ( there no particular reason , maybe the fact that pl feels that eu is closer ally ) . 
  btw do n't take ` fucks ' personally , check what nulad recently have said , 
  it seems that you might know something about knp plans . 
  are they willing to join any political group of ep ? 
  sorry homie but we have some `` dark pages '' in our history ( some `` recent '' ones : invasion of czechoslovakia or emigration of jews in 68 ) . 
  it can not be denied and it should be discussed openly . 
  relax . 
  these are the most exaggerated _ stereotypes _ . 
  still it does n't diminish ukrainian 's right to be self-determent . 
  you are saying it 's ok that russia can control its neighborhoods . 
  so i 'm just asking : how would you feel if it were you under ~ ~ russian ~ ~ anyone 's control ? 
  do you remember when russian `` sphere of interest '' contained part of germany ? 
  ddr ? 
  would you like to live in such country ? 
  nah , usa is too smart to allow this . 
  these `` refuges '' ca n't recognize and appreciate well developed and peaceful country . 
  i wonder what did they imagine and expect . 
  anyway , it 's better for finland this way . 
  high five portugal !, 
  you are right . 
  `` extortion '' is a better word . 
  remember : when the shit goes down you can always flee to catholic poland , 
  i 'm not a fan of orban , but he 's the only eu politician that says and does what should be done in this situation . 
  he did n't placed wrongly understood political correctness over law and order in his country . 
   human rights , equality , justice , tolerance yes . 
  and people from syria , afganistan , nigeria , somalia and iraq will embrace these western values . 
  lol, 
  nah , it 's not so bad . 
  you get a good press in poland , even from pro `` culture enrichment '' outlets . 
  that 's the first thing that i thought . 
  fix it yourself , it 's just a leak !, 
  are they expecting that someone will come and do everything instead of them ? 
  fix a tent , mop a floor and do the cleaning ? 
  it does n't require special tools or phd . 
  anyway , what else they have to do ? 
  i think `` no '' is caused by an overall mess and chaos taking place in de , fr , it . 
  we are still in shock that whole eu ( including us as well ) ca n't implement any solution . 
  eu politicians are lazy as fuck ( d. tusk and entourage ) and do n't have even an idea how to solve the situation . 
   a lot of hate from divers true . 
  i 'm a driver and i fucking hate those dickheads . 
  but before you downvote me , let me explain why : 90 % of polish cyclists do n't know traffic regulations : `` let 's fucking ride in the middle of the road , or sidewalk , or pedestrian crossing . 
  red light ? 
  it does n't apply to me . 
  should i signal turning ? 
  never ! '' . 
  additionally they have their monthly dickhead meeting : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/critical_mass_ ( cycling ), 
  with his nose !, 
  ^ ^ sorry , ^ ^ i ^ ^ could n't ^ ^ help ^ ^ myself, 
  well , the fact is that polish economy is still too small . 
  i 'm 100 % pro $ , but we have to get real : adopting euro right now would be a burden for eurozone and us . 
  imo eurozone should unify its fiscal policies deeper and stricter to prevent another `` greek situation '' . 
   the greeks arent getting all that money of course they do n't . 
  that 's not the point of bailout to get money to eat them away . 
  it 's just for a debt roll over and to buy time to apply reforms . 
  btw fuck you guy/girl that downvoted me because of an opinion . 
  this is 3rd bailout . 
  do you think this is easy for creditor countries ? 
  i wish greece all the best . 
  if pl were member of eurozone , i would gladly chip-in to save them . 
  but at the same time i understand german pov . 
  so what ? 
  that guy made a large pile of shit and said `` my job is done !, 
  so long , suckers ! '', 
  `` correct your numbers or we will correct you '', 
  but peaceful denmark ? 
  it 's ... confusing . 
  russia is having a serious problem with diplomacy . 
  to be more exact , they want to viewed as ant russian party , but their actions are completely opposite ( i.e. 
  deliberate damage to eu unity and pl-usa relations ) . 
  are you referring to this : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/why_die_for_danzig%3f ? 
  what ? 
  yeah , you are like austria , but with cute language . 
  that 's absolutely true what you are saying . 
  the problem is that world accepted what russia did to ukraine . 
  sanctions are bypassed , business is going on as usual and money is flowing to russia . 
  i do n't want do mention denouncing because that 's a joke . 
  russians can literary do anything what they want and it will be left without any consequences . 
  this wo n't happen . 
  but business on both sides will suffer . 
  they are talking about missing sock . 
  wow , this poll does n't reflect reality at all . 
  netflix in pl has such sieved library that it is n't worth 2 $ . 
  i do n't understand why they even bother to `` enter '' polish market . 
  it reminds me ebay and yahoo , they were literally crushed by local competitors . 
  ebay 's representatives were laughed at when they said that they wanted to educate polish consumer ( allegro was way more better back then and still is ) .

  deflection for deflection my friend . 
  you started by character assassination , claiming * what i must think * while * i did n't say such things * and then , when i defend myself showing you how wrong you are you accuse me of nitpicking . 
  and funniest part is that i * did * came back to that aspect , my answer was as folows :  it changes nothing !, 
  we do n't want people killing eachother here , being it immigrants or poles !, 
  as soon as we take them in they are our responsibility !, 
  but you * had * to ignore it so you could attack me personally , did n't you . 
  oh man , your bias is just seeping through your pores . 
  i know that you nonchalantly and with irony stated you are anti-polish , but something tells me you * really * are !, 
  lol , again , i did n't say that `` wholesome '' polish murder is better . 
  it is a murder we are responsible for , done by people we created and also by people we know how to manage . 
   you draw an arbitrary line , this time with religion no , it is arbitrary line drawn by region and knowledge of its issues . 
  these people * are * different and they * like * the way they are but when they come here we expect them to live the way * we like * . 
  that creates the whole problem . 
  it is not stereotypes , if these would be then all of nubers would look different and there would be * no * ghettos and issues germany and sweden are facing now . 
   i bet if you say `` murder '' the image in your head is an innocent polish women being murdered by muslim brutes . 
  lol , no . 
  because unlike you i know statistics and for your information , overwhelming victims of murders are * men * . 
  but i like how you image of `` racist idiot '' is wholesome . 
  you problably thinking i 'm sporting some sort of patriotic tattoo too and how i must love football . 
  and that i am a man . 
   does n't matter that of course the majority of victims of immigrant criminals will be other immigrants , we got a narrative to hold up here . 
  it changes * nothing * !, 
  we do n't want people killing eachother here , being it immigrants or poles !, 
  as soon as we take them in they are our responsibility !, 
   what !? 
  if he has to pay german wages , what reason does he have to move production to poland ? 
  something something arbitrary lines , we are all people . 
  wages between munich or frankfurt are not as diffrent as wages in germany and poland . 
  * you enjoy these arbitrary lines . 
  i knew you would that . 
  when our murder rathes were * sligtly * higher then it was a grand argument against me . 
  now it turns around and then `` it does n't matter , you are racist anyway '' and that shows you were right for once , you * are * `` big bad pole hater '' or at least biased because you would use * any * argument , important or not ( ** as you just pointed that it is not , heh ** ) , to stand against our way of doing things . 
  ** `` no bad tactics , only bad targets '' ** , eh ? 
  and it is not only your opinion , dew germans allready were pointing `` slighty higher murder rates '' as an argument to shut me up . 
  now what , it is n't important again ? 
  this all chain of comments come from `` read below to see a live experiment in human bias . '' . 
  i like how people are pointing out bias just when they are biased the same way . 
  so in this context , as i said , that we are taking responsibility for our own people and working on better poland , well , we are doing better than germany * at least in that context right now * . 
  then again , if culture would n't mean anything and borders would be only arbitrary lines then go tell german investors who are building assembly plants in poland to pay poles a german wage , not polish one . 
  because when we are talking about money . 
  why here `` the others '' is fine for germans ? 
  ah yes , it is just business . 
  i might be wrong i do n't say i ca n't be , but at least i 'm not a hypocrite . 
  my mistake ? 
  i did n't make that table . 
  also , i like how you run away as soon as you are proven wrong : ), 
  naaah , someone just put 1 on the wring side of coma . 
  it should be 1.0 , not 0.1 , especially that raw numbers are there and as it goes like ** 2011 : ** 449 ( 1.2 ) , ** 2012 : ** 377 ( 0.1 ) , ** 2013 : ** 298 ( 0.8 ) , ** 2014 : ** 283 ( 0.7 ) you can see that it is nothing but human error . 
  i 've allready submited question about that to the site manager , we will see what they will do . 
  on the other hand , your site has iffy way of sourcing data . 
  http://www.nationmaster.com/country-info/profiles/germany/crime half of these things are from * wikipedia * where wikipedia is a secondary source * and * dates are from 2008 , 2009 , at least in the case of murder , that we are talking about . 
  and lastly , your site uses united nations office on drugs and crime , * my * site as a source of its data ... face it , you tried to use it as an argument against me but it backfired , nowdays you have bigger murder rates . 
  now what ? 
  these are links from https://www.unodc.org/ and that 's err ... united nations office on drugs and crime , i 'm not sure it is legit . / s it leads here : http://www.unodc.org/gsh/ which leads here : https://data.unodc.org/ where under `` crime and criminal justice '' you can find all the data you need , including the ones i linked that * somehow * does n't work on your computer . 
   are we sure poland even knows about all the people murdered ? 
  no , they are rotting on the streets . 
  we have 100,000 police officers , it makes 261 . 
  my source ? 
  http://www.interpol.int/member-countries/europe/poland ** interpol ** . 
  fine enought ? 
  your source is shit , link it here so i can laught . 
  i think * you * might be biased against poland . 
   even if the chance for that is higher than in germany ah yeah , done some digging , look at my other post , i have some fresh data for you . 
   it 's an arbritrary line drawn just like believes , customs , tastes , emotions and everything that makes a human being ... you say `` a king '' but nations were created not only by kings but by peoples will and somehow it is importand for people . 
  it might not be important for you , but do n't say it has no worth . 
  it is like a paper , a coin . 
  at the end it all has no power , it is bit of cellulose or metal that even in raw form has no objective meaning at all , just a lump of mater . 
  but it has meaning for people , for humans . 
  nations are not shaped by kings only , but also by history , by regions , by animals and terrain , by resources , by believes , by climate . 
  you see nations as borders , this is not true . 
  if it would be true then people in africa would n't be murdering each other in the same countries . 
  you have very shallow understanding what a nation is . 
  or just do n't care at all , you are free to do so . 
  just do n't tell people it has no meaning . 
  also to add fresh data : https://data.unodc.org/sys/rpt?reportfile=crime-statistics-homicide-count-data&amp;region=europe&amp;region__label=europe&amp;subregion=eastern%20europe&amp;subregion__label=eastern+europe&amp;country=85&amp;country__label=poland&amp;format=html&amp;fullscreen=true&amp;showtoc=true#state:0 and here https://data.unodc.org/sys/rpt?reportfile=crime-statistics-homicide-count-data&amp;region=europe&amp;region__label=europe&amp;subregion=western%20europe&amp;subregion__label=western+europe&amp;country=118&amp;country__label=germany&amp;format=html&amp;fullscreen=true&amp;showtoc=true#state:0, 
  and these murders are on us , made by our reality , we take responsibility for them and we are going to deal with them in our own way , no need to add external problems into that mix ( and murder is a shortcut , i 'm talking about any form of crime and unrest and tensions ) . 
   and i am not talking for a per-capita basis err  there were a total of 662 murders in germany in 2011  there were a total of 449 murders in poland in 2011 either you are wrong or i do n't know how to read `` not talking for a per-capita basis '', 
  it is not ok to be murdered by pole , i never said that . 
  it is about responsibility for actions , for the country you are building . 
  also , you scold me for thinking in terms of `` the others '' ... well , that 's the problem , people who are flooding en masse your country are thinking just in that terms , for them you are `` the others '' and that 's the biggest problem . 
  and catholics were murdering shit out of people . 
  i 'm not believing in god , you are barking at the wrong tree . 
  but the fact still stands that they grown timmid over these many , many years . 
  you can google numbers yourself . 
   well . . the problem is that you come out at the wrong side of germany well , they were still germans and that 's what i 'm talking about responsibility and building a nation , you are not willing to take them as your responsibility because `` they were commie germans '' . 
  a nation is not a nonsense . 
  wow , you really know how to crook someones words . 
  now read what it would be : it would n't be `` good patriotic '' murder , it would be murder by someone whose background we knew , whose motifs we would understand and upon who our judgement would be full and complete . 
  we could look , as a nation , look victims family in eyes and say `` yes , we as a nation has raised this man in wrong way , his actions are a result of the environment created be us and we are and will be working to create better poland '' . 
  what you can tell ? 
  `` yeah , we let that person in , we know nothing about about that person but hey , you still has bigger chances to be killed by a car ! '', 
  what stinks is your accusation of racism because you can be sure that if * germans * would cause such problems then you would n't be welcomed here either , and that has nothing to do with race and you know that . 
  older polish folks remember how they were welcomed into germany in shortly after ' 89 , with spit and stones . 
  are you including all the mandatory social security contributions ? 
   yeah . . no one is ever murdered in poland . 
  oh come on , do n't pretend it is what i meant but if you want to go that way that way , fine . 
  we at least know * real names * of our people , at least those held for murder . 
   and those `` arguments '' aka prejudice and xenophobia are of course just common sense and only a problem if they are against polish people . 
  polish nationionalism is always wholesome . 
  that 's racist .

  yes , would n't it be wonderful if we lived only among people who agree with us !, 
  indeed , the disconnect between the values of the western and eastern europe has been laid bare . 
  guess it was n't just communism that divided us !, 
  yes , would n't it be wonderful if people we disagree with just moved elsewhere !, 
  obviously . 
  swamp the drain, 
  everyone agrees europe has its limits , even people like me , who think europe should help refugees . 
  europe should strengthen its ties and cooperation exactly so it can better cope with outside crises like this one . 
  like the us a century ago we need to become a bit more imperial or be doomed to be at the mercy of the chaotic world . 
  exactly . 
  complaining about `` identity politics '' puzzles me , as a wide array of modern politics , left or right , are based on identity . 
  ... and a large chunk of trump supporters , president-elect of the united states . 
   and identity politics . 
  what do you mean by that ? 
   pretty sure people we 're certain about the demise of our civilization when women 's suffrage was the hot topic as well . 
  considering the severity of modern anti-feminism , many still are . 
  i did n't get that kind of perfect world vibe from the op . 
  all of this does n't matter if people genuinely believe their entire civilization is being overrun by violent barbarians . 
  when things get existential , a better economy seems irrelevant . 
  what is important to note is that a rigid cap would do more ill than good . 
  so say you reach it and then what ? 
  shoot people on the border ? 
  drop them into a volcano ? 
  what should be done - and is being done - is measures to limit the migration in the first place , by strengthening relevant eu institutions and the like . 
  i do n't want to live in your perfect world . 
  others lived there for centuries , were ethnically cleansed and poles got their houses . 
  hitler 's savagery does not make other evil right . 
  at the very least those people deserve to be remembered . 
  hahahaha, 
  it is the public perception that is wrong , not reality . 
  race is mostly bullshit . 
  i am not sure banning trump t-shirts would help . 
  it is also a pointless feel-good gesture . 
  islamic extremism is a problem , but banning burkas does not affect it in the least . 
  what message would that be ? 
  nobody here likes the burqa , problem is the op advocated deporting people for wearing it , which is crazy . 
  oh , hello , french person , you are typing this from the middle of a no go zone ? 
  have you been forcibly converted to islam yet ? 
  i forgive you , i also sometimes project internet wars onto people who might not necessarily be part of them . 
  please do not assume they get paid . 
  lots of people are horribly wrong entirely for free . 
  are you certain you are replying to my comments and not someone else 's ? 
  i reread my previous remarks in this sub-thread and i do n't see how did you get an impression that i am `` oppressed '' . 
  i was denying the sub is an `` alt-right cesspool '' and was musing on its composition . 
  i have no idea what do you want from me . 
  i used the term loosely . 
  what i see are clear spikes of anti-immigrant activity and a change of tone . 
  it is entirely possible that a group of users is only ever interested in such threads on this sub . 
  only if we deny muslim societies and muslim rulers their agency . 
  the west influenced them , sure , but they also have directed their own countries for decades or centuries . 
  they are not children . 
  additionally , western influence is only partially negative . 
  they certainly helped , but i disagree they are the main cause . 
  it is the societal cultural and economic pressures in islamic countries that are the main culprit . 
  good post . 
  i despise alt-right , but we must better understand our political opponents . 
  reducing them to nazis/leftists/whatever is counterproductive . 
   the alt-right is a different political spectrum , not a subset of the current one . 
  that 's why it is alt-right , not because its in between classical right and far right , but because modern notions of the right do n't serve them . 
  i disagree alt-right is a different spectrum , they are just a different mix of old ideas . 
  they can certainly seem different to people who simplify the political scene too much . 
  which is , sadly , most people . 
  i do n't think a sub is likely to comprehensively represent a group it claims to represent . 
  not saying a lot them are n't horrbile people , though . 
  only some threads get this `` grah grah immigrants are invading '' choir . 
  when you talk about the very same topics in less-crowded threads , the atmosphere is suddenly quite different . 
  which makes me think a lot of regulars do not share the extreme views of those brigades . 
  you are just as mistaken as the guy you are replying to . 
  r/europe hosts a multitude of groups . 
  the anti-immigrant crowd is simply very local and occasionally brigades threads like this one . 
  but calling this place `` an alt-right cesspool '' is a ridiculous hyperbole that helps no one . 
  while i hate the rampant islamophobia in this thread and other parts of reddit , i disagree you can blame islamic extremism on americans . 
  such trends arise naturally , due to a multitude of factors and they eventually wane naturally , due to a multitude of factors . 
  we all get the blame for our nation 's politicians/political decisions . 
  you can be a fanatical anti-war protester and you will still get blamed , by default , for any war your country starts . 
  ignore generalizations , as they are not about you , and explain your position whenever you are actually talking to foreign people about such controversial issues . 
  no way around it , i think . 
  colonies are far away . 
  brexit ruptures a very packed sub-continent . 
  whatever happens we are all worse off . 
   it 's frankly the same on every ~ ~ uk ~ ~ news site these days . 
  whenever i think reddit sucks , i visit a news site comment section , just to get some perspective . 
  yeah , you guys keep doing what you are doing on your side of the ocean . 
  i prefer a society with little to no guns . 
  if we are being nuanced , then the left has been both . 
  pro and anti eu sentiment transcends the left/right divisions , just like many other common ideas . 
  if that was true , romas would have taken possession of europe long ago . 
  we should keep women uneducated and unemployed , as dumb breeders , right ? 
  obviously , the right/left division is a terrible oversimplification . 
  but it is all we have , in public discourse . 
  hence my hesitation . 
  neither `` classic '' right , nor far right , but something in-between . 
  that is not what i said but have fun thinking otherwise . 
  more like `` alt-right '' , perhaps . 
  these nationalist movements are further to the right than mainstream right-wing , but not as far as to be neo-nazi . 
  we just have n't redefined the labelling yet . 
  because russian establishment 's long term strategy is weakening western alliances , like nato and eu . 
  if the french left lets lepen win due to inaction , they will deserve everything that comes to them . 
  yeah , if i used the phone more , i would totally just use a subscription . 
  it really depends on your usage .

  do you have problem with polish citizens suing polish state in strassburg tribunal ? 
  lots of people used these institutions before . 
  the important thing is - how it 's used , not that it is used at all . 
   what polish government is doing is not good yes , and i 'm protesting that . 
   because you have to be blind to not see that everything that has been happening is just power struggle between shitty polish parties i dont care about their supposed motivations , i care about what they do to my country in the process . 
  it 's bad , but it wo n't last long . 
  they already repeat all their errors from their 2-year term of 2007 - arrogance , nepotism , obvious paranoia . 
  and they only bought/persuaded around 35 % of population , while they managed to enrage the rest against them . 
  people already got used to the money , but the corruption and paranoia is more and more irritating . 
  money will end , and pis will fall . 
  hopeful with minimal damage to poland . 
  not very similar , except for loan-words ( mostly government related for example parlament is sejm in polish and sejmas in lithuanian or sth like that ) . 
  lithuanian is baltic group , and polish is slavic group . 
  they are both indoeuropean , and a little closer to each other than let 's say germanic and slavic groups , but still we ca n't understand each other without learning . 
  i could n't understand even 1 word in 10 when i 've heard lithuanians speaking , on the other hand i can understand 30-80 % of words spken in any slavic language ( slovakian , belarussian and ukrainian are the easiest , russian is the hardest ) . 
  btw lithuanian was n't the most popular language in lithuania from commonwealth era - that would be ruthenian ( precursor of belarussian and ukrainian i think ) . 
  lithuania owned a lot of slavic-speaking regions at the time . 
   propaganda wo n't buy medicine , put a roof over your head or fill an empty stomach . 
  that 's why you need cheap vodka as well . 
  polish-lithuanian commonwealth was very progressive for its time . 
  there was a law forbidding to persecute people based on religion and each king ( they were elected btw ) had to sign it before coronation . 
  and if king abused power every nobleman had the right to rebel  if you 're interested in more i recomend : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/warsaw_confederation https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/confederation_ ( poland ) it 's sad how history made this country 99 % catholic and 40 % backward : /, 
  there 's something particulary scary about nanny state going on rampage like that . 
  i do n't know , it 's one thing to have authoritharian regime kill people for whatever reason , it 's basically expected , but when it 's not corrupt people but the system it 's damn scary . 
  like , real-life kafka . 
   you do n't have to be dicks about it . 
  how are they supposed to learn if we do n't make fun of them ? 
  it may be a shock to you , but goering can be wrong too  see vietnam for a war that was supported by government but eventually ended because of population disagreement . 
  another example - japan government ca n't start a war iiuc . 
  and historically - in polish-lithuanian commonwealth king needed all new taxes and wars to be agreed by the nobles ( around 5-10 % of population ) . 
  so yeah , the system makes a difference . 
  it 's for internal use . 
  it shows nicely , how `` average '' russian thinks in the opinion of russian government , if that kind of propaganda is the best they can come up with . 
   antisemitism was absolutely the worst for the jews . 
  i 'm not going to argue that , but they were not the only victims , just the most visible . 
  hitler also put gypsies , muslims , homosexuals , pacifists , slavs , etc in concentration camps ( even before he put jews there ) . 
  the distinguishing factor of 3rd reich was n't antisemitism , but the fact that they went along with all their xenophobies . 
  and in other countries ( some of them with more antisemitism than 3rd reich ) there was no holocaust as long as they had their own stable and relatively sane governments . 
  and the other countries that did genocide ( or mass murder , call it whatever ) was soviet union - again a totalitarian state . 
  i 'm all for fighting discrimination , but i do n't think you can win that fight . 
  even in modern europe people still hate various minorities . 
  the most important is - to have stable system ( government + police ) protecting them . 
  the real problem at the source was n't antisemitism ( which existed everywhere ) , the real problem was resentment over lost war and `` unfair '' treatment afterwards , plus a lot of economic frustration . 
  same thing happens in russia after ussr fell and they had hard 90s . 
  makes people support all kinds of nuts and belive whatever as long as it promises easy solution and scapegoats . 
  and now same thing happens all over the world to a lesser degree - that 's the reason behind trump , kaczy\u0144ski , brexit , golden dawn , orban , erdogan . 
  populism is on the rise . 
   many people become extremist in certain views when they find religion in their adulthood . 
  is n't it funny how he was atheist when it was profitable , and is catholic when it 's profitable . 
  sapkowski sold cdpr rights to make as many witcher games as they wish . 
  i guess that 's one reason he roesn like their success . 
  women live 10-15 % longer than men on average . 
  seems quite an important gender disparity , do n't you think ? 
  why is it ignored ? 
  `` mr x killed mr y and is accused of murder by family of mr y. 
  meanwhile , mr z also killed a man , but is n't accused by the family of mr y. 
  how come ? '', 
  wel - anybody can put the accusation , but it 's not the responsibility of 1 side to accuse every criminal in the world . 
  sorry to disappoint you . 
  russia is n't even communist now . 
  and again  i have n't even mentioned communism . 
  thank you for showcasing your biases by defending against nonexisting accusations . 
  abortion law change is kinda side-effect of pis alliance with radical catholic movements . 
  ca n't say no to these people now  but ask poles about lgbt or refuges ( or jews for that matter ) , and you 'll see where is the problem . 
  same thing . 
  he 's with the people ( british ) against immigrants . 
  pis is with the people ( `` conservative '' poles ) against `` the leftists '' . 
  i put that in quotes because there 's nothing conservative in removing personal liberties and breaking constitution , but that 's their pr . 
  well he was also the guy that invited venetian commision to poland to prove government is not breaking constitution , and when the commision decided it is - he accused them of being politicaly controlled by polish opposition  he 's just that stupid . 
  there is statisticaly significant difference . 
  imho it 's because women have to try harder in poorer countries ( and there 's not much alternatives to `` catching '' a good husband ) . 
  also obesity is not a problem . 
   europe 's last dictatorship we 've got a few more recently . 
  i was under the impression you have lots of empty spaces in your country . 
  yup , it 's `` why not '' money for them . 
  well , `` almost '' no computers . 
  so , no bet ? 
  personal attacks instead . 
  fine . 
  i 'm writting games as a hobby . 
  ensuring 60 fps on mobile is hard . 
  do you want to bet a beer of your choice that you wo n't be able to write a code measuring sth , calculating sin of that , and writing the result to another port on any android device currently on market , and hitting a 10khz window each time ? 
  i am pretty sure c64 can do that . 
  i 'm sure arduino can . 
  i mean a code like this : while ( true ) { new_value_to_send = somecalculation ; noop ; noop ; noop ; send_to_port ( new_value_to_send ) ; } with modern cpu ( that have branch prediction so if they predict correctly they speed up , if next data is in cache - same ) - this takes variable amount of time , so you have to sync it some different way . 
  with 8bit-era cpu the loop takes same time each iteration , so you can directly control some hardware requiring strict timings ( as i suspect system with piezoelectric sensors , sine wave generators and rotating driveshafts do ) . 
  there 's a reason people still buy 8-bit microcontrollers in times when tousand times more powerful raspberry pi is almost as cheap . 
  it worked for 25 years , so it was bough in early nineties . 
  c64 became popular ( available ) in poland after iron curtain fell in 1989 . 
  before that almost no personal computers in poland : / i got my c64 on first communion in 1992 and it was still great gift . 
   i suspect you could just run a commondore emulator on it with this software running in it , and it would do the job . 
  timings would be different , messing up everything . 
  old software interfacing with hardware was usually written depending on the exact time it takes to execute each instruction . 
  ca n't do that on modern cpus with prefetching and branch prediction and many levels of cashes . 
  and then there 's also traditional operating systems and all the abstraction layers adding unpredictable delays , and when you want to control a hardware that needs atttention in short constant intervals - it 's hard . 
  system is based on self-made table for calibrating drive-shafts , connected to generator of sine-wave signal , and piezzo-electric sensors for detecting vibrations . 
  software is self-made too . 
  and you ca n't program it to do real-time , low-latency work ( like measuring how much a turning drive shaft is skewed in this case ) . 
  it 's funny how 1 mhz cpu without operating system can do jobs 1 ghz cpus with operating systems ca n't . 
  then it wastes lots of heat by dumping still warm water to drain instead of heating it again ( less heating needed cause it 's still warm ) .

  according to polls national movement got less then 1 % of voters support . 
  not a slightest chance to get into the parliament . 
   the rivalry between them is set to lead to further fragmentation on the right . 
  extremely doubtful . 
  consolidation before the elections is far more likely - that 's how mentioned national movement was born : from consolidating various local groups of far-right nationalists . 
   if one of these parties loses significantly , it may not survive . 
  but the winner will hold a monopoly on poland 's left for the years ahead . 
  not gon na happen either . 
  both parties will survive . 
  they got way too much support , and public is getting more and more opposed to the struggle between just two parties : pis and po which take most of the attention from media . 
  none of the left-wing parties will win the elections , but whoever wins - tr or sld - might form a coalition with po to form a government after next elections . 
  and one more thing : russia signed treaty to defend territorial integrity of ukraine . 
  that includes crimea being integral part of ukraine . 
   this means that theoretically , the uk is less free than it was before the eu . 
  yea , the great firewall of cameron , and mass surveillance are certainly to blame . 
  sorry , but uk limits freedom of it 's own citizens by far more then eu ever will . 
  sad truth . 
  paper will take anything that written on it . 
  russians proved over and over again that it 's just that : paper . 
  i 'm not sure if there 's enough support for this case among nato members . 
  ukraine is not a member of nato and loosing crimea alone is something west can live with if at the same time they 'll gain rest of ukraine . 
  just to remind you - so far russia did nothing outside of crimea itself - imho they do n't want anything else but the peninsula . 
  as for poland - poland got a problem that it 's always warning west against russians , so long that they slowly get ignored . 
  countries like germany , france or uk do n't really understand mentality of russian government and they way too often assume * good will * . 
  exactly what i was about to say - in every way these guys look like russian troops , not ukrainian nor random militia using weapons bought on a black market . 
  good work sir spotting it . 
   the russian black sea fleet is a damn strong naval force for a body of water that size . 
  it 's not . 
  black sea fleet is - strategically - a fleet for both : black and mediterranean sea . 
  and that makes it rather underwhelming . 
  especially if you consider that almost every ship they got remembers cold war in both : design and weapons . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/black_sea_fleet#list_of_black_sea_fleet_ships compare that for example with italian navy that serves only mediterranean sea : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_active_italian_navy_ships the gap in power is enormous . 
  italians could wipe a floor with black sea fleet probably without loosing even a single ship . 
  one of the rumors says that khruschev was drunk while giving crimea to ukraine , and when he got sober - it was already too late to cancel the deal . 
  answer yourself this : is all of the gas going through nord stream , or ukrainian pipeline is still a blood stream for large part of europe ? 
  ( small hint : gas going through nord stream is n't a subject to all of the transfer fees that other pipelines are , so there 's no reason not to use nord stream as much as possible ), 
  foolish me . 
  got used to talk with people that can be swayed by argumentation . 
   this could only happen if the conglomerate had help from the government who actually can force people to do something . 
  you seriously think that monopolies are created only by governments ? 
  and if you 'd bother to click `` wage slavery '' link i made you 'd read there that it 's '' * quasi-voluntary slavery * '' - government would n't have to force anyone into anything . 
   why would the officer even say ` raus ! ', 
  ( ` out ! ' ) ? 
  read the other posts in this topic . 
  border control officers on some airports ai n't particularly kind . 
  and apparently guy in topic would n't be the first one ever to encounter such behaviour . 
   thanks for sharing , i have never heard of someone basing their vacation destination on exchange rate risk or related expense . 
  it 's not about exchange risk . 
  it 's about using commonly-accepted currency . 
  look at it from this perspective : * citizens of every single country using euro are automatically more inclined to visit slovakia then czech republic simply because it 's cheaper for them , costs much less hassle , and it 's easier for them to figure out prices in relation to their own payments . 
  * citizens of countries around euro zone are more inclined to visit countries using euro if they had some money from their previous visits and/or they conduct business with countries in euro zone . 
   you can usually minimize the costs by using local atms or credit cards that dont charge foreign exchange fees . 
  there 's no way to exchange currency without fees . 
  spread is always there . 
  that 's how they earn money . 
   when was the last time you did n't send your child to school ? 
  when was the last time you drove a car without the security thing which name i forgot ? 
  xd so that 's a slavery ? 
  as i said earlier : loooooooooool, 
  i highly recommend reading that : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/russia%e2%80%93georgia_war#independent_international_fact-finding_mission situation was by far more complex then just russians defending themselves . 
   it 's obvious that if people will see a company is bad - they wo n't buy their products . 
  plenty of examples to confirm ( yay tabacco industry )  we all are slaves right now . 
  weak up . 
  just to remind you , here 's a definition of slavery :  * slavery is a system under which people are treated as property to be bought and sold , and are forced to work * noone is forcing you to work , noone is buying or selling you . 
  right now in poland there 's approximately 10.2 % of people who do n't work but could have . 
  and if you want - you are free to go anywhere and do pretty much anything ( especially if your destination is on a pacific or in south america ) . 
  yea , some of the stuff will require learning , passing tests confirming you are worthy , perhaps also having some experience but in no way you are a slave . 
  though - seeing that post it 's quite clear that you 're a perfect target group for knp . 
  good that there is a party representing people like you - many poles do n't have that privilege - but personally i 'm happy that it stays out of parliament . 
  then comes the cabbage conglomerate and you 're not selling anything at all but rather forced into working for a gigantic food industry ( they got lower prices and better quality thanks to mass production and optimization that you 'll never be able to achieve yourself ) . 
  economic inequality goes out of proportion and after few years your village is forced into [ wage slavery ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/wage_slavery ) . 
  well , russians - or ( depending where you go ) every central and eastern europeans - get exactly the same only other way around : commies , stalin and vodka . 
  i guess one more generation will have to pass for people to stop judging each other by where their grandparents lived or what they did . 
  borderline liberalism is as bad as borderline socialism . 
  luckily : we 're not forced into black & white world . 
  besides - i do n't have time to teach you basics . 
  not at all , really . 
  that 's an understanding on a level of a primary school , nothing more . 
  person that likes to have a realistic view on a world and got some deeper understanding of world-wide politics and more importantly : economy . 
  but yes - i am proud from being european , just like i am proud from being pole . 
  if you try to suggest that these two exclude each other - they do n't . 
  [ not exactly half ] ( http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/sb10001424052702304644104579193992459983238 ) . 
  that was truth year ago , not any more . 
  besides - situation is really much more complicated then it seems . 
  ukrainians are very proud of their independence - even pro-russian people think of them as a brotherhood nation , but a separate one . 
  they wo n't stand russians taking over ukraine just like that . 
  obviously one leads to another . 
  `` almost one in eight potential voters -- had signed wednesday a petition to demand a referendum on the pursuit of eu membership '' - holly shit . 
  you got some serious democracy going there !, 
  1 out of 8 voters willingly signed non-government petition for . . well ... 
  anything ?!, 
  now that 's something unseen here on the continent . 
  be proud - even for that one reason . 
  glue ? 
  no , it 's solvent . 
  that 's a timeline of everything since 15th century till 21st century . 
  ok : almost everything - only conflicts where russia sent their army . 
  unofficial involvement is n't shown on that list . 
  and russia-georgia war was started by russia which unlawfully had it 's armed forces supporting puppet - `` government '' on georgian territory . 
  all that georgia did was attempting to take back lands that lay within it 's borders .

  as always . 
  they may take our lives but they wo n't take our dank memes !, 
  seriously though , it is kinda sad . 
  funny images wo n't change the reality and the reality is europe has a problem and no idea how to solve it . 
   communist monopoly board game i played `` kolejka '' several times and it 's a lot of fun . 
  russia can go fuck herself for all i care . 
   over the weekend , ipn reported that russia 's consumer watchdog rospotrebnadzor warned that the game is perceived as `` anti-russian '' and excessively critical of the soviet system . 
  well , since almost all poles are anti-russian and `` excessively critical of the soviet system '' i guess they are kinda right in this regard . 
  sure - if you leave me be in la plata !, 
  i 'm cool with it , seems logical . 
  so i take it that this list : 1 . 
  ottomans 1 . 
  france 1 . 
  venice 1 . 
  lithuania 1 . 
  sweden is correct , is it ? 
  so ... this means that papal states are a great power , right ? 
   let me know if anything is incorrect or if i forgot anyone . 
  glorious italian alliance is not counted as one state and we are a ( loose ) confederation after all . 
   which foreign tourists have the worst reputation russians . 
   and why ? 
  they are russians . 
  seriously though i think it would be ... british ? 
  pissed lads pissing on our clean streets in krak\u00f3w and all that . 
  was n't this disaster featured in `` candide '' ? 
   displacing millions of gallons of water remove gallons - this is glorious yurop not murica , we have superior metric system !, 
   france is papal controller [ in case you do n't realize what you 've just said . 
  i denounce them as false christians , for only the abhorrent and unclean would join accursed savoyard heretics in attack against his holiness . 
  weak england + weak austria + weak burgundy + pro-french castille = bbb gone wild, 
  sad to hear this ; good luck and let 's hope your successor will be worthy !, 
  i also made a [ map of the second crusade against ottomans ] ( http://i.imgur.com/sercmwx.png ) as of 1 january 1500 . 
  if anyone wants more maps just let me know and i 'll see what can i do , 
  venice ** italian alliance ( relatively ) stronk, 
  or you could play as aztecs and prepare glorious invasion of europe :p, 
  inb4 swedes immigrating because sweden is dangerous . 
   turkish - russian alliance to balance the franco - iberian alliance . 
  and italy will be right in the middle  _ <, 
   i hope you know what you 're doing we hope so too . 
   good luck . 
  you guys have played well so far !, 
  thanks but it 's not us - it 's the will of god himself .

  i 'll just post this screenshot showing [ ** glorious battle of the italian alliance vs ottoman & muscovite heathens ** ] ( http://i.imgur.com/hsmbdyt.jpg ) .

  and here 's a [ ** screenshot showing glorious battle of the italian alliance ( his holiness , serene republic and great tyrol ) vs ottoman & muscovite heathens ** ] ( http://i.imgur.com/hsmbdyt.jpg ) .

  where were you when we took constantinople from the heathens ?

  with all respect to his regime victims , hitler and stalin were in a completely different league .

  and that 's how to tell whether the country you are from was on the wrong side of the iron curtain . 
  aww yiss, 
  please do , i would love to take a closer look before the game starts .

  i know everybody will be busy playing but it would be nice to have some screenshots ( steam ones or f10s map saves ) . 
  hormuz can into space it seems, 
  yeah , something like this . 
  or maybe we should start a new sub ( / r/europeplayseu4 or something ) ? 
  / u/ilikemoneytoo - make sure to start a new thread ( summary + maps and stats pls ) , 
  i see . 
  alright then , next time perhaps . 
  pls use rnw , it 's gon na spice things up  i think i 'll stick with papal states , never played as them in singleplayer . 
  btw accept my invitation on steam please . 
  question to / u/ilikemoneytoo - will we use random new world ? 
  also which nations are left ? 
  i do n't know which one should i pick . 
  any majors left or just some scraps in rotw ? 
  for now ** i claim papal states ** . 
  sure ... 
   what is general relationship between poland and ukraine ? 
  `` it 's complicated '' . 
  we share a difficult past ( for instance check [ khmelnytsky uprising ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/khmelnytsky_uprising ) and [ volhynian slaughter ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/massacres_of_poles_in_volhynia_and_eastern_galicia ) ) but i think that if we deal with that we can be good neighbors . 
  i 've been to ukraine once , it 's a beautiful country although ruined by soviet union and corruption . 
  the whole crimea affair brought us together somewhat - i even sent some food and other basic supplies together with my family to ukraine shortly after annexation ( there was a national action , you could send a package free of charge via public post ) . 
  i have nothing against ukrainians . 
  i hope one day we can be closer as nations . 
  plus everyone who does n't like russia is half-way to become a pole 's friend anyways . 
  nobody i know cares . 
  [ here you go . 
  ] ( https://youtu.be/qcy68cwdkve ), 
  you have my vote . 
   holocaust role role of a victim , that is . 
  unlike the french for instance we did n't cooperate with nazis by betraying our fellow citizens of jewish origins . 
  i 'm not a big fan of these legislative plans but seriously , if you think poland participated in holokaust you can go fuck yourself . 
  so basically : racism + guns = more violence racism - guns = less violence who would have thought ? 
  is this another infamous russian `` xaxaxa i trick you '' ? 
  russian bombs ca n't melt polish planes !, 
  ** russia ** is a beautiful country with incredibly rich cultural heritage and amazing landspaces , from kaliningrad to petropavlovsk-kamchatsk and vladivostok . 
  please stay where you are , russian soldiers , no need to go on vacations to other countries .

  donald trump is n't a republican , he 's just running as a republican to avoid being marginalized as a third-party candidate , i think .

  i am no expert on this topic but there may have been jewish collaborators or something of the sort .

  in 2016 it was ~ 16\u00a0182\u00a0000 people . 
  in 2004 it was ~ 13\u00a0768\u00a0000 people . 
  how is that relevant if we disagree about him being a collaborant ? 
  the balance will be moving further and further towards higher education , no matter if we want it or not . 
  look at farming - at one point majority of population was working in farming . 
  now it 's a few percent in developed countries . 
  next big shift will be transport - self-driving cars are almost there . 
  bit by bit physical jobs will disappear , and it 's much better to prepare people for that when they are young . 
  there 's maybe 1 000 000 of them in 38\u00a0000\u00a0000 country . 
  noticeable , but not nearly enough to do all the physical work . 
  most killed people in occupied poland durin ww2 was jews therefore israel invaded poland . 
  was selling whiskey to native americans a collaboration from usa standpoint ? 
  to me it seems more corelated with how small the country is .

  or do you deny the fact crimea is now recognized by russia as part of russia ? 
  i do n't know . 
  in my city they 've started building an opera/theatre in 1974 and finished this year .

  so 20 % makes sense ? 
  ban on encryption is ban on math . 
  it 's government telling you `` you ca n't use this number or that algorithm '' . 
  it 's absurd , it violates basic human rights , enforcing it is impossible for the few people who care enough , and it barely helps fighting terrorism . 
  on the other hand mass survilance is very profitable thing to do , no matter if you 're big companies or government , so i see the appeal for them . 
  if we 're not concerned with human rights anymore - much easier and more effective solution to terrorism would be to ban all religions ( at least untill you 're 18 y.o. 
  giving up essential freedom for possible minor decrease in terrorist attacks is so stupid i ca n't even ... are you at least consistent and support forbidding cars as well ( the death toll is much higher ) ? 
   why do people deserve privacy ? 
  you 're looking at it the wrong way - it 's not that they deserve privacy ( which they do , but that 's irrelevant here ) , it 's that they deserve the freedom to record any numbers they want on their digital media , and to run any algorithm on that numbers that they wish . 
  and that government should not be able to torture you or imprison you to force you to tell them what number you recorded . 
  anything else is absurd , honestly , and result in banning numbers and `` thought crimes '' . 
  these rights alone give you right to encrypt whatever you want . 
  lol , they wrote lubin instead of lublin ( different city , oposite side of poland ) . 
  also no warsaw ( but that 's reasonable - it was a bigger village then  ) . 
   poland was exactly the same , during the 90s there was no `` country '' . 
  people were stealing whatever they could . 
  i was alive then and nobody i knew was stealing . 
  if anything - the most stealing happened near the end of communism when it was often the only way to get such rare goods as concrete , styrofoam , or even toilet paper . 
  as for millionairs - could you explain to me how it happened that poland was stealing so much , and yet we do n't really have oligarchs , unlike most post-soviet countries ? 
  even `` western '' and `` civilized '' czech republic , that is much smaller country - has oligarchs . 
  we do n't . 
  kulczyk does n't even come close . 
  how comes if they were stealing so much ? 
  yes it was wild times , and harsh for people . 
  but not because of some conspiracy or stealing . 
  simply because most of the economy had no value , and there were tremendous differences between poland and the west - and you could capitalize on that very easily . 
  who went into import business could make a fortune in a year . 
  who tried to survive producing useless stuff nobody needed anymore - went bust . 
  the original marshall plan after ww2 was available for eastern block countries too . 
  ussr made them decline the help because evil capitalism . 
  poor russians , if not for that they could 've continued to opress all these millions of people in estern block to this day . 
  damn shame they stopped . 
  btw when russians steal from russians it 's the fault of the west . 
  when russia invades ukraine and annexes part of it - it 's also fault of the west . 
  just so we 're clear on that issue . 
  well he is . 
   they do n't hide it , their plan was clear and consequences are as well . 
  they planned 3.8 % gdp growth for 2016 . 
  we 've got less than 3 % .

   right now any reporter can enter polish parliment that 's just false . 
  exact rules here : http://www.sejm.gov.pl/media8.nsf/files/zjei-acgdt8/%24file/zarzadzenie_ms_1_2008.pdf journalists have to register and get the `` karta prasowa '' . 
  do n't take the propaganda of either side on face value . 
  it 's frustrating , but you really ca n't repeat anything political seen on tvp or tvn without checking for yourself novadays . 
  it 's lies half the time . 
  and most recently in tvp i 'd say 70 % of the time : /, 
  it 's not like making non-ethnicaly-related people shoot each other is better . 
   also did n't the previous government do the things the current one is doing but in reverse ? 
  no  also are n't the protests funded by previous government i was n't . 
  people i know were n't . 
  there were 3 guys with sld flags and maybe 10 with nowoczesna flags . 
  probably they were paid . 
  still are  well , except l'viv is not polish anymore . 
  there was invention and popularization of cheap artifical fertilizers in the meantime . 
  what separates hlodomor from the rest - was the fact that it was the most fertile land in soviet union , and they took their seeds away and created the starvation artifically and forbid them to leave and forbid them to trade for food . 
  yes but pis is more left compared to most opposition parties , 
  well the only country i 'm aware off that tried to ban such low-level markets were soviet union during hlodomor , and the result was millions starved . 
  i take `` people not starving in grain-exporting countries '' as basic indicator of `` it works '' . 
  tvp had not shown that so it did n't happen , 
  there was po , nowoczesna , psl , razem , sld on these protests . 
  economically all but razem are right-wing compared to pis . 
  pis propganda , obviously . 
  max kolonko unbiased  btw : i do n't even own tv . 
   and if po were at power those three branches would be at the same spot as they were now that 's bullshit - ask 10 random polish lawyers . 
   true change will come with now young generation . 
  god forbid poland will be ruled by guys elected by teens listening to max kolonko :(, 
  you do n't see a difference between usa ( where american citizen can vote ) and russia ( where russian citizen can vote ) ? 
  both countries seem exactly as democratic to you ? 
  hell , even in north korea there are elections . 
  democracy - check . 
  pis just voted without members of oppositon , not using electronic system , or even the only other legal alternative - voting with signed cards . 
  instead they just roughly calculated votes by counting hands ( opposition was still protesting and they have n't informed them where they moved ) . 
  it 's not even sure if they had quorum . 
  some pms were signing the list outside , after the voting ( for example ziobro ) . 
  https://twitter.com/stasinskim/status/810615491614175232 sorry but po never did anything resembling this . 
  and that 's voting on fucking budget for 2017 ... kinda important . 
  but kaczy\u0144ski approved so it 's formality , right ? 
  the whole voting stuff is just a show ... 
  since pis took power it 's chaos and incompetence all over the place , i just wish they all go to hell and we can have normality again . 
  even fucking sld was better . 
  as a pole : i disagree about the old people , and about the oposition doing the same things as pis does .

  ignoring primitive ad hominem insults that does n't consist any argumentation . 
  i can change my mind if proven wrong . 
  by insults or `` no one i 've met says that '' ( and those are apparently all argumentation that my `` discutants '' are having ) you wo n't prove any point , beside that you 're an asshole that ca n't stand that someone is saying something you do n't like or feel uncomfortable with . 
  not yet , us , but it 's there somewhere . 
  nothing in this world is everlasting . 
   if the baltics would want to join this hypothetical euro nato , they will be allowed to join , end of discussion . 
  you did n't really prove your point , the argument `` no one i 've met says that '' is not an argument at all . 
  so it 's not an end of discussion to me . 
  i still hold my views . 
   the problem was not turmoil in russia , but consolidation of power and creation of brutal totalitarian state with objective of global domination . 
  it seems you did n't read my whole post . 
  not russia as one state ( which in my opinion is n't the best thing for russians themselves as human beings ) . 
  that 's probably true , however technology should and partly did soften the opression . 
   what 's the point of a military alliance if only members that are not likely to have a war be in it . 
  rationality that should make you avoid potential unnecessary risk ? 
  why go for a war if you do n't have to ? 
  military alliances are n't some charity . 
  it 's business . 
  and what do you have in return ? 
  why insurance companies will cost you more if you 're having a risky job ? 
  why insurance for hiking in mountains is cheaper than insurance including climbing ? 
  the same reason why estonia would n't rather be included in european nato and why israel is n't in nato . 
  `` we 're not romania '' . 
  these words from such a figure would shocked me or at least disgusted me few years ago . 
  it 's not about the fact of the conflict itself , but about the possibility of a potential conflict in the future . 
  i do n't think baltics would be included anyway . 
  by the same reasons why israel is n't in nato . 
  you 're generalising and over-simplyfying . 
  i 'm from ee and i 'm more afraid that russia will start disintegrating , which would have devastating short-term after-effects in the region , especially for our economies . 
  also , destabilized heartland is a very dangerous thing for ee becouse in such conditions it 's easy for an aggressive force to rise there . 
  then it usually goes west ( mongols , soviets and so on ) . 
  russia disintegrated in 1917 , end where did that put us ? 
  besides , fear from invasion does n't have to mean , that the afraid person thinks russia is strong , often invasion is a result of internal weakness . 
  that 's why protestantism started . 
  the rulers wanted to control the church so they could gain more power in their societies . 
  in most cases it ended with the destruction of state-church institutional separation , which was a catholic thing . 
  then columbus would n't swim west . 
  the reason was that europeans lost influence in trade as islam conquered those territories and especially when ottoman empire was built . 
  but i do n't think you can put an equal sign between `` the west '' nad those christians that once dominated middle east . 
  imagine , that christians were once majority in iraq . 
  those christians are a civilisation that died out after muslim conquests and it has little to do with the west understood as a geopolitical construct . 
  that culture has had a completely local context . 
  it 's rather the other way around , the west was higly influenced by middle east , becouse of christianity . 
  are you like 14 , or something ? 
  becouse this is the level of argumentation and ignorance you 're presenting . 
  do n't feel offended ( too much ) , it 's just that i 'm feeling like it 's 2003 when reading you . 
  did you actually read the book ? 
  becouse it 's in large part against your claims . 
  no , it 's well put . 
  in my opinion it 's temporary . 
  religious people are having much more kids . 
  present scandinavian culture is n't offering much to a viking personality . 
  if i would have to define protestantism with one word , it would be exaggeration . 
  protestants interpret christiany in the choosen way and then go all the way to the ultimate limit , becoming ultra-pures in the direction once obeyed . 
  after that , the pendulum swings back and backfires their churches which start to be in many ways the opposite thing to the reasons why these churches were established ( mainly , to be pure as fuck , now becoming as liberal as they can be ) . 
  the catholic church on the other hand , becouse of its centralised structure , constantly needs to search for compromises between all those fractions inside the church to cut schismas . 
  it makes it more lukewarm as more and more traditions rise inside the cc during the ages . 
  i 'm having a good laugh at those `` experts '' from newspapers who wrote that trump wo n't do much in his first year , becouse he would have to focus on cleaning up america from the obama legacy . 
  we had some fights but poles always seen many good sides in turkey becouse it was seen as a geopolitical counterweight against russia ( to some extent ) . 
  some romantic writers even went there fought there , these references are present in our literature . 
  your and ours nobility basically melted into commonwealth nobility . 
  in the east , nobles with ruthenian or lithuanian roots were even the majority of the higher nobility after they decided to get polonized to gain influence and power in the country . 
  the whole commonwealth thing started as a personal union becoue your prince decided to marry a polish queen and become our king . 
  it was a political deal , pushed by the nobility , however after few decades it was hard to tell who is a polish , ruthenian or lithuanian nobility . 
  even few tatar families got into being part of our nobility after they integrated into that society . 
  v4 has a geopolitical sense only in relation with our western partners . 
  when it comes to russia , our interests differ . 
  you can often hear a common v4 voice on things related with eu issues , hardly ever on what russia does . 
  and i do n't blame anyone . 
  it 's how geography works . 
  often ? 
  yeah , i know that , i 'm not the one having problem with that . 
  i do n't know why are you being downvoted for just telling a fact . 
  the catholic church will never allow gay marriages . 
  deal with it , people . 
  probably the context in which the words were put . 
  how much does a church have to have in common with other lutherans to be accepted as lutheran . 
  is n't spain doing better lately ? 
  becouse all immigrants are the same . 
  what for ? 
  so they can become bigoted atheists ? 
  most atheists and non-atheists as well have no idea about how evolution works despite some general understanding which is usually wrong . 
  i know , but it 's not how it works . 
  no normal person wants war . 
  but they happen . 
  your loss, 
  no , it is n't if you 're smart enough . 
  i pretty much , more or less , in a general sense predicted what will happen in global politics a decade ago . 
  the only thing that really surprised me is how fast it 's happening . 
  1 . yet 2 . 
  i did n't say it ever will and i do n't think there ever ( in predictable future ) be a british empire 2.0 . 
  a tail ca n't wag a dog . 
  c . this was a false 180 becouse those are two approaches towards two different unions . 
  england staying in eu ensured that eu is an unsteerable block that stabilizes the continent but at the same time is unable to develop into something more . 
  with england , the main brakesman , being outside , us ca n't risk that the eu will integrate into something more . 
  one hybrid-empire challenge at a time is enough . 
  i agree , however , their decision will be based on calculations including current trends and the fact that the presidential term in russia is 6 years . 
   influential political donors looted the place with the help of russian insiders  human catastrophe for russia , which was faciliated by the west . 
  those are your opinions which are n't facts to me as you still did n't bother to prove it or explain how this mechanism worked . 
  becouse of that it seems to me that 's something you choose to believe , not something you really have knowledge about .

  you get my point . 
  well you took it to extrime , i guess . 
  we are far from having neonazis - given our history . 
  right wing retards , sure , we have plenty . 
  our problem with muslims is their lack of adaptation and thinking : i should get everything for free . 
  no you wo n't get a shit for free and you better start learning skills useful in a new country . 
  is this so much to ask for ? 
  these days it 's basically a frozen conflict . 
  both sides fortified their lines and peace treaty does n't hinder exchanging fire . 
  people still die there . 
  as far as i 'm aware russian gov. 
  workers were told to take days off and go there with families for holidays . 
  no idea if it was paid by government or not . 
  so they were trying to kill you ? 
  but it 's a single animation and i thought op wanted a list of more regular animated series rather than one shots . 
  then why do we hear in news about some coloured madman with guns shooting to people every now and then there ? 
  for some reason we or other countries with low number of muslims do n't have this problem . 
  i would avoid all countries who have problem with muslims : germany , france and belgium . 
  they should fix their problem with multi-culti first if they want tourists to feel safe there . 
  something , something ongoing war ? 
  mostly floods if anything at all . 
  [ jaja ] ( https://www.google.pl/search?q=jaja&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewjb-6-qw-dpahvcbhqkhtuzdy4q_auiccgb&amp;biw=1366&amp;bih=613 ), 
  it 's a draw between tusk ( traitor who fled to brussels , merkel 's servant ) and kaczy\u0144ski ( considered insane by some ) . 
  pick your poison . 
  gals yes , but it varies from person to person and guys never . 
  it 's perceived gay af . 
   basically people from any country in europe will say it 's their national characteristic that they like to drink and to complain . 
  vatican too ? 
   you may have been fucked by communism economically but you will recover in time . 
  sure , but it 's very unlikely it will happen during their lifetime . 
  so basically , poland a and b  . 
  my only regret why the heck english had to be polluted with `` french '' . 
  w h y ? 
  i find words of french origin in english as really fucked up pronunciation-wise . 
  i have nothing to french as language , but i was n't signing up for learning it with english , just ... no . 
  maybe not speak as i have hardly any chance to use english in that way , but it 's a `` must have '' in it . 
  on everyday basis , it helps reading manuals/tutorials and i write every now and then on various forums . 
  do n't expect some 3d stuff or omg special effects . 
  german - the most frequently picked as the second foreign language . 
  why ? 
  as our richer neighbour the offer better prospects for well-paid job and generally life standard . 
  it 's one of the most important trade partner in eu and many german companies relocate their offices e.g. 
  amazon of lufthansa . 
  we have some difficult history with them , but money is money . 
  russian - used to be the most important 25 years ago  . 
  those days it 's mostly taught near our eastern boarder . 
  valued in business . 
  french , spanish - unless you want to go abroad , teach or work as a guide or as diplomat , i see no big value to learn those . 
  french used to be important here , especially in diplomacy , but lost its position to english . 
  already existing law seems to suit our needs . 
  the existing law is intend to make abortion only available in very specific cases , especially with our very low birth-rate . 
  i do n't justify having a kid from rape or other pathology , but getting an abortion instead of anti-conception is simply stupid . 
  no need to . 
  you reminded me how germans write tickets in english in our bug reporting system : every noun written by capital letter . 
  what do you get by getting a polish pass over a german one ? 
  still imo german pass  polish pass . 
  pierogi ( preferably ruskie - sic ! ), 
   some context : i was talking to two of my european friends ( separately , not at the same time ) and when they found out that i drive a pickup truck they both started laughing and giving me a hard time about fulfilling the `` cowboy '' stereotype . 
  i guess you can partly blame for it omnipresence of guns in the usa . 
  after all it was one of cowboy 's attributes . 
  go for german , i mean if you want to earn serious money dach countries is a way to go . 
  besides , english and german are the same family of languages , so it might be easier for your to learn it . 
  out of curiosity , how do you feel about that * worse * part of your country ( ddr ) ? 
  it was also communistic . 
   father says it 's medical , but of course , it 's rakija with an even more questionable alcohol content making it perhaps flammable . 
  fair enough . 
  accepted . 
   i do with the czech/polish ones because their new names are so hard to pronounce . 
  trust me - it works both ways . 
   krakk\u00f3 i guess you do n't have two u-s in hungarian like we do in polish ( u / \u00f3 ) and this is some sort of accent ? 
  i think you had your limit of * master races * in history ... 
   hoff come on [ kung fury ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztidn2dbyby ), 
  they are outsourcing because it 's very cheap - think india or china , but within eu and probably better trained . 
  if it were so good as you say , we would n't go to the uk , germany and other rich countries working there for our better future . 
  in statistics yes , but if you want to buy stuff like tv , computers , cars , go abroad you 're piss poor . 
  purchasing power is horrible . 
   my ( old ) country ( poland ) hidden german option ? 
   tell hitler he ca n't draw . 
  well at least his book is still [ selling well ] ( https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2016/02/23/hitlers-mein-kampf-is-now-a-best-seller-in-germany/ ) . 
  i hope it wo n't end up like the last time it was popular ... 
  you are making history !, 
  so basically an extensive entertainment at national level ? 
   generally germans are kinda trusted by everyone overconfidence is a slow and insidious killer ... v4 begs to differ . 
  why not the best of the two worlds ? 
   ( you know , because of its commie past , and americans do n't like commies so much ) i think it has more to do with high overstay percentage and general wealth gap than commie past . 
  it 's not true . 
   dual citizenship  allowed under following circumstances :  4 ) if a child born to german parents acquires another citizenship at birth ( e.g. , based on place of birth [ birth in jus-soli countries mostly of the americas ] , or descent from one parent [ one german parent and one foreign parent ] ) . 
  more info : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/german_nationality_law#dual_citizenship, 
  german is way better . 
  you will have problems getting to the usa with a polish one . 
  i have 3 candidates as picking one might be kinda hard , given how mixed traits we have from west and east . 
  - ukraine ( geographically-wise ) - the same family of languages , share the same sad communist past , used to be one country for some time in the history - hungary - not much too say , our brother in arms ( and drinking ) !, 
  - croatia - southern slavs , similar language ( to some extend ofc ) , same religion , one of the two the most popular and safe destinations for poles in 2016 within eu next to spain if i had to pick just one , i would probably lean towards hungary . 
   we tend to be self-important with delusions of grandeur about our role in the region and the world [ christ of nations ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/christ_of_europe ), 
  germany and russia tried to wipe us from european map for many centuries , but we are still here !, 
  you mean imported or locals ? 
  nordic stereotypes hmmmm ... lots of snow , rich , pale , heavy drinkers . 
  for me finland associates with : vodka , snow , sauna and fighting russians ( +1 in my book ) . 
   ichuj : for when you really want to give a fuck !, 
  :d ftfy potential here is limitless ...

  their failure was preceded by layers and layers of bullshit and idiocy . 
  but whatever , believe in kaczynski strategic genius if you want . 
  part of the plan my ass , sure he was gambling , he did n't have anything else left . 
   i do n't really want to worry you , but the alleged `` incompetence '' is considerably overblown by certain faction of media . 
  haha , whatever , just observe . 
  i have seen it before , done by the very same people and they behave exactly like they did before . 
  no need to trust my prediction , really , just see what they do and how they do after they eliminate the constitutional opposition . 
   their previous stint in government included clever long-term moves , such as destroying both populist parties that were naive enough to enter coalition with them , and taking over a better chunk of their electorate . 
  if that 's the reason you infer that they `` will destroy themselves '' then you sadly completely failed to understand much of what happened during the last ten years . 
  oh , so early elections and loss of power for a decade was a success ? 
  cool . 
   they wo n't , everyone that could lead a conflicting faction has been long purged/left on his own long ago . 
  i do n't necessarily disagree here , kaczynski is great at eradicating anyone with half a personality . 
  still , these are human beings and the parliamentary club is large . 
  humiliations will be dished out , factions will arise , ambitions will conflict . 
  coupled with external pressures due to gross incompetence as well as the petty and emotional nature of traditionalist-paranoid right-wing , the chance for some kind of fracturing is large . 
  time will tell , of course , but i have little doubt in their considerable hubris . 
  kk , it is only based on observing this party for over ten years , including their previous stint in the government . 
  they will destroy themselves , i jsut hope they do n't damage the country too much in the proccess . 
  but oh well , the nation has chosen , it got what it deserves . 
  hahahaha hey , whatever man . 
  you know what they have in spades ? 
  incompetence . 
  you will have many more moments when you will have to tell yourself `` media is tarnishing their image '' . 
  but hey , cognitive dissonance is unpleasant , i wish you luck . 
  that 's mostly because you ca n't burn machetes for heating . 
  they do n't have any ? 
  well , perhaps they can request some from nato . 
  i hear turkish aa units are available . 
  we do have this saying in poland as well . 
  sams do shoot planes down , yes . 
  no , no erdogan . 
  he was simply lucky that this situation required an asshole . 
  assholes are not required 99 % of the time . 
  haha , no putin would not attack nato over a plane . 
  why not ? 
  technically possible and really , what is russia gon na do ? 
  maybe we want some more of politicians than just be shrewd players ? 
  not being asshole bullies ? 
  perhaps there is more to a leader than just be a good tactician ? 
  and by the way , putin is not the grandmaster you paint him as . 
  and certainly not a good leader of his country . 
  no , but they will pursue a pro-russian policy and attempt to quit/cripple nato , something that physically protects my polish ass from russian bullying . 
  you see no way for those two forces to act at the same time ? 
  you know at least some of those parties freely admit getting funds from putin ? 
  front national , for example ? 
  he is funding an anti-nato party out of goodness of his heart , in your opinion ? 
  all the more reason to be wary of external actors using the situation to sow further discord . 
   i acknowledge that not all muslims are murderbots . 
  i also despise part of the company i 'm in when i oppose quotas - there are some really nasty people with fascist tendencies , and i am revolted by the fact that i can technically be grouped with them . 
  the polarization of the discussion is pretty terrible indeed . 
  i wish the debate was with people like you , instead of the `` muslim invasion ! '', 
  crowd . 
   bad for poland as a precedent - importing problems we do not currently have . 
  well , as i wrote we already took tens of thousands chechens . 
  syrian numbers would be similar and it would be extremely unlikely to create any problems . 
  note that countries like france have millions of people of muslim background , while we would have at most couple of thousand staying permanently . 
   bad for europe - there are undeniable problems and no , it 's not racist to acknowledge them . 
  they are undeniable problems but europe is already stuck with it . 
  thus , it would be positive of us to share the burden , at least a little bit . 
   bad for syrian refugees in poland - do you know how much polish-arabic interpreters are paid in the service of gulf companies and embassies ? 
  how many there are ? 
  will they accept what is essentially the job of a social worker , one of the worst paid jobs in poland ? 
  this is more of a problem with terrible polish labor environment , not with refugees themselves , i think . 
   bad for syria and iraq themself . 
  when risk of service in iraqi forces is grounds enough for asylum , who 's left to fight ? 
  well , you ca n't really force people to fight in a war , especially a war that has so many sides and is as hopeless . 
  and many of them already tried but left the rebellion or assad 's army after years of grinding conflict . 
  note : anyone who calls you islamophobic for what you said is a fool . 
  islamophobia is painting muslims as some kind of incompatible homogenous aliens that want to invade us , multiply and then overthrow us in a few decades . 
  quite a popular stance nowadays , sadly . 
  perhaps i was not precise - i focused on the muslims living in the western societies . 
  obviously some do have backward preconceptions from their home countries , but i actually do believe they behave differently out of pure-muslim countries , as humans do not exist in a vacuum . 
  but you obviously have your strong convictions , so whatever , feel free to throw further invectives at me if you feel like it . 
  well , the vast majority of muslims are n't religious lunatics either and neither is their culture completely incompatible with ours . 
  see , that is the kind of approach i am talking about . 
  seeing muslims as some aliens from outer space , coming to inject us with kebab . 
  some muslim communities are problematic , isolationist , fucked up and backwards . 
  but they are not fundamentally incompatible and they are not a faceless frothing jihadi army . 
  they are not mysterious . 
  we can flip germany now , sure , but do n't be surprised if there is less willingness to accommodate poland when we have different views on , say , russia and there is a pipeline to prevent or whatnot . 
  i find it also jarring , because the numbers of refugees we would eventually take would be really small . 
  we already gave asylum to tens of thousands chechens ( who are muslim and many of whom take part in international islamic terrorism ) and it did n't have any noticeable impact on our country . 
  essentially , we are telling germany to go fuck themselves for no real gain , simply because we fear teh muslams . 
  it is also about spirit of the union . 
  our actions now will reflect in the next negotiations as well as when we have a problem that the rest of eu might not find as important . 
  the posters i was replying to suggested eastern europeans see some obvious solutions because they are not shackled by political correctness . 
  but i am not sure estonia solved their minority issues much better than france solved theirs . 
  it is not about keeping mouths shut , it is about not pretending to have all the solutions because it seems all so easy from afar . 
  eu funds good . 
  eu burdens bad . 
  us policy often touches things far away from the us , so it is a bit different . 
  of course not . 
  but it is better to be less judgemental and sure in one 's proclamations when you have little experience with the subject matter . 
  and how do you precisely fix the problem ? 
  i am sure the french would love to know . 
  would n't ireland be partitioned into a clusterfuck of semi-tribal duchies too ? 
  oh right , france is doomed etc. 
  exactly . 
  the problem is real and terribly difficult , but people with little contact with foreigners often default to seemingly simple radical solutions that often are actually counter-productive or not feasible .

  you mean formally ? 
  not much if at all ...

  now try that with reddit 's teeny tiny flags ... 
  have you been watching the chaiman 's ear or something ? 
  there is also the republic of serbia flag ( republika srpska ) . 
  looks kinda like the russian flag at first glance but then [ it comes at you looking like this ] ( http://fotw.fivestarflags.com/images/b/ba-rs.gif ) all the while the russian flag [ looks like this ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/archive/f/f3/20120812153730%21flag_of_russia.svg ), 
  america is n't in the eu , though . 
  i personally doubt it does since 99 % of western europe ( correct me if i am wrong ) has not actually experienced communism . 
  the 1 % is reserved for the former east germany ... 
  you guys also have the ocean right next to you and that can create humid conditions where even though it 's a reasonable temperature outside you still feel colder because of the humidity . 
  i lived in florida which is surrounded by the ocean and winters were horrible there because you could not put on enough clothes to get warm since the humidity would just make you colder . 
  because they might be young enough to not have lived under a communist regime so they idealize it and think `` it 'll be different this time !, 
  are n't they freezing at this point ? 
  :p surely they ca n't be used to such barbaric weather as 15 degrees celsius ?

  it 's like an antediluvian returning in vampire : the masquerade ... 
  i would like the eu to somehow fix the monetary policy so that if a country starts failing financially it does not threaten to bring down the whole works , whatever the outcome . 
  i mean look at greece with its financial issues and how any article that mentions as much always pairs it with `` the potential collapse of the european union '' or something along those lines . 
  for example , why is it that when michigan kind of went to the dogs in the us , the only people who were most affected were the people living in the state ? 
  i remember living in florida at the time and it literally made no difference to me , i did not have to worry about the us collapsing if michigan did not recover . 
  is it because the us has more `` member states '' to kind of absorb the financial shock of one member state going down or what ? 
  cool , thanks for the reply . 
  hi , how do posts like this qualify when they are just an image without any sort of submission statement https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/68hul2/wonders_of_the_portuguese_language_caralho/ ( if i am reading the rules correctly , a submission statement is something that describes the post a bit and gives some background info ... ), 
  your link is kinda broken ...

  i can say that your posts in this very thread are hate speech . 
  prove that they are n't . 
  basically , the point i am trying to make is that you may * think * it 's possible to properly define hate speech but i would n't put it past any government to start bending the rules as to what `` hate speech '' actually means . 
  i have no idea but if i were to pick the most popular ones being espoused by people of a particular bent it would either be `` mass immigration '' and `` the eu '' or as they like to call it `` the eussr '' ... 
   a sejm where any noble is allowed to veto well ... we kinda have that already since everyone in the sejm is richer than most nobles back in the day :p obviously , no one individual in the sejm can actually veto a bill due to the balance of powers but i believe they can hold up the process some ...

  mainly because she is a politician of the highest level . 
  also the 2nd part of the quote : `` saying she hoped macron manages to fight unemployment in france and ** adding that the best way to counter populists was to solve problems ** '' . 
  talks about new eu army ... coincidence ? 
  out of curiosity , how large is the opposition in czech republic ? 
  a recent poll in poland showed that 65 % are against switching to euro while only 21 % were for it . 
   we know they would use them for greater good of the eu and not petty personal gains . 
  no offence , but that 's just naive . 
  this is politics and business at the highest level , there is no place for the `` greater good '' , its all about gains . 
  well , not sure if i would really call it interfering in internal affairs , but when another country is providing support only for one side , in order to make sure the other side ( in this case : the so called populists ) doesnt win in the future , i can see how it can be a bit gray . 
  edit : come on guys , at least tell me why you disagree , dont just downvote . 
  while i agree , that 's not my point . 
  i know this is a naive approach , but i would like to think that politicians should try to solve people 's problems , because they were chosen by the people , because it is their duty as representatives , because they actually care ... not because its the only way to stay in power . 
  at least they are honest , that the only reason they want to solve people 's problems , is not to lose power in the future ... 
  that was actually his twin brother .

  edit : added loose translation, 
  well this really wasnt a formal request and unfortunately , but in our times , being edgy and controversial is a pretty strong tool to promote yourself . 
   yeah so instead of giving full context of the interview , you prefer someone just giving the part that suits you , great standards ...  that interview from 2 weeks ago when cejrowski says clinton uses little childrens smashed bodies as face cream , and tusk should end up on electric chair ? 
  source ? 
  again , an example would be nice . 
  i havent watched any of his stuff in years , but i remember him completely differently - very positive and respectful to the people he meets , maybe even a little bit envious of the simple life some of them have . 
  even the `` context '' from op is shit ... 
  he also walks barefoot almost everywhere he goes in everyday life . 
  maybe if that were true ... but it isnt . 
  got ta say , im glad poland isnt the leader in that , although it definitely was a problem when i was a wee lad . 
  im guessing university is like that everywhere - it definitely is in poland . 
   i think the basic conundrum is that e.g. 
  italy has been complaining about this since 2002 but no one cared to help until it was literally too late . 
  and by that time no common plan existed , help was only voluntarily ( where half the eu declined to help ) and overall shit like that . 
  fair enough , but the issue is that even now when it is too late , there is no common plan or even a good plan . 
  unfortunately , but looking at the last couple years , i have no faith in the eu being able to solve this crisis . 
   from my point of view that 's bullshit as well . 
  that kind of situation is the chance to say : `` if you do n't even accept how the eu handles this for personal gain you 're first to get shipped back because you 're clearly here for $ $ '' but e.g. 
  germany just accepting people that were already redistributed is also a thing that ca n't happen . 
  but that 's not the reality we are living in . 
  we can not ship them back to syria and most likely wont be able to do so for years . 
  the `` worst '' we can do is send them back to whichever country they were relocated to . 
  nothing is stopping them from trying again and again . 
  sadly , this `` solution '' has been in place since what , end of 2015 ? 
  so far very little , if anything has been done to make sure migrants dont move freely in europe . 
  you said it yourself `` germany just accepting people that were already redistributed is also a thing that ca n't happen '' - but it does . 
  i just dont see any reason to trust the eu that suddenly everything will change . 
  if this was part of a bigger plan , then i strongly suspect people would actually back it , but for now , it just looks like the eu is walking aimlessly in the dark . 
   it does solve ( to some very limited degree ) the problem of people that are already in the eu and if you are not able to find a single person who is not just ( economic ) immigrant ( scary people , yes ... ) but legitimate refugee according to the international law among a pool hm ... around 1.3 million ppl ( or 160,000 included in quota system ) , you are just not trying at all . 
  at all . 
  there is no way you can put a lipstick on number 0 . 
  it doesnt , not in any meaningful way , that is why we are against this idea . 
  again ( because you skipped this part of my post ) , what is the point of relocating 160k migrants around europe when the vast majority will go to germany/sweden . 
  if your only goal is to have less people in italy/greece , ust let them in - end result is the same . 
   do not worry , we will send humanitarian packages and helpful advice . 
  very good , we will be grateful if the aid is needed . 
  we wont try to force the whole eu to do something their citizens are against . 
   `` in may , the european commission called on countries that refused to take in asylum seekers to pay a $ 250,000 ( # 212,000 ) `` solidarity contribution '' for every person brussels thought they should take . 
  the visegr\u00e1d quartet of central european states denounced the idea as blackmail . '', 
  because it is blackmail - do what we say or pay . 
  that 's not what requesting aid is . 
  that 's like demanding from a friend - help me move to my new apartment or pay for a moving crew . 
  do you really not see a difference between that and a regular request for help ? 
   this one ? 
  that does n't even mention a top 20 for overall safety or `` feeling safe walking alone at night '' and a top 19 for homicide rate . 
  am i missing something ? 
  iirc it was a report from early 2016 so it probably changed , but [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/41arpk/according_to_the_new_oecd_ranking_poland_is/ ) is a reddit topic about it . 
   it kinda should have the same result though . 
  if we leave border countries alone with refugees they 're dealing with then we 're willingly excluding them from the eu as a whole and are putting ourselves in danger at the same time , it 's a loss all around . 
  i agree , but i dont think we should leave them alone with this problem . 
  i am all for aiding ( personnel , financial , humanitarian , etc. ), 
  italy and greece , just not in the single way the eu is focusing on . 
  imo migrant relocation is not a solution considering what has been going on in the last 2 years . 
  italy and greece could use the aid , but more importantly a better plan is needed - what does relocating a couple thousand here and there help , when there will be hundreds of thousands/millions more . 
  not to mention the vast majority of these relocated migrants will go to germany/sweden . 
   tiny slovenia of 2 million ppl committed itself last year to taking 587 refugees and as far as i know , we do not need to chain them to stay here . 
  and we are really miles away far from open door policy & refugees welcome . 
  then share your wisdom how you did this , because other countries have these problems , migrants are leaving not only countries like poland and czech republic but also countries like portugal . 
  migrant relocation does not solve anything , additionally the eu hasnt even focused on keeping migrants where they should be . 
   they are taking care of our common border , so that poland can have no border controls and free movement with neighbouring schengen countries . 
  very good , it is their duty to do so , just like every other country ( poland included ) who has a schengen border . 
  if they are having problems with this , they can ask for assistance and im sure other eu countries like poland will gladly help . 
   sure . 
  as long as they stay in italy & greece , you are more than willing to send humanitarian packages and best wishes . 
  any aid , be it packages , personnel or financial . 
  if the only goal is to get them out of greece/italy , why go through the whole farce of relocating when we both know what will happen . 
  what does that have to do with anything . 
  that 's like saying a women should n't fear being attacked on the streets , in the middle of the night , because it never happened to her before . 
   i 'm seeing that claim quite a bit in this thread , what 's the source on this ? 
  i think its from an oecd index from last year . 
   if every single nation puts their national interests first we would n't have an eu . 
  not true at all . 
  deals are made because they are beneficial for both sides . 
  for example the eu 2004 expansion - it was a business and political deal , it was done because both sides gain from it , not out of the goodness of eu 's heart . 
   they have not accepted a single person?they have not accepted a single person ? 
  not as part of the migrant quotas . 
  private foundations and institutes have flown over some - mainly syrian christian families , try to guess what happened with them . 
   i bet they like schengen and free movement across eu ? 
  really nice thing to have , poland ? 
  guess who is paying for this luxury ? 
  border countries like greece and italy . 
  but not a polish problem , ha ... ?

  so far i agree , but for that it 's not necessary to rescue every single bank ( as it seems to be the case in europe ) . 
  instead we should also let some banks go bust like the us has done it . 
  however you call it ordinary citizens and tax payers having to pay for wealthy bank customers and shareholders is what happened in greece and this policy hasnt had a good outcome . 
  they get interests . 
  and furthermore the ones having more than 100.000 on the bank are richer people than the average taxpayer . 
  and if necessary one should also let the banks go bankrupt in which case the investors have to suffer . 
  thats market economy while acting like in the greek crises is socialism for banks ( and states ) . 
  and right so , since we in the end all have to pay for it . 
  the wealthy depositors should have to pay first . 
  it seems there are such rules otherwise italy would be allowed to do it . 
  it could also be a speculation that the brexit actually wont happen in the end , since uk politicians still hesitate to push article 50 . 
  actually the new rules for the banking union have just been agreed very recently and i dont think its a good idea to violate eu rules like during the greek crises again . 
  that 's exactly the point i was talking about before : you want the ecb acting like the eu is a souverign state , but on the other hand it seems you dont acknowledge eu laws . 
  thats a big contradiction , which i perceive with many people !, 
  the banking union actually shares risks among its members . 
  thus , italy also has to follow its rules which it signed . 
  in the meantime the banking union has been agreed which claims bail-ins have to take place first . 
  so , you prefer taxpayers bailing out banks instead ? 
  just bad that the sun has much more readers than the times . 
   pritchard is well-respected this statemenet can be questioned with good reasons . 
  i read some articles of this guy and perceived it actually much more as anglocentric eu-bashing than quality journalism . 
  actually i think germany could live with inflation target system although i am not sure that it is really the better method . 
  however the real reason that forbids fed style methods for the eurozone is that the eurozone is not a state while the us , uk and australia are states . 
  you shouldnt forget that eurozone countries are souverign states which dont like eu interfering too much in their inner affairs either . 
  the eurozone is still a confederation and not a federation which has its consequences for the design of the common currency as well . 
  actually keeping that in mind the ecb has already went quite far with their `` monetary '' measures . 
  germany also already had a good export industry during the times of the dmark . 
  nevertheless i agree with you that such huge trade surplus can not be in germanys interst either and the euro is even increasing them . 
  however in the end of the day there has to be decided if you want a race to the bottom ( germany following a policy which brought many countries in financial crises ) or a race to the top ( other countries implementing more stability orientated policies which will also reduce trade imbalances in the medium term ) . 
  i am quite convinced that the second option is more sustanable . 
  actually the ft is not the referee about european treaties , although they would like to be . 
  dont you have a primary source from the treaties ? 
  for all politicians it is actually the far easier way to increase spending and put the burden on future generations . 
  to cut spendng is never popular and will never be , which does not mean that it is a bad policy . 
  actually something bad already happened even before the referendum with the murder to jo cox . 
  but it hasnt changed the result either , although many `` experts '' predicted it . 
  dont forget the media . 
  i think murdoch is the one person who has biggest responsibility for brexit . 
  more than johnson , cameron and farage together since he has spread his anti-eu propaganda over years and decades via the sun etc. . 
  politicians and population rather adapt to the leading opinions in the media . 
  does farage know that he just used a hitler quote ? 
  since sarkozy has already been voted out of office i also think a new candidate like alain jupp\u00e9 would be better for the next presidential elections . 
  actually sarkozy has been a good leader concerning eu affairs in my mind . 
  at least better than hollande . 
  the european parliament still has a democratic deficit , as long as the `` one man , one vote '' rule is violated . 
  probably he was mixing it up with [ swaziland . 
  every country would be allowed to offer better loans to greece . 
  the same counts for britains whose banks debts in greece have been rescued by the eurozone taxpayer as well . 
  why hasnt switzerland offered better loans to greece ? 
  even worse are generalizing titles like `` germany says ... '' , which are also typical for the anglo press , when some random german politician might have said something . 
  look , i wish you all the best . 
  i just think there are far better alternatives to pp than podemos , because podemos indeed remind me on many popilist movements in south america who actually hardly solved any problems ( but often made them worse ) and are not really known for being specifically anti-corruption either . 
  it can always get worse . 
  just have a look at venezuela !, 
  actually the swiss also have some trouble with the implementation of their referenda results . 
  the content of the free movement restricting initiative is still not implemented since it violates bilateral treaties and time is running out ... 
  the main problem in the last 5 years has been that france has such a weak leadership since hollande came to office . 
  the duo sarkozy/merkel still worked well and a franco-german leadership is what europe needs . 
  germany can not lead europe on its own , but france has been hiding during the whole crises , has only done too little too late and left germany the whole burden of leadership . 
  the big tabloids have much more influence than the times . 
  the greeks havnt cared about the result of their referendum either . 
  no , he doesnt . 
  there are several commenters on reddit doing that , but he is not one of them . 
  it seems you are not able to understand him correctly . 
  personal opinions and the media mainstream are two different things . 
  but the problem is that the press actually has influence on personal opinion of many people . 
  however i have to confirm that i also perceive large parts of the british press are latently anti-german and full of stereotypes . 
  german press is much more friendlier to britain in comparison . 
  there has actually never been a german hegemony in europe . 
  also the two world wars have just been struggles about european hegemony . 
  since the end of ww2 europe is actually under us hegemony and nobody even really seems to notice it ( which shows how far reaching us hegemony actually has gotten ) . 
  switzerland also profited more from the brain drain per capita without paying the price of being in the eurozone for it . 
  countries not participating in the euro zone like britain profit even more from the brain drain . 
  this is only the case because major european countries have accepted a swiss special status since the westphalian peace treaty / vienna congress . 
  bigger countries like e.g. 
  germany simply wouldnt be allowed to follow a swiss style isolationist agenda and would also get huge difficulties with its neighbours by implementing a swiss style direct democracy . 
  switzerland has managed to get into a niche of world policy and therefore has a bigger political scope of action . 
  it also works because switzerland is a small country and other countries grant it a special status . 
  ... and the svp is your strongest party :d, 
  the whole balance of power thinking has never been something idealistic but always just been a strategy to maintain british hegemony . 
  everything else is propaganda . 
  the economic situation of a country is actually only one of many parameters which are relevant . 
  the size of a country as well as the political climate in a country play a major role as well . 
  note that spain and germany are among the few european countrys where right-wing populists havnt managed to get seats in the national parliaments yet . 
  in this case the swiss would need to have the highest rates for more involvement what i actually highly doubt . 
  monetary policy wont be able to close this gap , only structural reforms will be able to do so . 
  that 's not the easy way usually proposed by the populists , but the only sustainable . 
  we are not living in a european state . 
  there have been good reasons for the maastricht treaty . 
  what the ecb is doing is very dangerous , but as usual most people will only wake up as soon as the next bubble bursts . 
  you actually should remember that as a spaniard . 
  i disagree since only 3 % of turkish landmass are in europe and its main religion is islam . 
  the current behaviour of the turkish government dont qualify either . 
  the us helped to create the chaos in the middle east with the coup in persia and the iraq war , so it should take responsibility for the consequences . 
  turkey is more oriental than european . 
  american establishment wants turkey inside the eu just because of geopolitical reasons ( nato , etc ) but then again europe has to face the consequences ( like it already had to face the consequences of the wars in the middle east ( while the us itslef just took a few thousand refugees ), 
  this is not comedy , but satire . 
  satire is usually less `` funny '' but has a political message . 
  this video is not comedy , but satire . 
  these are wo different things many people dont seem to be able to differentiate .

  hell , people who say that `` krak\u00f3w 's air quality is among the worst in the world '' should go to kl or singapore for one day and experience [ haze ] ( http://funnymalaysia.hornbill.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/haze-kuala-lumpur-june-24.jpg ) . 
  and we 're still getting fucked ( nordstream 2 ) . 
  i 'd add our arms industry , yachts and apples . 
   catholic fundamentalists as jarkacz has said , many years ago : `` the biggest threat for catholicism in poland is zchn '' . 
  they 're not catholic fundamentalists - they are supported by pretty devout catholic media like radio maryja , but they wo n't push religion down anybody 's throat , because it 's counter-productive and they know it . 
  but calling lubuskie `` more developed '' is at least misleading . 
  the most developed part of dolno\u015bl\u0105skie , beside wroc\u0142aw , has been voting for pis for years . 
  top three voievodships with highest unemployment in 2013 were either a german partition or annexed from germany in 1945 . 
  / u/perkel666 claim is false . 
  and it 's popular , because west = money , east = lice . 
  west = germoney , east = beggars . 
  which is false . 
  there is a division - more people vote pis in the east and south , and more people vote for po in the west and north . 
  but reasons are different , it 's not just `` zabory '' , it 's far more complex ( and historic deportations are way more important ! ) . 
  not to mention bullshit about rich western poland and poor eastern poland . 
  few years ago the poorest gmina in poland was in ma\u0142opolskie , near nowy s\u0105cz . 
  in the same ma\u0142opolskie we have krak\u00f3w and zakopane , which are among the most wealthy cities in poland . 
  pis won both in krak\u00f3w , and in zakopane . 
  another example i 've already mentioned - copper basin in dolno\u015bl\u0105skie is the richest region in that voievodship , yet they vote pis . 
  first time in post-communist history we 'll have a one-party government . 
  i hope they 'll do well . 
  it 's a myth . 
  pozna\u0144 , which was the biggest city of german partition which was actually ethnically polish , was supporting narodowa demokracja before the war ( they were right-wing ) . 
  most of \u015al\u0105sk , all dolny \u015al\u0105sk , lubuskie , zachodniopomorskie , most of pomorskie and warmi\u0144sko-mazurskie were settled after the war . 
  and there was no development , because after the war everything was either destroyed or stolen by soviets ( whole industry was evacuated to russia !, 
  sure , they get no seats , if they get not enough votes . 
  every national minority can have a comittee like that - belarussians used to have a member of sejm ( pose\u0142 ) , who was elected from sld ballot . 
  ] ( http://www.wyborynamapie.pl/sejm2015/sejm2015%20graf.png ) - if we count voievodships , they 're also invisible . 
  it has been explained hundreds of times - most of ex-german territories were settled by people from east of bug . 
  they were forced to do so , it was also the only place where pgr ( state farms ) were quite common ( the rest of country had privately-owned farms ) . 
  there was whole generation that lived on their suitcases , because they thought , they 'll get back to their real homes . 
  it 's other world than central and eastern part of poland . 
  as for big cities , reasons are other ( more secular society , middle class that likes neoliberal rethorics etc. 
  interesting places . 
  copper basin - one of the richest regions in poland ( polkowice have biger budget per capita than warsaw - [ link ] ( http://samorzad.pb.pl/3774901,10160,najbogatsze-gminy-miasta-i-powiaty-w-polsce-ranking ) ) . 
  there are schools that teach kashubian language , which is imo harder to understand than slovakian . 
  but they are pretty conservative and their identity is very polish . 
  german minority . 
  protestants . 
  orthodox . 
  edit : added imgur link , yay, 
  we 're too busy being catholic for things like that . 
  on wednesdays . 
  we also used to call austria rakus . 
  probably bc you guys . 
  i do n't have to read your username to know where you 're from , mate . 
  because soviet 's mass-murdered and brainwashed your people .

  imho that 's the safest and most sustainable way . 
   also renewable energy can be created decentralized by normal people . 
  that 's where huge amount of subsidizing goes to , as otherwise people are unable to afford it . 
   you treat party as a monolith that has to be destroyed ? 
  do i ? 
  how did you come up with that conclusion ? 
  i absolutely do n't . 
  all i want is new , fresh parties coming in , including something that would cater to my views - centrist , pro-european democratic party that 's not afraid of doing necessary reforms . 
   you do n't see that parties are made up with individual people with individual views oh , i do . 
  but i alse realize that that your one candidate you vote for in jows does n't direct the government - it 's a party ( or coalition ) as such that does it . 
   i want to see power taken from party leaders and being put back to party members in each of the parties . 
  jows wo n't do that . 
  it 's a matter of political culture , not a voting system . 
  and we already do have parties that are n't leader-centric - look no further than psl . 
   i 'd rather see valuable candidates being elected jows do n't change anything in terms of how valuable people are selected . 
  parasites on a nation like macierewicz would still be selected with jows ( look up his election result ) . 
  it can change something in terms of how populist individual candidates are and how they try to tear stuff up from the public money to their own region with a total disregard of a common good , but that 's about it . 
   well here 's where we do n't agree and i feel it will stay that way , cause you live in an idealistic abstract world , being unable to face the brutal reality of a real world implementations of this system . 
  operating on simple abstract truth is easy , but i 'd highly encourage you to think more about how it works in real world and why for example brits are fed up with jows . 
  or subsidizing renewable energy . 
  they are , but still can run for quite a while , though current plans are to shut all of them down by the end of 2022 . 
  and imho the best solution would be to replace oldest reactors with a new generation . 
  but greens are against any form of nuclear reactors , no matter how safe they are . 
  it 's like kebab , mate . 
   i would consider his personal views in the first place . 
  which do n't matter cause in the end it 's parties that decide direction of a government and laws passed , not your selected candidate . 
  at the end of a day you still vote for a party - and jows are only causing people to be even more likely to vote on two largest parties cementing the po-pis duopoly that i 'd like to see broken and new parties introduced . 
  jows make it pretty much impossible . 
  look at uk elections - ukip gathered 20 % of support and when there was a chance for them to enter in a coalition with the government and have some real impact on politics - they lost miserably due to idiotic jows . 
  i want to see plurality and democratic representation of the views of society in parliment , not a system that effectively enforces two-party system . 
   in jow system parties will have to consist of more diversified views and leaders would have to fight for votes even within their parties . 
  that 's a false illusion . 
  just look through the comments of people from france and britain - your idealistic theory does n't work when crashed with brutal reality . 
   49.5 % of brits voted for parties explicitly against the jurisdiction of the echr does n't mean that they voted against the jurisdiction of the echr . 
  technically you do n't , not like the other countries do . 
  effectively british parliament can implement laws that in other countries would n't be possible due to infringing constitution . 
  read through the comments section - few other people already discussed the matter . 
  and let 's not forget affairs with greece and ukraine where merkel been very active and often hitting news . 
  i would n't be surprised if people interested in either of these would ` like ' her . 
   poland heads for presidential elections tomorrow , which are likely to be a predictable -- even boring -- affair and it came out to be quite the opposite ... 
  of course . 
  but no serious party catering to them . 
  majority of poles are centrist , but majority of parties are center-right or straight on right wing . 
  yes , it was , but it does n't mean we do n't know the cause of accident and does n't mean someone `` exploded '' the plane ( implied : russians or tusk with russians ) . 
   when you get elected in your district you do n't act against any of your voters but you try not to act against any of your main opponent 's voters either as you want to win them over to get re-elected . 
  you do that anyway , cause you still start in an elections . 
  there 's still your name on a voting card . 
  what you do n't do however is putting the interests of your region over the interests of your country - we already had a problems with that in a proportional system , so i ca n't imagine just how bad it would be in single-member-district . 
  it 'd basically turn into political oligarchy where people try to buy votes in their region at the cost of others ( see : train station at wschowa being by far , far more common precedence ) . 
   you become a representative of your region , of your people you are a representative of your people in the proportional system . 
  the single-member-district system got a huge flaw in that it evolves into two-party system , so even though your ideal model accounts for each person fighting for his vote - the brutal reality is that people have no choice - there are 2 major parties and whole game is played between their selected members in each region . 
  at the end of a day - it 's not individual people steering the country - it 's parties that do it . 
  so with smd you end up having only two options - either country goes in a direction presented by party a or by party b , the other votes are `` wasted '' , that 's the problem uk had - 4 million people voted for ukip and all of these votes were wasted , at the end they ended up having 1 seat in a parliament even though by all means they should be the 3rd force forming an alliance with leading party and having some actual , real influence on the politics and a direction of uk . 
   staying loyal to all people in your district becomes your priority . 
  i want parliament to stay loyal to the country . 
  not a tiny interests of individuals . 
  let 's not forget about these 30 % of people believing in smole\u0144sk conspiracies . 
  that probably includes also mr. duda who said , i quote :  it 's difficult to say what was the cause and what exploded , but i 'm convinced that the explosion happened, 
  oh yes ... good old days when every country around seen poland as an opponent ... 
  i know some that have a strong , unshaken faith in what jkm says for a good few years now , so ... 
  i would n't say that they change their views on monthly basis . 
  some certainly do , but not all ... 
  if anything - it 's a sign of failure of the education system . 
  seems like europe is slowly drifting towards populism ... very dangerous direction ... 
  i made some decent [ comparison of german and polish presidential powers ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/35auuw/polish_presidential_election_thread/cr307sx ) . 
  in general many people think president in poland ca n't do shit , but reality is slightly different ... 
   since duda has already announced his support he already did ? 
  oh my god , i have way too good opinion about him  i do believe voting for a person and not a party is what democracy is all about . 
  i believe democracy is about the will of the people and not person a or person b. 
  and elections in uk showed beyond any shadow of a doubt that single district voting ** does not ** reflect will of the people . 
  it also allows easier access to the parliament for coordinated extremist parties and more difficult to very wide spread but still relatively popular parties . 
  the bads overweight any potential goods by an order of magnitude . 
  and i 'm laughing hard at the nativity of people who think it will suddenly turn politics into much higher quality . 
  look up last parliamentary elections results - people like macierewicz would still get into parliment with jows . 
  they already said that they do n't . 
  ~ ~ even they are n't that stupid . ~ ~ i keep on underestimating pis - apparently they do . 
  yes , it will be komorowski vs duda , thankfully kukiz and his nonsense demands are out , though he will probably try to negotiate something for a vote of support ... that said though i doubt either of the two candidates is going to agree for his demand of implementing single-member district voting system in poland . 
  who will win the second round ? 
  well , hopefully komorowski , last thing we need is a president that 's a conspiracy theorist . 
   now we can be pretty much sure we 're getting jows what kind of twisted logic made you believe that ? 
  after uk elections it should be more than clear that single-member district voting system is one of the worst out there . 
  definitely by far worse than what we have now in poland . 
  at a very most kukiz might negotiate referendum for that , but even that is doubtful - i do n't think either komorowski or duda would agree to that garbage . 
   but will increase quality of politicians in these parties significantly . 
  hahahahahaha , i 'm choking, 
  if someone is curious why they did n't just [ dump fuel ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fuel_dumping ) - a320 is n't equipped in fuel dumping mechanism . 
  however in emergency a320 actually can land overweight , even with maximum fuel load right after take off , but for some reason it was deemed too risky and they decided to burn fuel instead . 
  perhaps / u/cieloroto can correct me , but on top of powers available to german president , polish president can initiate legislative process , which is a big thing , can stop any law by his right of veto ( can be overruled by 2/3 of sejm votes ) , and got some additional competences in military , being the supreme commander of the armed forces . 
  i seen some people here saying that a president has essentially no power , which is n't true . 
  traditionally presidents were n't using much of their power , but polish president got more power than many ( most ? ), 
  of other presidents in eu countries . 
   let 's see what the poles are ~ ~ saying ~ ~ complaining about today !, 
  ftfy, 
  glorious achievements of yurop !, 
  obviously . 
  i actually would like to see more interesting posts about elections all around the eu , not just uk , france and germany that we get here any way . 
  well , if you are into teenagers ... 
  french kiss would do it ? 
  we had a running joke in poland back in early ' 00s : why terrorists never attacked poland ? 
  cause the only skyscraper they can bomb or hit with a plane is a palace of culture and science and none of the poles would cry after that one .

  but i 'd guess somebody would have to research onr members in this area ( pre-1939 ) , and compare with perpetrators of pogroms . 
  some , not most . 
  on the other hand , people from rnr tried to start a pogrom against warsaw jews , around easter 1940 . 
  and there are some hints ( more research is needed here ) , that ex-nrists could be involved in summer 1941 pogroms ( jedwabne etc. 
  to be honest , onr is n't really a problem here . 
  they are tiny , no more than 2 or 3,000 people ( at best ) . 
  what 's worrying , is that our present government does n't mind them parading legally . 
  this manifestation was n't allowed by city ( mayor ) , but decision was overturned by * wojewoda * ( province governor , appointed by national government ) . 
  even worse - they had police protection against `` leftists '' . 
  true , because they were ( pre-war ) in many aspects ** worse ** ( than bnp or italian fascism ) . 
  onr was a `` native '' polish fascism , very similar of croatian ustasha or romanian iron guard . 
  this comparison is ... disturbingly correct in present times . 
   so what 's the point of being in the eu if you are not relevat even as a member ? 
  because you 're more relevant in the world as member of big united community , than as single sad alone c * o * untry . 
   seems like terrorist attacks had huge effect on eu . 
  trust is lower in the south . 
  i do n't think terrorism or refugees are crucial reason , i 'd rather say it 's still about post-2008-crisis fallout . 
  convenience flag . 
  ship was ( i guess ) actually turkish . 
  yeah , but pis has single majority due to difference over po in 2015 . 
  smaller difference = no majority for pis . 
  even if they win ( based on present polls , things would be probably worse for them in two years ) they would need kukiz to form a coalition . 
  local in 2018 , parliamentary sep/oct 2019 ( and of course ep in the meantime ) , presidential circa may 2020 ( with probable tusk 's comeback ) . 
   mrs szyd\u0142o could join them too if she likes . 
  but we north/western poles do n't wan na !, 
   it has to do with their profession . 
  but nun itself is n't a profession . 
  sure , nun can be e.g. 
  a nurse or teacher , but then these professions mandate no such uniform . 
   that 's a profession . 
  professional uniforms are one thing . 
  of course , there 's nothing religious in nun habits . 
  what about nuns ? 
   no need to ban them . 
  problem is , some politicians want this . 
   just associate them with oppression and backwardness . 
  but ... why ? 
  why should we care what somebody wants to wear ? 
  it 's not our business . 
  hijab ( and more often , niqab ) is viewed in west as a symbol of backwardness in islam ( because it 's visible ) , but do women in muslim countries ( or even more , muslim women here ) really mind it ? 
  imho there are more serious issues we should care about , like their access to education , financial independence , or ( in case of saudi arabia ) driving . 
  but what happens , when woman herself wants to wear a hijab ( of her own choice , not forced by another man ) , and somebody ( e.g. 
  state in europe ) do n't allow her to ? 
  who 's oppressing who there ? 
  banning headscarves is just bad , as making them obligatory . 
  no state law should mandate what a woman can or ca n't wear , period . 
  yeah , but catholic women are n't even obliged to wear it everyday , and we are comparing special visits . 
  imho it 's a matter of being polite - just like donning a ( even paper-made ) cap in synagogue , or taking shoes off in mosque - as a tourist . 
  what about headscarf during visit to pope ? 
  seems that catholic women wear it . 
  i recall only merkel among stateswomen not doing it , but she is n't catholic . 
  it 's just like people saying `` i 'm not an antisemite , but jews/israel ... '' .

  two other american author series i did enjoy : * queen & country * by greg rucka , and * y : the last man * by brian vaughan . 
  him too , but my favourite american comics author is stan sakai . 
  notice , that both are n't us-born ( moore is english , sakai japanese ) . 
  and there 's also irish garth ennis ( * preacher * ) . 
  of course , fact that such talented people work in america , says something good about this country . 
  among `` full '' americans , probably bill willingham ( fables ) . 
  still , in general imho european  american here . 
   there are some parts of britain where muslims are majority example ? 
  anything more than some cities ' districts ? 
   women covering their faces is a cultural issue , not a religious issue . 
  it 's both , mostly because religion is part of culture . 
  remember , that there 's no single interpretation of this certain issue . 
   ha ha yea , fuck those 500 people who now wo n't be able to pay their mortgage reliably it 's not us ( eu or poland ) who is to be blamed here ( but company itself ) . 
   american comics became whole fanchises with the heros being templates for writers to work with . 
  true , that 's probably i never could get into american comics , especially whole heroes genre ( maybe except ** few ** batman ones ) . 
  these few us comics i do/did read , all are one-author title . 
  started two world wars . 
  habsburgs .

   vladimir putin was the handpicked selection of yeltsin rather his daughter 's . 
  putin was a guarantee , her and her friends crimes ( corruption ) wo n't be charged . 
  yeltsin was delusional ( literally ) in last years of his rule , due to health problems ( honest ones , he had a hereditary heart condition ) . 
  his circle keep him `` going '' publicy-wise thanks to painkillers etc. 
  chechnya was already de facto independent after 1st war . 
  there would be no 2nd one , if not for putin . 
   he consolidated chechnya ( which regardless of what we think about it , was terrible for russians who remember dead conscripts and terror attacks ) . 
  thing is , he started it ** himself ** . 
  i mean 2nd chechen war . 
  = polan stronk . 
  there 's something uncanny in this smile . 
   it 's normal for belarus to be known for tractors when its dictator used to be the director of an agricultural farm . 
  is n't it a positive view , however ? 
  afaik , belarusian automotive industry is actually the most successful whole-ex-ussr-wide . 
  i even noticed maz buses here in poland few times ( and our market is highly competitive because of strong local companies , like solaris or solbus ) .

  stay safe and calm , france .

  especially palestinians . 
  for me it 's kinda personal since i 'm partly jewish myself and what israel devolved into makes me fucking sick to my stomach . 
  so criticizing israel and its jingoist policies makes one an antisemite now ? 
  yeah , that sounds like significantly inflated numbers . 
  not sure how either supporting or not supporting israeli policies has a bearing on a truthfulness of that . 
  while i do n't know about the site or their agenda , `` zionism '' is a real thing - a political movement . 
  not sure what those quotation marks are there for .

  yeah , those are the 3 i had in mind . 
  it was n't all * that * bad .

  * i can think of maybe 3 . 
  and i always thought i have a decent vocabulary . 
  while belgians deserve the blame , it 's important to remember that the rest were n't all that far behind . 
  british extermination of tasmanians ? 
  man-made indian famines ? 
  german shark island ? 
  french algeria ? 
  has anyone * ever * seen those terms used before ? 
  get back to us with your anti-mod whining when something of value is lost . 
  really ? 
  why ? 
  wow . 
  i did n't think you could have been any dumber , but here we go !, 
  that 's actually quite impressive !, 
  do n't get me wrong , it was reasonable to the point and the the certain extent . 
  and now we are way beyond both the point and the extent . 
  almost none . 
  especially hispanics . 
  i hear there are some in spain , but the government and the eu are working hard to make them leave . 
  and thank god - they almost ruined spain . 
  most of the eastern europe got really , * really * , * really * high on neoliberalism in early 90s . 
  along the lines of `` communism was an utter shit , so let 's do * everything * exactly opposite way ! '', 
  depends on what part of `` the masses '' and what part of the ruling class you ask . 
  but yes - probably about 50-60 % of the population leans towards neoliberalism , albeit expectations of pay rising towards the western european standards is also very high , well beyond 30-35 % socialist-leaning population . 
  i do n't see a 1:1 correlation between a work-culture and a quality of welfare that the comment was implying . 
  if anything it is linked to the dominant economical and political beliefs of a ruling class and/or society as a whole . 
  for example in poland a `` people will take advantage of it ! '', 
  argument hardly ever transpires and main one against both welfare and higher pay is that it would smother economical growth and increase unemployment due to higher costs of labor . 
  and we have 4th lowest labor costs in the entire eu while having about as well educated and english proficient workforce as countries with labor costs 5 times higher . 
  yeah , thankfully that kind of statements will mark you a moron and unfit for working with children in eyes of the most of the society . 
  sadly , not in all of them . 
  what the actual fuck ... 
  i looked at the title , looked at the . uk address and was relieved it was n't in poland . 
  right ... 
  i really hope there will be prosecution for this kind of shit . 
  or they do n't have a generous welfare system since they follow a neoliberal dogma . 
  not a study itself , but [ a press release ] ( http://www.britsoc.co.uk/media/84290/generous%20welfare%20benefits%20make%20people%20more%20likely%20to%20want%20to%20work,%20not%20less,%20research%20suggests.pdf?1427799136444 ) by an [ institution ] ( http://www.britsoc.co.uk/media-centre/press-releases.aspx ) that published the study . 
  maybe the study itself is somewhere there as well , but i got ta go right now . 
  also it 's hard to be entrepreneurial and actually start a new business ( or become a productive member of a society in a different way , like arts ) when your salary barely covers your basic needs . 
  and especially if losing that income would significantly endanger you . 
  not to mention how it affects decisions such as one about having children . 
  while generous welfare system and semi-comfortable minimal wage are n't an ideal solution and can be to some extent abused , i do believe that benefits for both society and real economy greatly outweigh the costs and potential issues . 
  yeah , that 's probably correct . 
  i think i 'm just refusing to consider them a * real * media . 
  even with all the us culture we are all consuming it feels very foreign to me . 
  i 'd call it `` socially individualistic and mentally collectivist '' . 
  an exact opposite of what i consider optimal . 
  with some crazy labor laws and culture in regards to jobs . 
  also whole crime and law situation seems to border on police state and kafka . 
  and cities are just noisy and ugly . 
  that 's what i 'm talking about !, 
  bloody brits do n't even remember to mention us once these days , yet alone treat as such an important threat to society . 
  always chasing that hot new thing to blame , tossing old ones aside without as much as a minor tabloid harassment . 
  i 'm ... a bit confused ... 
  so we 've just been a one season wonder , huh ? 
  that 's just hurtful ... 
  i was reading it and thinking - `` damn , that 's kinda bad . 
  i wonder what country that is . '', 
  i really do n't think that 's accurate outside of maybe 10 % of the people . 
  not even media come up with this shit as far as i 've seen . 
  to expand on that : communists/solidarity neo-liberals/socialists entrepreneurs/intellectuals conservatives/liberals 20-yearolds/50-yearolds catholics/unbelievers moderate catholics/catotaliban employees/employers universities/market left/right populists/elitists liberal media / ~ ~ ultraconservative ~ ~ independent media kaczynski/tusk and so on and so forth . 
  just pick and choose yours . 
  i think that one got turned around tho , right ? 
   poles are given special blame that 's very considerate !, 
  well earned !, 
  four others got sentences between 2 and 3 years as well . 
  no suspention either . 
  those got boring 3 threads ago . 
  wow . 
  look at that egypt . 
  looking at those list i wanted to go with austria , but then again , not sure how i feel about semi-militaristic organization from there . 
  let 's go with luxemburg !, 
  yes , right . 
  as i said , it 's far from ideal , but it is quite old . 
  and i guess it depends how you look at it - in for example it 's hard to attribute all the answers to racism when results between lithuanians and black people vary only slightly . 
  i realize that racists are n't exactly among sharpest tools in a shed , but being racists towards * lithuanians * as a pole would be borderline insane . 
  here is another one http://www.cbos.pl/spiskom.pol/2014/k_149_14.pdf from last year . 
  question is a bit different and refers to a number of minority types . 
  here is the main graph translated and mutilated by my paint skills : http://imgur.com/uoy7ieu  most people in eastern europe are likely to be outright racist because the region there is so ethnically homogeneous sure . 
  how about you start working on your racism instead of making up excuses and trying to pull us into your fucking gutter ? 
  you clearly are a keen observer and an adept analyst of geopolitics and we 'd love to hear more of your learned opinions on the subject of nato-russia relations . 
  just keep in mind that project of missile shield in poland has been scraped like 5 years ago . 
  you got ta use a brown one . 
   first of all , the `` study '' , has such a small sample size , it hardly reflects accurate data . 
  i thought that the fact that those are % s will be obvious to anyone ... 
  it 's a proper study on a 1123 sample performed by oldest polish public polling institute and the best polish university . 
   it 's completely obvious that you 're more likely to encounter racism in an eastern european country than a western european city . 
  that 's probably true .

appology for ww2 & post war era crimes would be nice start . 
  what the hell is `` schweden '' ? 
  ok i 'll pass on trying to define geographical borders of europe . 
  i 'll stick to cultural / political europe . 
  http://imgur.com/xwyw5rl blue = cultural europe red line - border of political europe, 
  poland finest http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/janusz_korwin-mikke  in his electoral interview to the eu parliament , janusz korwin mikke expressed his belief that hitler did n't know anything about jews ' extermination . 
  jkm also stated that he believes women should not vote , children shall be lashed and putin was right seizing crimea . 
  i 'm fluent in polish ( my native language ) and english . 
  i 'm also able to communicate in german , spanish and russian ( on ** very ** basic level ), 
  there is a joke about radom radom is radom of europe  bada bum tsss, 
   the member states of nato and russia will , together with other states parties , seek to strengthen stability by further developing measures to prevent any potentially threatening build-up of conventional forces in agreed regions of europe , to include central and eastern europe . 
  i guess russian armed forces massed at ukrainian border with large parts of them magicaly appearing on the other side could n't be called threatening build-up of conventional forces . 
  it 's in the last question in transcript :  q : i have a question about -- what 's the president 's position on positioning permanent nato troops or nato bases in the eastern european countries -- for example , in estonia -- or prepositioning some equipment in those areas as some of these analysts and some of the estonian politicians they have called for ? 
   mr. kupchan : i think that the discussions in wales will focus intently on the kinds of measures that need to be taken to reassure estonia and its neighbors , and that we will see more military activity in your part of the world , including training exercises , defense reform , defense capacity building , increasing rotation of nato troops through estonia and through the region in which estonia resides . 
  ** i doubt that we will see movement toward the creation of what one would call permanent forward bases ** . 
  as you probably know , ** there is something called the nato-russia founding act , and that act addressed the question of the setting up of permanent bases ** , and nato is in a situation right now in which it is refraining from moving in that direction . 
  i always thought that i travelled more ... http://imgur.com/0x2uhkx, 
  it has everything : swastikas , ukrainian nazis , blood , evil west and scary obama . 
  i also think it was about soviet uniforms . 
  on the other hand people in poland love russian army choirs , they concert a lot here . 
  well , to be honest , with current political climate , every russian cultural event in poland would gather protestors , shitload of them . 
  i 'm not trying to make any specyfic point . 
  we , people from central/eastern european states can just sit back and take big sip from our `` we told you so '' glass . 
  the mere second the word about it reached kremlin , putin halted any military aid for separatists , pulled russian forces from ru/ukr border and dissolved whole armed forces of russian federation . 
  then he started crying . 
  he reached for his pocket , grabed a key and used it to open locked drawer of his big oak desk . 
  he reached inside and took out his gun . 
  he put it against his head . 
  ' i lost ' - he wispered crying . 
  ' i failed mother russia ' - that was his last thought , whle he pulled the trigger . 
  it 's funny beacuse before their brought down plane with your citizens on board , dutch government was firmly opposing any sanctions against russia . 
  i do n't think that anyone wants seperate passports in polish . 
  polish minority is just asking to allow them to write their names and surnames with polish characters in official documents ( passports , ids etc ), 
  you 're incorrect , to the certain point . 
  does polish imperialism existed during polish - lithuanian commonwealth ? 
  yes . 
  was `` uniting all the slavs '' one of its goals ? 
  sorry to disapoint you but technicaly speaking , polish constitution specifically forbids same sex marriages . 
  on the other hand , it do n't forbid civil union . 
  article 18 of constitution of republic of poland :  ** marriage , being a union of a man and a woman ** , as well as the family , motherhood and parenthood , shall be placed under the protection and care of the republic of poland . 
  something went very , very wrong here . 
  in poland we have bicameral ** parlament ** . 
  lower house - ** sejm ** , upper house - ** senat ** . 
  ** zgromadzenie narodowe ** - is n't a name for legislature . 
  it 's a name used when sejm and senat are called to debate together ( calling up a national assembly ) . 
  baisicly it 's called in one of four cases : * to receive the president 's oath of office * to hear a presidential address * to declare the president 's permanent incapacity to exercise his duties due to the state of his health * to bring an indictment against the president to the state tribunal, 
  hash , hash . 
  we like to pretend that pilsudzki was n't a dictator . 
  they did n't need to invade , [ they were already here . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/northern_group_of_forces ), 
   they ca n't be sued for anything it 's not completly true , mp can be arrested and put on trial if they are cought commiting a crime or if sejm votes , to remove someone immunity . 
  but it 's a joke party . 
  i 'll explain it to you in very simple manner . 
  thay had licence for agreed period of time . 
  that period ended . 
  they applied for renewal . 
  we said `` no '' . 
  there is nothing to be sued about . 
  i 'm well aware of that . 
  i never said that german occupation was a good thing . 
  nazis were evil and so were soviets . 
  put yourself in our postion , imagne that after liberation of netherlands , us secret police arrested most of intelectual elite and either shot them in a head and burried them in unmarked graves or send them to the work camps . 
  imagine that they set up puppet goverment , and bullied you into submission . 
  imagine that every one opposing their rule was either killed or dissapeared and was never heared of ever again . 
  imagine living in a totalitarian `` paradise '' , brought to you on bayonets of your `` liberators '' for almost half of a century . 
  sorry but wo n't get even an inch of love for ~ ~ reaping an pillaging ~ ~ glorius red army , from either me or from anybody from other central european country . 
  it has something to do with silly little things like : mass murders , mass deportations , instaling totalitarian dictatorships or stealing people land and heritage . 
  it was n't glorius day . 
  it was the day in which europe was divided and comerade stalin got his filthy hands on almost half of it . 
  russian orthodox church just went full retard . 
  you never should went full retard . 
  yes , for worst . 
  much worst . 
  i always was arguing with my friends that modern russia , despite its interior problems and `` wannabe great empire again '' attitiude is n't threat to european security . 
  it 's xxi century , cold war is over and soviet union is gone . 
  well i was wrong . 
  russian state always will be threat to european security . 
  in poland , \u017candarmeria wojskowa ( military gandarmerie or military police , to be precise ) , acording to new law introduced few years ago , can act as a support for police , when they are called upon . 
  in said situation they act as normal police unit . 
  so far , goverment called mps during some big events ( euro 2012 or 2014 iaaf world indoor championships ) to support police in crowd and traffic control . 
  it 's time to put stop to the aggressive estonian imperialism !, 
  well , not soon . 
  it 's still only a concept - there is long way to go . 
  this video is from chmielnickij oblast , not from kiev, 
  beacuse if government would declared and tried to enforce martial law , the whole situation can spin out control in matter of hours . 
  martial law means more violence , more violence means more deaths and more deaths pretty much means civil war . 
  dear sir , i must admit that your weekly `` fidesz - lets have some laughs ! '', 
  reports are really making my day , week after week . 
  silesian autonomy movement [ ruch autonomii \u015al\u0105ska ] main goal is autonomy within poland , not independence , so you really ca n't label them as separatists . 
  to be more precise , they want to restore [ silesian autonomus voivodeship ] ( http://tinyurl.com/ncvwbdq ) which existed in second polish republic . 
  can you be antisemite in a country without jews ? 
  yes , you can !, 
  welcome to the fascinating world of polish right wing politics !, 
  silesians in poland actually want autonomy , not independence . 
  they have some support , but they lack any real political power . 
  i doubt that it will change in few next decades . 
  let 's just dovnote you into oblivion . 
  without a comment . 
  it was another provocation from russia and its agents . 
  that embassy was standing there on purpose !,

  being afraid to be called a nazi, 
  of course they will be different . 
  more extreme , more violent . 
  yeah , no need for that, 
  since the introduction of `` anti-hate-speech '' laws . 
  good thing we do n't have such a thing . 
  oh , i just saw an error in that map ... azerbaijan lost its southwestern territory to iran . 
  uhm no . 
  we are very different , especially culturally . 
  also we have different ideals , one of ours for example is freedom , which the russians are obviously missing . 
  and i mean freedom for everyone . 
  russia is only hated because it makes itself hated . 
  looking at smolensk 2010 , ukraine 2014 , georgia 2008 , the 45 years of soviet occupation , the glorification of stalin and the communists , regular military provocations ... 
  the list goes on . 
  tons of reasons why to hate russia . 
  meanwhile russian citizens ... 
  it depends if they are talking lots of shit and are disrespectful , viewing the world as if it was 1950 or if they are actually polite and friendly people . 
  well , ignorance ... as for myself , i see romanians as allies . 
  especially since they literally never had done anything in history against poland . 
  you should n't worry about some polls . 
  in the end most of them are n't accurate anyways . 
  i am actually also surprised to see romans so so low ... and also at the same time seeing the germans so high . 
  some fo those have a 101 % turn out , the chinese one has only 99 % if the author had to round the numbers so much , why even bother to also write a '' .0 '' behind each percentage ? 
  yes it is . 
  although i have never thought about it being rude . 
  is there was czech insult which goes with that - czycy ? 
  you know that the russians are very different from the polish , do you ? 
  also the worst part about this is that russia still praises its communist times as one of the best and one of the most murderous people as the best leader ... and by the way , under him more people died then under hitler ... and he lived at the same time when hitler came into power ... also another thing , he actually allied with hitler in the first part of ww2 ... 
  it was n't a non-aggression treaty . 
  the budapest memorandum was about those 5 countries recognizing ukraine and protecting its souvereignity if it gives up its nuclear arsenal . 
  and how are you going to tell anyone what is a bad decision and what is a good one ? 
  also the russians are known to shell your place , they did it in their invasion of donbass for example . 
  shelling the ukrainian army from their own territory . 
  so i do n't think anyone will just stop at the russian border , at the same time the russians will probably use nuclear weapons if there seems to be no chance of winning ... and i do not support appeasement policy neither do i support the usage and actual creation of nuclear weapons . 
   there would be more positive reception to russian control in eastern european countries huh wut ? 
  i actually have no idea which countries would appreciate another 45 years of russian occupation ... 
  except if merkel is blocking it . 
  * protect and these countries were : russia , uk , us , france , china, 
  well , there is a huge problem . 
  to stop russia you need to make them submit , so you will enter their territory and they will use nuclear weapons , if someone starts occupying their lands ... a major power of course . 
  and russia is for me shady af ... 
  oh boy , what a twist !, 
  it looked like you were trying to defend britain ... actually never thought of it , that you wanted to criticize churchill for that . 
  if that 's so , then i probably took something the wrong way . 
  and today nobody needs kresy , although historically it was the land of the polish-lithuanian commonwealth, 
  well , our plan was to preemptively strike germany in 1934 , but for that we needed the help of the french ... 
  they of course refused . 
  also everything was made according to the munich agreements , for which britain and france agreed for germany taking czechoslovakia ... 
  so hypocrisy at its best by churchill . 
  have nothing against disagreeing . 
  although why should the election have been faked or rigged ? 
  yes indeed they were . 
  you may search it in the archives of the interpreter . 
  they have a liveblog about it and are reporting about it since january 2014 . 
  oh right , because they were the leaders of then ... do you know actually what , nobody even knew about them becoming presidental candidates ... 
  so yeah , poroshenko did the coup , and i did 9/11 . 
  poroshenko was elected after the war started . 
  when did russia intervene ? 
  28th february 2014 . 
  the russian invasion of crimea , followed by a `` referendum '' approved by your local tinfoil wearer . 
  meanwhile in april 2014 something started brewing in eastern ukraine , interestingly enough administration centers were attacked and taken over , but what is especially interesting was that media buildings were also taken over and russian tv was played over them ... grandious strategy for hybrid warfare . 
  so even there it seems like russian speznaz or the fsb had its fingers in it . 
  now russia never officially intervened ... 
  even for western media , which is the most stupid thing to say . 
  russia invaded ukraine on august 2014 , when the supposed `` rebels '' led by a russian ex-general were removed from sloviansk and mariupol . 
  they almost lost to the ukrainian army and luhansk as well as donetzk were almost taken back , but then ilovoisk happened . 
  a major invasion by russian groundforces started , which includes the ilovoisk massacre . 
  russian troops were advancing across ukrainian territory until the current lines through 3 major offensives , breaking 2 cease-fires . 
  one in september , the other one in january ... actually also in february by constantly bombing debaltseve into ashes . 
  so these were 3 `` cease '' - fire violations . 
  the russian army played an active role in expanding occupied territory . 
  these are certainly not `` rebels '' . 
  i am also sick and tired of your shit . 
  you call them ** black-and-white ** ?? 
  from what i can see , they are pretty much diverse enough to even consider some of them as pro-russian ... 
  especially the articles of spiegel have this thing going on , with adoring putin ... and yes i read german media , and i am sick of its shit . 
  it has many manipulated informations in it , many also very badly researched . 
  i prefer specialized newsplatforms , specialized like interpreter for example . 
  well , nuland and obama bombed ukraine with sikret cia agents ... oh and mh17 , it was a cia agent ... no wait , i mean a bomb ... no it was us sponsored isis ... god damn it , no , it was a ukrainian jet ... missile i mean . 
  now i have got it !, 
  it was an ukrainian buk launcher , which launched a cia with a jihadi onto mh17 , the jihadi exploded while the cia agent was planting explosives and then putin flew by with his magic bear and began liberating europe ... no wait . 
  every country neighbouring russia does ... that is why everyone is asking for more nato or more in particular us troops ... 
  especially us , because of history . 
  meanwhile merkel is actually ** blocking ** the deployment of nato bases in central europe ... `` not angering the russians '' ... 
  laughable . 
  there must be something behind it ... oh right nordstream 2 and even schulz does n't say anything against it , what wonderful solidarity we have . 
  but actually ... why do you need to see bandera as a hero ? 
  although , i do n't think it is appropiate to ask , but so is politics ... 
  well , we * certainly * are * very * grateful for your * promised * help in world war 2 , * especially * the ending was an absolute ** red ** surprise for us . 
  following the conflict since the beginning . 
  this is what you get out of your classical `` frozen conflict '' with a * very carefully dealt cease-fire * which was * only * broken about 5 times , by doing more and more offensives , while russian generals , which are still in the russian army , are involved . 
  in this case , the eu and the osce are useless . 
  by the way , war is heating up again , although i think it will cool down because of the azerbaijan-armenia conflict ... or it will lie in its shadow , because provocations from russia are a taboo thing for western liberals . 
  iz abot mlticlutraism isn it ? 
  well , they do go to poland and actually work there . 
  so they get classified as migrants ... 
  although the highest number of what i could gather was the internally displaced people , which means , the ukrainian refugees often seek shelter in western ukraine . 
  you do know , that the russian language was made official when yanukovich was in office ? 
  that was in 2006 ... ( please correct if wrong ), 
  euronews is actually pretty bad and also likes to sometimes `` accidentally '' spread propaganda .

  using harpoons !, 
  ( not joking ), 
  being european , that 's what they were talking about , unless you were following polish media back then and you know better . 
  [ yeah ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_space_agency ) , [ kinda . 
  but , you 're hungarian , so by default you are european . 
  it sounds like that time when poland got accepted to join eu and people were saying `` we are finally in europe ! '', 
  nope , we were always here ? 
   what are they fighting for anyway , they 're fighting to get out of the country , join the eu and emigrate . 
  haha , yes , they ca n't wait to migrate to uk and take your jobs and benefits . 
  and you are not painting one . 
  nah , they 're just from first world countries , are clueless and naive , thinking everywhere is the same as in their own , little cozy and safe places . 
  `` why do n't they join hands and sing kumbaya ? 
  what a horrible barbarians '' . 
  nato would send an angry letter , that 's for sure . 
   black and red flag [ it 's ukrainian insurgent army 's flag . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ukrainian_insurgent_army ) as a [ pole ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/massacres_of_poles_in_volhynia_and_eastern_galicia ) , not really fond of the usage . 
   yay for your past being greater than the present . 
  oh , so you 're polish after all ? 
  so first ivory coast then ... indonesia ? 
  or is that monaco 's flag ? 
  too bad we did n't get that madagascar though  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/maurice_benyovszky, 
   why do the vast majority of people pick american english over british english ? 
  of course there are many different british accents , but for me personally it 's because i just do n't like the sound of british english . 
  it sounds snobbish and uptight . 
  we are also being bombarded by american culture via movies , music , games and other media , so we tend to pick up their accents . 
  even now , you are commenting on an american site , with over 50 % of the population being american and writing the american way . 
  so i guess our tendency to speak with american accent instead of british is thanks to the american cultural victory . 
  let 's be honest , you do n't even have to be that good . 
  same here in west pomeranian . 
  i 've never even heard about such a thing let alone attended . 
  it has many meanings from damn , fuck , shit , bitch , whore to functioning as a comma or expressing joy and admiration . 
  not unlike english `` fuck '' but thanks to polish grammar it 's way more flexible . 
  we have similar saying in polish , atrributed to j\u00f3zef pi\u0142sudski . 
  which roughly translates as `` wonderful nation , but the people are cunts '' . 
  it says `` whores '' , but i felt `` cunts '' fits better in this context . 
  but i have !, 
  you guys just do n't know the beauty of swearing in polish , it 's almost an art . 
  kurwa can bu used as any part of speech not only as a noun , you just need to add/change prefix/sufix . 
  `` very beautiful/awesome '' ( in a vulgar way ) would be i guess `` wykurwisty . '', 
  sure , some people use it as a comma , but i was just saying that those endless possibilities exist . 
  because some people lack creativity does n't invalidate that . 
  my point was i feel restricted while swearing in english , of course that might be just because that 's it 's not my native tounge , but i think thanks to conjugation , declination and changing prefixes and sufixes , swearing becomes more interesting . 
  `` fuck '' has got nothning on `` kurwa '' . 
  from my polish perspective i feel like english swear words in general lack finesse and are very plain when compared to slavic languages , but you are right . 
  it 's very flexible and universal , it can display wide array of emotions and mean many things . 
   they all had mandatory russian lessons in the primary/middle school . 
  besides being able to read cyrillic or counting to ten , most of those people still speak fuck all of russian . 
  there is no need , by now it 's probably all white < insert overused french joke here  . 
  landing safely . 
  funnily enough , we are always embarrassed by it and think that it was us , that invented this trend , same goes for clapping on airplanes ( which many people attribute to americans ) . 
  well , unfortunately there are more germans on / r/europe than poles , and they just keep downvoting any opinion , no matter how mild , that contradicts their view . 
  let 's compromise on nazi germany death camps . 
   there 's nothing too low for a pole . 
  oh , look , it 's this guy again spewing his anti-polish bullshit . 
  edit . 
  one if his bests quotes [ here . 
  ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2tlq4r/cnn_calling_auschwitzbirkenau_polish_camps/co0kuhx ) guy 's a natural . 
   but it does n't seem to happen enough to warrant this kind of response ( meaning the billboards that was mentioned another place in this thread ) . 
  it 's not about frequency , the fact that this kind of mistake happens at all is a problem . 
  some people say it 's counterintelligence at work , trying to twist history , some say it 's just an honest mistake , language difference or ignorance . 
  does n't matter . 
  as many posters here already stated `` truth gets blurry with time '' and we ca n't mistake victim with a culprit . 
  but that does n't stop modern germans from calling him german . 
  my whole shitposting argument was , that you have to take the good with the bad and that the death camps were n't build by some ancient race of nazis , but germans . 
  well should 've thought about it earlier . 
  now it derailed the whole thread deflecting the issue to something irrelevant . 
  those were nazis , not germans after all . 
  remember . 
   he was born in bonn ... is that a yes then ? 
  it 's certainly amusing being called a retard by someone who ca n't even spell the word right . 
  i do n't know that word . 
  could i get a definition ? 
  thanks . 
  was beethoven german ? 
  or maybe that part of history suits you and it 's fine calling him one ? 
   no , we give credit to governments and people , not countries . 
  countries change over time , since it 's leadership , culture and opinion also shifts . 
  and yet it was japanese that massacred chinese in nanking , americans that bombed hiroshima , french that sat on their asses participating in the phoney war and poles that annexed zaolzie . 
  for some reason german and russian states during that period get a magical label `` nazi '' and `` soviet '' and a free pass . 
   really ? 
  you are going to compare the change in leadership from republicans to democrats to the change from genocidal fascism to democracy ? 
  yes i will , because that 's the change from one political party to another . 
  since the goverment represents the country and its people we usually give credit to countries not political parties . 
  i do n't see how germans are exceptions to that . 
  you ca n't just whitewash your country by blaming it on the nazis . 
   i would almost say that equating modern day germany to nazi-germany is the same as calling the death camps polish . 
  good one . 
  it 's not about modern day germany , but the german state in general . 
  so i guess following that logic guantanamo was a republican detention camp ? 
  nazis did n't appear from some other dimension . 
  those were german or nazi german camps , if you want to be precise . 
  it was just a pun , polls / poles , so you are the one complaining about complaining . 
  alright then that settles it , as a fan of chobits , [ magda `` chi '' og\u00f3rek ] ( https://scontent-fra.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xaf1/v/t1.0-9/17089_968469529859762_5626638632389601301_n.jpg?oh=38dc9355bae9708773ad23ad17e14840&amp;oe=55beb03c ) gets my vote . 
  she might not know anything about anything , but at least she is pleasant to look at . 
  i feel the same way , who do i vote for who is n't a conservative catholic ? 
  i 'd vote for palikot if he were n't a populist and just as insane as the rest . 
  the chunk that was taken by czechoslovakia 20 years earlier while poland was fighting the bolsheviks . 
  we can do this all day . 
   reminds me of the force field in dune ( the lynch film , imma not reading no stinking books ) . 
  i was going to post the same thing and praise on your taste in sci-fi , but the second part ruined the moment .

  piast poland was a fact ( tho it never really covered all the area you have in mind at the same time ) but extrapolating that early medieval fact into xx century to make some kind of claim is beyond insane . 
  i would have to write a few dozen pages to even start to describe how uncomperable both societies and states in those two timeframes are . 
  i 'm not saying that we should give those lands back or anything like it . 
  it is what it is , changing that border is every bit as insane of an idea as changing eastern one . 
  that being said making up lame medieval claims to them is just dumb . 
  only reason we have them is that stalin had a plan . 
  all those stories about poles supposedly ruling wroc\u0142aw at any point between 1400 and 1945 are just creations of stalinist propaganda . 
  that 's my whole point . 
  it 's simply historically incorrect . 
  and as a historian i do care about such things . 
  london was founded my romans . 
  that does n't make it an italian city . 
  also i do n't think that 's correct - beside few years under mieszko poland has n't really controlled western pomerania till xii century and that control was brief . 
  i doubt that pomeranians considered themselves poles . 
  and how would you describe wroc\u0142aw between years 1350 and 1841 ? 
  you know - that time it was a part of holy roman empire of the german nation ? 
  hmm ? 
  saying that szczecin is historically polish is about as correct claiming that moldavia or estonia are . 
  even worse since that happened even earlier . 
  even wroc\u0142aw - has n't been polish since at least ~ 1300 so it 's as irrelevant of a claim as it gets . 
  well , [ 1st voievodships were established in early 1300s ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/administrative_division_of_the_polish%e2%80%93lithuanian_commonwealth ) and we have n't stopped using the name since , if you do n't count a partition-related break , so i guess it must have transfered when moldavia were our vassal or something . 
  `` piast poland '' is just a communist propaganda construct anyway . 
  false one at that . 
  no person with even basic understanding on history should defend the notion of innate `` polishness '' of those lands . 
  not exactly true . 
  on both counts . 
  regarding 1st you have to realize pre-1945 poland was n't a nation state just like many others in europe were n't . 
  there were polish citizens of almost dozen different cultures ( germans , ukrainians , kashubs , tatars , jews , byelorussians etc. ), 
  for hundreds of years and they would not call it an occupation . 
  especially not before modern nationalisms emerged at the end of xix century . 
  and the 2nd part is also incorrect if we were to consider premises of nation-state . 
  lw\u00f3w , wilno and areas around them were predominantly polish . 
  there is a reason why far-right morons of today ca n't stop yapping about them . 
  those damn [ 1900 germans and their rabid anti-german propaganda !, 
  ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/85/sprachen_deutsches_reich_1900.png ), 
  what effective ethnic cleansing would that be ? 
  have i missed something ? 
  we 've done some bad things , live any other country , do n't get me wrong , but i ca n't recall an ethnic cleansing there . 
  if you are talking about voting thing then no . 
  only parts that were german before 1772-1794 were repopulated . 
  but fact that those who were moved there from the east assumed mentality of their new neighbors is indeed very interesting . 
  i guess being uprooted to such extent also allows you to give up old habits and look at things from a fresh perspective . 
  and there is a fact of meeting both regular germans and their new western polish neighbors and realizing that world may not be all that hostile after all ? 
  or maybe if your family and traditional neighborly bonds are broken you have to depend on the state and mythical `` society '' to bigger extent and you realize that it is n't all that bad , and you can actually thrust people , rather than just your close family ? 
  http://www.forvo.com/word/wojna/ http://www.forvo.com/word/woda/ http://www.forvo.com/word/wojew%c3%b3dztwo/#pl http://www.forvo.com/word/wojewoda/#pl only one that is a bit different is `` the leader '' being either old and general term : http://www.forvo.com/word/w%c3%b3dz/#pl or modern military one : http://www.forvo.com/word/dow%c3%b3dca/#pl frankly i did n't think it all will be so similar . 
  on the other hand those words have been around for hundreds of years , so it 's kinda neat that they vary so little even between western and southern slavs . 
  there are few ideas , but leading one says that while prussian state was aggressively anti-polish it was a country of law , unlike two other occupants that were bordering on barbarism and brutal ethnic cleansing at times . 
  that created less of an inheritable distrust in institutions and preserved old identification with polish ( but multicultural ) state , rather than polish nation that had to prevail under other occupants in times of rising nationalisms . 
  it 's kinda pointless question anyway , since we have a fully professional army and as far as auxiliary services go even volunteers from those blue regions would suffice . 
  there is literally no indication that possible next war would be wwi kind of meatgrinder requiring endless pool of manpower . 
  in old polish `` woj '' was a word for a warrior/knight , and to this day `` wodzi\u0107 '' means `` to lead '' . 
  actual word for voivodship is `` woje-w\u00f3dztwo '' and the head of it is `` woje-woda '' . 
  both words have been in use since middle ages . 
  so yes , it 's the same thing . 
  ( we pronounce our `` w '' like english `` v '' ), 
   there is some suspicion that antidepressants can make people go on a murderous rampage and autism ? 
  care to provide something that resembles a source ? 
  apparently he [ was going through a breakup ] ( http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3013743/germanwings-pilot-slipped-safety-net-devastating-consequences.html ) . 
  what a worthless piece of narcissistic shit !, 
  are those psych evals they are supposedly going through even real ? 
  i 've been told that there is not a single thing know to psychiatry that is easier to notice than narcissistic personality disorder of proportions required to do such a thing . 
  because it was n't the depression itself . 
  there has to be hundreds of depressed pilots in the air at any given time if statistics on the subject are to be believed and you do n't see them crushing into mountains . 
  as far as conservatism and religion goes , in reality it has very limited effect on things such as family and sexuality . 
  especially among younger generations . 
  i went more in-depth in the 2nd part of this post , if you 're interested : http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/30dxr6/recent_french_and_german_population_change/cprxlro, 
  back under communist rule situation was a bit better as far as housing goes and much better when it comes to work . 
  it was hard * not * to have a job . 
  but i do n't think that it 's the only reason . 
  people have been moving out of their family homes to get university education for two generations now . 
  you finish high school , you move to the bigger city to attend the university and either rent an apartment with few of your peers or live in the student housing . 
  you just visit your parents every few weeks or so . 
  then if you meet someone and have a longer relationship you just rent a place togather , live for a bit and few years down the line think about getting married or getting a child . 
  you rarely end up with a person from your own home town , and more often than not choose to settle away from your parents . 
  it was like that in my parent 's generation as well . 
  i actually lived with my grandma ( 2nd set of grandparents were 200km away ) , but that was considered unusual . 
  even people who had their parents ( their children 's grandparents ) in the same town lived separately ~ 90 % of the time . 
  to lesser extent in more rural areas , but even there it 's rather due to lack of means , rather than lack of desire . 
  when opportunity presents itself people just build their own house close to their parents ' . 
  and as far as religiousness goes ? 
  i do n't really know how and if it affects whole situation at all . 
  +95 % of poles are catholic , in theory , but considering oneself one and actually following the rules are two very different things . 
  you become a catholic kinda automatically , without ever having other option . 
  even in the generation of my parents most of the people do n't really care about faith , * especially * in regard to issues of family and sexuality . 
  people advocating against things like living togather/having children without marriage , or condoms/pills , or ivf are very scarce and referred to as `` catholic taliban '' . 
  and among younger generation ? 
  much more so . 
  most people just do n't care and will show up in church for weddings , funerals , christmas and sometimes even easter in order to not have to discuss it with grandparents , but that 's about it . 
  there is a religious minority , obviously . 
  ones that goes to church every sunday and whatnot , but among youngest generation that ca n't possibly be higher than 10 , * maybe * 15 % . 
  and i 'd imagine that effect of family/sexuality related teachings of catholic church are mostly limited to the most pious that group . 
  yes , it 's very concerning . 
  i 'd say it 's mostly related to how shitty job market is for young people . 
  those who are n't unemployed or severely underemployed are working on [ temporary contracts ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/images/c/c0/proportion_of_employees_with_a_contract_of_limited_duration%2c_age_group_15%e2%80%9364%2c_2013_%28%25_of_total_employees%29_yb15.png ) rather than full time . 
  you finish university at 25-26 and have real trouble finding a job that can pay for your needs , let alone allowing you to afford a child . 
  pay you can realistically expect to get around 30 , unless you are really doing great , emigrated or found a really superb opportunity is between 500 $ -700 $ . 
  renting z 2 room appartment that is more or less suitable for 2 people in a city will cost you +400 $ . 
  rest of the prices are pretty much the same as in the rest of europe , so if you are doing really well for 30yo , you have 1000 $ a month to cover all the expenses by you and your partner . 
  if your girlfriend does n't have a full-time job ( most people do n't ) getting pregnant means that soon enough you will have only 1 of those wages to cover your expenses . 
  and child 's .

  also stalin personally both hated and feared poles . 
  he was one of the top commanders back in 1920 and he barely made it alive when what he thought was unstoppable red army got crushed . 
  his agreement with germany was that they attack from both sides on 1st of september but at the last second he got cold feet and decided to wait and see how germans are doing and that 's why he attacked on 18th . 
  this is how much he overestimated strength of polish army . 
  on the other hand our army was n't half bad and from what i was told by historians that are more into this kind of stuff main reason why we lost against germans in september so damn quickly was the decision to defend at the very borders instead on the vistula line . 
  german armored divisions simply broken through our lines in multiple places like they later did in france . 
  high command assumed that if we were to to do that germany would simply claim all undefended land and call it a day while our allies in france and uk would n't bat an eye . 
  there is also whole thing about almost all german army invading poland and french having 15:1 advantage on their side of things but deciding to sit on their asses for almost a year . 
  same with uk . 
  so when you add that to all the horrors of the occupation ( 16 % of the population murdered ) we get all twitchy hearing that uk and france has apparently saved us and that we should be grateful that they declared war even tho it has n't helped us at all . 
  finland has not won . 
  they signed peace still losing the territory soviet union wanted to take in the 1st place . 
  seriously ? 
  bmw used to be gangsters ' ( and wonnabe gangsta ) ride of choice in early 90s here in poland . 
  even today you will be ridiculed to death if you own one . 
  especially black . 
  bmw even had few media campaigns solely to fight this image but to no avail so far . 
   still in the end general opinion is that poland suck and we 're `` 20 years behind the blacks '' . 
  everybody complains about everything , especially the current government , no matter if they voted it . 
  that 's mostly among grumpy old people and our whiny political right . 
   political correctness is generally ignored , and when you mention it people will look at you like you 're from a different planet . 
  poles as a majority think they are persecuted ( or at least were for decades ) so they have right to choose if the are following the pc or no . 
  also harsh jokes are fun . 
  first jokes about president kaczy\u0144ski death appeared the same week . 
  again i 'd say less and less of it tho i see some resurgence of right-wing kids trying to outedge eachother by repeating moronic ideas they have n't put half a thought to . 
   ecology is associated with greenpeace nuts that block building badly needed roads and bind themselves to the cooling towers to protest against them ( you know , the evil-looking thick ones , where water is evaporating  ) . 
  and that is simply a misconception born of our constant complaints . 
  only thing people do n't care is abolishing coal , but that 's to be expected in country where almost all electricity is based on coal . 
  people from left to right are much more `` green '' than rest of the eu when it comes to preserving forests , national parks , wild animals and so on . 
  and i mean by a lot . 
  few wolves kill some farm animals somewhere in scandinavia ? 
  shoot half of their population , no one bats the eye . 
  in poland ? 
  we have biggest populations of almost all wild animals in europe despite being much more populated and yet public ( as all the pools show ) is fiercely against killing them . 
  same with forests and so on . 
   most poles have inferiority complex towards `` the west '' because poland is poorer ( btw most poles still think about italy and greece and portugal and spain as places where people are much richer than us ) , but it 's changing slowly . 
  so true . 
  it is mostly limited to people who where already lived as adults behind the iron curtain ( and some youths due to education-induced misguided patriotism ) and i 'd describe it as some kind of strong superiority complex intertwined with even stronger inferiority complex . 
  that mixed with perfectionism and tendency to get all exalted over nothing and you have stereotypical pole . 
  so cringe-worthy . 
  on one hand people consider themselves morally superior etc. 
  but on the other not knowing real situation in other countries assume that it is always sooooo much better than in poland . 
  minor corruption scandal involving ex-politician breaks out once every 2 years or so ? 
  `` oh , how our country is not working !, 
  our politicans are among worst in the developed world !, 
  we are banana republic ! '', 
  you can notice it all over less competent parts of media . 
   not much difference for poles between bismarck and hitler really ? 
  like seriously ? 
  never , i mean never heard anyone arguing that bismarck was anywhere nearly as bad as hitler . 
  and yet countries with both high corporate taxes and high income taxes seem to thrive while ones sporting different approach are n't doing too hot . 
  problem is that companies have always an option of not paying taxes altogether so you simply ca n't win `` i will tax less ! '', 
  game . 
  it would be nice if you could , but it is what it is . 
  you are right about adding benefits tho . 
  it should be both carrot and the stick . 
  playing ball and not trying to screw us over ? 
  good boy !, 
  have a tax cut starting next year !, 
  still trying to weasel you way out ? 
  how about some additional taxes on your goods ? 
  and sure it would n't work if , let 's say estonia , would introduce higher taxation , but with whole eu ? 
  this is simply too big of a market to give up . 
  also notion that tax evaders will always find a way is simply silly . 
  sorry , but i 'm not going to get into yet another discussion how `` pure capitalism '' or `` pure liberalism '' are best economic policies and would totally work if people would just introduced them really , really correctly . 
  for me they are about as great as pure communism . 
  sure it all sounds great and solves all the problems in theory but sadly does n't work . 
  world is just a bit too complicated for that . 
  tbh i just keep voting for po till our left gets their shit back together , get rid of morons like miller etc. 
  tw\u00f3j ruch has some good ideas and very reasonable people like hartman , kalisz , nowicka or nowacka . 
  i 'm just not sure about palikot . 
  thing is that many corporations are avoiding paying taxes altogether , no matter if they are too big or not . 
  it 's not about destroying companies with ones that are too high , it 's about forcing them to pay their fair share if they want access to the market . 
  sure they will try to fight back , but that 's hardly a reason to give up outright . 
  companies earning billions while not paying a dime are hardly something we should care about preserving . 
  also ec has very serious muscle when it comes to things like that and so far all the companies they went to war against had to eventually bend over . 
  you guys still using conscription ? 
  eu is the biggest economy in the world and by far the biggest buyer of advanced goods . 
  no important corporation can afford losing this market and recent actions by ec against giants like google and microsoft prove it . 
  forcing them to pay their fair share of taxes if they want to do business here sounds like a reasonable thing to do . 
  and if someone decides that they do n't want to play ball then i 'm sure that there would be dozens of eu companies ready and willing to cover that gap . 
  so i guess like europe for last 15 centuries ? 
  for historian like me who specializes in ancient history all those `` new rome wonnabes '' are just ridiculous . 
  especially if they are , like in your case , your good streak lasts little over 100 years . 
  most of european countries had empires of their own for much longer than that and yet we still have only one rome . 
   america may be the new rome but that does n't mean that our republic has to die the same way that rome 's did : drowned in gold and stubbornness . 
  good ideas etc. 
  but `` new rome '' ? 
  you guys are n't exactly known for being modest but that 's absurd even for you ... you 've been relevant for little over a century for fucks sake :d, 
  ** poland ** : * legalize and tax marijuana * rise ~ ~ alcohol ~ ~ and tobacco taxes * push for eu wide laws for corporations along the lines of : `` either pay taxes in here or get the fuck out '' . 
  * rise corporate taxes . 
  * tax churches , get rid of tax cuts for them other than ones for preserving historical buildings . 
  * bind highest wage in a company to lowest one . 
  let 's say 1:15 for starters . 
  * get rid of vat on books . 
  * big pay rise for teachers and nurses . 
  * rise funding for top universities by a lot . 
  * significantly rise r&d funding . 
  * increase minimal wage by a lot over few years while limiting the taxes employer has to pay in first few years to the level before the change . 
  * same sex marriages * abortion laws similar to ones in neighbouring countries * secularise whatever else is left .

  most assertive ones advocated for limited use of force on ukraine 's territory . 
  i 've seen none that could be described as jingoist either . 
  british taste for tabloids always boggled my mind . 
  [ this ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/7/7d/gazetawyborcza_cover.jpg ) is how cover of most popular polish newspaper looks like . 
  well done title . 
  i started reading it and was like , `` oh no , one german comedian making fun of holocaust , who the fuck cares about one dumb gu ... oh . 
  not what i was expecting . '', 
  that sounds like a legitimate question . 
  i do n't get the downvotes . 
   jingoism oxford dictionary : * jingoism * , extreme patriotism , especially in the form of aggressive or warlike foreign policy not sure how that applies . 
  and to win hearts of the clueless who ca n't understand the difference . 
  yeah , your public debate regarding eu seems to be fubar . 
  only some . 
  many of the jews , at least in xix and xx century poland were quite secularised and often atheistic . 
  sizeable amount never learned yiddish and basically became poles of jewish ancestry . 
  claims of utter lack of integration are simply false . 
   uh , is that really the best example when they played a fairly large part in instigating the fall of the polish-lithuanian commonwealth in their roles as szlachta intermediares ? 
  i mean the zaporozhian cossacks basically just kept pointing them out and won support among the ruthenian peasantry in breaking away in the khmelnytsky uprising . 
  i do n't specialise in that period so i asked a friend who does , just to be sure , and she agreed with my first assumption that those things were very insignificant . 
  singling out jews during ukrainian uprisings happened but jewish role in sparking them were minimal to none . 
  unchecked power of `` crown princelings '' and failure to deliver on a promise to expand cossack regestr were two main issues followed by few secondary ones among which was hiring jews to manage magnates ' estates , but even then that 's just one piece of the puzzle made of attempted exploitation by magnates themselves . 
  those oligarch funded troops seem so bizarre in modern country . 
  just like magnats ' private armies back in the times of plc. 
  on the same land too . 
  i actually saw a graph with what they manufacture the other week and it 's really not that hard to avoid them . 
  i , without even trying or knowing what is theirs , only used one of their products - ysl perfume . 
  have you even read what you responded to ? 
  i 'm all for criticising israel in any way , shape or form and am not too concerned about angry protesters expressing anger at jews ( since , angry protests are n't known for splitting hair and keeping in mind parts of the nations that are on their side ) but this is some hardcore bullshit . 
  back in early xiv poland started it 's policy of accepting jews who were being prosecuted and expelled from other european countries . 
  they were given their own rights , protected by the crown law and become loyal citizens and important part of society 's fabric for next 600 years . 
  jewish population in poland was by far biggest in europe reaching well over 20 % in some regions . 
  and yet their `` genetic evil '' mentioned by author , somehow failed to transpire . 
  hate israel , it 's government and it 's semi-fascist ideology all you want . 
  you should . 
  but simplifying it and blaming all the jews for that makes one no different from israeli extremists . 
  it depends . 
  if it poses imminent threat to others it seems like a reasonable thing to do at times . 
  there were , for example , suggestions of preventive war against nazi germany . 
  in hindsight it sure looks like best option for everyone including germans . 
  also when it comes to isis we are n't even talking about possible threat but very real aggression happening as we speak . 
  i 'm far from being us-style trigger happy , but i would n't discard the possibility of any preventive military actions on principle . 
  that 's interesting . 
  i had literally no idea . 
  never got in contact with anything other than state owned wod-kan . 
  old habits die hard , 
  ceo arguing for access to drinking water not being considered basic human right is just a tip of the iceberg of shit nestle is doing . 
  i rarely care about things like that but even i was disgusted reading about their exploits . 
  perhaps , but in poland most of state monopolies were ` privatised ' on stock market with country holding enough shares to still control them . 
  they are transparent but government can still affect them . 
  most of them ( nor orlen this year tho ... ) are turning quite a profit and yearly dividend is reasonably big part of a budget . 
  it always struck me as a reasonable compromise . 
  wow , that is crazy . 
  even in poland during biggest privatization madness ( we privatized railroad and semi-privitized electricity production for w/e reason ) no one even proposed privatizing things like water , power lines , sewerage , gas pipes . 
  yeah , you 're right . 
  not sure why i used this word . 
  it was obviously little bit of both , but like you said with more conquest and assimilation than extermination in many situations . 
  my apologies - when one writes on the internet it 's easy to forget about being accurate . 
  and it really was n't about painting you as some resident bad guys , things like that were hardly uncommon or limited to germans at the time . 
  about the same time one of the polish dukes p. much exterminated whole baltic tribe of [ yotvingians ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/yotvingians ) in a punitive raid . 
  terrible title for very interesting video . 
  you should be ashamed op !, 
  you really thought that the cheesy title is only thing that will make us watch it ? 
  actually pederast is adolescent man fucker and little boy fucked is a paedophile . 
  common etymology dates back to ancient greece . 
   i think poland made out pretty well compared to germany . 
  who the hell wants belarus anyway ? 
  poland managed to get some great land due to stalin 's power grab . 
  apart from some basic infrastructure and natural resources land does n't really make much of a difference . 
  people inhabiting it are what matters and since population was virtually moved from land that was lost to land that was gain i 'd say that everyone would rather want to leave it as it was before . 
  ww2 and stalin 's relocations also made poland one of the most ethnically homogenic countries in the world for the first time in its 1000 year history . 
  before people who 's mother 's tongue was polish usually made less than 60 % of the population , so post-war changes were quite groundbreaking as if war itself was n't enough . 
  it is what it is tho . 
  complaining about history serves little to no purpose . 
  damn , i 'm yet to meet even mild german revanchist . 
  you got me intrigued :(, 
  there were [ more changes ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/75/map_of_poland_%281945%29.png ) too . 
  everything that is yellow was german before wwii and mostly inhabited by germans ( sizable polish minorytywas only in silesia ( bottom left bit ) . 
  on the other hand pink parts where with poland for hundreds of years as well . 
  actually both germany and poland got pretty screwed by forceful relocations after ww2 . 
  thankfully no one is looking for redrawing of borders ( save few 0.01 % of morons ) since that 's one big clusterfuck . 
  one could argue that stalin 's idea to deport both poles and germans from transferred territories is one that can be responsible for lasting peace in the region in foreseeable future . 
   for russia to just show up out of nowhere is just comical for me . 
  to claim the history of the area is even more of a farce . 
  well , that 's how history works . 
  stalin came up with the idea , churchill and fdr ok ` ed it and it was done , just like that . 
  calling danzig purely german city ( like konigsberg arguably was ) is a big stretch . 
  it was polish city for 300 years , then got annexed by brandenburg for 150 years to then return to poland for over another 300 before it was annexed by prussia . 
  konigsberg was part of poland only for about 200 years as a part of prussian homage and had very little polish inhabitants . 
  do you really view those two situations as similar ones ? 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/old_prussians those were baltic tribes ( like lithuanians , latvians , estonians and few others that have n't survived ) that were exterminated by german crusaders making place for colonisation of the region back in xiii-xiv century . 
  hence it kinda fit that too , and referring to german inhabitants of east prussia as prussians is n't all that common . 
  not like we would want it in the 1st place , but i 'm curious why you specifically hope it does n't fall to poland ? 
   but germans ** were ** expelled from their homes were . 
  nothing can be done now . 
  palestinians are getting expelled and prosecuted now . 
  what is even your point ? 
  that injustice happening to someone at some point in history makes similar injustices happening now ok ? 
  or is it just an exercise in futility ? 
  edit : love blanked downvoting of all my recent comments , regardless if they are related to this thread or not . 
  very mature .

** misconception : ** all people who dare say anything critical of this are idiots and ca n't extrapolate this situation into any of the possible myriad developments . 
  true or not ? 
  you tell me . 
  [ the end is the beginning is the end , is it ?

  [ well well well well well ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jchhjdmqah4 ), 
  the fact that slovakia wants to legally protect itself from being forced to accept refugees makes them more right-wing than the spiritual successor party of the nsdap ? 
  whoa , calm down , vladimir ilyich . 
  some people just [ hate everyone ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjpd0ngrnv0 ) . 
  what do you mean undust ? 
  you mean to say you do n't keep yours impeccably clean at all times ? 
  oh , do n't be such a seriousness nazi , it was a joke , man !, 
  i understand what you are doing with extending the process beyond the first step , but it 's a mystery to me why you are doing it . 
  let me try this . 
  is building a road automatically bad ? 
  when hitler built roads in the 1930 's was it bad for the people of germany ? 
  the end . 
  are nazis capable of ever having a valid point ? 
  yes . 
  either way , it 's not really about hitler 's highways , we started off with the npd leaflet . 
  here again i stand by my sentiment : npd 's hi-jacking of the soon-to-be-official policies , as suggested elsewhere in this thread , is what 's dangerous ** to someone who does n't know any better ** . 
  the leaflet sounds reasonable , therefore hi-jacking those ideas makes the npd appear as if they have a valid point . 
  so when they 're making it , it 's a valid point . 
  so people will see that leaflet and if you had your way , they 'd look at what many here have said are perfectly reasonable things ( hence , one would assume , why they 're being adopted as the official stance ) and they 'd wonder about how on earth `` those bloody nazis '' ever got that thing so right down to a t - which could make someone like you look like a fool , for having always claimed that nazis are idiots . 
  dangerous people should not be belittled and should not be underestimated . 
  to me , a realistic assessment is a must . 
  ( i am slightly reminded of hannah arendt 's `` banality of evil '' , as portrayed by [ that film ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmbsiq1lkoa ) , for some reason , but that 's a tangent ), 
  fair point , i agree . 
  i hurriedly read that as `` accepted in the west '' , instead of `` accepted part of western culture '' . 
  apologies . 
  then we appear to agree in general , but one of us might be getting something wrong , it appears ? 
  i stand by the sentiment - right-wing extremism is dangerous because in separation some of their viewpoints are valid ; which is what you so vehemently reject , claiming that due to the tainted connection to a larger ideology , right-wing extremism can not ever be right . 
  which to me is an absurd notion to hold , to me - to say right-wing extremism is right about something , but at the same time it 's wrong about the same thing , because it 's right-wing extremism . 
  i hope you catch my drift , as i ca n't think of an analogy suitable enough . 
  to me , that 's a bit of denial and a rejection of reality . 
  sorry , we 'll have to disagree over this detail then , albeit i 'm glad we agree on the general point ( i assume we 're both referring to the statement that right-wing extremism is dangerous , for various reasons and in various meanings of the term ) . 
  i have to ask , however , what you meant by your statement that `` right wingers are espousing a reactionary ideology itself '' ? 
  reactionary as opposed to ... ? 
  but is n't male circumcision accepted in the west ? 
  it 's not controversial to me - i do n't think i know anyone who 's had it done , but i do n't hear about protests against it ( at least it 's absent in the mass media i happen to consult ) . 
  do you mean to say you used the `` suggest title '' reddit function and this was the result ? 
  i realise the plans were conceptualised during the weimar republic . 
  still , i believe hitler was highly critical of the republic and rejected a lot of its legacy - yet he was enthusiastic for the autobahns ; so in that respect , he ** did ** build the roads , did n't he ? 
  i 'm going off of wikipedia here , so do correct when necessary , but since railways were the primary lifelines of industrial and military transport , the intent of building the roads does n't seem to have been part of the future war effort , either . 
  i 'm not going to try and persuade you otherwise ; you extend the total image that we now have of the nazis to try and convince me that a single detail , like the autobahns , was not an accidental element of the nazi state ( since plans were laid during the weimar republic ) , but an integral one instead . 
  i am at a loss about what to think : were the autobahns a mistake or not , if they were conceived by the weimar republic , but built during hitler 's time ? 
  were the germans of that time right in building them , or should we condemn them for it because of what happened later ? 
  i remain unconvinced . 
  edit : i remain unconvinced as to your statement that nazis could never have been right about anything historically , and nazis ( i.e. 
  far-right groups ) ca n't ever be right about anything today - a statement that seems predicated on what hitler did during wwii . 
  it 's an absurd notion to me : that 's the whole problem with far-right extremism ; it 's not dangerous because it ca n't ever be right - it 's precisely dangerous because some elements of its ideology , in separation , may appear to be acceptable !, 
  it 's what the whole picture builds to that is the problem , yes , absolutely . 
  have n't you editorialised the title * ever so slightly * ? 
  germany should immediately demolish all remaining autobahn stretches built in the 1930 's / 1940 's , as they were built under hitler 's reign and are therefore wrong , due to nazis being unable to ever have a valid point . 
  building * those * autobahns was a mistake that needs immediate rectifying . 
  is this the quality of discussion we want to endorse ? 
  i would venture calling it `` irrational '' , but that may be subjective . 
  i dare say dclauzel gets the attention he gets not through his comments , but mostly through his mod actions ( albeit the comments play a certain role as well ) . 
  what is your reasoning for such a sentiment ? 
  are you saying immigration is a non-issue ? 
  why did they use a throw-away , then ? 
  are they banned on this subreddit ? 
  as opposed to your expertise hidden behind a 1-hour old throw-away ? 
  since it 's a replica of about 6 metres in height , i 'd say it 's sufficiently far off not to constitute `` south africa 's eiffel tower '' .

  you 're right .

  i know i was mighty bummed as a kid when democracy came and we did n't become magic americaland all of a sudden . 
  at least i could read some spider-man and batman , so there was that . 
  i encourage you to watch the video again , for the video i watched three times now has a guy that talks about 5 or 6 hours , not 6 or 7 . 
  sapek 's definitely taken his talent to new heights with that trilogy , as far as i am concerned . 
  reminds me of the time i was on a long-distance train , taking a dump and suddenly we arrived at some minor city that i 'd have never guessed we 'd be stopping in . 
  my 15 minutes of very private embarrassment , while the people were getting off and on the train , saying their goodbyes ... 
  so , uhm , yeah .

  i beg to differ , but if i did blunder indeed , then i 'd be only happy to have started sounding stupid already , if it 'll become some sort of a magic spell that can change the vector of where things are heading . 
  it 's the conflation of `` roma '' and `` romanians '' , would be my guess . 
  then there are at least two of us , as my musings point me to largely identical , ugly conclusions , however much i would wish it were not so . 
  in fact , i 'd be very happy to be proven a fool . 
  contrary to what the hive-mind may believe , it is not the score , but the words that should be important , albeit there are obviously arguments in favour of a score system ( which , unfortunately , becomes a target of various manipulative practices for the very reason the score system is worth having in the first place ; a catch-22-as-catch-can situation ) . 
  decadent ?

  central planned economy will never work in a long term . 
  and that 's my point from the beginning . 
  that 's not any news , moscow says so since a long time , the only reason they left ukraine alone were the `` friendly '' goverments and a hope to turn them into another belarus . 
  if you 'd folow the russian opinions on internet , which are just parroting the oficial propaganda , you 'd not be suprised about their actions against ukraine since they never accepted its independence and dissolvement of ussr . 
  fortunatelly for the baltic states , they 're the members of nato and eu , otherwise they 'd end up like ukraine , or worse . 
  russia violated the international agreements first of all . 
  you could negotiate it with ukrainian gov in 1991 , but all that mattered were the military bases , which is as well the rearson to invide and annex it now , except that it involves destabilisation of ukraine , which was the real reason to do so . 
  just face the reality , kremlin never cared for he russian people , it was the same during and after wwii when they kicked out local tatars and settled russians like cattle which you can chase from a one field to another . 
  they 're going to look for a job , steal or beg , but most of unemployed people here are just alcoholics collecting bottles and cans to exchange them for little money they spend on ... alcohol . 
  seriously , i 've said it already that i 'm not any radical , i think the state is to serve the people , but taking money from them and giving to the others is not helping anybody and in the long term it 's just making it worse . 
  then the problem is with your welfare system and that basic `` income '' idea is not going to fix it . 
  you know there 's a difference between helping minors , sick and retired people and `` helping '' everybody by giving the others money away . 
  it 's not a real help actually since it discurage people from improoving their skills , education and seeking jobs , they 'd rather stay on comfortable welfare and do nothing , that 's why i 've said it 's demoarlising . 
  i like your absurd sense of humour , but i doubt the murdered and starving people would appreciate it . 
  ok , it 's fully understandable , but just mind that theese people are not paing taxes for real , they 're paid by the others taxes . 
  personally i 'm not a radical , i think the people who really ( underline ) needs help , should be helped , but they also should n't pay any taxes since it 's pure nonsense . 
  also , it 's not a real help when you just give money away without any other perspectives of work , education and just social advance , theese people will just stay on welfre and never move on . 
  the example of your friend should be also put in a perspective of taxes that she/he was and is paying , becouse these are hers/his money that could be spent by her/him and not by the goverment . 
  the salary would be just much different without it , or with smaller taxes . 
  you 're also just giving me another argument abut how demoralising is the welfare since it 's not worth to have a decent job and honestly earn money if you can just get them for nothing . 
  why to even bother doing anything useful if you 're going to get robbed by the state and sponsored by the taxpayers if you do nothing ? 
  tell me , are your unemployment offices offering some professional courses and work offers , are they cooperating with employers ? 
  do they even demand the unemployed people to seek the jobs , go on the interviews and accept offers ? 
  co kraj to obyczaj - same proverb  glad to hear that . 
  if i can `` sell '' you a secret ... try talking few words in broken polish , the people will love you instantly and do whatever to help ( even if you do n't need it ) . 
  it 's true i know very little about the finnish welfare system , but i was rather criticising the very idea of a basic `` income '' ( how 's that income actually ? ) . 
  if that 's an improovement as you say , then i 'm really sorry about how exploited are the finnish people . 
  do as you wish , we got bankrupt and reformed our conomy the same time exactly , except that it costed us alot and we 're still a one of the poorest eu countries . 
  wish you 'll come to your senses before it 's too late . 
  ok , i know the idea , but following this way you should as well tax everything since the life itselve is dangerous , not to mention that some people have just genetical predispositions for some illnesses . 
  would you tax women just becouse they have breasts and thus higher probability of cancer ? 
  this is a nonsense . 
  you convinced me , i 'm moving in . 
  sure i did , but since we started to talk about the very idea i thought it would be good to put it in some perspective . 
  thank you for prooving my point . 
  still i ca n't see a reason to give money for nothing . 
  no , just the state and its services have no such means , or the will , to close everything . 
  they could be as well corrupted or just `` tolerant '' since policemen are also people grown in the same enviroment as everybody . 
  yes , it 's still expensive and it could be much better if gov could just do what it done in portugal , decriminalise it . 
  it 's hard to compare with your country or uruguay as well as it 's hard to comapre the prices of oranges or bananas , which we ca n't grow in poland , the amount and quality of the crops will never be the same and the same goes for the price . 
  come on , you just mentioned some of he `` social '' costs of using the pot . 
  anyway that 's all just an excuse for extroritng more money from the people and i 'm quite sure the gov will not loose another opportunity to take even more . 
  maybe in finnland , here you have to actually work first before you get unemployment fee when something happends and you ca n't just live forever on welfare . 
  no , you 'll not `` make '' but get these money and someone needs to earn them first to pay the taxes . 
  the money do n't grow on trees , you know ? 
  how ? 
  besides , it depends on a system and it does n't make them any more or less reasonable . 
  ca n't say , but most of weed here is local , grown in greenhouses . 
  if farmers here can grow tomatoes and paprika , despite the cold weather and terrible soils ( mostly sands ) , they could as well grow cannabis . 
  i do n't supose that everybody grows potatoes or rye in a backyard , but you can always buy a bread or vegetables in the shop or market . 
  it 's demoralising since you do n't have to do a thing to get money while the others needs to work hard and they 're being punished for it . 
  instead of giving others money away , the gov should consider to not take them in the first place . 
  that would be far more efficient , but most of all , fair . 
  if you wants to throw your money away , be my guest , it 's yours and i respect your liberty , but i 'd rather encourage people to make their own enterprises , employ people and live like satisfied citizens ... not useless and pathetic beggars . 
  the solutions which you 're advocating are not improoving the numbers and standars of employment , they 're just promoting unemployed people living on welfare . 
  still that 's quite expensive compared to poland where you can get that 1/8 ounce ( 3.5 gram ) for about 47 $ . 
  for about ten years it used to be 26 $ until quite recently . 
  there 're also discounts if you buy more at once . 
  anyway just compare the us taxes and regulations to eu and as for the `` competition '' there 's none in the market of tabacco which prices are directly determined and regulated by the gov , you ca n't sell it cheaper . 
  i just do n't think that the gov will loose such a chance to extort even more money from the people . 
  ok , that 's how it is in france i guess , in here the `` cartels '' selling weed are mostly some local thugs or just regular guys who work as middlemen between the farmers and customers . 
  i 'm sorry if you have gangs and mafia in france , but as you just said , they 'd only get a little bit less wealthy and smuggle it anyway . 
  the only solution is to let everybody grow and use it if you really wants the mobsters to get bankrupt . 
  still i do n't know what 's so great about it . 
  the state should not be some `` charitiy '' organisation which gives away the money taken from the others , by force . 
  if anything they should help , but most of all do n't disturb the people who wants to earn honestly . 
  it would rather make the gov to be a cartel . 
  i 'm not going to lie , i like weed and most of people i know in poland knows very well how harmless it is . 
  in my opinion the problem is that when gov will replace the `` mafia '' in its job , the prices will grow far higher becouse of taxes and i 'm quite sure they 'll establish concessions for the ones that can corrupt them . 
  just like it is with tabacco . 
  i say , do n't legalise , just decriminalise and let the people grow their stuff like any other plant . 
   employer mafias comrade , i do n't know how 's that in us , in europe most of the companies are small and medium private enterprises . 
  if you steal their money , they 'll not be able to employ workers , the big corporatons will always survive either by outsorcing ( more unemployment ) or corrupting the politicians . 
  and why is that a `` right '' direction ? 
  giving money for nothing is not just demoralising , there 're the others who need to pay for it and they 're the ones disadvantaged here . 
  goverment earns no money , they 're just taking them from people by force . 
  it 's not just that germany refuse to confront russia , they also have alot of common interests with them , their former chancellor schroeder was just corrupted by gazprom and they 've constructed a pipeline on baltic just for political reasons of moscow . 
  i 'm quite sure they 've also forced eu to excuse the russian invasion of georgia . 
  just for the sake of `` peace '' , to keep their good relations and busyness going on . 
  we 're looking to america becouse it 's not dependent on russian gas , it has no interest to excuse or support them , but most of all it has means and balls to stood up against their actions . 
  also , do n't think that 's just some romantic `` blowjob '' like sikorski said , politicians can do or say whatever , but the people knows that both germany and usa can sell us if it would just serve the interests of these countries . 
  i was worng , obviously . 
  listen you schweinhund , we did n't asked for these lands , nor for the money which are given to each and every new eu member and they ca n't be used for military . 
  as for who 's a thief , we 're still lacking thousands of artworks stolen by your retarded regime during the war , not to mention the pure vandalism of our cities , especially warsaw , slave labour and most of all millions of victims which ca n't be measured by any amount of money . 
  just halt die klappe . 
  sorry if i 'm laughting at the guy , he deserved notinhg else , but we both know how ridiculous and immature sounds the name `` radek '' in polish and that nobody is calling him like that . 
  i could n't link translation of [ pap ] ( http://www.pap.pl/palio/html.run?_instance=cms_www.pap.pl&amp;_pageid=1&amp;s=infopakiet&amp;dz=kraj&amp;idnewscomp=167022&amp;filename=&amp;idnews=170333&amp;data=&amp;status=biezace&amp;_checksum=1646591863 ) ( official press agency ) , but it 's as i 've said , included in the budget of the ministry of finances , ministry of defence said they just ca n't pay it from their budget becouse it would be against the rules . 
  also , i 'm finally not sure which ministry was responsible for what . 
   polish air force has 48 f-16 . 
  the price of one machine without weapons is approx . 
  42 million us dollars . 
  because such expenditure exceeded the possibilities of defense , established a special multi-annual program financing the f -16 . 
  the tender was settled at the end of december 2002 . 
  the results of these wars are horrible . 
  ep is useless waste of money and it never will represent people the same way as national parliaments . 
  you ca n't have democray without a demos and despite the expensive efforts , it 's not possible to create an artificial `` european '' identity . 
   forward with european project rather backward since that would most likely destroy everything . 
  greeks and brits will not be the only ones opposing this internationalist loonacy . 
  if you wants to ` fight ' for `` united '' europe , you 'll need to face europeans and i hardly doubt that a pack of eurocrates and left extremists is going to beat them . 
  i agree , except that the politicians are elected so the popular opinions matters .

  i vote for a mandatory paintball guns mounted on the crossings to shoot people that do that . 
   maybe they do n't know what f. . . indicators are for they surely have no slightest clue .

  to begin with - people tend to use breaks in a more reasonable way . 
  god damn it / poland,

  all of the good universities are in western or northern europe , with 1 popping in from south and east . 
  nothing from central or south-eastern . 
  if dug out this train will be a very important find , regardless if it 's full of gold or empty . 
  from early georadar scans it seems that it 's a complete armored train from ww2 - not even one was preserved in any museum to date . 
  additionally it seems to include a few complete armored vehicles ( including tanks and tank destroyers ) onboard - again : with immerse historical value . 
  a possibility of finding additional equipment like weapons , ammunition , highly unlikely ( probably rotten down ) but still possible : documents , could really open a new chapter in our insight into the ww2 . 
  finally ps . 
  imho that 's one of the things that eu should take care of and unify across the entire eu , cause the current state of things is way too dangerous for my liking . 
  weird . 
  in 2013 lithuania was spending 0.8 % , in 2015 they 'll spend 1.11 % and their current target is to reach 2 % by 2020 ( sources : [ 1 ] ( http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/04/03/us-lithuania-defence-iduskbn0mu12720150403/ ) , [ 2 ] ( http://www3.lrs.lt/pls/inter/w5_show?p_r=4445&amp;p_d=151726&amp;p_k=1 ) ), 
  oh , i get what you mean . 
  good point . 
  population did not vote . 
  the representatives of these 7.7 % voted * against * , representatives of vast majority of population voted * for * . 
   is extremely stupid or extremely manipulative . 
  or just extremely imprecise . 
  no reason to automatically assume stupidity or ill will . 
  that 's not how it works either . 
  representatives of the countries voted , decision was made based on that , and vast majority of countries voted * for * . 
  there was no ' * arbitrary decision from the eu * ' . 
   second , did these people present themselves without delay to the authorities ? 
  if they are doing anything without delay - it 's running away from the authorities . 
   how would a v4 military fare ? 
  it 'd be a bit more powerful and less coherent version of polish army . 
  other v4 countries got relatively minor armies - even looking by % gdp it 's : hungary - 0.9 % , czech republic - 1.0 % and slovak republic - 1.0 % . 
  compare that to poland with 2.2 % ( [ source , 2015 estimate ] ( http://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/news_120866.htm ) ) . 
  but v4 army would n't make much sense anyway - who they 'd be able to stand against ? 
  not russians , that 's for sure , cause orban is more pro-russian than any polish post-communist party . 
  czechs and slovaks meanwhile would prefer to ignore everything and everyone . 
  v4 is an illusion with no actual will to do anything coherent . 
  should have moved to latvia instead of stealing . 
   i would add psl but i think they never were in opposition  for those curious : since regaining democracy in 1989 , psl was in government coalition during years : 1991-1997 , 2001-2004 , 2007 onwards . 
  every time with a different party . 
  they 're very ... persistent . 
   he too spoke of `` hypocrisy '' , but he aimed at eu members such as france and spain , which have anti-migrant fences , but which criticise hungary 's razor-wire barrier . 
  oh yea , i found that especially amusing . 
  either support fences or do n't - a rational arguments can be put out for both sides - but having fences yourself and at the same time bashing hungary for that is laughable . 
   waaaaaaay less messy not really ...  maybe go get some inspiration there , mods ? 
  from a sub that 's 8 times smaller ? 
  yea ... we 're long past that point . 
  you never voted to be in a purely economic union . 
  [ you voted for a membership in european economic community ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_kingdom_european_communities_membership_referendum,_1975 ) which already was a partial political union that established several things that brits apparently do n't like any more , including a guaranteed [ freedom of movement ] ( https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/treaty_establishing_the_european_economic_community#title_iii_.e2.80.94_the_free_movement_of_persons.2c_services_and_capital ) . 
  hahaha , the most positive subreddit about it is / r/anarchism ... hahahahahahaha, 
  actually , [ yes , you do ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nato ), 
  oh , stop complaining already / poland, 
  well , the current doctrine is that we 'd be first to react . 
  so as much as in the end we all will rely on [ america ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihnugaaea4m0 ) , polish army will be there to provide support early on , to let the ball rolling and start up nato defenses . 
  and to be fair - if poles meet in person with hungarians , * lengyel , magyar -- k\u00e9t j\u00f3 bar\u00e1t * always seems to make people smile , 
  an act of democracy would be to follow the constitutional path . 
  if we 'd ignore all the rules in the name of abstract impressions of what democracy is and what it is n't - in a worst case we 'd end up in anarchy , in a best one : in a rule of mob . 
  constitution is not blocking anyone from conducting such referendum , but it has a specific order in which and how it should be done . 
  otherwise it 's not much better than what russians did in ukraine . 
  yep , and in this case : democratic order of doing things was infringed . 
  1 square meter garden ? 
  what he is supposed to do with that ? 
  plant a radish ? 
  democratic order is set by a constitution , constitution that , as far as i 'm aware , is forcing such referenda to be made on the territory of entire spain . 
  someone is wiping his ass with a constitutional order - he gets punished for that .

  catering to american audience with american humor, 
   the age pyramid still looks better than most european countries . 
  then governments should act to change it in your country instead of pulling migrants in . 
   this does n't happen in europe . 
  in some countries it does n't . 
  in other it does . 
  europe is a very diverse continent , despite of what some media try to imply . 
  musk kissed it himself, 
   `` many studies show does not happen '' . 
  the only studies i 've seen show that middle eastern and african immigration he is doing the same thing [ as last ~ ~ heavily ~ ~ mildly up-voted video did ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3lb43j/the_european_refugee_crisis_and_syria_explained/ ) - drawing conclusions on the european immigrants based on a statistics of latino american immigrants in the us . 
  people elected him to the european parliament , we might not like it , but in fact : he ** is ** representing poland .

  let 's not forget my favourite excuse : it 's not islam , it 's poverty . 
  we can not blame islam , because islam is diverse and christianity is even worse - look : crusades and inquisition . 
  not sure if you can find over 700 scientists with enough patience to withstand politicians over the span of few years , though i would certainly like to see similar initiative on a national level , given huge disregard of science or ... well , even logic that too many members of national parliament display all too frequently . 
  yes , and they do n't walk with falanga but rather polish flag . 
  well , electing president that says things that either undermine nato or partially dismantle it certainly does help in repeating the cause of the precious growth ... 
  well , he lost a popular vote , but won thanks to electoral college .

  held it last year , and this year will come close ( for large satellites they are pushing as many launches as the industrial base can output rockets , so there 's not much they can do to sign even more contracts for launches within next 2 years , new contracts go beyond that ) . 
  random fun fact : arianespace was the first commercial launch provider , and for a while they held 100 % of market . 
  technically it 's an illiberal democracy - a. . . very specific approach to democracy . 
  there 's more to it than just a tyrrany of majority . 
  all rockets have components imported from various different locations , but ariane family is quite unique in sourcing large sections of rocket from various different countries . 
  current ariane 5 , which is even more complex , leads the market by revenues and is one of a few launch vehicles to enjoy 100 % success rate within last 10 years . 
  perfect for intelligence purposes .

  moscow is since eternity a symbol of anti-civilisation in poland and we have generally a very bad opinion about you we have never taken anything from you , we have never wanted to and we never will well there 's probably one exception . 
  i 've read that based on your experience , we have created an audit institution which is probably the most respected office here, 
  your president is a joke and you 've given 2nd place in your parliamentary elections to some random populist retard plus you 're also more corrupt than us . 
  you already are infected and this is probably it distorts your view of other countries, 
  the germans just see themselves as teachers for the poles , nothing unusual they just a have a very special attitude towards us that they have towards no other country, 
  the germans are arrogant enough not to bother themselves with collecting proper information , instead they blow everything out of the proportion and exaggerate regular , internal reforms to the point where they depict this is a coup , and get their news from an ideologically homogenous group of journalists that are known for not liking the ruling party in poland since probably forever i wonder why is this the german * modus operandi * ? 
  is it because somebody is looking to justify their deeply hidden , for the time being , aversion to poland ? 
  and now we can finally get back to our usual , genuine views of poland ? 
  because it 's really the germans that are fueling this there 's no pluralism in germany anymore , you have self-censoring media that fire people because they 've criticized the idea of mass immigration , you should look at yourselves instead of putting your nose in our internal affairs even the germans say that you ca n't openly debate controversial issues in public better take care of your issues with free speech, 
  the bbc is n't pluralistic as well if you have a society where there are cultural divisions and there are many disagreements , you 'll probably end up with a system in which when the government changes , many journalists and staff from the public tv or radio get wiped out that does n't happen when there is a sense of unity in a country , but that unity can also have the face of russia  i like the model in which the governing party and the opposition get their channels in the public tv , i think this is how it works in germany , but then the opposition is n't united as well , so i guess in the end you just have to count on the competences and good will of the current public media staff, 
  he did n't describe his opponents as second class citizens but he made a general remark about the `` tradition of treason '' in polish history without pointing to specific people also , he did n't call anyone `` gestapo-like '' . 
  by the way , should n't he be supportive of gestapo if he 's a national socialist ? 
  and the reporter was n't `` beaten '' but poked and the same happened when a politican of the former ruling party poked a female jounralist when she was recording a video about the protests that took place near the parliament you have no idea what you 're talking about , you even have no idea what national-socialism was , i assume it is because you also lack knowledge about all the myths that were very strong in the german culture, 
  wow do you really think that a party in which its leader 's father took part in the warsaw uprising is national-socialist ? 
  are you really this dumb ? 
  this is getting funnier and funnier  i did n't expect this level of anger to outburst during a shift of political power in a country did anyone even bother to check what was the state of our public media when the former government was in power ? 
  when almost everybody in the media was supportive of the ruling party and journalists that shared views with the opposition party were all wiped out from the tv or radio , with a single exception of a man who had his show shifted to late hours ? 
  the level of hypocrisy , hysteria and ignorance is so huge that you really ca n't take all these alarms being raised , as serious, 
  terrible article that does n't explain antyhing , only exposes the author 's ignorance  in order to appease those poles , who found themselves on the losing end of economic reforms , they blamed former security agents , who allegedly infiltrated businesses and syphoned money out of them you do n't have to be someone who has lost in economic reforms to agree with that diagnosis , as this is simply a historical fact , accepted by everybody , except staunch critics of the right wingers , who will say anything if it contradicts the beliefs of the right yes business is/was to some extent infiltrated by former communist secret services and their secret agents . 
  but it requires reading about the roots of influential polish businessmen , academics , politicians etc. , just simply stepping outside your comfort zone, 
  so this is why the swedes got so mad in the mid xviith century ... 
  [ i am john paul ii , and i approve that gif ] ( http://www.swjakub.pl/images/stories/jargrafika/inne/1.jpg ), 
  it was about making a general point in response to the alleged `` soviet influence '' you just ca n't go for the mono-causal explanation, 
  i believe catalonia is a part of spain since the xviiith century ? 
  this idea is a gigantic failure because : 1 ) it 's significantly going to weaken incentives for work , at least for some 2 ) it makes citizens dependent on the state on an unprecedented scale ( i 'm leaving fascism , nazism and communism out ) , where the state literally will be responsible for maintaining the citizenry 3 ) it will de-politicize and alienate people even more and destroy social bonds , because the leviathan will take care of everything 4 ) considering the above - this is yet another step to destroy liberty and impose an almighty surveillance state , as hobbes wished for so anybody who is enthusiastic about that does n't treat liberty seriously . 
  probably because he does n't know shit about history and political thought anyway this is going to collapse just like any idea of a state - `` rationalized '' economy . 
  the soviets already tried to manipulate with economical transactions in order to `` rationalize '' the society and make it equal ( and that 's really the logic behind this common pay ) . 
  did n't work in the long run, 
  the germans will come up with something they already had the idea of remaking the roman empire and now they 're really putting the pressure on southern states so much that they hate them and think that euro was planned as a german conspiracy this is a good start for integrating europe, 
  there 's a lot of corruption in spain and italy because clearly , they 've been free of the soviet influence and there 's a very liberal abortion law in post-soviet countries , because they 've been influenced by the ussr , because only people with soviet mentality impose liberal abortion laws ( your logic ), 
  [ you can clearly see the soviet camp here ] ( http://one-europe.info/user/files/330cs3b.jpg ) and [ here ] ( http://ichef-1.bbci.co.uk/news/624/media/images/72724000/gif/_72724992_eu_corruption_labels_624map%283%29.gif ), 
  poland is too racist and xenophobic you should let us stay homogenous for your own safety this is also why immigrants ca n't come to poland and why poland should be let to stay alone, 
  spain right now is a fake , not internally integrated country the only thing that holds catalonia and spain together is spanish nationalism and the army  the spanish should let catalonia go, 
  i mean that they started the whole process and it 's the first party that ever thought of creating the first central , anti-corruption , non-communist office, 
  yes and they can strike down the decisions of elected representatives , who are the foundation of democracy i 'm just pointing to the logic of democracy . 
  constitutional courts can distort the logic of the democratic political system , that happened many times in the usa . 
  then in effect it 's really legal experts who rule rather than politicians but of course you can be critical of democracy and then indeed , the judges should be viewed as a powerful center of power , almost unrestrained in their competences and then they can rule with an easy , regular majority, 
  i think that the title would suit our current president of the cc better , as he was , as you know , in the communist party ; , 
  did those gerb/dps parties also create a central , anti-corruption office that in consequence brought down corruption in poland so that now it 's , according to ti , placed 35 . in their rank and bulgaria is 69 . ? 
  i 'm talking about the cc judges in general . 
  i do n't care by whom they have been elected why is it that people elect their representatives to the parliament and then 15 judges have the power to strike down a bill with just a regular majority ? 
  you had your coup during local elections in 2014 when there ware nearly 2 million invalid votes you reinterpret everything in a discrediting way for the current government rather than from the point of abstract rules and ideas and so this is why i have a different opinion , because i think some of those changes are simply fair constitutional courts can become a pain in the neck . 
  it has been proven in the usa and our court proved that when it had stuck down lustration, 
  i 'm in favor of making the tribunal vote with a majority formulated in a fraction ( whether it should be 2/3rds i do n't know , i like 3/5ths more ) . 
  i think this is just fair we 've learned from the us supreme court that judges also must have restraints imposed upon them , because otherwise they tend to distort the political system and act as if they have an executive power like the parliament or the president * some * judges can just easily find any excuse to rule according not really to the law , but to their personal preferences , thus they should have it a bit harder, 
  dunno , people often use 3/5ths and 2/3rds, 
  russia is a sick country with a soviet mentality still in place , because their soviet authorities constantly bolster the pride in both the soviet union and imperial russia ( yes , in russia you can be proud of the tsar and stalin at the same time ) this is why russia will never really reform itself because they care more about foreign issues than internal issues . 
  and if this is the case , well then surely anyone who criticizes the government 's foreign policy puts himself on the line, 
  so you 're saying that the procedure for electing judges is unconstitutional ? 
  :d the tribunal can only tell the parliament that it should change some articles in a particular bill , but it 's beyond its power to say whether a judge was elected illegaly or legally, 
  but why should n't judges with a weak legitimization vote with a 2/3rds majority ? 
  what is so undemocratic about that ? 
  if the c.court 's position is too strong and they make decisions too easily , then we end up with with a center of power that manipulates the law and the constitution , as it happened in the usa , where some of the s.court 's decisions were made on completely ridicolous grounds, 
  there 's no such thing as an `` illegal '' judge all judges ( right now we have 20 elected judges ) were elected and some of them are sworn tribunal has no power to decide who is `` legal '' or `` illegal '', 
  what is wrong in making the tribunal rule by a majority of 2/3rds ? 
  why should the judges rule with a regular majority ? 
  you may like it or not , but it 's really not that controversial and saying that the `` eu '' urges poland to do something is an exaggeration . 
  only few people really expressed concerns anyways , they ca n't really do much . 
  there was the same hysteria with orban and hungary and they did n't end up being isolated, 
  polish school : - english 6 y.o. 
  - german 10 y.o. 
  i never bring the nazis , because that passed away and wo n't come back and i precisely wrote this i referred to the xix-xviii th century attitude of germany ( or maybe it 's better to say prussia ) towards poland , when for some reasons you were angry at us and thought that you have a right to teach us certain things . 
  this spirit , although not literally , still exists in the german media the sense that you can say anything about poland , accuse us of falling into a dictatorship , drop the explanation of the whole political and historical context of polish politics and in general create a national drama and histeria in germany , all in order to arrogantly school us on democracy and by the way , do you think it is wise that germany is alienating another of its neighbours ? 
  you have the south against you , you have france against you , why have poland against you ? 
  do n't forget you like to get into a duo, 
  i 'm not referring to the jokes , although they 're also a sign of some things , but this is n't something i 'm interested in . 
  there 's an increasing arrogance and teacher attitude towards poland in germany, 
  generally speaking - it would be just for the uk to break up uk is a non-integrated country created by simple , primitive conquest of scotland . 
  the scots have never really felt any bond with the english and the english have no right to keep scottish lands but from the political perspective , the british break-up would cause too big of a turmoil and obviously , you want to live in an as stable environment , as possible, 
  i believe `` dziadek mr\u00f3z '' works only for the russians , ukrainians and belarussians, 
  i 'm talking about the media , that took a histerical stance against the current polish government and one article even duplicated the argument given by den alten fritz that justified the partitions this is weird , because you have changed your attitude towards the jews , romas and homosexuals , yet your opinion about the poles seems to have gone back just to the xixth century and i think this anger will only get stronger of course i 'm not talking about the nazi-stance , nevertheless irritation and anger still exist and the sense that somehow you should be a teacher figure for poland, 
  you are taking in immigrants that live off of welfare , you do n't really know how many legitimate refugees have you taken in , as they ca n't be even properly checked by your policemen but this is just a consequence of your politics , yet despite the fact that u do n't have the info , you still want to have a beef with us, 
  we need to get deeper , sorry, 
  the ukrainian immigration increased after the war in donbas had started , so i 'm sure some of those ukrainians came to poland because of war and do you know how many * legitimate * refugees did germany , france or britain take ? 
  because from what i know those refugees camps , you know , exist in turkey , lebanon and jordan , 
  i 'm not saying this , but there is this special feature of wapo that does n't bring them credibility as well , so i would speculate , that yes indeed this article was inspired by anne applebaum, 
  but she obviously has still influences there and she writes articles for them from time to time and she 's a respected journalist in the usa there is a clear conflict of interests there - she 's the wife of the former foreign minister and writes for the newspaper that reports on the topic of the former opposition party, 
  we 've taken already half a million ukrainians besides , you should understand that some of those eu funds go back to the countries that had poured them in, 
  eurofunds are like what , 2 % of our annual gdp ? 
  the single european market is far more important for poland than the eurofunds , because those eurofunds go back to germany and france in the end besides , poland is considered an `` emerging '' market and those countries tend to have a faster gdp growth than the countries that are already highly developed . 
  if the productivity in poland stops to increase , then obviously no amount of money will be helpful, 
  clearly * die h\u00e4sslichen deutschen * are preparing the ground to justify their future outburst of distaste and arrogance towards the poles , once again this is why * die h\u00e4sslichen deutschen * are distorting the words and report things about poland in a sensationalist and manipulative way to make it look like there will be a sort of censorship imposed on the media in poland * die h\u00e4sslichen deutschen * did n't report about how the current public television is heavily in favor of the former government and how there was almost no one who would represent the views of the former opposition . 
  this is * des alten fritz * spirit the arrogance of the germans is absolutely mind-blowing and i do n't get why are they so obsessed about the poles , that they constantly talk about poland in a highly emotional manner, 
  the supporters of the former governing party and alike seem to slowly fade away and be less active there is absolutely no reason to be concerned about democracy or rule of law in poland i remember how the former government helped to take over one of the biggest polish daily `` rzeczpospolita '' . 
  why then was there no outcry about censorship or the end of democracy ? 
  i also remember the way in which investigative comission in sejm handled the gambling affair all those people shouting about the end of democracy are just a bunch of hypocrites that ca n't accept that they 've lost miserably in the last elections, 
  this means that the parliament is obliged to change the wrong articles and that a sentence of a court can be changed . 
  and also you know when the law ca n't act backwards the cc ca n't tell me whether i should return the car or go to jail, 
  well i disagree here - i think the only case in which the tribunal can tell the president what he should do is when there is a conflict regarding competences of the central offices of the state ( eg how the president should cooperate with the government around foreign policy ) if there was an article in a bill which would say that one becomes a judge after the oath , and cc would be asked to rule on this , then the situation would be way clearer, 
  that is zubik 's opinion . 
  some think that one becomes a judge after the oath and if the president refuses to take the oath , then the office of the judge is voided then , the president is n't judged by the cc and it has nothing to do with his impeachment, 
  the cc could only tell what the president is supposed to do , when it would be asked to solve a conflict between the central offices of the country about their competences [ article 3 par 5 ] ( http://trybunal.gov.pl/o-trybunale/akty-normatywne/ustawa-o-trybunale-konstytucyjnym/ ), 
  this means that the parliament is obliged to change the regulation and correct the bill , but there 's no way that the cc can tell the president `` you are obliged to do this '', 
  that 's fully correct , esp . 
  because pis is the most sceptical party about russia  and by the way - how are things with nord stream 2 going ? 
  how can the cc tell the president what to do , when it 's only supposed to say whether a legal act violates the constitution ? 
  welfare spending is the biggest position probably in every country , 
  why is the increase in family benefits spending populist ? 
  do you even know how much poland spends on its welfare ? 
  it 's not an authoritarian government , rather the media that are ideologically opposed to the newly elected party , describe it this way .

  europe will not be strongarmed out of relevance being a large united organism does n't mean it will have to be belligerent . 
  there would be an added layer of economic and political safety that would very much foster all the things you enumerate - trade , technology , diplomacy . 
  as it stands , powers like usa , russia or china can and do play us against one another in these fields . 
   maybe you have the impression a counselling is always pressure for the one or the other option . 
  that is certainly not the case . 
  i have no doubt that many , if not most , people who would be doing counseling would be empathetic professionals . 
  still , some will inevitably be assholes and would be posed to do great emotional harm . 
  thus , i would prefer for the counseling to be offered , certainly encouraged , but not mandatory . 
   however , i think someone has to speak for the unborn child somewhere in the process . 
  otherwise it remains unheard , and i do not want that . 
  certainly , but i do n't think it is omitted either way . 
  human culture is inundated with messages about family and children . 
  the whole fact of pregnancy brings the prospect of a child prominently to the mind of everyone concerned . 
  how we consider the feotuses is an important philosophical question which can and should be argued , but i am not certain if mandatory counseling is the place for it . 
  i would argue pregnancy is a major health-affecting state and thus abortions are very much about health preservation , heartless though it sounds . 
  bearing a child is , after all , a huge sacrifice that a woman 's body focuses on almost exclusively and it is a calculation that is always being made , consciously or not . 
  of course the preferable way about it would be a proper protection , but it is still crippled by bad habits , culture and instincts . 
  i am all for sweeping sexual education myself . 
  regarding the cost , the issue here is that it becomes a class problem . 
  richer folks will get their abortions regardless of the cost/trouble and how irresponsible their sexual behavior was , while the poorest and the worst educated will be either forced to found potentially dysfunctional families or seek help underground . 
  even if we disagree with abortion itself , hampering access to it harms the society in general . 
  healthcare is not just about curing diseases . 
  healthcare also fixes people after car accidents they themselves caused , poisons they willingly ingested , cancer caused by cigarettes . 
  pregnancy majorly affects a person 's health , so healthcare helps those people , either to carry the pregnancy to a happy healthy conclusion or to termination . 
  why should we interfere which path is taken ? 
  i would argue that exactly the consideration of said options creates mental distress . 
  for example , the prospect of founding a family while being destitute and with the father being terrible or already thoroughly absent . 
  or carrying the child to the full term , having their body almost completely transformed just for that child to be sent away . 
  thing is , for some women none of the options are good . 
  they can just as strongly believe about life of the unborn child too and yet they have to make a choice . 
  like , what options ? 
  founding a family and giving the child away for adoption ? 
  they are aware of these options . 
  when we do have a common public healthcare , its aim is to assist the populace to be healthier . 
  reproductive issues and planning are biologically the most critical health-affecting issue of human beings . 
  therefore , healthcare system has to assist them . 
  to do otherwise would indicate a major bias against a procedure crucial to millions . 
  `` hearing about alternatives '' should be included in the general sexual education and not forced in a crisis moment , when plenty of women feel utterly scared and lost . 
  for plenty of women , it is the most terrible decision they have to make in their lives . 
  but forced counseling would only make it worse for many of them . 
  counseling and support should be clearly offered , but the moment it is forced it can easily become an intrusion and judgement . 
  ah , cold war , usa did so much crap back then , i am really glad they suck much less now . 
  no wonder greeks have bad memories - a lot of fondness for the us in poland also comes from the cold war . 
  it is a sad opera of mistrust and recrimination . 
  wish you luck and the rest of europe too . 
  ca n't blame them for the last one . 
  some kind of greek dish , i always thought . 
  i am more surprised with the poll saying greece majorly dislike usa . 
  what do you think about it ? 
  if so , then why ? 
  it just shows how the place and its history are bigger than the greeks or the turks . 
  even the norse name for it was `` big fucking city '' ( translation mine ) . 
  well , whatever , not saying this sub is a shining pillar of flawlessness either . 
  but it is still far superior to news/worldnews , thank you very much . 
  yes , we need to send 200,000 clickbait posters there asap !, 
  ca n't have some unspoiled internetspace somewhere , can we, 
  sunni islam is very decentralized and i hear eastern orthodoxy is hardly monolithic either . 
  a temple is an embassy for people who consider their religion a feature that overrides their citizenship . 
  so unless we live in a theocracy , a lay government should not treat temples as such . 
  then a mosque should be the least of your worries !, 
  i do sympathize , though , polish politicians also have a long history of sucking up to clergy , sometimes even before the clergy itself makes any demands . 
  fun fact along these lines , for a long time i thought `` istanbul '' is some dirty `` moosleem '' word , but it actually comes from greek just as well . 
  a temple is not an embassy , last time i checked . 
  unless you live in a theocracy and neither turkey nor romania are ones . 
  haha , no historical hiccup there , nope . 
  why not just retake byzantium or something ? 
  are we bargaining with islam itself ? 
  is mosque an embassy ? 
  is a church ? 
  jokes and internet , eh . 
  one person 's `` obvious '' joke is another person 's genuine idiocy .

  he did not help much either , but that 's a different story .

  i would worry more about the influx from the outside , really , and that is why such a high-profile thing should be probably conducted by iama, 
  and yet you are here .

  thank you . 
  i am not sure we can learn that much by now , he was quite outspoken for a long while . 
  unless someone throws a really good question or two , but that 's not assured . 
  i do n't read him as traumatized , really . 
  let us not be defeatist . 
  it would certainly be a huge moderating effort but there are ways to make it less messy . 
  / r/europe mods probably would have to get some serious support reinforcements for this , though . 
  this is a complex issue and i do not think it is such a binary choice . 
  i do not want europe to be a scary empire or an enemy of russia . 
  diplomacy and trade are more effective when there is a common platform and a bigger negotiating leverage . 
  issues like military , immigration , energy , some international relations , trade relations can be greatly benefited by a more united europe . 
  powerful outside actors easily play us against each other in many of these fields . 
  because it still sucks a lot , despite decades of improvement . 
  at least most of it managed to stay the fuck away from russia recently . 
  no one says it will happen anytime soon . 
  certainly not , in my opinion . 
  but in the long term europe will be either a superstate or a curious backwater museum . 
  did n't tsipras get elected on the promise `` fuck austerity , stay in eurozone '' already ?

  and that 's where my nick comes from as well ... have n't even seen the movie , 
  if i 'm reading you correctly , you want free stuff and do n't want to thank germans for paying for it ? 
  obviously , the government ... 
  are there elections coming up in poland or something ? 
  folk-e [ a ] tings-be-slutning . 
  `` slutning '' might be just another term for `` whoring '' , 
   create a corridor through poland d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu ? 
   east wise and experienced in the ways of the world we might be not `` experienced in the ways of the world '' but we have some experience in `` the ways of russia . '', 
  yup . 
  i 'm not applauding the other murderer ... unlike you . 
  no , i mean 25 % that do n't see themselves as europeans . 
  what does the remaining 25 % see themselves as ? 
   you 'd rather have a man who planned and executed the murder of 17 innocent people free than dead ? 
  well , if the alternative is some anonymous dude , on the other side of the pond , deciding who lives and who dies , then definitely yes . 
  one step at the time ... 
  it would n't be the blast that kills you , you 'd be dead 30 seconds before the blast wave gets to you . 
  neither . 
  there 's no such thing as `` will of the people . '',

  my point is entirely based on modern science , namely genetics . 
  what is your point based on , post-modern ` morality ' ? 
  you mean the babies ? 
  yes , it 's sad that in the 21st century we still have to fight for the right to live for our fellow human beings . 
  jacek hugo-bader actually has some very interesting and insightful series of reportages from former ussr . 
  they were made in early 90s , i guess he has suffered the same delusional paranoia that hit michnik since . 
  then you are already lost . 
  eh , not this proletarian internationalist mumbo-jumbo again . 
  i know a lot of people who went for erasmus , however 95 % of them were studying humanities and did n't really invest themselves much into it . 
  99 % of these people were going for erasmus to party in a warmer country ( mostly spain ) , i have n't actually heard them studying anything onsite . 
  in fact , polish universities do n't even count the year spent on erasmus into the degree . 
  conversely , the foreigners on erasmus in poland do n't have the same responsibilities as natives , as they hardly speak the language . 
  they mostly get a pass regardless of their involvement . 
  claiming erasmus is a study opportunity is false . 
  it is a cross-cultural meeting one , which produces quite a lot of couples , but the educational benefits are probably negative ( basically taking a gap year paid by eu ) . 
  are you implying there are insurmountable physical differences between men and women ? 
  careful , i think that 's mansplaining !, 
  recently facts about corruption in dietary science emerged . 
  basically the carbohydate-producing companies paid a lot of money to researchers throughout the last 50 years or so in order to blame fats . 
  only now novel research actually shows the correlation between carbs and chd . 
  they even discovered a whole new neurosignaling pathway based on some carbohydrate enzymes , one which could play major role not only in heart disease , but also mental ones . 
  fats do n't generally cause cardiovascular diseases like we 've been taught . 
  dietary cholesterol has no correlation with body one . 
  recently , much more emphasis was put on research on carbohydrate effects on these ( it also became apparent that research in last 50 years or so was corrupted by carbohydarate producers , in order to blame fat ) . 
  in poland we eat a lot of white bread , which is rather unhealthy and has a lot of carbohydrates . 
  i think that could be one reason . 
  the development funds are not free money and only ignorants use this argument . 
  we never agreed on any quotas on joining as well . 
  it 's actually not that cheap , to the point it 's pretty much unaffordable for most people . 
  to get a permit and buy a simple handgun it 's easily 10k z\u0142 and a year of training - and you have to actively participate in sport shooting . 
  self-defence permits are impossible to obtain . 
  communists afraid of revolutions . 
  it happens rather frequently , last time by zdf , which i think is a public broadcaster . 
  the issue is even bigger , recently there was a disgusting article by frankfurter runschau , which claimed holocaust was n't perpetuated solely by germans , but in unison with poles . 
  fitness industry is false , because it shows the effects of heavy steroid use and claims it is because of their useless supplements , while in fact 100 % of fitness models are on juice . 
  it 's actually pretty close to polish pronounciation of hiszpania ( heesh-pan-ya ), 
  greek democracy was actually very elite , and certainly no women were allowed to vote . 
  the lie about polish concentration camps was created by germans ( specifically , an ex-nazi spy working for adenauer ) and is still exploited by the german mainstream media . 
  as for economic gain , what do you think about , for example , nordstream then ? 
  you 're right , usa would have done the same ( and probably invade azerbaijan just for the lulz ) . 
  however , that still makes russia a threat for europe ( which i believe it was n't during yeltsin 's reign ) . 
  are you kidding ? 
  libya was the most prosperous nation in whole africa , they built massive public projects such as the great man-made river , newly wed couples had a flat and money given to them for free , the public had massive subsidies to everything from oil to education in western countries . 
  libya was definitely better place to live in for young people than half of europe . 
  then gaddaffi wanted to create his own , gold-backed currency and start selling oil in it , instead of petrodollars . 
  and then all of a sudden he had a massive insurgency in his country , where out of nowhere ` citizens ' started firing heavy weaponry , mortar shells and tanks at the government , while western powers indiscriminately bombed the shit out of the national forces and citizens . 
  do you honestly think such policies are created by presidents , not the deep state/military-industrial complex or the eggheads in mod ? 
  quoting al-jazeera in a discussion about militant islamism is like quoting der sturmer in a discussion about nazis . 
  well , on the other hand these lawful ways would easily get subverted by morsi , as he already established himself as a de facto dictator , influencing all branches of the government , in his short reign . 
  well , since mujahideen were created by cia to fight soviet invasion of afghanistan , he is technically right - but i know what you mean , cue the nyt article describing ben laden as a ` freedom fighter ' . 
  indeed . 
  to be honest , i was not supporting georgia in that war . 
  however , putin did act kind of aggressively . 
  the agency was created by po in 2015 . 
  the article does not say when the funds were embezzled , but my safe bet is that po at least had their share . 
  not really , i 'm actually a classical liberal , complete opposite of pis ' conservative socialism , and have opposed pis in every election . 
  what about the georgian war ? 
   but the polish government want those western companies to locate branches in poland they can then use to keep polish worker wages low and taxing them on the profit they make as a result i 'm not sure where you are getting that . 
  do you honestly think a government whose one of the main ideological stance is to increase real worker wages and reduce foreign capital ownership of major industries would do exactly the opposite , in order to gain minuscule ( yes , they are minuscule as western companies are masters in tax dodging ) tax incomes , which are orders of magnitude lower than what they would get from income taxes and vat on increased salaries ? 
  great , let 's see how these textbook definitions lived up to real world scenarios . 
  unless you want to talk about theoretical systems of governance that are not realizable , but for me that 's a waste of breath . 
  let us also not forget that the term dictatorship of proletariat was extensively used by marx and engels in their basis for socialism and communism , but hey , what did the guys who invented the whole ideology knew , right ? 
  inquistion was dealing only in religious manners and rarely handed out sentences , the myth of burning stakes is a myth , they never had executive means to do that . 
  the stakes were set up using local laws and most of the victims were sentenced for treasonous/anti-state behaviour , not blasphemy , and on local rulers ' judgement , not inquistion 's ( although obviously they often collaborated ) . 
  the only inquisition that executed thousands of people was spanish inquisition , which was not under pope 's command , but under spanish king 's , who used it as another policing agent . 
  the reformation was pretty bad in that it lead to religious wars throughout europe , i 'll give you that . 
  juncker 's declaration of war towards tax havens is the most hypocritical statement of 21st century , right after shroeder 's signing nord stream deals and becoming its tenured board member . 
  yes , it is . 
  show me a socialistic country that was not a totalitarian regime ( maybe besides allende 's chile , but it was more of a social democracy ) . 
  the difference between socialism and communism is that one is a realizable , albeit murderous , political ideology , and the other is a utopia , that can never work in the real world . 
  well , it might be a radical view , but i think they are more akin to a financial pyramid that uses pseudo-spirituality to gather more money . 
  of course , some cynics might say all religions do that , but it 's not true on a systematic level , for instance in catholicism , while in scientology it 's ingrained in the structure of beliefs itself . 
  they also commit conspiracy to interfere with the state , as in the operation snow white . 
  yea , if you claim the pope gets frequent death threats from catholics in poland i need a proof of that better than a random redditor saying ` poles want to kill the pope ! 111 ', 
  which story exactly ? 
  but please , do n't start with crusades , that will only lead to embarrassment . 
  historically socialism is equivalent to totalitarian regimes . 
  he should instead use the word social democracy , which has a completely different , benevolent meaning . 
   and when france wants to force corporations to pay them minimum wage , poland protests and blocks everything at the european level . 
  [ citation needed ]  and poland dares to protest when we wo n't allow corporations to fuck our working class over . 
  disgusting behavior . 
  there is no other word . 
  poland protests , when on one hand eu talks about european values , freedom of movement , freedom of capital , etc. 
  and then france tries to block said freedom of movement and capital in the name of same eu solidarity . 
  that 's not only disgusting , it 's a logical mindfuck that makes no rational sense , besides playing protectionism intra-eu , against the very european values they claim to protect . 
  he also says capitalism is bad and socialism is good , which i think is the main reason people who have actually lived through socialism do n't like him a lot . 
  that 's bullshit and typical weak counter-propaganda - ` islam is bad , but crusaders were so bad too !, 
  ' , ' a u was bij\u0105 murzyn\u00f3w ' - style show me examples of catholics threatening to kill people over pope , or whatever else connected to religion . 
   do you know how much hate current pope gets from conservative catholics in poland ? 
  sure , he gets a lot of hate , since he supports socialism and is against capitalism . 
  however , nobody threatens to kill the pope . 
  scientology is a cancer that should not be regarded as a religion anyway . 
  of course it is authoritarian , even the basic definition requires the dictatorship of the proletariat . 
  not to mention every single historical realisation of socialism was a bloody totalitarian regime . 
  i 'm getting the impression that you are redefining words that have intrinsic meaning to fit your left-wing agenda of whitewashing socialist crimes . 
   we do quite a bit more than welfare . 
  when the french and german governments have controlling shares in major corporations it goes quite a bit further than that . 
  several countries actually legislate to make workers representatives required on corporate boards . 
  yet they do so within the capitalism framework and market shares , not authoritarian means as in socialism . 
   and even the welfare was won through decades of worker resistance movements and unions , which were organized by socialists for socialist principles .

  we ( and many other countries ) have a failing public retirement fund system is what 's happening . 
  nobody should be forced to have more children so that they can financially hold 3 elderlies the moment they 're born . 
  government handouts in poverty do n't help natural growth , having an actual life out of work in relative financial comfort does . 
  japan tried to do the same to their country but failed to see the issue at the core ; we 're just repeating their mistakes . 
  i thought rather about silly pis populist expenses and all broken/unfulfilled campaign promises than sociological environment causes . 
  all it got us is debt . 
  honestly with the current government it all went to shit and polish z\u0142oty is getting devalued pretty seriously . 
  damn populist conservative catholiban policies . 
  there should be a sub for maps with displaced warsaw . 
  i feel ya man . 
  i 'd dig some thai or korean girls over here . 
  but the thing is , we have nothing in place to integrate them . 
  poor language to learn , public offices that do n't know a hint of english , generally unfriendly environment to anyone that is after studies . 
  this will have to change , but at the moment we 're closer to close ourselves down than to open up to newcomers other than ukrainians i guess . 
  unlikely . 
  both countries are rather unwelcoming of immigrants . 
  hospitable , but not accommodating whatsoever . 
  im fond of the canadian system myself . 
  though first one would have to make a country worthy and accomodating of settling in . 
  i generally am not opposed to migration if it 's educated people with competitive skillsets . 
  though i may be in minority in that regard . 
  czechs are far from attracting the poor around the world to flock to them for welfare . 
  oh , you referred to sanctions . 
  certainly , but it does close many types of business venture . 
  in that case that 's a good thing , no matter where they 're from . 
  so no point in the venture or it having a chance of staying . 
  i dont think they can afford competitive business . 
  also is n't russia sanctioned heavily ? 
  see no reason why they 'd do that , all factors considered . 
  maybe i 'm missing a country ? 
  where else from ? 
  max kolonko is a conservative so he 's low key supportive of trump and pis . 
  he broke the trend with this video and suddenly people be like traitor communist scum . 
  to the current government and its supporters , that 's no badass , that 's a whining communist being taken away from power . 
  the comments make me so sad :( that 's the kind of people that support the current government . 
  i 'm not , just that liberal democracy is the only one that works at the moment , unless i 'm omitting something . 
  if we 're going to split democracies into types and which one is entitled to which right , we 'll end up with none of it . 
  oh i 'm sorry you need a 30 million demonstration to understand there 's a significant opposition to it . 
  even including the pis supporters , the majority was opposed to the reform . 
  it could be defending the separation of powers , which is , by extension , one of the tenets of democracy . 
   not people who spit on him at every occasion . 
  you 're talking about the majority of poles opposed to the judiciary reform ? 
  if that 's the case he should reevaluate his views , as he 's not being faithful to his voters in that case . 
  he 's an mp . 
  he owes his duty to the people and their voice above any petty inter-party squabbles . 
  if you think otherwise , we clearly have different definitions of duties and obligations of an mp . 
  i do n't care if there 's schetyna or adrian from 2nd grade out there - you 're not standing with the people and their voice . 
  the control itself is n't so bad but nowhere is it direct with nothing overlooking the process or the candidates ; there has to be some approval by a council or some other branch . 
  poor excuse . 
  the protest was not organized by the politicians . 
  they just took part it in it . 
  honestly this is the kind of behavior you 'd expect in a kindergarden - `` i could join but there 's guys i do n't like there . '', 
  honestly i do n't consider any of them `` the '' opposition . 
  the fact that they choose to discredit the protest or/and attempt at appropriating the protest instead of fighting for democracy and standing * with * the people above all boundaries ( including that of party ) shows how petty they are . 
  i was referring to the one bill that was passed that 's still eroding the separation of powers . 
  the means matter little if they do n't reflect the voice of the people . 
  2 out of 3 bills was vetoed , the third one on common courts did pass . 
  ca n't really tag this as a victory for democracy . 
  at three levels , the supreme court , the national council of the judiciary and common court . 
  by either the minister of justice or the parliament . 
  on top of that , they can be retired at will by the minister of justice . 
  the first two were vetoed , the third was passed . 
  by saber we 'll retake . 
  the minister of justice can appoint judges directly and arbitrarily with this reform , meaning you have the judges you want each time a party gets the cabinet . 
  fair , all i 'm saying it 's a possibility . 
  edit : as per your edit - especially as kukiz was shitting on the protests just a day ago . 
  kukiz is a populist big tent/right wing party and they agreed with pis on a lot of things in the past , hard to tell where their line is . 
  with kukiz they can , and kukiz is rather unpredictable . 
  i would n't celebrate just yet , the veto can be overruled by 3/5 of the parliament . 
  in addition , the current party was in such a hurry that the version of the bill was different from the one voted by the senate , which is ( another ) breach of constitution ( you should 've seen the chaos and shitstorm before the vote ) . 
  as such the bill was invalid anyway . 
  they may try going around it either way . 
  edit : oh , and the common courts bill was passed ... 
  its a bit disappointing how all the members of the opposition try to appropriate the entire protest as if they organized it . 
  just highlights the issue at core ; disconnected opposition from the voice of the people . 
  ah , fair enough , knew i missed something . 
  as leftist as i am and wish government would deal with many social areas , i 'm a proponent of debt being a last resort , not something you should perpetuate or keep for the next party to deal with . 
  a bit of an issue with 4 year elections terms , there 's little thought given for what 's ahead . 
   but we need people to push economy forward . 
  we need children to be educated and live comfortable lives to make better decisions . 
  you ca n't make good decisions when you live in extreme poverty . 
  sure , there is small percentage of people that will use it as incentive , but it often does n't end in american dream . 
  then you deal with extreme poverty , * not * natural growth . 
  low natural growth is symptom of inability to have children for a multitude of reasons , lack of money is just * one * of those reasons , not the cause . 
  there are just better ways that are n't roundabout and do n't end with debt with no return in sight . 
  but first one has to recognize the exact correlation between cause and effect and another and the factors influencing those causes . 
  you want a simple measure that goes a long way , else it 's just throwing money at a problem hoping it 'll solve itself . 
  an unrelated example is solving bank issues in the past crisis by bailouts and billion money injections . 
  waste of money that just ended up lining bankers ' pockets . 
  this is similar . 
   social benefits are by definition target at groups that need help . 
  do you think we should make social benefits for people that are n't poor ? 
  my point is people should n't be having babies they ca n't afford to bring up nor have an environment they can be brought up in . 
  the government should n't help with the former , they should affect the latter , else you eventually just end up spending more money but not solving the problem you wished to address . 
   as for quantifiable investment . 
  we do that as well . 
  with a lot of help from eu funds . 
  smart growth is doing exactly that . 
  focusing on specific problems , and trying to solve them by investing in promising ideas/businesses . 
  there are points for and against it .

  just revive the tradition of carrying sabers . 
  at least it 's way more posh than axes . 
  it used to be so until 1977 .

  this post makes me more at ease with everyone staying with 4g . 
  in the interwar period . 
  that 's what we 'd have to do to not break our agreement with eu if we passed the requirements . 
  we can avoid that without angering eu by artifically keeping them from passing . 
  i 'm not saying that it 's happening , only that it 's not `` lower unemployment = better '' when it approaches end of the scale . 
  also i do n't think a national bank could do much about workforce shortage . 
  we already do , there 's plenty of ukrainians working here . 
  you can avoid it indefinitely by deliberately not passing required metrics . 
  that 's what poland is doing . 
  czechia is getting on the the dangerous part of the scale . 
  there 's this concept called [ full employment ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/full_employment ) , where everyone having a job is actually a bit above 0 % unemployment . 
  it seems to be somewhere around 4 % . 
  in theory this can cause bidding war between employers and hyperinflation . 
  i agree that meat has a much greater enviromental impact than vegetables , but when it comes to health exercise and portion size has much greater impact than slight changes in composition . 
  and fatty foods leave you satiated for longer per calorie , so it naturally comes easier to control portion size when you 're eating a fatty meat-heavy diet . 
  going to the extreme ( either vegan or keto ) is taxing on body , but even mixing it up a little bit makes it okay . 
  humans are much more adaptable to diet than most people think . 
  you just need to not get fat and move . 
   there is no tolerance for intolerance if only that was true they would n't have the issues of muslim clusterfuck . 
  beer is a vegetarian meal i can get behind . 
   40 days without alcohol that one 's tough . 
  eskimo rarely eat anything besides meat , fat and organs and somehow they 're fine .

  if you hate muslims that much you can come to poland .

  there is a difference between them , even if you need to look for it . 
  they 're pretty much fucked economically , if nothing else . 
  it 's understandable that they 're angry . 
  austria has to keep buying these medicore watercolors .

  soviets planned a defensive war of attrition . 
  their plan was to turn poland into a nuclear wasteland in case of nato invasion . 
  perhaps for germans . 
  we 're going to get thrown under the bus way before they get to germany . 
  we feel that germans want to treat poland as a buffer zone in case of russian invasion , a kind of `` let 's have war there , it 's lost to us anyway '' land . 
  it makes us doubt in nato 's resolve to actually do something in case shit hits the fan . 
  the underground city was called zion . 
  matrix movies . 
  living in the last human settlement on earth takes toll on your mind . 
  soviets attacked a lot of groups and that was because they opposed soviet rule , not for any other reason . 
  power was all that mattered . 
  these atrocities were n't in the name of atheism . 
  it 's just a consequence of letting australia in . 
  looking at people writing in esperanto in this post 's comments , english is certainly not enough . 
  with slovio you understand almost all of it if you speak a slavic language .

  apparently being close to russia correlates with meeting the quota . 
  where are the proofs ?

  they do n't remember permanent shortage of goods , kilometer-long queues to buy meat or furniture , political instability and purges , cold war that could end with mad nuclear exchange any day ... 
  they only `` know '' it from tales of people who long for days when they were young and healthy and complainers who got left behind during transformation saying how `` everything was more fair back then '' ... 
  yes , that debate made to constitutional court once . 
  in 1997 one amendment that permitted abortion due to difficult personal situation , enacted one year earlier , was declared unconstitutional and removed . 
  apart from that , usually any proposal does n't even make it past lower house of parliament . 
  i guess , it depends on how question is phrased - the one you 're mentioning asked about possibility of `` abortion due to mother 's difficult life situation '' , which is completely different situation to `` abortion on demand '' , and has much wider support , even within some conservative circles , who do n't want to see abortion used as a form of birth control , but understand that `` accidents '' sometimes happen . 
  this is , i think , sixth or seventh approach to change abortion laws in modern poland - there were proposals to change it to both sides , depending on current government . 
  each and every one to date got stuck down , as current laws we have is reasonable compromise between both `` pro-choice '' and `` pro-life '' camps . 
  this one will be no different . 
  few days ago , poll results got released and around 14 % of polish women favor more restrictive abortion laws ( including total ban ) , 20 % want more liberal laws ( including abortion on demand ) and rest are that they should stay as it is or undecided . 
  not initially . 
  first baldur 's gate started that trend - they went literally all-in on that one - put their houses on mortgage , hired famous actors to do voices , ran ad campagins in many papers and stuffed game box with interesting goodies ( i recall large world map printed on canvas ) - basically , piracy was huge back then , so most distributors opted to do localizations as cheap as possible , to keep costs low - five digit sales were considered great success . 
  since bg1 was on five cds , one could pay 100 pln ( 20-30 pln was `` going rate '' for single pirated cd back then ) for a set of cd-r discs in plastic bag , with `` label '' written hastily with marker , or one could pay slightly more ( 120 pln was initial retail price , i think ) and get high quality , original stuff - and that 's what they banked on . 
  it really paid off - they sold out all prepared copies within a week , and started the trend of high-effort localizations , with other companies following suit ( hell , we even had some pirates trying to copy it - there 's `` age of empires 2 '' localized to polish by some russian ( ? ), 
  pirate group , with dictionary-translated sentences recorded in thick eastern accent . 
  it got cult status back in the days , due to how hilariously bad it was ), 
   paradox seems to be doing well , and their games are - really - niche . 
  https://eacea.ec.europa.eu/sites/eacea-site/files/publication-of-results-dev-vg-2015.pdf  7 565184 se paradox development studio ab project dallas 150.000,00 13 % they got 150k eur from the same program cdpr got theirs . 
  it goes way earlier than that . 
  cd projekt has been distributor of computer games in central-eastern europe for over two decades . 
  seeing , how you have lithuanian flair , if you were to pick up old baldur 's gate or warcraft 2 retail box , chances are high , it 'd have cdp logo on it . 
   would not like to see one of those burst .

  old pipes , laid 50 years ago , burst from time to time . 
  you do n't get geyser-like fountain shooting boiling water up - they are monitoring pressures constantly and in event of failure , shut it down immediately . 
  you end up with [ medium size crater ] ( http://i.imgur.com/yufcepn.jpg ) and nearby streets looking like hot springs . 
   central heating ? 
  what is that ? 
  oh , sweet summer child ...  do you get hot water/water vapor like you get regular water to heat your houses ? 
  yes . 
  that 's how it works . 
  `` muncipal departament of heat energy '' is what handles it in my town . 
  rather than each block having it 's own system , it 's cheaper/more efficent to have city or district-wide central location with highly efficent water heating furnaces , which distribute warm water across the city in huge , insulated pipes ( main ones they use in my city have over 1m in diameter ) . 
  it also allows to `` piggyback '' on local buisnesses that generate excess heating in their process , which they can re-sell to city , instead of dumping it - power plants , steel mills . 
  my hometown has contract with local tire factory . 
  even some datacentres do it . 
  but usa is n't `` tax heaven '' by any stretch of definition . 
  if that were the case , they would n't need to create facta bill in first place ... 
  there 's big difference between state-run companies , like kghm , pzu , orlen , which , while partially privatized , are mostly directly managed by state itself ( with director seats going to sympathizers of new ruling party after elections , as a kind of `` spoils of war '' ) , and companies where state is only a major shareholder , no different than any big pension or investment fund ( for comparison , norway owns like 1 % of world 's entire equity thanks to it 's oil fund , but does n't use those assets to realize current ruling party political goals - pzu is in similar situation , as a largest ( and former monopolist ) insurer of largest economy in central-eastern europe , they picked up shares of many companies , both domestic and in neighboring countries , over the years . 
  list of stocks on warsaw stock exchange alone that they own is few pages long - that does n't make any of those companies `` state-run '' . 
  current alior 's board of directors has no connections to any political party and been working in various financial institutions since mid-90s , long before pis ( current ruling party ) was even created . 
  if there will be ocassion to buy out some shares in banks ( like few months ago , when italian unicredit sold off 10 % of pekao for bargain , since they needed liquid cash to deal with their domestic crisis ) , they might do it , but it will be based on economic , not political goals . 
   state-run alior bank alrr.wa stopped reading here . 
  if rest of article has similar level of fact-checking , i have nothing to worry about . 
  alior is our `` youngest '' bank - created in 2008 by italian ( carlo tassara ) private fund , they enjoyed great growth thanks to good branding and marketing and no-bullshit offers , which allowed them to make ipo on warsaw stock exchange in 2012 , netting to the tune of 2bln pln . 
  two years later , they got introduced into wig20 index - largest , most prestigious index on warsaw stock exchange . 
  while on the roll , they started buying out smaller banks , do some banking under large telecom private label ( `` t-mobile bank services '' ) and recently started expanding to , i think , germany and romania . 
  while pzu owns around 29 % of their stock , pzu itself is a privatized company as well - state owns 34 % of pzu stock . 
  effectively , state has less than 10 % of stake in alior - hardly `` state-run '' , is n't it ? ... 
   and they do have full nation-state infrastructure . 
  four out of five `` countries '' you listed have surface area of large city . 
  somehow i ca n't imagine uk paying for highway upkeep as much as luxembourg . 
  just browse booking.com , trivago , agoda or similar sites - plenty of budget rooms under 20eur/night . 
  there are actually two embargoes - one put up by eu , regarding natural resources extracting and processing equipment , military technologies etc - enacted in response to annexation of crimea - pretty much inconsequential to poland , as we were n't exporting such technologies to begin with . 
  the other one is put up by russia regarding import of eu-produced food products - enacted in response to first one - this one actually hurt our farmers and food producents pretty heavily - in some branches up to 20 % of our produce was exported to russia . 
  i remember you could buy discounted diary products in some places , with cyrillic letters on labels , which were made for export , for really silly prices ( like 0,1 eur for a package of cottage cheese ) in some supermarkets in first few weeks following embargo . 
  luckily , our producents found new markets ( anyone remember `` freedom apples '' campaign ? 
  ) , and we recovered quickly - which this article is all about . 
  long live free market and competition  http://www.polskibus.com/en/index.htm for example has varying prices ( kinda like airlines do ) - depends on when you 're booking ( the more in advance , the cheaper - you can snag tickets for literally 1 pln ) , how many tickets for that particular course have been sold , time of ride ( weekend rides tend to be more expensive ) and so on ... standard ticket ( students etc have lower prices ) for tomorrow costs 39 pln , next week one is 29 pln and so on ... their main competitor is https://luxexpress.eu/en/ - they are from estonia originally , i think , but they entered heavily on our market . 
  never rode with them , but tickets for tomorrow are listed at 31 pln . 
  after those , there are medium companies , often offering like 5 different courses only . 
  they tend to be slightly more expensive , since they are unable to leverage economy of scale - expect to pay around 40-50 pln for ride . 
  then you have smaller private companies - sometimes literally two guys with a van , taking shifts driving passengers . 
  they have less overhead , but i 'm not a big fan of using those - cars are old , lack wi-fi ... on top of bus options , there are also railoads - slightly faster , but way more expensive , unless you qualify for one of numerous discounts ( students , disabled , blood donors , retirees , employee discount ... ) , expect to pay around 50 eur - not really worth it , as it brings us in price range of last option - 245 pln ( 56 eur ) gives you direct flight on one of numerous cheap airlines - being in middle of europe has this advantages that we have connections with pretty much every carrier - western ( ryanair , easyjet ) , central ( airberlin , germanwings ) and eastern ( wizzair , airukraine ) ... 
   global scale : no . 
  look at us fleets ' area of responsibility for now . 
  us is cutting on their military budget , while china is expanding their fleet like crazy . 
  they built their first carrier recently and are constructing two more right now , which puts them on second spot , after usa , which has 10 . 
   technological : big no . 
  mostly crappy products copied by other countries . 
  i even did better soldering on my pc than their manufacturers . 
  i previously had zero experience on soldering . 
  you get what you pay for - if you 're buying $ 0.99 crap off aliexpress , then do n't wonder about shitty quality . 
  many top electronic brands have their plants located in china . 
  think apple , with their sub-contractor foxconn , in one of those examples . 
  then you have acer , asus , xiaomi , huawei , lenovo ... 
  they definitely have capabilities for high quality engineering , as evidenced by their space program , it 's simply more due to fact that exporters care about price only , which leads to cutting corners and results in crappy products that get shipped . 
   soft power : absolutely no . 
  let 's forget about catching us , europe . 
  china ca n't even catch south korea for soft power . 
  it 's a shitty country why would anyone watch a tv series about life of chinese ? 
  what about other areas ? 
  china has huge presence in africa and asia - they 're buying up everything not nailed to ground , oversee big infrastructural projects , overtake local companies . 
  usa and europe are comparatively neglecting those countries , and as the demographics change and countries get out of poverty , one might wake up in completely different global landscape . 
  i 'd like to have it on record that this guy is a religious nutjob that has been fighting sex , pornography and abortion since 1991 , with no results - his previous `` anti-abortion law proposal '' in 2011 got 450.000 signatures , and as required by law - got put under parliament discussion , where it got axed , just like this one will be . 
  he is n't an ellected official or mp , and in poland everyone can put up law proposal under vote , as long as one gathers enough signatures - that does n't make the law automatically pass . 
  abortion has been `` hot issue '' in poland pretty much since we ( re ) gained independence , and every party puts it for vote , but nothing ever changes , as current laws are reasonable compromise between `` pro-life '' and `` pro-choice '' sides - both are unhappy with current state of affairs and want to pull the line to their side , but opposite side keeps them in check . 
  overnight bus ticket to neighboring country costs literally as much as two packs of cigaretes ( depending on where you live - warsaw ( central poland ) - berlin = 34 pln , cracow ( southern poland ) - prague = 21 pln , gda\u0144sk ( northern poland ) - kaliningrad = 45 pln ) , not to mention gynecologist practices offering `` period restoration '' services locally ( every newspaper in  50k pop town has like two dozens of such adverts in classfield section ) - we already have quite restrictive laws regarding abortion , but it 's not preventing anyone who wants one to get it . 
  there are tescos in thailand . 
  this is a global brand . 
   3kg container of nutella everything is bigger in usa , is n't it ? 
  nutella jars have 400-600g here . 
  only product from morocco i 've seen in shops here were oranges , but they are very seasonal , with prices ranging from 2 pln/kg ( 0,5 eur ) during supermarket promos ( especially around christmas - few decades ago , under communism , it was pretty much only period when they were available , as party went out of their way to make sure masses have something to celebrate with , importing them from cuba , so it kinda became `` traditional '' christmas fruit - every market stocks them at low prices as a loss leader to lure people in for their holiday shopping ) . 
  around 4pln/kg ( 1 eur ) is the `` standard '' price , you 'd be paying most of the time , up to 6-7 pln/kg ( 1.8 eur ) when they are n't available in larger shops and you have to look around small , specialty ones . 
  he was probably referring to those that aligned themselves immediately with west , after gaining independence ( poland , baltics , czech republic , hungary , romania etc. ), 
  - those that were/are still aligned to russia ( belarus , ukraine ) are all doing quite poorly . 
  ukraine 's economy has been in recession for first two decades they were independent - only in 2004 gdp per capita reached back to 1991 levels . 
  then after four years of reasonably fast growth , 2008 global crisis hit , effectively erasing all gains they made - five more years of slow climb later and they are back to 2008 levels in 2013 . 
  then whole mess with russia started . 
  as it stands now , ukraine , which was slightly richer than poland when we both gained independence , has wages roughly five times lower than us .

those are also the best fri\u0435nds of the r\u0430dical \u041cuslim , along with l\u0430ck of contr\u0430ception . 
  any of these `` p\u0430inless '' methods are actually very distressing , since you will have to wait until the effects set in , and that 's worse than pain i think .

  it 's your choice to connect low crime rates in norway to their prison system , my sheltered island libertine . 
  it 's not immediately apparent to me that these things are in any way connected . 
  rather it 's likely that the crime is low simply because the quality of life is high . 
  if norway had the us justice system while retaining it 's prosperity and lack of poverty , i 'm pretty sure its picture of crime would remain the same . 
  us has plenty of states where the quality of life is easily comparable to norway . 
  new england , vermont , new hampshire , northwestern states ... and guess what ? 
  the crime rate there is very low while the justice system remains the same . 
  what 's the difference between prisons of maryland and maine ? 
  probably not much . 
  yet maine is a pastoral paradise all around , while maryland has crim\u0435 ridd\u0435n hot zones like b\u0430ltimore on its body . 
  why 's that ? 
  because of economic and cultural troubles - not the justice system , which is similar all across the us . 
  remember that the awful picture of crime and police brutality that you see coming from america is true only for select states which are located mostly in the south . 
  other states are just as peaceful as scandinavian countries , while retaining the same gun rights and righteous justice system . 
  general quality of life is much more important in regards to crime rate than making your justice system into a `` pr\u043egressive '' festival of crim\u0435 ap\u043elogism . 
  also , lol @ you for comparing right\u0435ous punishm\u0435nt of r\u0430pists to saudi ar\u0430bia 's mosl\u0435m f\u0430natical bullshit unleashed upon innocent people .

   you 're dutch ; you 've never known want , you 've never feared poverty , you 've never faced war . 
  i 'm not dutch , i have experienced most of these things , and i say ki\u0441k the b\u0430stards out .

  also , it 's fairly easy to evade what you 're talking about without making r\u0430pe de-facto legal . 
  just make the punishm\u0435nt for murder much h\u0430rsher than for r\u0430pe , while still \u0440unishing r\u0430pists with an iron fist .

  do we want to live in a society where horrific violent crimes go unpunished ?

  other than the weed stuff ... 
  what do you mean about america ? 
  police brutality is a cultural problem , it does n't have anything to do with being `` tough on crime '' . 
  laws and regulations should be tough , not actions of police . 
  it 's not a black-white tone , it 's an us vs them tone . 
  leave playing both sides to the international globalist elite . 
  ordinary people ca n't afford to be so cosmopolitan . 
  when some cultures are so demonstrably backwards , the question stands - is it worth it at all to import the sworn adherents of such a culture into your country , just to fulfill some kind of nebulous humanitarian mission ? 
  is it worth it to risk the damage that this group of potential insurgents and interlopers can do to your country and its people ? 
  and should the manipulative billionaire eu and ngo elites really have their claws stuck within every country 's business ? 
  if punishing rapists will somehow lead to a culture war , that culture needs to be completely excised from society . 
  it is nothing but a tumor . 
  i do n't need to see the big picture when i 've already picked a side . 
  also lol @ you comparing poland to the arab world . 
  you either have n't been to poland or you 're some kind of turbo liberal for whom all conservative viewpoints are the same .

  driving after drinking in poland is a big no and will get you in trouble . 
  interesting - i was in croatia and the waiter offered me a beer . 
  he said it 's ok to drink a small beer and drive , but i am polish and would not dare ( unless you show me the exact law in writing which allows that in your country and i 'm 100 % sure i wo n't go to jail ) . 
  i did not trust him , thinking he was just trying to sell me the beer . 
  from what you 're saying he was just being croat . 
  i experienced it first hand in the us . 
  we went to a pub , everybody ordered beer . 
  except they came by car and then went home by car . 
  i , coming from europe , was like - wtf ? 
  they told me it 's normal to have a small beer ( or two ) and drive . 
  i also read in a book ( might not be true ) that as long as you drive straight , do n't break any rules and your car is ok - then the police have no right to pull you over and check your alcohol level . 
  it 's just not allowed in usa , they have no reason to stop you . 
  afaik - it works the same way in poland * on paper * , but most people are not aware , police has always pulled people over for routine checks and i guess you do n't want to argue with them , anyway . 
  also , in the us , they wo n't sell you alcohol if you do n't have an id on you . 
  you are a 78 year old , white hair , wrinkled guy with a cane , but you do n't have an id stating you 're 21 ? 
  no beer for you !, 
  but you can drive drunk if you have an id . 
   american logic . 
  technically , russia is the largest country on earth . 
  ^ im ^ fun ^ at ^ parties , ^ i ^ promise . 
  ^ ^ i ^ ^ mean , ^ ^ i ^ ^ would ^ ^ be , ^ ^ if ^ ^ i ^ ^ was ^ ^ ever ^ ^ invited . 
   i fail to see the humor in the picture . 
  but then , i am german . 
  i think it 's the choice of language and style in which things are said . 
  i have the same impression , i.e. , / r/polska shits on polska , basically . 
  much hatred , it goes further than critique . 
  not everyone and it 's sad . 
  nice to see somebody else noticed the trend . 
  i briefly remember reading about it some day - * philosophy * ( as in phd ) has a different meaning in the us than in europe . 
  when we say * philosophy * we mean a person who is an unemployable ( in his area of expertise ) thinker with a major in philosophy from a polish university doing dishes in the uk . 
   the kind who ponders why the world is the way it is and and it lowers our gdp . 
  in the us , the `` doctor of philosophy '' could be a neurobiology researcher or something like that . 
  i am sure this is not accurate , just something i read . 
  i used to put a lot of sugar ( like three teaspoons ) in my tea , but stopped doing that eventually . 
  now i do n't like sweetened tea . 
  part of that may be because when i used to sweeten my tea i was drinking cheap teabag stuff and then i moved to leaf tea . 
  the former was very strong and dark and was barely drinkable without sugar . 
  leaf tea is not as strong and actually has distinctive taste ( i can tell different tea varieties by taste , like ceylon , darjeeling and dianhong ( yunnan ) taste differently ) . 
  that is why americans did n't want british tea and dumped it in the sea . 
  only in winter . 
  it helps with cold ( except it really does n't , because lemon magic does n't work after it 's poured over with hot water/tea ) . 
  it sounds like they target the german tourists , [ who love apfelstrudel tea ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/tea/comments/6i727g/remember_the_apfelstrudel_tea/ ) . 
  yes , sounds like inka . 
  i would n't market divka in poland , though because it almost sounds like an invective in polish . 
   i 'd drink absolutely anything one serves me as coffee have you tried our [ inka ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/inka_\\ ( beverage \\ ) ) ? 
  it was very popular in communist poland when it was very difficult to get your hands on real coffee . 
  http://www.grana.pl/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/inka.jpg i remember the smell and taste from my childhood and was pleasantly surprised they restarted the brand a few years ago .

  but the key element of my post was his archaic approach , with zones of influence , being paranoid of non-client states , border shenanigans and outsized emphasis on brute force . 
  well , his subjects love it . 
  oh sure , but the amount of ignorance about turkey is staggering . 
  he might be wrong , but at least on the same planet wrong . 
  you think letting in thousands opens the gates forever ? 
  elaborate ? 
  sure , i was not trying to . 
  i just do n't think fleet power projection is as important nowadays . 
  and in many ways it can become a trap - it will suck a lot of money from russia and will make them more prone to engage in more costly and unpopular meddling . 
  the visibility of russian fleet would also bolster nato participation , so it is a bit self-regulating . 
  yeah , a few thousand immigrants will destroy your society . 
  how so ? 
  i would say it sure stuck to its values a bit more than was sensible . 
  and after that they will take crete ? 
  pillage venice ? 
  i mean , i am certain it is good for them to supply assad or swing their dicks from big ships at med countries but i just do n't see what actual benefit it brings them , except for feeling like an empire . 
  sweeet !, 
  it just saddens me some leaders truly see it this way . 
  they are still refugees , though , just high risk variety, 
  you have no idea how transparently you are being played . 
  it 's like seeing a basic case from intro politics textbook . 
  sultan stronk , sultan rule world, 
  yup , it goes both ways . 
  at some point , they need to decide and then we will adjust . 
   pilots who shot down that jet are in jail . 
  now that 's just fucked up . 
   the only thing he needs to do is ending the support to rebels and voil\u00e0 . 
  it is far from `` voila '' . 
  i read somewhere that if assad pushes the rebels too hard they will move into turkey . 
  that would be probably not the best for you . 
  next month , erdogan best friend of rojava . 
  putin does n't care for his loyalty . 
  he is doing a 19th century global chessboard thing , he will just use whatever he can to get his imaginary victory points in his game against the west . 
  no , it really is n't . 
  every country is first and foremost self-interested , but there can be more coherence and loyalty than this , as shown by countless other leaders and nations . 
  yah , you must be having real fun this month , reading all those experts !, 
  i assume most of nato activities are done in a non-secret fashion , with the clandestine left to the member states . 
  it would be horribly hard to maintain secrecy across so many nations , even in the best of times . 
  you got me for half a second !, 
  my eyebrow actually twitched , well played !, 
  eh , i consider myself leftist and i keep reading on reddit how `` regressive left '' has hijacked europe or is even ruling it . 
  but then i see merkel , hollande , renzi , may - sometimes more to the right , sometimes to the left but generally careful boring politicians trying to more or less ineptly manage the arising crises and steer those huge organisms somewhere they subjectively think is safe . 
  i just do n't see non-marginal leftist political equivalents of ukip , fn , afd , pis etc. 
  that is why i asked for examples . 
  and you say such people hijacked `` the left '' somehow ? 
  sounds to me like you are talking about a sub , a forum or a blog but i do n't understand what does it have to do with wider european politics . 
  are hollande or merkel part of the group you outlined ? 
   blame those who currently hijack the left to spread their multicultural idealisms at any cost . 
  like whom ? 
  serious question . 
  yes , enough to even use actual words !, 
  it is a bit silly , yes . 
  still pretty cool , in a way . 
  even in france it is . 
  terrorism is 95 % flash and , well , terror . 
  what if there is an alternative for germany ? 
  what then ?!, 
  i bet those guys are quite a boost for her , heh heh, 
  germany going wild and spontaneous !, 
  it just needs to warm up a bit . 
  bow before gott-kanzlerin mutti, 
  western style democracy is far more than just voting , it is also checks and balances . 
  racism - the wolf - is definitely within europe already , so no worries about false alarms . 
   it will become necessary at some point for europeans to reassert our own racial identity or our people will eventually experience victimization ( the aggressors would regard it as retribution ) . 
  wake me up when white americans start getting oppressed by the black . 
  oh , wait , you got the tyranny of obama , right . 
  and now the wimmin are getting uppity too . 
  your post coupled with your nickname reminds me why i stay the fuuuuck away from internet w40k fandom . 
  nothing truly personal either way , cheers . 
  are n't you going to the other extreme and presenting a false dichotomy , though ? 
  humans in general have flawed brains , and can be criminal temporarily or just in parts of their lives due to bad environment . 
  these brains are also malleable and , using what we call rehabilitation , can be prodded to become more managable within the society . 
  no one is `` pure '' or `` impure '' for all their lives , even in normal circumstances . 
   but intuitively as person , i want to punish those who wronged me or my loved ones . 
  that is exactly why no one ( almost ) nowhere is a judge in their own case . 
  without a disinterested outside arbiter , `` justice '' quickly becomes a blood feud . 
  it is a feature of civilization to reduce the impact of instinct and intuition in favor of more reliable decision-making processes . 
  eh , it is a strawman , though . 
  i agree with your sentiment and there are certainly people who think `` their '' criminals are worthless and should be punished as hard as possible , but presenting a caricature of an extremist stance has no purpose other than making ourselves feel better . 
  hah , which makes me think that condemning a part of populace to recidivism due to lack of rehabilitation is essentially scapegoating . 
  designating some people to be the `` bad guys '' forever so that the rest of the society feels better in their `` goodness '' . 
  their capital ca n't even vote , lol i know , of course . 
  why and what for , but it is funny in the context . 
  can you explain the specific elements , if it is not a problem ? 
  this is beautiful and i do n't even know anything about portugal . 
  well , now i do !, 
  beauty , eye of the beholder , all that, 
  drum and bass , but [ you might find it interesting if you have n't seen it . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c-hgbrvlv5i ), 
  but is it hate if they correctly say how it looks ? 
  that polish catholics are more conservative than the vatican 's current leadership ? 
  and is it really hate if you like it this way ? 
  then i do n't know what you were complaining about . 
  the article was simply saying polish catholics are more conservative than the catholic church led by pope francis . 
  seems like you should be actually happy about that . 
  do you disagree with the idea that the polish church is more conservative than pope francis ? 
  can you specify what features make them `` non-white '' or `` non-european '' ? 
  are you certain you would recognize them as such if you did n't know anything about them ? 
  we get mostly western ukrainians who are much more nationalistic and have built a lot of their identity on specifically not being polish . 
  and besides , would n't an assumption that they will happily relinquish their heritage be a tad paternalistic and part of the problem ?

  how strong is the butthurt between those countries ? 
  i always smile at articles like this . 
  pis is a shitty goverment but mostly western perception that their standpoint is always the proper one is just silly . 
  especially now when refugee crisis we warned about kills people in western europe . 
  polish democracy is unharmed and working properly . 
  rule of law on the other hand is faulty due to constitutional tribunal shitstorm . 
  pis had a majority votes and if you dont accept it , it means your view on democracy lacks something . 
  accept a democratic choice . 
  i feel that slow growth of other economies like chineese one along with growing amount of muslims in the west might be very tough for some europeans who are so full of themselves, 
  i am always happy to see those articles , they prove there is a bigger butthurt than our for russia . 
  did you really ? 
  you are reddit user after all . 
  it was very unfortunate what she said about crimea . 
  france , after brexit was supposed to be the biggest eu army , we really hoped for more stability from them . 
  europe has already too many problems . 
  what year is it , again ? 
   the european republic is a eutopia they got utopia right, 
  some could say germans were really jewed on hitler 's work . 
  i am sorry i know it was inappropriate , i will delete this comment when the shame hits me, 
  it is about time to leave the ship, 
  i am a big atlantis supporter, 
  my money is on the former ( btw anyone from anglo country here , is what i said above grammatically correct ? ), 
  do we know each other ? 
  but is this the one they deserve ? 
  how come ? 
  stupidity is strong in this one . 
  this is a common feel about hungary in western slavic countries . 
  and after seeing lithuania i am not even upset about opinion regarding us . 
  according to the internet it is , do you really think someone would lie on the internet ? 
  depends , what they were fighting for ? 
  if plunger for example , poles could have gone rough on them . 
  brits have chavs , we have them . 
  as far as i know . 
  tl ; dr some polish guy threw a firework into this kebab place at new year 's eve . 
  4 guys ( some of them of middle eastern origins ) went out and a fight begun , resulting in thrower 's death ( he was stabbed ) . 
  stabbers were arrested . 
  in here our tracksuit community likes to defend their own no matter what so they started to demolish the place , which resulted in police intevenence . 
  i saw somewhere headline saying they clashed with the police , dont know if this is the truth yet . 
  i recommed you to check out the name of this ... restaurant , this is the only funny thing about this story . 
  ** edit : ** few most aggresive protesters were also detained by the police . 
  add some translation otherwise it will get deleted . 
  respect . 
   national unity +5 % -1 / year, 
   that 's only murders , and anyhow the majority of crimes committed by those people go unreported so official statistics are underestimated . 
  they were before 2007 , too . 
  you dont share any sources on this . 
   i still remember the childish understanding of it all that i had , we were rich , they were poor i am like in my 20s and this basically sums the situation up . 
  plus more redistribution, 
  razem is irrelevant ( 2-3 % support ) party which supports the closest to commie redistribution of wealth taking every party we have , no wonder paying for private property of once aristocratic family makes them upset , even tho our gov paid 0,12 % of what the collection was really worth . 
  politician 's immunity, 
  people who are responsible should be put in jail , what is other to think ? 
   slavs  white, 
  why is that ? 
  ( i am not sure if it was an irony ), 
  if this information is true i am shocked that after all this time countries with this mindset exist in europe . 
  such is life in polan, 
  muh nazi argument , so if someone asks if i am a slav ( which is inferior race to nazis ) can i claim for damages ? 
  lovely christmas gesture . 
   hopefully pis will implode earlier [ well ] ( http://combiboilersleeds.com/image.php?pic=/images/doubt/doubt-6.jpg ), 
  [ this meme ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_next_100_years ), 
  every time you invest in eastern poland your toilet unclogs itself, 
  when will this meme die, 
   proto-fascist xd like evertime somone left wing lacks arguments she/he tries to cover it up with buzzwords . 
  one could only wish : ' (, 
  arent we all a bit ? 
   he doesnt believe in real life memes what year is this again ? 
  but i am all for maitaining current state of laws , it is their job to talk with press as said above , i am just presenting other side of the dicussion, 
  noone is saying otherwise , remeber he just lost truck and a driver , i only translated what he said, 
  you really ca n't stand objectivism , do n't you ? 
  i presented both sides of the conflict and stated my personal beliefs . 
  you do really buy opposition stuff that much that you are afraid to check out what other side of a conflict has to say ? 
  they have it regulated , afaik we do n't . 
  like there are recticed places from where press can film, 
  it already came , 
  owner of the company is upset , seems to be blaming german controllers for not unloading the truck before . 
  i 'll translate it , but it isnt anything new people here wouldnt know about . 
  just a guy shifting the blame for his truck . 
  https://twitter.com/sycylia6_/status/810988801946451969 company owner said : `` i talked with him aroud afternoon . 
  he said germans wo n't allow him to unload the truck . 
  this is a thing about shipment to germany , bit of good will was enough and nothing bad - i presume - wouldnt happen to my car , my driver and those all people , poor people who died there . 
  but germans with their attitude to poles did n't want to unload it and made him wait untill 8 o'clock , then those people came hijacked the car , did what they did with my driver and went to market do their thing there . 
  this is the only comment i can make right now . '', 
   terrorism is , in its broadest sense , the use of intentionally indiscriminate violence ( terror or fear ) in order to achieve a political , religious , or ideological aim . 
  what was his ideological aim ? 
  what a shitty thing to say, 
  we did not have terrorist attacks after 1939 here . 
  murders even nasty ones arent terrorism by definition . 
  inb4 hurr durr right wingers it has nothing to do with being right or left wing . 
  pis proposed legislation which is similar to french , american and german . 
  right now any reporter can enter polish parliment and harass politicans before bathroom door by questioning them about anyting ( including those gossip newspaper ones ) . 
  reporters have huge access to sejm here . 
  i personally supported protesters , limitation of press in public institutions should be minimal , but acting like it was a rebelion somehow is just silly . 
  we like to protest about things ( we protested last month about abortion law and the same day others counterprotested against those protests ) , this is what we do - especially when it comes to freedom of speech and public institutions . 
  anyway , i am happy our gov dropped this idea . 
  dont say anything , just [ invest ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/8/81/why_didn't_you_invest_in_eastern_poland_advertisement.jpg/280px-why_didn't_you_invest_in_eastern_poland_advertisement.jpg ), 
  i just opened r/europe , looked at the title and * sigh * we need to end this meme some day, 
  for this your shitter will be cloggerd for eternity , dont bother calling polish plumber, 
  let 's not jump into conclusions here . 
   they 'd care to keep him alive after capturing the truck we dont even know if it was captured edit  correction : truck ( not dead passenger ) in berlin market incident was polish , nationality of suspected driver is unclear http://live.reuters.com/event/truck_plows_into_berlin_christmas_market_2, 
  not cool , this way you can start infitite chain of screaming in certain area .

  if i call one person unpleasant and one person a giant asshole , i still would n't want to associate with either of them . 
  the `` but the others are so much worse '' `` defense '' always comes up when someone mentions left-wing violence but it really has zero bearing on my opinion that neither side should be associated with anyone who considers themselves a democrat . 
  as soon as you abandon that principled view , you have to ask `` and how much violence should we invite into our middle ? 
  '' , and that 's out of the question . 
  ah , that explains it . 
  thanks !, 
  no , but at least the teary-eyed hand wringing does n't come from an authoritative position . 
  if nobody has the means to solve it , there are few meaningful arguments about party politics to be made so i 'll just focus on the meaningless until someone has an actual concept . 
  we wo n't vote for two years anyway , until then the situation will become clearer . 
  it 's not just about this one incident , more about the general tendency - it 's undeniable that while it sometimes is in the spotlight , leftist violence has _ way _ less of a `` guilt by association '' effect than right-wing one in the media and on the political stage . 
  greens and left pretty openly ally with them through their youth organizations . 
  and while the latter are scorned by many , they are still seen as democratic parties while only the npd would ever go near anything right-wing and violent , and if they get 5 % somewhere the media predicts the apocalypse . 
  depends on what wing is in control at the moment , but yeah , same can probably be said about the union . 
  it 's true that there are very few differences outside the extremes any more , and that 's depressing . 
  oh well , let 's at least say that merkel has pragmatic _ rhetoric _ , that 's something that ca n't be said about the greens and also a pleasant aspect . 
  compassion is a horrible metric to base international policies on . 
  we need ice cold technocrats with an ethics degree , but those are hard to come by . 
  still , it 's ridiculous to accept such people into the debate with open arms . 
  they should be shunned just like their counterparts as the anti-democrats they both are . 
  instead , they 're commonly given a platform from which to sort people into `` racist '' and `` one of us '' . 
  at least merkel is pragmatic . 
  god forbid the greens were at the rudder right now . 
  vietnamese refugees ? 
  dissidents ? 
  as if that were the only relevant point for running a country ... 
  also note that it 's the number of _ applications _ , not the number of _ refugees _ . 
  just before anyone starts to rant about the `` 800k propaganda '' again - it refers to the latter , does appear very realistic in that context and there is significant delay until a refugee can ask for asylum . 
  the foreigners living in munich are n't exactly the kind that would rob you , more the kind that would be robbed if they did n't have bodyguards . 
  ( well , and students of course . ), 
  though i agree that refugees are n't posing or facing any apparent problem in the centers outside munich , probably due to the `` rich small town '' atmosphere where everything is much more peaceful than in , say , frankfurt to begin with . 
  jobbik is just a little more crazy than sd , and orban is n't exactly a shining beacon of democracy , either . 
  apart from sd , swenden went off the shallow end and still managed to drown , though , so to speak . 
  exactly the same thing as the folks ' in the other trench : jack shit ... 
  holy mother of hdr . 
  see the article , though :  but mr rutte responded on friday that it would be `` crazy '' to offer permanent shelter to people who refused to leave . 
   `` we are talking about the group that can go back , whose governments would take them back , but they do n't want to go back , '' he said . 
  he excludes those cases , so there must be some other explanation for how they can just say `` no '' , but i ca n't figure it out . 
  i 'm not taking any stances , i was just trying to provide the example you asked for . 
  their politics may be a bit screwy , but hungary is definitely reaching for the retard cake atm . 
   bouttobeadick take a guess . 
  illegally . 
  how would they hold a job when they 've officially been rejected ? 
  and illegal labor at most contributes to society indirectly through companies ' budget . 
  your pm excluded such situations . 
   but mr rutte responded on friday that it would be `` crazy '' to offer permanent shelter to people who refused to leave . 
   `` we are talking about the group ** that can go back , whose governments would take them back ** , but they do n't want to go back , '' he said . 
  i. e. their government must be known . 
  you mean in the union between ethiopia and eritrea after ww2 ? 
  i 'm not that well versed in history , so i can only rely on wikipedia ( i only knew they were an italian colony later united with ethiopia ) and do n't really have leg to stand on . 
  but when they were annexed and subsequently became independent , the italians were _ long _ gone . 
  country of origin is different from citizenship , though . 
  i assume the latter is what matters in a legal context . 
  german jokes , of course . 
  what 's a sentence with ten words and four lies ? 
  an honest pole only drives his car to work sober . 
  yeah , of course that place sucks . 
  that was independence from ethiopia , though . 
  roughly : selassie systematically undermined the eritrans ' rights , the parliament dissolved and they were annexed , provoking them to take up weapons and start an independence movement - and such movements rarely end in peaceful democracies , as you said . 
   oops , forgot where i was and what opinions are accepted . 
  sorry for not blaming everything on the jew ... muslims . 
  truly sorry for not sharing your xenophobic paranoid delusions , nazi-troll nationalists of r/europe . 
  and you wonder why you do n't have more support ? 
  that kind of behavior usually comes with certain stances regardless of direction , and over time people begin to associate the opinion with the bullshit . 
  but keep on truckin ' if you 're fine with doing a great disservice to your cause . 
  eritrea ? 
  it was a colony , but i 'm not aware of any abuses . 
  there 's obviously no country completely left untouched by western influence , but i would n't say that necessarily means we 're to blame for any and all problems . 
  that seems like a bit of a useless policy . 
  if they 're rejected , deport them - if the system is n't broken , there were good reasons for it and they would be safe . 
  if the regulations are broken , then change them , and if you ca n't manage to deport people efficiently that 's a flaw that the government should take responsibility for instead of offloading it on the migrants . 
  so where does `` sending people off to fend for themselves '' come into play ? 
  is this just a cheap move to appear `` tough on illegals '' to draw votes away from wilders ? 
  not to mention that the concept of `` fending for themselves '' would obviously mean a life of crime so you 're only shooting yourself in the foot with increased security expenses . 
  you did n't take that cheap shot at those people , though , but at a random stranger because you saw an opportunity to posture , never mind that their conclusion was logical . 
  i _ hate _ how people think they 're allowed to do that to `` help '' the greater good , all you 're doing is damaging it . 
  you 're doing just the same right now with the false dichotomy in your second paragraph and your misrepresentation of their conclusion in the third . 
  i obviously have no idea about the merit of that judgment , i 'm just saying it 's wrong to take a cheap shot at a logical conclusion of an argument instead of challenging the argument itself . 
  [ just look at that disgusting fascist and the braindead crowd hailing him !, 
  ] ( http://www.traditionalcatholicpriest.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/lech_walesa.jpg ) ( no contest to the second half , though . ), 
  that depends purely on intent , which is what this entire subthread is about . 
  you should acknowledge that if their assessment is correct , it not being an act of extremism is actually likely . 
  you 're talking to like five different people here . 
  it 's ridiculous to jump straight from `` my knowledge leads me to believe this is atypical behavior for neonazis '' to `` you must be hell-bent on denying racist people exist '' ( i. e. a thinly veiled `` you racist '' ) . 
  people like you are the bane of this entire discussion , could you please keep shaming and yelling at people on your own continent ? 
  we have enough problems with your type from both sides as it is . 
  censoring a curseword , appending a `` sarcasm '' tag , _ and _ a serious note advising caution that is longer than the first line ? 
  yeah , i do n't think somebody will yell at you , you might break in half . 
  that 400l of air only last 90 minutes surprised me myself , though . 
  i 'm guessing they made the same wrong assumption . 
  it 's the _ legal _ answer , but the wrong approach to actually do anything about the problem itself . 
  it appears people are talking about different numbers , as i just noticed . 
  http://www.zeit.de/politik/deutschland/2015-08/fluechtlinge-zahl-de-maiziere-asyl the number of asylum requests was 220k until the end of july , when 37.5 k requested it . 
  but in the zeit article , de maiziere bases his estimate on the total number of refugees , saying that 83k people crossed the border in july , not all of which have likely asked for asylum yet , and the numbers are only expected to increase . 
  that makes the 800k total far more likely - at one point , they 'll _ have _ to ask for asylum , so it 's better to include them in the statistic right now . 
  pick your battles . 
  some people on both sides are obvious trolls or have such a simplistic view that it 's impossible to debate with facts . 
  others obviously do care about proper arguments and logic - those are the ones you can debate , just disregard the rest . 
  then challenge people 's points instead of deriding them . 
  them being stupid should make that pretty easy . 
  shooting every migrant on sight would technically still be a solution , so there is one or several .

  or am i thinking of the wrong european country ? 
   if the check is under $ 5 or $ 10 yeah , we have a similar thing in poland where if you are buying something like 5 pln worth of goods , you can not pay by card . 
  also , a lot of places will not allow you to pay just for cigarettes by card so you have to get something else if you want a pack of smokes . 
   article by harry cockburn this does n't sound legit ...

  so may i ask for a short summary of the two parties , if that 's at all possible ? 
  i do n't know much about spanish politics and since google translate is horrible i thought i 'd ask a native , 
  alright so what is the spanish version of a socialdemocrat party , then ? 
  i do n't know spanish at all and it would be interesting to see what the common platform ( s ) is ( are ) for the sd parties in spain . 
  why does spain tolerate socialists ?

  not even the super hot stuff , just anything that is spicier than what poland has : /, 
  yeah , just think of it like a soviet russia joke `` in soviet mexico taco turns you ! '', 
   spaguetti taco i am waiting for italians to get triggered by this jajajaja, 
  that kind of defeats the purpose of a cultural exchange , no ? 
  what 's your opinion on sriracha sauce ? 
  ok so eating a taco is slightly different than the ol' kebab  here 's how i eat my tacos ( talking about hard tacos ) : 1 . 
  hold the taco straight up , do not turn the taco . 
  turn your head left or right as if you were trying to read something that is somewhat off center . 
  bite the evil taco with your head turned . 
  if you want to prevent the meat falling from the back of the taco you can kind of nibble on that end and then get back to the end you were going to eat on . 
   poland is still on this corruption list it 's getting better ... slowly ... sort of ... * nervous laughter *, 
  not a mexican but have eaten tacos and met mexicans before . 
  does the meat fall from the side or the end opposite of that which you are eating ? 
  sounds better than our surprise expression `` o kurwa ! '', 
  well , there * was * that one berlin wall  . , 
  sorry about the misspelling there and thanks for the clarification , 
  our national team may have lost a world cup match from the looks of it . 
  what does `` horale '' mean ? 
  ( i know i am missing an accented letter somewhere ... ), 
  sovereignty . 
  350 million british pounds for muh nhs . 
  immigrants . 
  jobs . 
  more immigrants . 
  the issue is far more complex than just some buzzwords but those were some of the key issues mentioned during the whole brexit campaign .

  welcome to the club . 
  do you have the `` they ride polar bears to work ! '',

  that stereotype travelled from germany to the u.s. so it has roots in europe .

  that 's swedes and danes ...

  [ portuguese from portugal tends to sound slavic though ... ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6kdweqjmag ),

  but i am unable to get rid of ` the nationality ' because other people perceive me through it . 
  i ca n't just move to australia like i would to germany -- there are political processes that make that harder for me , and these processes are largely based on tribal politics . 
  the fact that i might refuse nationalism does n't really change my life , as it is largely defined by what other people perceive . 
  we could have lived in a perfectly unified european state by now , if it were n't for these damned nationalists . 
   i do n't want europe to be souless uniform blob of same-thinking europeans . 
  see , that 's exactly what some of us want . 
  to unite . 
  european identity is better , because it 's broader . 
  global identity is even better and no identity is the best . 
  to me , nationalism , patriotism and jingoism are just points on a scale of `` tribal commitment '' . 
   why should it fade ? 
  i find it unpractical , for once . 
  nation states are often too small or too big for effective management . 
  it either inhibits growth or squander resources on corruption . 
  in my opinion it is also unethical and nonsensical -- i 'm expected to care about other people who are randomly born in the same territory and happen to speak the same language as me . 
  i 'm expected to prefer them to people from other parts of the world that i have much more in common ( other people in my trade , for example , or other people who use fork to eat ) . 
  and what 's most disgusting , i 'm expected to ** love ** that idea of a nation , that i did n't choose . 
  i am fucking taught that at school . 
  forcing this kind of collectivity on children makes me want to vomit irl . 
  this is also i hate religious indoctrination of children with passion . 
  i understand that idea . 
  i called that `` cut off '' because that how it will be perceived by the people on the territories that might have been partitioned . 
  because this will be seen as partition , something that has a really bad vibe here in poland . 
  you do n't divide lesser poland , greater poland and mazovia into different political entities . 
  you just do n't , or you 're going to get insurection . 
  i know you think that division and regrouping is something fundamentally different than just slicing the country apart . 
  but it is n't and it wo n't work for at least 30 more years in poland . 
  if we 're lucky . 
  maybe it would work if the nationalism fade out - but it does n't seem to , unfortunately . 
  i think the divides you propose might be artificial and as such , provoke a negative reaction . 
  i , too , think that smaller union members would be better , but the division has to be made on existning borders . 
  you probably could cut off bavaria from germany , or silesia / kashubia form poland , because there are people who might want it , but i do n't think you 're going to get brandenburg or mazovia split off their respective countries . 
  it would just create opposition and backfire . 
  if you want an example of terrible pizza , try `` da grasso '' , it 's spread like a plague . 
  order this , then imagine everything on it done ** differently ** and in the end you might have an idea of an italian pizza  . 
  i. . . what ? 
  i do n't disagree with you , i just wanted to set this one issue straight . 
  i 'm really anal about that stuff , because i come from silesia and have studied its history  . 
  i mostly agree with you , but you 've got history of silesia wrong . 
  it was n't * always * german , it was n't even german for a majority of the time . 
  even the name silesia comes from a lechitic ( for simplicity sake , let 's say proto-polish ) tribe of \u015al\u0119\u017canie . 
  it was part of poland for about 300 years since the beginning of kingdom od poland . 
  then , until the war of austrian sucession in 1742 it belonged to the czechs ( kingdom of bohemia ) . 
  only for the `` brief '' 200 years was the silesia german . 
  i just want you to know , that you made me laugh , 
  i agree that this is a dumb statement and i think directed at poles who harbor some kind of resentment against the germans . 
  i just did n't like the tone of your post . 
  `` better shut up or else '' ? 
  that is not reasonable thing to say . 
  i suppose it does n't . . ? 
  but why it is required for kaczynski to remember a bullshit casus belli from ww2 ? 
  are you suggesting that germany is going to attack , and is awaiting convenient justification ? 
  why is it so important , that mr kaczynski ** should ** remember that ? 
  okaay ... why should he remember that , again ? 
  i think it 's per 10,000 or something about that , 
  i agree that a lot of factors that contribute to lower status of eastern poland are independent of each other . 
  i think there still is a major divide . 
  these statistics you quoted show no such divide . 
  and there might not be a divide in these categories . 
  but there still are in another subjects : percentage of people connected with sewage and canalization , number of people in production age , amount of trash per citizen , crime rate ( this is actually lower in the eastern poland ) . 
  i 'm not claiming that the eastern half is the worst , it 's just that this is a stereotype the op asked about . 
  i 'm just saying there is a division -- maybe not a definitive `` pass this border line and you'e in a different country '' kind of division , but a division of some sort . 
  i mean , look at the election scores on the site you linked . 
  this is so iirp shaped it 's not even funny . 
  here 's my take on it : http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/14llnx/european_countries_and_their_model_regions/c7e81pk, 
  the divide in poland is two-fold : - urban vs rural : as anywhere in the world , people in cities earn more , have better access to jobs and other helpful institutions . 
  polish cities left this post-communist-urban-wasteland-in-transition look behind a few years ago . 
  the big cities are considered motors of polish economy , they are expanding bubbles of civilization and wealth . 
  polish country - not so much , not everywhere . 
  you still get those villages with defunct state run farms that collapsed after 1989 and nobody found any job for the population working there , so these are now dens of alcohol abuse and social degeneration . 
  that 's becoming a rarity , too , forunately , but the more east you move , the more of them you get . 
  which brings me to another divide : - east vs west , aka russian part vs. everyone else . 
  this thing carries from as long before as partitions of poland . 
  if you look at the [ railway connection map ] ( http://kolej.one.pl/mapy/1/1088025256.png ) , [ ngos per capita map ] ( http://www.ngo.pl/files/wiadomosci.ngo.pl/public/wiadomosci_foto_2009/podstawowe_fakty_2008_odc2_mapa3.jpg ) or [ votes for two major political parties map ] ( http://nczas.com/wp-content/gallery/rozklad-glosow-polska-b/rozklad-glosow-polska-b.jpg ) you 'll notice it 's awfully similar to the [ shape ] ( http://www.trystero.pl/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/zabory.jpg ) of partitions of poland over modern boundaries . 
  that might let you understand why poles have that negative attitude towards russians , if you ever wondered :p . this shape reappears in multitude of maps -- personal income maps , infrastructue density maps , emigration rate maps , all sorts of it . 
  there 's even a term coined , although not really politically correct , for this right-hand side part of poland : `` poland b '' , often joked around as the `` worse part '' . 
  of course these are all either generalizations or just my impressions , but it might give you some insight for the polish matters . 
  still , people are so surprised . 
  i 'm willing to bet that another 20 years of economic union and free travel zone , and it will become impossible to dismantle the eu . 
  the people will grow too close to each other . 
  [ everthing going as we expected ] ( http://i1.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/336/249/36f.jpg ) . 
   but we sure do like to make fun of our similar languages haha , yeah !, 
  you 've got some nice ski resorts , too !, 
  also , `` odbyt '' means rectum , `` kupa '' means shit , `` szuka\u0107 '' means `` to seek '' and `` szczotka '' is n't a whore for gods sake , stop being so offensive everywhere !, 
  did you experience a sudden influx of polish tourists this year ? 
  i mean , every other friend of mine was in croatia this year . 
  i seriously wondered if polish is dominant language there for the vacation o_o . 
  on a side note , i really need to go and see these famous waterfalls :d, 
  very informative , thank you !, 
  which is also cool , because `` orszak '' is a polish word , too and with similar meaning -- followers , attendats or even procession . 
  umm ... poles ( or proto-poles ) were known as `` lachy '' long before the legend was made up . 
  it is speculated that this name comes from a name of the tribe `` l\u0119dzianie '' from lesser poland . 
  hence `` lechistan '' , `` lengyel '' and all that . 
  that 's too bad . 
  no positive feeling towards poles in the mass consciousness ? 
  i understand bad feelings from history , but i thought that we get along fine recently . 
  are there any grudges held by the ukrainians or is just the disinterest in a boring neighbour who you think you have little in common ? 
  actually they did , it 's my mistake . 
  the day is 23rd march . 
  both governments declared by acclamation the day of polish-hungarian friendship ( ~ ~ 12th and ~ ~ 23rd march in hungary and poland ~ ~ respectively ~ ~ ) .

  before 1996 it was even higher !, 
   all it would do is escalate the issues except this line of thinking does not work . 
  we did n't get anti-missiles installed here , so russia would n't get angry . 
  what do you get ? 
  georgia and then ukraine . 
   besides that this would be pretty much the end of civilization anyway ... 
  i do n't see how chinese would get drawn into this . 
  we were the second nation in the world to have a constitution after usa , helped them fight for independence and generally hate commies ( they did bad things to us ) .

   i guess it works the way that legislators wants . 
  if you wanted to go for an overhaul of the whole tax system then yes , but it 's a far bigger thing than what they promise to do . 
  not just that . 
  story on how the system works in principle is such : in the begining there was no currency , 0 z\u0142otych . 
  nobody could pay for anything and so nbp printed money . 
  but who should get it now ? 
  the conutry ca n't just sit on money and wait . 
  so it gave low-percentage loans to banks , so they could borrow money to companies to finance investments . 
  and now companies need to earn money form other companies ( indirectly , mostly ) to pay their debts . 
  but now , there 's not enough money on the market to pay the loans with the interest !, 
  so nbp prints a little bit more money and loans it again . 
  borrowing rates and rate of printing money let it control inflation and a few other things . 
  that 's true , but it 's not how tax free threshold works . 
  lowering vat would be probably better as it 's regressive tax ( affects poorer people more ) . 
   not extremely religious - check i guess people have vastly different opinions on that matter and it influences policies a lot . 
  and you guys pretend not to be german . 
  it would n't look far from what would be ch\u0159\u0119\u015b\u0107 though . 
  it could make typographical mistakes worse . 
  i mean \u017a\u017c is bad enough , \u015b\u0161 \u0107\u010d would be even more confusing . 
   the change could help book publishers save on paper idk m8 thr r many w8s to s8v ppr though i agree , using z to change sounds seems like a weird hack . 
  i 'd expect that kind of thing from magyars . 
  it 's just a joke . 
  it 's not meant to be of any factual accuracy . 
  i 'm not sure . 
  aladdin disagrees !, 
  we 've got \u017c & \u017a , so \u017e is not needed . 
  rz is used on its own right . 
  i mean , for example if a word has r in some form ( dobry ) then you 'll use rz in its other forms ( dobrze ) , but if you 've got g ( ksi\u0119ga ) then you 'll use \u017c ( ksi\u0105\u017cka ) . 
  there 's list of letters for both rz and \u017c for this `` exchange '' . 
  obviously there are exceptions to this rule . 
  what 's wrong with trousers ? 
  even if you try to turn this into a gender issue , many women wear trousers . 
  the right kind of stonings . 
  so , you trying to continue the work of claiming that some austrians were germans ? 
   except the fact that ms. curie was polish i think it might be somehow relevant . 
  i do n't know how , i 'm not an expert on these things . 
  is n't she a politician already ? 
  acceptance of homosexuality is older than rejection of it . 
  in ancient cultures it was okay to be gay . 
  they did n't really distinguish this until rennesaince or so .

  i know that one guy with an alfa that stays more in the workshop than on streets .

  i too do n't see the point of going to africa instead of europe , but :  sandy beaches  plenty in croatia oh come on . 
  that 's right , but poland should change its laws because they 're against freedom of conscience . 
  your face looks like heineken tastes . 
  if a polish man married a british girl who gave birth to anonymous-donor in-vitro baby the situation would be similar . 
  except for the fact that they could probably convince the institutions that he is the father , which would be a fraud . 
  aaand it 's just the french doing it . 
   it 's just assumed regarding every state-funded ( or eu-funded ) construction here there 's so much in common between our nations !,

  you 'd think that sweden would be all over it already .

  that 's 2000 calories per 40 km . 
  this is about 800 grams of pork . 
  they eat less or gain weight . 
  you burn calories by walking . 
  to make a kilogram of pork you 're going to need 6 tonnes of water .

  that 's why dubai is such a tourism/business/aviation hot spot now while countries like kuwait and saudi arabia are losing billions every month because they relied too heavily on oil ( some 93 % of their income was from oil ) . 
  the mentality in many of these countries was `` oil is god 's gift to us and when it runs out , it 's gods will '' . 
  you can say what you want about dubai but it 's leaders were/are not idiots . 
  they transformed a small emirate into an alpha city and the 4th most visited city in the world ( london , paris , bangkok , dubai ) . 
  the airport had 80 million international passengers last year , nr 1 in the world . 
  average hotel occupancy is the highest in the world ( 87 % ) . 
  and so on and so on . 
  so while you might not like it and do n't want to visit , dubai is a much needed success story in the region . 
  please do n't compare it to qatar or even worse , saudi arabia . 
  my grandfather , rest his soul , used to say this to me : '' the germans fucked us for 5 years , the russians fucked us for 50 years '' . 
  and this was during his lifetime . 
  he was 10 when ww2 started . 
  he remembered . 
  but he also remembered communism and what damage that period of 1945-1989 did to poland and europe in general . 
  he hated the russians far more than germans . 
  recent memory of germany and germans is not negative . 
  recent memory of russia is ( smole\u0144sk just came out a few days ago ) . 
  many poles live in germany , many jump across the border on a weekly basis for shopping or work , and all in all , there 's no real hatred . 
  but you will still find many poles who do n't like russians . 
  and a lot of that has to do with the way most russians look down on poland . 
  germans do n't really do that . 
  im not defending anything , just pointing out that the same vague description about how women should dress is in the bible , and women have been earing headscarfs for thousands of years without being forced to . 
  only 2 countries force women to wear them , iran and saudi arabia . 
  women can choose not to wear one in any other muslim country , and many choose not to . 
  now if the family is uneducated , intolerant and forces the women to wear them , that has nothing to do with islam . 
  blame the educational system of the country instead , and the fact that women often feel powerless as it 's mainly old men who control the country . 
  as for europe , they are old women today , but were once young women wearing them . 
  it was the norm for women to wear them , it 's only in the last 30-40 years that it has changed and the younger generation doesnt wear them anymore . 
  its also in the bible . 
  `` virgin '' mary wore a headscarf and long flowing dresses , as was the custom at the time . 
  hell , women wear a headscarf even today in central europe , move out of the cities and the older ladies in villages pretty much all wear headscarfs . 
  that doesnt make them muslim . 
  it 's just an old tradition , which predates islam , christianity and judaism . 
  who is justifying it ? 
  while there might not be an excuse , its still much worse when it 's your country doing it to you rather than your neighbouring country or a country your country is at war with . 
  if a country does this to its citizens , who can protect them then ? 
  hence the metaphor with the father vs stranger comparison , not torture vs fist fight . 
  read between the lines people . 
  what would make you feel worse ? 
  if your neighbour / class mate punched you in the face or if your father punched you in the face ? 
  damn , that guys neck sort of continues and becomes a head . 
  its like a thumb . 
  also , bad technique , heel lifted , dude will feel uncomfortable within a few minutes .

  i could go on, 
  if they did n't go bust after leicester won the title , they 'll be fine now . 
  imagine all the thousands of people that put money down on germany , france , spain or even england . 
  the house always wins in the end . 
  there 's no curing their stupidity . 
  i know a guy who was in dubai working and making bank , while constantly spewing anti muslim and anti arab comments on his fb , now he 's in england making bank as a polish citizen and is extatic that they 're leaving the union . 
  some people ca n't be fixed . 
  i get your point . 
  but for me , as soon as they say `` oilrich '' and `` qatar '' in the same breath , i stop taking them seriously . 
  that is my point . 
  i have many things to say about qatar and their backwards laws , but theres no point talking about them to people who dont even know the most important thing about the country . 
  if it wasnt for the gas , qatar would be an anonymous obscure country nobody would give two shits about , like they were 20 years ago . 
  btw , that natural gas is one of the main reasons for isil in syria . 
  but that 's a longer explanation i dont want to start now . 
  both the man and woman were charged . 
  he for sex outside of marriage ( crazy law , but thats the law ) and consuming alcohol without license , she for the same things plus 12 months for lying to the police . 
  you 're ridiculing the situation . 
  are you even an adult ? 
  your replies are very immature . 
  not saying she was lying , but i find it strange that she didnt get more help from the dutch embassy . 
  western media likes to spin things to make these countries look worse than they are by not giving you the full story . 
  a story came out recently about `` sex party in dubai , scores arrested '' , and the media 's narrative was that if you have a yacht party which involves consensual sex and alcohol , you will go to jail . 
  none of the articles ( i read them in 6 languages from 10 different countries ) mentioned that the people arrested were military and police officers who were with hookers , and it was embarresing to the country so they got arrested as an example . 
  nope , drinking and sex will get you arrested . 
  that sells more papers . 
  im not saying they are perfect countries by any means , but theyre also not as vile as western media makes them out to be . 
  qatar is seriously beckwards as a country though , no denying it . 
  her sex partner according to her . 
  she went out drinking with her boss , went to his room to `` sleep '' , woke up drunk and claimed rape , then admitted to consensual sex after sobering up . 
  admitting it is what put her behind bars . 
  but you seem like you know everything about this case , so why waste my time . 
  what country was her boss from btw ? 
  i forgot . 
  doesnt change the laws , but shows how little people know about the country they are shittalking itt, 
  thats not my point . 
  everybody here talks about qatar like they know everything about it , yet dont even know that their wealth is not because of oil . 
  their oil production is not small , but their natural gas reserves are massive . 
  only russia and iran have bigger natural gas reserves , both are massive countries with a population of 200 million and 80 million respectively . 
  and qatar is 1/3 the size of belgium , with a local population of 300.000 . 
  well lots of european women go on vacation in southern europe and shag new guys every day . 
  for free ... same thing , but they get paid thousands of dollars a night instead . 
  not oil .

  debatable , but probably not . 
  they still committed many crimes however , enslaved and hurt a lot of people . 
  now the reason people do n't hate on germany that much anymore is because they accepted their faults , made amends , apologized and so on . 
  on the other hand , the often common stance of russia is that there 's nothing to apologize for , or the apologies issued are brief and insincere . 
  where the germans have shame for their deeds , for similar acts many russians carry pride . 
  also , wwii crimes for germany ended in 1945 . 
  meanwhile , the soviets occupied a large part of europe up until the 90 's . 
  sorry , i panicked . 
  i 'm , like , sorry , officer . 
  so what are some good traditional british dishes ? 
  last time i asked this on / r/food i was suggested to have tikka masala . 
  apart from english breakfast stuff i only know of beef wellington and fish and chips . 
  could n't they , like , send them over an email ? 
  the linked article is really shitty because it does n't explain the situation at all . 
  i 'm on my phone right now and do n't have other sources on hand , but in another thread someone linked a more detailed article . 
  as far as i remember no party was `` banned '' , only one mp was removed from the proceedings on that day because of some offense or something . 
  then the whole party got up and left in protest . 
  hey , at least it 's warmer here . 
  and if he somehow makes a norwegian wage in poland , he 'd be really well off . 
  citing wikipedia :  the term mediterranean derives from the latin word mediterraneus , meaning `` in the middle of earth '' now what sea is warm , is in the middle of land * and * has a significant russian coast ? 
  the divide between western and eastern european cultures has more to do with the divide between western roman catholic church and eastern orthodox church influences . 
  central european countries shared the catholic faith with western europe , as opposed to eastern european countries , and thus shared more with the western than eastern culture . 
  the distinction of central europe comes from that fact - countries that are geographically `` east '' ( but honestly , look at the map , it 's the center ) but culturally belong to the west . 
  it would n't be correct to lump this region with west though , because through its location it created a distinct mix of western and eastern due to the collision of those cultures . 
  plus , yes , we do n't like being lumped with russia into one entity ( ideas like pan-slavism and all that ) because then they historically get all `` ho ho you 're practically one entity with us , let us roll over the cavalry to make sure you 're safe '' , so we also like to talk about the ex-commonwealth lands as central europe .

  i 'm actually wondering if 2.138 billion euros is surprisingly a lot of money for a country 's - worth of a fruit 's yearly production , or if it 's surprisingly cheap . 
  that 's about 0.5 billion less than bill gates ' yearly salary . 
  unless putin moves the border ... 
  i liked that clip , but i still do n't think it should cost 500k . 
  6,5 million was for emission fees , which is ridiculous that the public national tv would charge for showing a public announcement . 
  beam it to the orbit !, 
  i have n't worked out what to do next though . 
  hey , maybe it would be slow and it take a decade or two ... or more . 
  but it 's the thought that counts , 
   as someone who advocates a federal european super state in the uk ?!, 
  this ca n't be easy for you ... 
  federalization would mean that ukraine goes back into russian sphere of influence . 
  a federalized ukraine would n't be able to make any moves towards eu membership with a few of its oblasts disagreeing with that . 
  then they keep being the weak proxy state that 's trying to play the game in both teams , or join russia in putin 's little union . 
  either way , great for russia . 
  a chance yes , but would probably hide all of his stolen assets before leaving office . 
  but oh well , the elections were already decided on ( on terms * very * favorable to yanukovich ) , seems he had other reasons to flee the country . 
  yes , well , i think he would have come out of it with a better deal anyway . 
  he would have been `` the guy who did n't get reelected '' instead of `` the guy that fled because he was thought to be a corrupt fuck at best and a traitor and killer at worst '' . 
  seriously , this was what the maidan protesters even started with , months ago . 
  if yanukovich just resigned from the start and announced elections himself maybe he would even get reelected . 
   i really despise discussions like this where the sovereignty and democratic will of eastern europeans is ignored and any consideration of their fate is reduced to a tug of war between east and west this also applies to nato alliances . 
  pro-russia posters ( or putin , in his speeches ) will tell how nato `` creeps up '' on russia , or `` swallows up '' countries . 
  because nato expansion is literally a us invasion on the poor sods who have no other choice but to submit . 
  i 'm sure it has nothing to do with a big autocratic nuclear power in the vicinity that has a tradition of strong-handing its neighbors , while talking how it regrets that a few of those countries are now independent . 
  surely it 's not the will of the people to seek safety in a powerful alliance . 
  i 'm not saying it 's easy , but if we closed every industry and institution in poland because of corruption we 'd probably live in caves by now , 
  if so , a logical course of action would be to do a crackdown on corruption , and not nuclear power . 
  as someone who just got home from the pub : i think so ? 
  there are a few restaurants , but it 's hard to find something authentic and it 's expensive .

  i 'm sure they think we 're retarded that we do n't derail every discussion into a po-pis conflict . 
  ... yes , i even said so in my post . 
  radicalism is a civil right as well , i 'm not sure what exactly is your point . 
  there 's nothing wrong with saying that someone has radical views . 
  you say like its a bad word . 
  a radical is someone who favors extreme political reforms . 
  maidan protesters are radicals . 
  pro-russian protesters or separatists are radicals . 
  non-radicals are people that stay at home or go to work and maybe have an opinion , but otherwise are pretty ` meh ' about the whole thing . 
  yeah , but `` supporting '' does n't really equal `` joining '' . 
  also many people might say they want the us to attack something , or russia to fight someone , or ukraine to start shooting , but may have a different opinion when you hand them a gun and say `` okay , you go '' . 
  well they built a tank . 
  maybe it was a proof of concept - they would disassemble it , and then assemble it again wherever needed .

   but kiselev says in sweden , there has been a `` sharp rise in child abortions , early sex is the norm - from the age of nine , and it is not surprising that child impotence starts at 12 . 
  there you have european values in all their glory . '', 
  i 've been wondering - does the average russian actually think of europe as this oversexed , homoerotic , immoral cesspool ? 
  i know stuff like this is sensationalized propaganda , but sometimes it seems we 're mostly portrayed as deviants , devoid of any traditional values , just waiting to break apart the moral , happy russian family . 
  i did n't know we can afford stuff like this . 
  well then , imagine that there are actually job ads that specifically ask for * only * disabled applicants . 
  they 're not even shy about it , the ad lists a `` disability certificate '' next to expected education in the requirements . 
  well of course not , and that 's because the forced part was n't done right as well . 
  haha , in high school we had to do a 1 km run to pass the class . 
  at no point previously did we run for such a distance , and our `` training '' consisted of running for maybe 300 meters two or three times . 
  i almost puked , had a time of over 6 minutes , but i somehow made it . 
  i wish i was thought * something * about running at school . 
  only years later i discovered it can be kinda fun , because school only made me hate any form of exercise . 
  at least you guys have some success with just throwing a football for the kids to play with , 
  it sounded better in my head that they were so outraged that they refused to live on the same side of the planet as belgium . 
  hey , i did n't say it 's the single cause for longevity worldwide ... 
  actually , i heard it 's the lifestyle . 
  you guys are chill as fuck . 
  less stress = better health . 
  i partly blame pe in schools . 
  it 's still so goddamn backwards . 
  it was pretty much the same when my parents went to school , it was the same for me , and from what i heard , it 's still kinda the same for children today . 
  it 's supposed to provide physical activity and introduce young people to various sports . 
  instead , it consists of the whole class playing football with no supervision ( which , as usual in such cases , ends up with kids that are bad with football being marginalized by other kids , since they mess up the game ) , and useless tests for things like 100m running or jumping a pommel horse with very little prior practice , which directly affect your school grade . 
  this pretty much favors only kids that are already interested in sports , and tries hard to ignore every one else . 
  how are kids supposed to learn anything from that , and how are they supposed to carry on any good habits into their adult life ? 
  it 's slowly changing and some schools introduce other , more diverse activities with actually competent trainers , but this will take decades to fix .

  i get the feeling that sarkozy may be just the tip of the iceberg ... 
  ok , a question then : can you go to jail in today 's germany if you express a dissenting opinion that is not `` kill all the _______ '' ( fill in the blank ) ?

  no , it 's not true . 
  also , here 's a link from harvard about pedophilia and rehabilitation : http://www.health.harvard.edu/newsletter_article/pessimism-about-pedophilia i trust you consider the source a trustworthy one . 
  no , you can not . 
  it 's what drives them . 
  can you rehabilitate someone who prefers men so that they no longer prefer men ? 
  can you rehabilitate someone who has a masochism fetish ? 
  also , harvard studied this already : http://www.health.harvard.edu/newsletter_article/pessimism-about-pedophilia, 
   you would go to jail for saying this on the streets you know , i am waiting until the german government starts `` disappearing '' people who dare to speak their mind about a touchy subject on the streets . 
  lol yeah right , they said the same damn thing about homosexuality . 
  can you rehabilitate a man who prefers blonde women ? 
  can you rehabilitate homosexuality ? 
  can you rehabilitate any sexual preference ?

  does this count ?

  i no longer like them so there you go . 
  normal humans do n't go around raping kids . 
  pedos will never be human to me and that 's final . 
  i am not going to ever consider pedophiles as humans since they act like the animals that they are . 
  keep defending the pedos , i guess . 
  sooo why not cut off that arm , then ? 
  ca n't rehabilitate pedos though . 
  literally virtue signalling ... 
  an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure ... 
   we 're talking about people . 
  once someone rapes a child they 're no longer human to me , sorry . 
  pedos ! = people and that 's all there 's to it . 
  once they rape someone , they already are psychos . 
   might as well try to reabilitate them rehab on pedos does n't work , it has never worked , and it never ever will work . 
  also , they 're already child rapists so i do n't think they can get anymore psychotic ...

  i am not sure but ca n't some polish eu reps request documents in polish ? 
  as for `` importance '' , i really do n't know but i 'd prefer if all of the official communication from the eu and its institutions was in english only since that is the default language of trade around the world anyways ... 
  not disbelieving the source but considering people think we are experiencing a lack of freedom of the press , can you tell me who ultimately owns wprost ? 
  but those are already used in , say , the eu parliament , though . 
  ever watched one of those eu-parl meetings where some our pl reps were speaking in polish to the group ? 
  i would like to see them try and use [ interslavic ] ( http://steen.free.fr/interslavic/ ) with the cyrillic alphabet ...

  i am not sure how that works and i am currently looking for a reputable source ... 
  i personally expect a `` wag the dog '' situation one way or another . 
  by `` wag the dog '' i mean that the bill gets passed in another way entirely or while we are distracted with a different more controversial bill . 
  to give some context to this , while people were protesting the judicial reforms the ruling party passed a couple of other bills that were n't as controversial but will make life a bit more annoying in poland . 
  one of those bills will probably raise the price on water provided to the home and things like that . 
  but what if the `` jihadi '' has a bomb jacket strapped to their body ? 
  we have a small ( approx . 
  50,000 or so ) contingent of vietnamese people living in poland and they integrate rather well from what i 've heard ... 
  they 're yuuuge , believe me folks !, 
  well , if you are n't completely burned on poland , i highly recommend visiting warsaw as it 's much safer ( just do n't come on november 11th for your own safety , even most of the natives stay inside during that day . ),

  the soviet union was a genocidal regime , it just killed indiscriminately .

  can we just get a megathread for this meme like all the others before it ?

  ( art . 
  197 ) in this case it looks like tribunal refused to proceed in accordiance to the bill . 
  i understand why and as i 've said this was the intention of parliament , this or including a one of judges in question . 
  tribunal is judging the bills , but until then the law is presumed to be constitutional . 
  how 's that retoroactive if the bill is already a law ? 
  the problem here is that 's a bill about tribunal itself , this is the contradiction written in the constitution . 
  another problem is election of judges , because as we can see president is not obliged to take wovs , or at least was n't before the ruling of tribunal , but it was after the new judges were sweaed in . 
  instead of getting emotional , poiting fingers and throwing groundles and powerles threats ( i guess you know how ts works ) you should try to understand that this whole mess happend because it was possible to appoint 2 extra judges in previous cadention and 3 additional in this one . 
  the problem here is also with the way that judges are elected , which can be also regulated by parliamentar bills and voted down by a regular majority . 
  edit : downvote for not enough radical criticism ... how typical for polish redditors . 
  fantastic martyrology of `` far left '' ( following your classification ) created in defence of `` elites '' , which are the real target of this `` saying '' . 
  saying which is equally arrogant and stupid . 
   pis and po together voted by both , but proposed just by a one of two . 
  i agree it 's a power grab , but it 's possible just because the constitution allows this and both parties took advantege of it , one before and the other after elections . 
  this is a bit more complicated and pointing fingers is not going to help . 
  the real issue is with constitution , which allows this kind of conflicts because in this case the problem is with a bill about tribunal . 
  constitution says that tribunal is composed of 15 judges , elected by parliament for 9 years cadentions , details are regulated by a bill and before it 's judged , there 's presumption of legality so in theory tribunal should judge it in accordiance to existing rules . 
  it did n't and gov argues that this sentence is not legal because of that . 
  i suppose that was the whole idea of ruling party from the beginning , they issued a rule in their bill that tribunal needs to proceed with 13 judges , if it would happend , then at least a one of three `` controvercial '' judges should be included . 
  if parliament would want to avoid this conflict , then they could issue * vacatio legis * long enough to judge it , but they did n't which is also legal , but problematic in this paerticular case . 
  this is another problem which was not predicted by the creators of constitution . 
  there 's already conflict of competences between president and government , now we have a conflict between parliament and constitutional tribunal . 
  no idea what legislators were thinking then , that a single party will hold all of these institutions forever ? 
  ok , i thought you 're talking about embriogenesis . 
  birth is indeed a major stress for both organisms and can be lethal , but this is also what medicine is for . 
   since there is no unequivocal definition of life , the current understanding is descriptive . 
  life is considered a characteristic of something that exhibits all or most of the following traits : - homeostasis : cells of zygote keeps it , as well as sperm , but ** only ** for limited time . 
  - organisation : obviously both are organised , even if sperm lacks cell organelles . 
  - metabolism : sperm does ** not ** anabolise any of its components , it does n't absorb organis matter , once it 's created , it 's ** only ** katabolising stored energy to perform its only function . 
  - growth : sperm does ** not ** grow . 
  - adaptation : sprem ca n't adapt , an organism can only to some extent and thus there 's natural selection . 
  - response to stimuli : both can respond to chemical and phisical stimulation . 
  - reproduction : sperm ca n't reproduce , a healthy meture organism can and humans are maturing in puberty . 
  how about we abort pregnant women ? 
  it would be also a `` birth control '' ... 
   you consider them separate entities not me . 
  no idea what kind of `` damage '' you 're talking about , it 's a natural proces and it does n't matter if you like it or not , this is just how we reproduce . 
  this kind of comparations are ususally useless , the parents are `` donors '' of their gametes . 
   list the characteristics i 've asked you to read the definition of life , you should have it in biology classes anyway , or at least i hope that 's in american schools curriculum . 
  [ read ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/life#biology ) . 
   unless we choose to allow it to you 're obviously wrong , we can control it only as far as contraception works . 
  mothers ( and fathers ) should be awared of that when they decides what to do with their `` bodies '' . 
  once again i repeat , humans in embrional period of their life are separate organisms ( bodies ) , even if dependant on their mothers . 
  excuse me if i think that someones comfort is not enough to justyfie elimination of another human . 
  i 'm afraid it is , not a single biologist , not even a phisician which somehow excuses aborting humans , would consider gametes as living organisms and deny that zygote is a one . 
  deliberatelly i 've mentioned sometic cells , also because they 're diploids . 
  so i tell you once again that arguing with independence or viability outside of mothers womb is a fallacy . 
  there were developed ways to treat premature births and humans are dependant on mothers for many years even after they mature during puberty . 
  also , once again i repeat that intercourse leads to procreation and if it 's not a rape , then the argument about `` unwanted '' offspring is moot . 
  so we have a conflict of interests here and unless we get a compromise and develop some technology to avoid this problem , we have no other choice to preserve the life of both parts . 
  no , gametes are not living organism , neither somatic cells are . 
  please , read the definition of life . 
  and i see it clearly because zygote in her own `` body '' is a separate human . 
  excuse me if i think that every human is a subject , not an object . 
  no , i 'm telling once again that an offspring organism is not their own organism ( `` body '' , if you insist ) and that the humans which are dependent on the others are not their `` property '' . 
  i was n't referring to your comments , but to the general rules . 
  zygote is an early stage of organism developement , if it 's a human zygote , then it 's a human organism , it fulfills all the biologic criteria of a living organism . 
  what you 're trying to talk about are the conditions set by some politicians and ideologues in order to excuse elimination of that human organism . 
  fetus ( organism in prenatal stage of developement ) would n't survive in many cases of premature or complicated birth without medical assistance . 
  usually the `` human '' rights applies to registred specimens and this happends with birth , but this is again , humans legislation and depends on regime , laws of nature and phisical sciences are something else and sometimes unfortunatelly contradicting . 
  they have , except that they should n't have absolute authority over the other humans . 
  we can only to some degree , contraception and sterilisation is not working every time . 
  eliminating sick and `` unwanted '' humans is not a medical solution , even hipocrates was against it , but who cares about it today . 
  i 'm all in favour of contraceptives and education . 
  morning after pills are basicly the same what aborting humans is , except that it 's even more harmful also to the mother . 
  eliminating humans is someyhing i 'm opposing , as you probably know . 
  a young mammal is dependent on mother , sometimes for many years even after birth . 
  independence does not determinate a human . 
  good , but until then we have nothing else but human wombs . 
  we can not control most of processes that are taking place in our own bodies , another person like phisician can do it , but still is limited . 
  no , it [ does n't ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/life#biology ) , unless you mean growth , which is also why i 'm mentioning the first mitotic divisions of zygote . 
  what you consider a `` safe side '' is highly subjective and this is also why i 'm against definitions of human based on ideology , or religion ( if there is any ) . 
  [ read ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/consciousness ) . 
  a human is a living human organism , just that . 
  of course , parents which are unable or unwilling to rise their children can give their babies away . 
  yes , but sex can lead to fertilisation , no matter your intentions or awarness . 
  and i see why humans matters for other humans just like it is amongst the other social species . 
  another false comparation , organ is not organism . 
  absolutelly , kids should be protected if their parents are dangerous , but we ca n't force sterilisation . 
  as i 've said , it has other functions , but procreation is the primary . 
  the whole evolution is about survival of the fittest species and this strategy just worked for our specie . 
  a potato is not a human ... 
  of course . 
  the question is not if we should protect humans and prevent others from taking their lives away , i hope we agree at lest on that , the question is what 's a human . 
  there 're few answers , but i 'm considering biological as the most neutral and objective . 
  of course it can , but why do you assume that consciousness determinates human ? 
  a potato is not conscious , but a pig definitely is . 
  we 're all `` clumps of cells '' . 
  the limits you 're talking about are just legislative creations based on some ideological beliefs , they can be changed in this or the other way . 
  just because something 's legal it does n't mean that 's fair and ca n't be criticised , there 're far too many examples of bad or even inhumane laws all around the world . 
  and because of all of that we should narrow the margin of dubious definitions and ideologic concepts down to the natural , objective sciences . 
  it does n't depend on me , but in many countries there 're services which takes care of abused childern in patologic families . 
  ok , so there 's also this social function , which does n't change the primary , biological one . 
  it 's a living organism since feritilisation , or more exactly since the first mitotic divisions , whatever you consider `` sufficient '' development and thus grant the human `` rights '' to this organism , does n't change the fact that it 's a living human organism . 
  so why do n't we concentrate on developing life saving technologies instead of removing the `` problematic '' humans ? 
  i 'm afraid it does . 
  it 's not my idea or invention so do n't blame me , but the fact is that people reproduce and grow in female bodies , you ca n't control or `` dominate '' some natural processes that happends inside your body . 
  once again , goverment is not forcing people to reproduce . 
  pregnancy is a natural process thanks to which we 're all here , patologic exceptions should be treated separatelly by medicine . 
  yes and this is also why i would consider rape as an exception , but still adviced against it .

  it 's not even cold yet, 
  astronomical winter for northern hemisphere : 22.12-21 .03 + / -1 day climat one : when average daily temperature falls below 0 ' c + usually when it starts snowing, 
  previous one : [ the hitchhiker to magadan , far east russia ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0hurjkotpu ), 
  migration issue did n't even play a big role in the elections . 
  reverting retairement reform , various subsidiaries ( eg . 
  500pln for each kid ) , keeping dead nonprofitable industry ( coal mining ) alive by national budget and on expense of other industries ( energetics ) etc were the big thing . 
  ( and fact they are 2nd biggest option after rulling po ) - set of populist shortterm bandages without any long term plan their program is so bad that even their voters hope that was just a election bullshit and wo n't be implemented . 
  it 's not a bad thing when it 's done with sense , not just to get votes like it 's done in poland . 
  even if the `` putting its own citizens first '' is nothing more than a populist baner that has no support in real life , where decisions are made without any reason ? 
  you are just ignorant of polish political scene, 
  from kaczmarski songs like [ upadek ikara ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4l49lnd5bq ) ( fell of ikarus ) , [ \u015aniadanie z bogiem ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=el7nz28ylpo ) ( breakfast with god ) or [ w\u0119dr\u00f3wka z cieniem ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enq5ehfq3t4 ) ( jurney with a shadow ; this one is more autumny i guess ) would be better i guess, 
  go to poland and save over 2/3 on living/education costs ; ) adding your preferable areas of study would make it easier for people to suggest unis, 
  those polan borders though - modern or pre-ww2 , mayby bit of both ; ), 
  i wonder why such vessels do n't carry guns just like russian units incase such events, 
  can also work with ubite/y/a / ci , but zabity feels more natural . 
  `` zabity '' is literally english killed - as eg . 
  with gun, 
  we got same phrase in polish `` x \u015bpi jak zabity '' ( x sleeps as if he/she/it was killed ), 
  all those are more of a exception than regular trend, 
  which we do n't really really on ; ), 
  turkey has been fucking up things related to daesh conflict really badly, 
  meanwhile [ houses in poland ] ( https://www.google.pl/maps/@53.18045,22.0433795,3a,75y,6.45h,73.28t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1solbs9mcjbp8d1f6sbnrsxa!2e0!7i13312!8i6656!6m1!1e1 ) i 'm most used to see ( go down that street , one of neighbourhoods in my hometown - a small ~ 60k people town ) . 
  we usually got cube-shaped ones ( they were build during communism times ) or more modern american-like designs, 
  as if grey blocks of flats jungle was only a communist thing ; ), 
  [ this ] ( http://weknowyourdreams.com/image.php?pic=/images/house/house-06.jpg ) or [ this ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6f/numbers_341_to_385_lordship_lane_n17.jpg ), 
  people really own houses in so densly populated countries like netherlands or belgium ? 
  it means : `` where eyes can not reach for free '' but in a more vulgar manner . 
  it 's pretty hard to find exact english equivalents , `` na krzywy ryj '' means gatecrashing and `` w pizdu/w pi\u017adziec '' means somewhere far . 
  the series are made by uni history student that goes to magadan ( eastern syberia , near kamchatka ) only with his backpack and 200pln , [ trailer ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0hurjkotpu ) ( has english subs ), 
  whole budged to esa !, 
  sounds like administrative change to me eg . 
  adding small towns/villages that worked as sleeping houses for people working/studying in lisbon to the lisbon itself, 
  we got 5 open mosques in poland : 2 old , wooden ones in eastern poland like one in [ kruszyniany ] ( https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/meczet_w_kruszynianach ) or [ bohoniki ] ( https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/meczet_w_bohonikach ) and 3 more : in [ warsaw ] ( https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/meczet_w_warszawie ) , [ pozna\u0144 ] ( https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/meczet_w_poznaniu ) and [ gda\u0144sk ] ( https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/meczet_w_gda%c5%84sku ) , nothing special about them though, 
  if you are happy with political system/climate only becouse it 's nationalistic then you got serious problems in judging things or plainly dumb it 's literally like saying that some ideaology is best becouse it has a cool logo ... 
  dreamworld ; ), 
  like on the `` w pizdu na krzywy ryj '' talk with russian women : - `` russia did n't attack poland in ww2 , we entered the war when germans attacked us in brest ... '' - `` but brest was polish then ... ''  / edit : [ episode mentioned , in polish/russian though ] ( https://youtu.be/o7oibuuz7a8?t=4m46s ), 
  as far as nato goes poland is nearly only on the giving side eg . 
  - sending trops around the world - signing overpriced arms deals - supporting pretty much anything us does while we get only a pat on the back in return, 
  it 's easier , faster and more useful to give / edit ; well , mayby not faster , but certainly more effective in helping, 
  who will balance out southern slavs constant streams then ? 
  they are much worse than polish ( most of our constant streams come from double letters like sz , cz , rz , dz , d\u017a , d\u017c so it 's little missleading ), 
   try making fun of the church or catholicism on polish tv like standard sketches do on tv ? 
   - icz sounds more belarusian/ukrainian, 
   - ich if plural it 's probably polish ( aka it 's smith 's house ) , if not - then belarusian or ukrainian, 
  easy entry to weaker market, 
  you are looking only on one side of the trade though, 
  or a positive one, 
  silicon valley is tech center , not e-center, 
  it 's expansion on what ten commandments entail according to the church , a rule book of sorts, 
  catechism of the catholic church would be more accurte, 
  is there a name for catholic sharia ? 
  it 's based on [ old model ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/21/warszawa_203.jpg ), 
  should go both ways then, 
  not realy a sport by most definitions though it 's definitly a team discipline, 
  literally in few cities though , not country wide, 
  europe must be a really scarry place for your children then - people do n't have guns , are pretty ok with nudity , are pretty healthy and you can even buy kindersurprise in each shop, 
  you are either trolling us here or a real steorotypical redneck american, 
  `` the play is intended for really adult audience and contains sex scenes '', 
   seems foolish not to know how to defend yourself with a firearm . 
  that 's completly different thing from restricting accessibility guns, 
  what kind of hockey - ice hockey or field hockey ( or both ), 
  ice or field ? 
  as for trailer hyper ? 
  why not . 
  would be weird if they used it in the series most important thing for me was the fact they used more accurate weapons ; ), 
  most will argue that 's the main reason, 
   emergency state like in belgium . 
  ghost submarine strikes again, 
   hurling wow til such thing exists, 
  watching : volleyball or ski jumps playing : volleyball or squash/tenis/table tenis , mayby handball or basketball ( i assume things like running , swimming or cycling for fitness do n't count ), 
  come on , those are awesome, 
   the musketeers i was really hyped about it since i 'm very into fencing and thanks to [ this trailer ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g55dcijqg3y ) ( they finally used proper rapiers & daggers for them instead of lame sport \u00e9p\u00e9es ) , but ditched it pretty fast , found it really averege , not worth the time, 
   not to mention that the same was done few months ago by the previous gov what exactly are you talking about ? 
  had it been more about the politics and war it would be really cool , unfortunatley they made it into a brazilian soap opera in cool costumes, 
  yes : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/muhte%c5%9fem_y%c3%bczy%c4%b1l#international_broadcasts  low quality  720p ? 
  [ not in uk though ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/muhte%c5%9fem_y%c3%bczy%c4%b1l#international_broadcasts ) ; ), 
  that 's nowhere near regular seat changes, 
  not eu , but few episodes of turkish `` muhte\u015fem y\u00fczy\u0131l '' ( it 's called `` wspania\u0142e stulecie '' = `` magnificent century '' ) and polish production , but about ukrainians emigrants in poland : `` dziewczyny ze lwowa '' ( girls from lviv ), 
  then at least people can watch some castle/palaces from belgium ; ), 
  meanwhile british weather emigrated to poland - it 's has been raining for 2 weeks ... 
  quality public spending, 
  / r/iwantout /, 
  they will make a directive that forbids fire to heppen , duh, 
  couse gypsies are like esmeralda from disney, 
  one important thing about catholic church is that it has had a bit different role in poland than in most other countries - it was more political and cultural , church was the place/institution/community that was root of most underground movements and played big role in preserving polish culture during hard times . 
  it 's where most of it 's position comes from , not the religious part . 
   volunteer firefighters i 'm talking about fulltime firefighters , not volunteers , 
   ambulance guys there was a scandal few years ago where some medical guys on purpose let people die and participated in illegal organs trade ( something like that , i do n't remember the details ) . 
  i guess that had some impact as for firefighters , they got really good pay/working hours ( they often get 2nd job ) and very early retirement age , which angers many people i guess . 
  in general those two had been always # 1 and # 2 as far as i remember, 
  yea , i did n't know how to phrase it to be short, 
  well you can half serious half jokingly say that church is 4th power next to montesquieu 's legislature , an executive , and a judiciary powers . 
  thankfully it gets pushed out as time goes, 
  and religion is not # 2, 
  source : http://www.bankier.pl/wiadomosc/komu-ufaja-i-co-cenia-polacy-7287345.html ( polish ) ; based on gus ( polish central statistical office ) data from 1st quarter of 2015 from 14000 people aged 16 + . 
  i ' v translated all the infographics , sorry for mistakes . 
  -------------------------------- some info from the text : - women trust more in police and catholic church than men ( women : ~ 71 % , men : ~ 62 % ) - men trust more in army than women ( men : 75 % to women : 70 % ) - there 's big differences in age groups : generally the older the responder the more trust he has , biggest differences in the attitude thowards parliament , police and church - aged 25-34 : 57 % trusts in church when aged 74 + 84 % , police : 61 % and 77 % , parliament : 22 % and 41 % - trust in other polish people : 78,4 % ; family : 97,6 % ( 65,7 % definitly ) , friends : 93,4 % , workmates : 82,5 % , neighbours : 75,9 % , strangers : 39,1 % . 
  as previously the older the person the more he willing to trust other people - value of fairness also goes up with age - religion spikes up in the ranking in 65 + age group on the expense of money, 
  and that 's pretty much all the difference there is - few words ; ), 
   silesians and kashubians which are spoken pretty much only in culture centers ( and places like that ) though not live , distinctive enough eg .

  international relations have countless different standards depending on the particular field , even among allies . 
  a bit different situation , though . 
  everyone is buddy-buddy with the us on copyright infringement , whistleblowing is something else . 
  his case would be highly politicized , scrutinized and he is not a priority for the usa anyway . 
  even the initial famous manning-sourced leak was nothing special despite assange claiming `` countless war crimes '' and manning herself was prosecuted . 
  that moment passed , really . 
  a year ago it looked like the far right had some chance , now it seems it expanded to its limits . 
  the current does n't , he was referencing some unnamed former one so who knows . 
  it should n't be applied like a cudgel , though . 
   remember that jew and christian books are fine with slavery , too . 
  rules for how to treat your slaves are * immediately * after ten commandments . 
  i discovered it many years ago and i am still laughing . 
  if daily mail and the sun are bastions of right wing sanity to you , then i am very very sorry . 
  at least use telegraph or something , ffs . 
  everyone did , we are allies . 
  but again , i just do n't see sweden doing it when assange was running around uk free for a year before he exhausted his legal route and fled to the embassy . 
  he is essentially imprisoning himself without a trial , it is basically psychiatric now and i am not saying this maliciously . 
  depends on what you mean `` pro-israel content '' . 
  i am still relatively sympathetic towards israel while having very strong opinions about its current government , for example . 
  that would be ideal , but both things are insanely more complicated and ambiguous than people think . 
  in case of syria , it would require a western military operation , for example . 
  after less than optimal situations like iraq , the west prefers to just take a lot of people instead . 
   killed this sub make a new one then or find a new one , for fucks sake . 
  i ca n't understand people clinging to places they supposedly hate , i have left many subs that i did n't find sensible . 
  it wo n't change with constant complaining . 
  directed by soros , do n't forget !, 
  he is not forced to live there , he is doing it to himself . 
  if he imagines sweden is that evil totalitarian state that will rendition him to cia - when uk , the closest ally of usa did not - then he needs mental health aid . 
  goddammit , you have opened my eyes . 
  sniping from the bushes is all that is left in those worthless immigrant clusterfucks . 
  i do n't mind people having different opinions but the utterly echo chamber nature of those threads , with dozens of dudes patting each other smugly on their backs for having been supposedly right about everything since 10 ad is disgusting . 
  you sure think you perfectly understand it all , do n't you . 
  logic !, 
  the actual polish military is controlled by the most anti-russian politician in existence . 
  he can make it give a shit , instead of giving out guns to amateurs . 
  that 's not the point . 
  the point is that perhaps we should n't automatically take what terrorists say as truth just because it fits our fears . 
  hahahaha, 
  i like how the most outspoken about the evils of non-homogenous societies are eastern europeans . 
  one would think it would be the western ones who would be louder , if it is indeed such a horror . 
  i wonder if not being anywhere near the actual issues makes the perception different , hmm ? 
  they also said they will conquer half of the world . 
  so i prefer when relevant agencies check it instead of just accepting daesh propaganda . 
  the real thing in the ukrainian conflict was the contested regions actually having ethnic russian/russian speaking populace . 
  without it , it is everyone against the invaders and that 's just not fun for anyone . 
  that is why baltics are afraid and we are n't . 
   all major political parties are scared of russia would n't say any party is scared . 
  the ruling party hates russia , others are wary and distrustful , but no one is genuinely afraid . 
  that 's nice . 
  how about doing it using the actual military , though ? 
  calm down , you voted , you got it , i do n't care . 
  your establishment does n't seem like it is in a hurry , though , but that 's your problem . 
  eh , there is that , but you get all kinds of demographics . 
  bigotry is high also in the western europe and in usa nowadays . 
  it is a bit different , though . 
  brexit had a long-expected vote and even now they do n't feel like actually doing it . 
  no one will kick turkey out of nato without a serious deterioration and even erdogan would be truly mad to do it from his side . 
  i would n't care about what subs `` think '' , especially large ones, 
  believe what you want to believe . 
  the west might not like erdogan , but it does n't mean they prefer more chaos , instability and major destruction of democracy that a coup entails . 
  even erdogan still clings to its vestiges so he is preferable for the time being . 
   in addition , the turkish army is large and relatively modern . 
  we 'd rather have them on our side than on the russian 's side . 
  it is nice to have them harmless , but it is not like they would actually pose a threat either . 
  at worst they will just fuck more of their poor neighbors . 
  what media ? 
  do you mean internet commenters , perhaps ? 
   he did n't like the response he is getting from the west after coup . 
  the west was against the coup . 
  what it did n't like was erdogan arresting or firing thousands of judges and teachers and mumbling about death penalty . 
  even if they actually created an alliance , what are they going to do ? 
  bully some hopeless eurasian republic together ? 
  i do n't get it why no one there used google translate on their phone . 
  it has mandarin and it works like a science fiction translator device at times . 
  and no one had google translate on their phone ? 
  it has mandarin , ffs . 
  yeah , machine translation , but it can communicate simple ideas very well . 
  it even speaks what you translate , how can you not use it . 
  this is an outrage ... ooooh , that tasty bread again !, 
  the majority of police in the west is at least decent , even in usa . 
  it is all a question of that few percent who are bad or stupid and how spectacular their misdeeds or mistakes are . 
  do you envisage a scenario where a russian fleet militarily threatens france or italy and it does not get escalated to a whole nato involvement ? 
  do you think nato would allow russians to use conventional military force against western europe ? 
  if that 's the case , then nato does not actually exist anyway . 
  did n't know but that 's entirely unsurprising . 
  so , sweden is doomed , amrite ? 
  sure it is a lot of damage but it would require essentially threatening a world war . 
  for that , we already have enough nukes to destroy all life . 
  what more threat does a carrier bring ? 
  but is n't it mostly psychological ? 
  what can a russian fleet do in med to nato countries ? 
  and subs go as they please anyway . 
  sure sure, 
  i like insults , they make it easy for me to just not commit any further effort !, 
  have a nice productive and healthy life, 
   there is very little about any country 's military that is actually public knowledge . 
  positions , bases , strength , equipment during peace time are mostly easily accessible . 
  details , especially electronic , are not . 
  regardless , a structure like nato at least ought not be reliant on secrecy . 
  yes , geopolitics are a board game to many .

  that 's why right-wingers dislike them and like last elections showed , there 's a lot of right-wingers around here . 
  it 's of course deeper than just that , you could probably write a pretty fucking long book about polish-jewish relationship . 
  same, 
  why not . 
  i really like british culture and sense of humour and i believe many share that sentiment ( book of childhood - potter , favourite show - top gear  . 
  the only rare unpleasant experiences were honestly just regular online slurs towards poles . 
  not worthless , just not mine . 
  i 'd personally have way less trouble raising someone else 's child that was already there when i met the woman . 
  i could n't live with a cheater though and not my kid is honestly not my problem . 
  xd this gov is actually unreal . 
  in case that was n't clear , i was joking , i do n't have anything against him ( although i do n't really like his art at all ) . 
  they should 've tbh , i do n't like his song . 
  we 're going full austria this year , sending a guy that kinda looks and behaves like a woman . 
  they 're actually fucked up . 
  yes , insult your biggest ally when you actively `` beg '' for it 's help at the same time . 
  that 's just absolutely retarded . 
  they 're antagonizing us with everybody , this wo n't end well . 
  i remember hosting a couple of canadians some years ago and the only thing that surprised them about poland was that everything was really clean ( not sure if i agree , though , from my experience other countries are very similar in that regard ) . 
  outside of air , the biggest problem are still people that do n't clean up after their dogs . 
  french for sure . 
  for slavic languages - i kinda liked hearing croatian , but i do n't even know why . 
  yeah , same . 
  always look for british comments in this sort of threads . 
  best banter . 
  probably legia fans . 
  many football fans , including me , dislike volleyball or ski-jumping fans as well , cause they 're as casual and plastic as it can get . 
  our transformation was n't peaceful because we are so fucking smart , intelligent , non-violent people . 
  it was peaceful because commies had knowledge and documents that could ruin political careers of many that took their place . 
  that 's the reality . 
  i mean ... potatoes are great . 
  what can we do . 
  we are . 
  could you show any example ? 
  i 'm afraid we would n't be able to do shit if we get caught off guard . 
  we will help baltics if something happens ( as much as we can , we wo n't suicide ) . 
  the question is , will others ? 
  i know . 
  i got really triggered multiple times seeing people over the internet that said `` we should just give ee to russia , fuck them , we wo n't fight '' . 
  or when corbyn said that expanding nato was a mistake . 
  no it fuckin was n't you nonce . 
  it really shows how different some western countries look at russia . 
  anyway , all i said previously is that defending baltics will be really tough if not simply impossible . 
  enemy can cut it ( moving from belarus ) if we do n't manage to take the kaliningrad oblast quickly . 
  honestly , defending baltics is potentially a really , really tough challenge . 
  wtf, 
  it 's probably not worse . 
  as far as i remember ( it was a pretty heated topic over here ) , caracals were the only offer that met pretty much every requirement . 
  and like yarpen_z says , with sikorsky/lockheed we would have to buy weapons in a separate deal . 
  they certainly need to be updated . 
  as far as i know we 're doing something about it . 
  number-wise probably . 
  but it needs really huge reforms , not even investments to become legit strong . 
  russians would wipe us easily now ( they would have trouble establishing control , partisan movement would be huge but they would definitely win first part of the war ) . 
  it 's good if you are strong yourself . 
  bad if you 're weaker then your neighbours . 
  yeah . 
  to be fair to him , po government became way more vocal about military spending and active in that area after this clown fiesta in ukraine started . 
  before they just went with the flow created by previous govs. 
  should uprisings count though ? 
  that we are not ready yet . 
  no , it is not ridiculous . 
  you 're not supposed to stop following certain discipline because `` your '' teams are bad . 
  if you like the sport , you like the sport , that 's it . 
  part of the `` benefits '' deal ? 
  every at least decently developed country has or will encounter the exact same issue . 
  communities that treat women equally to men and are based around individualism , self-development , making carees etc. 
  that 's the way it is . 
  there 's no good solution , really . 
  i do n't buy this `` too high costs of living argument '' . 
  they 're way lower in poland and people with `` western-like '' salaries are n't exactly making kids at bunnies rate . 
  it 's obviously wrong claim . 
  they 're just economic migrants , many probably pushed by war there but definitely not eligible for gaining a refugee status . 
  saying that - many people that are coming to europe right now are also not authentic refugees ( i know there 's a lot of real too , do n't spit on me ) . 
  i think that 's why some people thought this claim will convince eu we ca n't really take more . 
  not really . 
  we 're not on western eu level but western eu ( mostly germany ) is making sure this whole thing will be our problem too . 
  we 're too poor as well . 
  1 ) they 're too weak . 
  2 ) they have their own traumas , lessons , whatever you wan na call it , too . 
  3 ) empires work different now . 
  i 'm pretty sure if those countries were strong enough , they would n't mind becoming what usa is today geopolitically . 
  your recent past is preventing you from being openly power hungry . 
  i think it 's a fact . 
  but do n't get me wrong , if it did n't - i do n't think you would go full nazi or anything like that . 
  like with empires - establishing control over areas works different now . 
  your post is . 
  it 's logical that post wwii trauma prevents you from going full retard again . 
  not being able to defend your country , does n't mean you 're not worth of owning it ( lost war ! = mismanaged country ) . 
  and yes , certainly , eu and nato are the guarantees of poland 's safety . 
  what i basically meant was - their position was strong in europe way prior to wwi or wwii . 
  back then , they actually were more abusive , manipulatory , self-interested and power-hungry . 
  wwii trauma keeps them in check now . 
  you can believe in fairy tales and some fundamental change - i do n't . 
  i 'd say it 's mostly their still quite recent past that prevents them from being openly power-hungry . 
  well , she pretty much chose only the comments that suited her agenda . 
   implying that germany are not the most important country in eu and our most important neighbour in almost any way . 
  it 's not a fixation . 
  they 're just important . 
  and they were obviously a major topic here before pis came to power , people criticized tusk and civic platform for their unconditional love for merkel and germany . 
  it is and always will be unacceptable here .

  warsaw will become one hell of a city . 
  and look how much the city has changed since it was completely destroyed during the war : https://c5.staticflickr.com/9/8776/28887185476_75ca95af8e_o.jpg, 
  yeah but who included it as an option in the first place, 
  `` what is the biggest issue you , a young european , are facing ? '', 
  well the salaries are higher in warsaw than in the rest of poland . 
  they have a mountain in a mountain ?!, 
  shocking . 
  because they do not want variety . 
  they want more socialism . 
  if they advocated for the removal of the state marriage institution i 'd be walking with them . 
  oh i 'd love to , but sadly your socialist buddies are forcing me to pay . 
  what are charities for ? 
  if i currently am forced to pay 60 % of my income to the government , i would absolutely give 10 % to chariities which i can trust . 
  it is cheaper to fund the nurses and doctors than to fund the entire ministry of health ( or whatever it is called in the uk ) plus the doctors and nurses . 
  also they do n't face any competition . 
  `` basis of collective responsibility '' aha . 
  you can have your collective responsibility together with your socialist friends , forcing people to pay for it is nothing else than thievery . 
  `` mostly '' makes a giant difference . 
  of course it would , what 's wrong with making profit ? 
  how is it ridiculous ? 
  you keep saying this stuff without even trying to back it up . 
  how is it more ridiculous to you than the fact that the government forces one person to pay for the other ? 
  and do n't even bring up the us healthcare system , it has nothing to do with private healthcare . 
  oh , and right now the government is making money from ... everyone . 
  because ? 
  what is your problem ? 
  of course the nhs should be private . 
  all healthcare should be private , that 's obvious . 
  it is only attractive for the politicians, 
  yeah , of course , right wing voters are uneducated human failures , we all know that . 
  leftists on the other hand are great intellectuals who will progress humanity into a new era of happiness . 
  if it offers subsidies , it 's not capitalist . 
  rich fuckers :(, 
  thing is - they already failed to ensure that . 
  their current government is just as corrupt as the previous one . 
  to be honest , i have absolutely no vision for this country 's future as one state . 
  it is too large and diverse , while having no real historical background to back it up . 
  out of lack of heroes , the western part is taking pride in bandera while the east does n't feel any connection to this country at all . 
  both are equally bad . 
  i 'm sorry to have to say this , but because of that , combined with the absolutely awful economic situation , it will just have to break into at least two smaller countries . 
  hopefully this will go like with czechoslovakia though , not yugoslavia . 
  funny how the poeple , including me , who correctly predicted that it would result in a complete mess , were downvoted to hell on this sub back in 2014 , called russian bots and so on . 
  neither was it ukrainian . 
  no man , i am quite leftist socially myself and i still think so . 
  on the other hand you have got many right wingers who believe the opposite . 
  there are too many perspectives from which one can see this issue to classify it as left or right . 
  am polish , please send help , i am currently hiding from the government ... 
  i need someone to snuggle me though the border to the beautiful land of freedom and democracy that is germany . 
   edit : my flair : still norwegian , ca n't change that . 
  just like 50 years in japan will never make me japanese . 
  so true . 
  be careful , you ca n't say such things or you will be executed !, 
  do n't you know about the pis regime ?!, 
  the pope is safe , it 's about the pilgrims . 
  i generally am not at all scared of the attacks , the chance of dying in one is minimal , but all that changes when you visit such event . 
  yeah but if an accident would happen in poland , right wing group support would skyrocket, 
  the . 
  i 'm talking about real people though , not their political beliefs . 
  they really are good people . 
  seriously ? 
  turks are good people but erdogan is radicalizing them . 
  he needs to be removed from power first . 
  i 'd like to have lviv within our borders again though . 
  just because of how historically significant it is . 
  but it 's more of `` i find it sad we 've lost it '' than `` let 's take it back '' . 
  ukraine , however , is making demands to some polish cities , like przemysl . 
  and those who killed innocent people should be executed . 
  thing is - these were exceptions , they were n't following orders from the top . 
  the ak was the largest resistance movement in europe . 
  but every army has bad people . 
  was witold pilecki evil ? 
  upa , on the other hand , had clear orders to do an ethnic cleansing , right from the top . 
  this was an organized action . 
  look at the ak 's achievements and tell me whether they are worth remembering or not . 
  how many ? 
  the ak was an underground anti nazi and anti soviet military organization . 
  comparing pilsudski to stalin ? 
  and no , i am by no means a supporter one of his supporters , he created a state not much different from the people 's republic . 
  butthurted ? 
  dude . 
  that 's like a german saying jews are `` butthurt '' about the holocaust . 
  what kind of person one has to be to be able to say such things is beyond me . 
  ukrainians caused it themselves . 
  they called upa national heroes and recently renamed one of the main streets in kiev to bandera prospekt . 
  they base their nationalism not on achievements but on not being poles or russians . 
  they decided to go down this path and are now starting to face the consequences . 
  not even slightly surprising . 
  [ seriously , they gave these people guns ] ( http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-6qxnso6fbus/vhcodfzciai/aaaaaaaaye8/28i1snymntm/s1600/oyspocyhtb0.jpg ) [ a movie about the massacre is coming out soon , it will make even more people aware of what happened during this forgotten genocide . 
  here 's the trailer . 
  this is a new level of being shameless . 
  dude basically says it 's all russian fault . 
  nothing like pushing the fault for a genocide on another nation , eh ? 
  i 'm going to have to ask him because i do n't remember . 
  seriously , reading this i have been listening to the ziggy stardust song, 
  a short story from my grandfather who survived the massacre in volhynia . 
  it was still early after the genocide started , people did n't know what to expect from the ukrainians . 
  my grandfather lived in a medium sized village near przebraze ( the defense of which , where my grand-grandfather actually participated , is today a very famous event in poland ) . 
  anyway , it 's important to remember that not all ukrainians were evil . 
  the poles in that village have been warned that the upa was preparing an attack after the sunset by some friendly ukrainian family . 
  all poles fled into the forests where they hid .

   anglo-saxons for christs sake , just like us germans til germans are anglosaxons, 
  sadly this sub has become really bitter about the uk . 
  shame . 
  you can see the patronizing attitude all over the place towards the brits . 
   well the koran is pretty much against the jews . 
  actually you 're wrong .

  nice dog, 
  ukraine is not getting in until , at best , the late 2030s, 
  i know . 
  but in russian it sounds like \u015b so it 's just as invalid by your logic, 
   fact is that serbians do n't want to enter eu https://europeanwesternbalkans.com/2017/02/06/47-of-citizens-support-serbian-membership-to-the-eu/ it shows that * yes * has a plurality and almost 50 % so i 'm not sure i can agree with your statement, 
  it 's like st in question, 
   ok , now i 'm confused . 
  is n't that exactly what pawel said was wrong about the map ... ? 
  it 's correct but inconsistent, 
  and bulgarians, 
   serbia has started at least 3 wars in the last 25 years and has sent 2 army convoys to neighbouring countries the last 5 years . 
  does serbia have any ongoing wars ? 
  that 's what matters also ukraine is huge . 
  that 's one reason why no one really wants them in the union of the old members . 
   serbia is much worse in this regard i think your neighborhood bias is showing through edit : why the downvotes ? 
   but because they tend to be extremely close to the eu 's greatest foe russia . 
  you 're overestimating the influence . 
  it 's mostly symbolic . 
  actually it 's the eu that supports current state of serbia - being a semi-autoritarian corrupt country , for being pro-eu on paper, 
  60 degrees of amplitude . 
  i never thought about it this way . 
  that 's funny , because before 1920 gdynia was an irrelevant village, 
  nothing like a religious statue in the middle of fucking nowhere, 
  at least brussels is its own part of belgian federation , separate from flanders and wallonia . 
  the same ca n't be said for strasbourg . 
  if the eu ever manages to federalize , at least brusselles could become its own subdivision - the capital, 
   also , the strasbourg one is making conspiracy theorists go mad because of the tower of babel reference how is that a conspiracy theory ? 
  it legit looks like it . 
   wwi was not about remaking europe at all what ? 
  what was the [ mitteleuropa ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mitteleuropa#the_prussian_mitteleuropa_plan ) plan ? 
  if tht 's not remaking europe then i do n't know what is . 
   neither belarus , nor ukraine did n't have nation states during interwar . 
  wrong, 
  i just noticed that finland has a very convienient shape for weather forecast, 
  do lithuanians learn about the witold/jagie \u0142\u0142o conflict ?

  because it was contested area and its fate was a result of two wars this was n't exactly the case with core poland, 
  not necessairly - i would n't consider the former congress kingdom area to be conquered by poles for example, 
  what is this , suwalszczyzna ? 
  indeed , it 's a medieval borrowing, 
  that does n't change that it was conquered, 
  the eastern territories got under polish control due to wars with neighbors there , you could call that conquest,

  no it fucking was n't . 
  no `` communist '' country has ever called itself communist . 
  and of course north korea is democratic and republican ? 
  as we know official propaganda is always accurate with reality - it 's not like those countries were miserable because they were totalitarian dictatorships . 
  why ca n't people realize the economic system that was n't implemented there and was mostly used to maim people . 
  let 's look at the definition  ideology and movement whose ultimate goal is the establishment of a socioeconomic order structured upon the common ownership of the means of production and the absence of social classes , money and the state . 
  show me a soviet aligned country that did this . 
  before anyone calls me out : no , i 'm not a fan of communism . 
  but that does n't mean that i have to believe such lies and inaccuracies . 
   case in point : greece and turkey barely manage to not have a war , nato be damned . 
   `` barely manage '' but do they have it ? 
  that 's what matters . 
   and show me two countries that , before wwi had anything remotely resembling the coal and steel union . 
  [ latin monetary union ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/latin_monetary_union ),

   this is false . 
  soviet union was far more ambitious .

  there was no counter force that had major effect in collapse of yugoslavia . 
  it collapsed due to internal struggle . 
  only places in the state of war are the ones outside nato .

  joining nato = increasing chances of a new war ?????

  why do you live in poland ? 
  holy shit he even labaled the eu flag,

  soviets were pretty clearly the lesser evil . 
  the reason why you all did n't all get genocided was because the german occupation lasted just a few years and germany lost the war .

  welcome to extremism where logic is thrown out of the window, 
   parties like pis are shitty for homosexuals and non-catholic/religious people not really . 
  there 's no special benefits for being catholic or problems if you are not . 
  ( unless you get offended by things like cross hanging in the parlament ) . 
  we are talking about european country , not some kind of islamic theocracy . 
  even with pis in charge we are below level of religious rediculness that happens in us . 
  also i would like to add i 'm anti-pis and on liberal side of worldview , but i do n't like when people overdemonise/overprise and strawman the shit out of one side, 
   i disagree on your points you disagree with facts ? 
   i still ca n't see why a very conservative party will be the light of europe , which was my main point . 
  not that very conservative , but may be for eu standards . 
  as long as conservative party makes reasonable decisions ( still waiting for pis to make some ) it can be possitive . 
  there 's nothing inharetly bad with being conservative ( unless you mean extreme form of it ), 
  there 's no wanting of banning of immigration , but calling for following the law in reasonable way  the first one i said it because your comment about multiculturalism , nothing else a lie though there 's no controling the press , but change of control model over state owned channels the homosexuality promotion is limited to gov money and part about catholicsm is pretty true . 
  pretty big - first two ones are straight out lies, 
  a `` cleaning job ''  i guess it went over some heads : `` to clean '' can have two meanings : ( 1 ) normal one : to remove the dirt from something and ( 2 ) to assasinate/kill . 
  polan is steorotypically known for people emigrating to clean toilets . 
  swaping the meaning you got the sittuation from article , hence the joke - polan still goes west for cleaning jobs , but now it 's different kind of cleaning . 
   if poland wants to ban immigration , control the press and ban `` homosexuality promotion '' and focus on catholicism big strawman , but whatever, 
  hurr durr polan defending sweden , 
  and by `` european values '' they literally meant `` overzealous political correctness and homogender multiculti '', 
  some obviously , especially the church of kaczy\u0144ski followers , 
   or the corrupt police in poland and the rest of eastern europe does n't bother to investigate this part still counts as reported though . 
  difference in reporting crimes may be a thing , but then again - anecdotal experiences of people coming from germany or netherlands are really worrying compared to what was ~ 10-15 years ago, 
  does gov need to implement this in some fixed timeframe or is it just an expensive poll ?

   also , where do you want to get fuel from ? 
  im in no way an expert on this , i was just pointing out that even though we may `` still remember chernobyl panic '' , our attitudes are changing and the majority of poles support nuclear power . 
  pathetic ... 
  why ? 
   they are directly helping you and hungary with their money , and you two are the most anti-eu countries right now , like seriously , what the fuck . 
  they are not helping out of the goodness of their heart , its a mutually beneficial deal , there is nothing free in business and politics . 
  i dont know the stats for hungary off the top of my head , but poland is one of the most pro-eu countries . 
  however , that does not mean we can not criticize it . 
  honestly , i hate this kind of attitude - you are getting money , sit quiet and do everything we tell you to . 
  not really , the support for nuclear power is increasing in poland . 
  iirc there was a poll this year that showed 61 % want a nuclear power plant to be built in poland . 
  while you are right that legally its not valid , it still shows the massive support against migrant quotas . 
  i really dont like these types of boycotts , even though its the `` smart '' thing to do , it seems wrong ( cheating the system ) . 
  i dont think there is any point in starting the guessing game - how many boycotted , etc. 
  the facts are hungarians were asked and 95 % were against quotas - simple . 
  we had a similar referendum boycott when donald tusk was still in power in poland , he straight up told people not to take part in a referendum about getting rid of warsaw 's president ( who was from his party ) . 
  the issue with `` 1 '' is that ** officially ** the vast majority of people from ukraine arent refugees , since they can get a visa much easier/faster than asylum status in poland . 
  `` 2 '' is problematic . 
  for example polish ngos brought over some syrian christian families that left for germany in the first week . 
  i think poland should find other ways of helping italy/greece , be it financial , personnel or other aid . 
  edit : formatting - just me being dumb with reddit, 
   but the whole idea of the regulation is to redistribute them , not caring about the country they applied for asylum at first or where they want to go . 
  but the fact is , they are not applying for asylum in poland , with or without the program . 
   why is that idea so wrong for you ? 
  is n't it actually a good idea that they are shared equally , depending on how well a country is doing and how many people life there ? 
  thats a very open question and a proper response would be too long ( sorry , i just cant be bothered to go over this for the 100th time ) , so ill just say there are many reasons and factors that make me think this idea is bad . 
  i know that sounds like a cop out , but as i said - i just cant keep discussing this over and over again , its too complex of a thing to just answer in a couple sentences . 
  the problem is when the eu gets to decide which rules have to be followed and which dont , who has to follow the rules and who doesnt . 
  lets not pretend everyone is treated equally and everyone who broke a rule was punished ( consequences ) . 
   that 's the excuse i always hear . 
  nonetheless there are more applications in even poorer countries then poland . 
  so i do n't buy that excuse . 
  like which countries ? 
  also , what excuse ? 
  are we supposed to round them up , bring them to poland and force them to apply for asylum ? 
   they even completely denied to try it . 
  i can understand why they are pissed off . 
  not really true , poland and hungary didnt refuse from the start , czech republic even took in a couple ( iirc 12 ) . 
  but im glad you can admit it isnt fair and subjective . 
  for example slovakia took in 16 but thats not a problem for the eu . 
   so do n't let it look like an accident , please . 
  poland even told us the reason why there are no refugees themself : its not an accident , its mainly about social benefits which poland has very low compared to germany/sweden . 
  that link is a reason why poland doesnt want to take in migrants , that is not why they dont want to come to poland . 
  there is a big difference . 
   if i 'm right those 47 are btw . 
  christian syrians . 
  no clue . 
  although a polish ngo did bring over a couple syrian christian families that after about a week ran away to germany . 
  again , you ignoring what i said and trying to switch topics how evil poland is , just proves my point ( since you cant refute it ) . 
  did you even read your sources ? 
  first link shows that they do not want asylum in countries like poland . 
  if you dont know why , i will give you a hint - social benefits . 
  second link shows that 47 from syria ( again , they dont want asylum here ) applied in poland and there was only 1 rejection . 
  wow , we are so `` unwilling '' that we refused 1 applicant - the horror !, 
  not really . 
  this of course is only my opinion , not something that can be checked/proved , but i dont see how this could play any meaningful role in eu country 's reluctance . 
  since the beginning the whole process has been slow going , criticized by many ( not only v4 ) , lacked public support , etc. 
  if its around 15 % complete now , what do you think it would have been , if countries like poland didnt out right refuse the quotas and only took a couple refugees ? 
  im guessing : maybe 1 % , maybe 2 % tops . 
  even if it was a little higher than that , its still a very subjective criteria to use for punishing these countries . 
   it was negotiated and agreed upon but now some countries will not follow the agreement . 
  some ? 
  so far only about 15 % migrants have been resettled in this programme and there are only a couple months left in this 2 year deal . 
  all most every eu country hasnt followed the agreement ( not taken in the areed amount ) , lets not pretend its only these 3 evil countries . 
  i know , but that is a subjective criteria . 
  it is not fair , because nothing like that was specified , who gets to decide this is a good enough reason for punishment ? 
  there are countless different criteria you could use . 
  you ignoring the whole point that this punishment is completely subjective and isnt about fulfilling agreements , just proves that it is not fair . 
  and ? 
  motivations dont matter in legal deals . 
  you either fulfill an agreement or you dont , there is no middle ground . 
  it would be fair and clear if it was about the migrant quota deal - you take in the assigned amount - good , you dont - bad ( punishment ) . 
  in this case its neither fair or clear , because who gets to decide what is ok and what isnt . 
  if poland didnt out right disagree with this deal and only took in 1 refugee would that be ok ? 
  what about 10 ? 
  that is not specified anywhere in the deal . 
  but its not , why are only these 3 countries being singled out , when almost everyone hasnt kept their side of the deal ? 
  thats the thing , its not about the migrant quota agreement . 
  if it was , then every country that hasnt kept their side of the deal , would be punished . 
  instead we only have 3 countries being singled out , for some unclear reason . 
  legal deals dont work that way , you either fulfill them or you dont , there is no middle ground . 
  remember that almost every eu country hasnt fulfilled what they agreed to . 
  most likely they wont either , since only about 15 % migrants have been resettled so far and this 2 year deal ends in september . 
  how is it fair , that only a couple countries will be punished for not fulfilling an agreement , when almost all eu countries havent ( and most likely wont ) fulfill it either ? 
  so now we are the ones that created this international crisis ... gotcha . 
  to be exact , the change of mind was due to the change of governments . 
  that was one of the many reasons the old government lost in the elections . 
  hungary already had this referendum and iirc about 95 % said they didnt want these quotas . 
  the eu only cares about democracy when it suits them . 
  thats kind of my point . 
  so if poland didnt change their mind about the quotas and for whatever reason only took in 1 refugee , do you think we should be punished ? 
  probably . 
  how about 10 ? 
  that is very unclear and unspecific . 
  deals dont work that way . 
  i dont have a problem with consequences for not upholding your side of the deal , but treat everyone equally . 
  people who fulfilled the agreement - ok , people who didnt - not ok ( punish ) . 
  thats not what i meant . 
  according to you ( and the eu ) its `` ok '' if a country tries and fails to take in their agreed amount ( i remind you of the extremely low 15 % completion of this resettlement so far with only a couple months left ) . 
  so if poland should take in 6k , then how many would we have to take in , not to be punished ?

  kukiz , the guy who got 20.8 % and was third , is also right-wing , somewhere between po and pis , but that was not an important part of his campaign . 
  two remaining candidates were centrist . 
  they got 1.8 % together . 
  the left may have some chances in the parliamentary elections this autumn , but most polls predict between zero to few mps for them . 
  some at least do n't indulge in cocksucking . 
  i do n't know if this one does . 
  sld keeps being treated as one by media , but that 's probably only till november . 
  i heard opinions that it will be absorbed by po pretty soon . 
  note : 3.8 % ** added all together ** . 
  po -- likes merkel and juncker ; epp in the european parliament pis -- likes cameron and orban ; ecr in the european parliament, 
  because let 's be frank -- neither candidate was in favour of any of that . 
  i think po ( including komorowski ) are more pro-ukraine , while pis ( including duda ) are more anti-russia . 
  it was before 1932 , when the prussian , austrian and russian penal codes were still in effect . 
  i have never heard about anyone being prosecuted on that basis though . 
  you can take a detour over romania , but i do n't think nato would look at it too kindly . 
   do any danes vocally support russian separatists ? 
  i think it would be comparable only if a bunch of andorran soldiers went for `` vacation '' to barcelona . 
  * [ grammar ] * a ** word ** used to connect clauses or sentences or to coordinate words in the same clause ( e.g. , and , but , if ) .

  i 'll fill out the table in a moment, 
  of course they would n't . 
  difference between \u0442\u0448 and \u0447 : not sure it you 're asking about a difference between retroflex , palato-alveolar and alveo-palatal consonants ( t\u0282 vs t\u0283 vs t\u0255 ) , or about a difference between afficate consonants and combinations stop + sibilant ( t\u0283 vs t.\u0283 or t\u0282 vs t.\u0282 ) . 
  in the first case , it 's about tounge shape : for \u0282 it 's touching the alveolar ridge and flat , for \u0283 it 's touching the alveolar ridge and domed , for \u0255 it 's fully domed and touching the middle of the palate . 
  in the second it 's a bit more subtle , but polish luckily has a minimal pair : [ * trzy * ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f2/pl-trzy.ogg ) vs [ * czy * ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/32/pl-czy.ogg ) ( direct audio links ) . 
  lem me draw a table . 
  -- also , you can categorise languages based on the * sh * sounds they use : languages that use \u0283 : english , french , german , hungarian , slovene , czech , slovak , latvian , finnish , ukrainian languages that use \u0282 and \u0283 : lithuanian languages that use \u0282 and \u0255 : polish , russian , mandarin chinese languages that use \u0255 : japanese, 
  i do n't understand what is that `` tz '' sound you are speaking of . 
  unless you 're speaking german , but you are n't . 
  anyway , the letter * c * ( * \u0446 * in cyrillic ) in those languages stands for some variant of [ voiceless alveolar affricate ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/voiceless_alveolar_affricate ) , which does n't exist as a phoneme in english and is usually approximated by letters `` ts '' . 
  also , in english * [ tzar ] ( https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/tsar#english ) * can be also spelt * tsar * , * czar * or * csar * , and pronounced with / s / , / z / or / ts / sound . 
  the russian word is * \u0446\u0430\u0440\u044c * and english language can not handle this sound in the initial position . 
  most western systems of transliteration of cyrillic and japanese use * ts * for this sound . 
  probably shit comment, 
  i think macedonians can keep the name ( everyone knows what it 's referring to ) , but they should stop the whole chutzpa about alexander and the legacy of his empire . 
  the ancient macedonia just * happened * to be in the general area around skopje and thessaloniki , but that 's it -- those were different people , of different culture . 
  you ca n't claim to have everything in common with any random person that just happened to rent the same apartment you are currently renting . 
  the problem is that the same word : * lithuanian * is used both to refer to a member of the lithuanian nation and to a person who grew up in the area called lithuania . 
  let 's take mickiewicz for example : he was polish by etnicity , russian by citizenship , and lithuanian by the birthplace . 
  he considered lithuania a region within the sphere of polish culture . 
  in fact , if you check out `` pan tadeusz '' , multiple characters refer to various things/people being both polish and lithuanian -- but both of those words are used a bit differently , in different contexts . 
  i think the reason some belarussians want to claim the name * lithuanian * is because the last interesting thing that history books say of their ancestors is `` 14 century : got conquered by lithuanians '' . 
  a similar thing with irish : the ones from the north often call themselves british despite never setting their foot on britain .

  i just flipped the russian propaganda upside down and got something indistinguishable and from nazi point of view . 
  what russians must realise is that the soviet union and the third reich were more similar in their actions than they think . 
   renaming of streets except that most of those streets were actually renamed by communists . 
  most of them will get back their names they had before soviets . 
  nazi wehrmacht freed ukraine from soviet occupation . 
  the argument goes both ways . 
  read the article before trolling :  the legislation , which also targets nazi propaganda was adopted by 254 votes in favour in the 450-member parliament , or rada . 
   it bans all symbols and propaganda representing `` the totalitarian communist and nazi regimes '' -- from street names and flags , to monuments and plaques .

  on average , over 5 % of letters in polish texts are z 's . 
  it 's the 5th or 6th most common letter , beaten only by vowels aieo and maybe also by n . this is most likely the highest result for z among all the languages , beating even hungarian . 
  obviously , z is a 1-point tile in polish scrabble . 
  polish is the z-est . 
  maybe it 's not the prettiest , but compared to the ones bordering it ( german and french ) , it sounds really , really nice .

  if po went insane and wanted to nationalize banks or do sth like that - anybody oculd sue them before constutitional tribunal , and it sufficed if judges there voted 51 % against . 
  if pis do sth insane ( and with their anti-eu and anti-bankers rhetorhic it 's more probable at least in perception of foreign investors ) - constutitional tribunal has to vote 67 % against it to cancel it . 
  that 's not going to happen , so in effect - constitution does n't mean anything in poland right now . 
  ultimately it 's about market trust , and pis is actively decreasing it . 
  we have 27 years of continuous economic growth . 
  government term is 4 years , but in that 27 years we had 17 governments  only 1 government was reelected , and most did n't even lasted 4 years . 
  at this point 2-4 % growth is assumed by voters , and they vote based on other things . 
  poland is less religious and less homogenous now than 20 years ago , yet we are 4 times more safe .

  krak\u00f3w : 1791 -- 23 591 , 1910 -- 137 592 warszawa : 1792 -- 120 000 , 1914 -- 884 500 lw\u00f3w : 1772 - + -30,000 , 1910 - 206,100 wilno : around 20 000 in 1830 , i couldnt find better sources to compare , but it was slightly smaller than krak\u00f3w . 
  on the other hadn it had way better university . 
  in mickiewicz times wilno university were the best in the whole russian empire , and krak\u00f3w univeristy were nowhere close ( probably behind lw\u00f3w ) . 
  https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/uniwersytet_wile%c5%84ski#cesarski_uniwersytet_wile.c5.84ski austrians were cool with autonomy , and that allowed for some historians to deal with matters they could n't in other partitions , but the city was provincial for the most part of xixth century . 
  krak\u00f3w was the poor and backward part of austrian partition , when warszawa and wilno were the most advanced parts of russian partition , and lw\u00f3w was well developed city ( admitedly - like krak\u00f3w it was placed in the poorest part of austrian empire , but it won the competition with krak\u00f3w at the time , it only started changing after ww1 , and changed suddenly after ww2 for obvious reasons ) . 
  i do n't mean to depreciate krak\u00f3w - it was very important polish city in many periods ( before waza , after ww2 ) , but during partitions it just was n't that important . 
  oh , nice to know . 
  where i came from ( lublin/w \u0142odawa region ) jagody and bor\u00f3wki are used for different kinds of blueberries . 
  also my granparents showed me another kind of wild berries - blue elongated ones ( greenish inside ) , also edible , and they called them '' \u0142ochinie '' . 
  gathering mushrooms , berries is n't tradition , it 's a hobby ? 
  also a way for people to earn some money in the summer . 
  not that obviously . 
  during partitions krak\u00f3w was a provincial city for most of the time , and wilno/lw \u00f3w / warszawa were the main cultural cities . 
  it should be splitted into `` southern lesser poland '' and `` eastern lesser poland '' . 
  eastern lesser poland has some influences from russian/ukrianian , but small . 
  it 's mostly small changes in pronounciation of some sounds . 
  i 've been told people from lublin pronounce words like `` lublin '' ( with bli sounds and similar ) softer than people from the rest of poland . 
  i do n't hear it , but then i 'm from this area  on the other hand people from krak\u00f3w region has this weird way of accenting first syllabe instead of second last syllabe like the rest of poland . 
  and their word for `` outside '' is `` to field '' instead of `` to court '' like in the rest of poland . 
  it 's all mixed and borders are not strict , the map is simplification . 
  anyway , polish dialects are much less different from each other than english dialects . 
  i do n't know of any pair that makes it impossible for speakers to understand each other , and trainspotting proved i do n't speak scottish english , 
  there are accents but they are nothing like in english . 
  i think mostly because our spelling system makes sense , 
  it 's also how i feel about contemporary poland : / we 're just in earlier stage . 
  oh , right , i 've learnt english by reading so in my pronounciation they are n't , 
  in poland : branding anything `` communist '' is a political suicide because it basicaly means `` soviet '' and is synonymous with `` corrupt '' / `` totalitarian '' / `` oppressive '' / `` dysfunctional '' . 
  socialist = `` slightly less intense communist '' . 
  it 's funny , because solidarno\u015b\u0107 was a socialist movement  . 
  in the beggining it was a joint movement by all people that wanted to change government , most of them wanted to stop the oppression , some wanted capitalism ( mostly meaning - make it so we are as rich as western europe , damn the short term consequences ) . 
  after 1989 there was huge propaganda campaign of right-wing economy ( and it was nessesary imho to do the painful reforms , but it caused 25 years of right-wing propaganda with almost no mentioning anything else ) . 
  young generations of poles see everything that 's even slightly socialist as `` leftist '' and automaticaly evil and dumb . 
  there are exceptions but rare . 
  also - lots of people have blind spot for public education and healthcare ( they do n't acknowledge it 's socialist , so they still can complain about leftists ) . 
  some ( mostly young ) people do notice and want to privatize both . 
  it was n't only for germans , it was used for all non-slavic people at first . 
  in many polish cities there are districts called `` niemce '' ( old polish for niemcy ) and these were usually places where foreigners were settled by kings/city administrators , and not nessesarily germans - also people from scotland , france , netherland , etc. 
  later it become a name for people using german language , and later when most of their states formed united germany - it become a name for that country . 
  i thought the same , but people explained to me that czech language used same spelling as polish at some point ( `` cz '' `` sz '' etc ) , only later they changed to all these c ^ s ^ . 
  if politicians from a country know there 's no chance to win they may change their vote in exchange for some favor .

  right , i 've read parent comment more carefuly .

  if both women and men are more safe in country x than in country y , does it matter that women are much more safe than men in country x , when in country y both are equally unsafe ?

  old polish prover : `` where 's 2 poles there 's 3 opinions '', 
  you have to give it to kaczy\u0144ski - he read the needs of so far ignored parts of society well , and he manipulates them perfectly .

  i do n't see why would they stop out of sudden . 
   it is not that illogical to think `` something '' sentient and above these concepts wanted it . 
  no it 's not , it 's just not very helpful , because then you can ask `` who created that sentient sth '' .

  stop doing business with russia . 
  at all . 
   this resulted in many of these weapons coming up for sale illicitly . 
  surprisingly when western ukraine protested for months there were no armored cars , no artillery and even no same uniforms among the protesters . 
  even guns were extremally rare . 
  they build wooden catapult and used molotov coctails . 
  i wonder what makes the eastern ukraine so much better supplied with armored cars , anti-tank missiles , etc , than the capital city ? 
  and i wonder how do you explain somebody buying armored car and artillery with fuel , ammunition etc and waiting since nineties maintaining it perfectly and even painting it from time to time to use it now . 
  and that must have repeated a lot , because they have many of these . 
  besides using medium and long-range surface-to-air rockets , or shooting artillery with any precision whatsoever is n't a thing that a regular person can do . 
  you need military training in that particular domain . 
  seriosuly , just admit it 's russian-paid and supplied bandits . 
  with crimea putin finally did admit it , what 's different now ? 
  i meant the weapons they used to seize ukrainian aa installations and to fight with ukrainian army before . 
  you know - all these armored cars , artillery , machine guns , rpgs ? 
  you think they bought it in shop ? 
   so we ca n't even blame this on russia except for sending the separatists to ukraine , and giving them weapons and supplies in the first place you mean ? 
   or some of the separatists were sort of a `` sleeper cells '' that were trained by russian military that 's obvious for anybody with half a brain . 
  you do n't send tanks and artillery to amateurs . 
  you meant ignorance and not stupidity . 
  missiles are designed to be as fast and fast-turning as possible to be able to intercept faster and harder targets . 
  that means the mass must be reduced to minimum . 
  planes are usually lightly armored because the mass reduces their performance . 
  so putting a big warhead on surface-to-air missile is counterproductive - it 's better to put smaller warhead that shoots sharpnels around - it suffices to damage the plane . 
  the best modern sam systems attemp to do away with the warhead completely - they are faster and more precise and are meant to ram into the plane and destroy it just with the kinetic energy . 
  russia has cheap gas and eu politicians are assholes ( and the people who voted them too ) . 
  on the other hand when it was ukrainians killed on their teritory by separatists and ukrainian army fighting separatists it was ok for everybody in eu , and the sanctions were symbolic . 
  so continue to ignore this . 
  he thinks global warming is a conspiracy to get money out of countries . 
  he thinks everything is better privatized , no matter the economies of scale or the humanitarian disadvantages . 
  given his reforms people with `` bad genes '' or other statistical disadvantages would n't be able to get health insurance for example ( because who will force private companies to accept them ? 
  companies would only accept people with good health ) . 
  in fact healthcare system is one of these things that work the best with private-public cooperation , and the reforms of korwin would be decline in quality of life and in efficiency of polish healthcare ( yes , it 's possible - 3rd world countries for example have system very similar to what korwin is proposing and somehow they live shorter than we do ) . 
  he thinks export is irrelevant and only import matters for economy . 
  he thinks only amount of money matter in economy and not the speed with which it is transferred ( dumb , the speed matters much more than the amount of money - that 's why taxes sometimes has positive effect on economy despite taking some of the money from people ) . 
  he 's just hobby-economist without much knowledge about the subject . 
  people without economic education like the fact that his simple solutions are understandable , but they wo n't work . 
   wan na be able to start your own business without getting fucked over by our tax system actually poland has one of the lower taxes on companies , especially on the small ones . 
  of course not as low as tax heavens , but for eu standards it 's low . 
  and if mikke did everything he wanted to in poland you would need to pay more just for private security company and private health insurance than you pay in taxes for everything . 
   there 's more stupid people than smart ones http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/people_are_stupid.png, 
  to be honest if you count in usd we had small recession in 2009 . 
  but instead of lower salaries and defaulting all over the place our currency just devalued against eur and usd . 
  actually i do n't care about karma . 
  i do it for fun . 
  eu is many things , but it is n't an anti-russian organisation . 
  you 're thinking of nato . 
  russians of course think everything that is n't russia is anti-russian . 
  like paranoics they know for sure that the rain was sent by their enemies to worsen their mood , and the people talking quietly behind the corner were surely speaking about them . 
  having different friends = acting against russia . 
  this is called destructive relationship . 
   `` we should use precision weapons , like israel , to destroy those who fired [ into russia ] , '' bushmin was quoted . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bm-21_grad  the system has lower precision than classical artillery and can not be used in situations that call for pinpoint precision . 
  it relies on a large number of shells dissipating over an area for a certain hit rate on specific targets . 
  nonetheless , because of the short warning time for the impact of the whole volley , the bm-21 is still considered a fearsome weapon today . 
  you have to be very naive to think troops in crimea ( and eastern ukraine ) were n't sent by putin . 
  so i think you just pretend to believe that . 
  you have to be very cynic to compare peacekeeping missions with what putin is doing . 
  it 's the exact opposite . 
  but i 'm sure you can rationalize all of that somehow . 
  human mind is great at this . 
  yes , i abuse my right as a human being to say what i think about others actions . 
  on the other hand putin god given right is to send soldiers to kill people in other countries because he do n't like their choices . 
  west is acting stupid and right now russia is doing both ( trading and cooperating , and invasions and civil wars ) . 
  putin is very consistent - always invades countries during biggest sporting events - georgia during summer olympic games , ukrainian crimea during winter ones , the rest of the ukraine during the finals of the world cup ... eu will do nothing , france will still sell russia the ships , half of the eu ( poland included ) will still buy russian gas and oil , germans will still want to have partnership with russia and nato will send harsh words and do nothing more . 
  russians will send weapons and new `` patriots '' to kill people in ukraine and say it was all ukrainians fault anyway . 
  this wo n't be an regular invasion ( because there 's no need for it now ) , but ukraine wo n't be allowed to develop like a normal country . 
  cynism of eu governments makes me sick . 
  in polish dubbing of `` the madagascar '' cartoon king julian ( the lemur or sth like that ) was speaking about `` cz\u0142owieki '' instead of `` ludzie '' to make him sound weird and funny . 
  in polish it 's 1 cz\u0142owiek , 2 and more ludzi . 
  do you also have the same distinction for 3 and bigger numbers like in polish ( one case for non-personal-masculine ) and another for personal-masculine ) ? 
  in polish the numbers change depending on gender and `` personality '' of the noun they count . 
  1 = jedno ( for neutral nouns like apple ) , jeden ( for masculine nouns like car , dog , soldier , boy ) , jedna ( for feminine nouns like river , girl ) 2 = dwa ( for non-personal-masculine nouns like apples , cars , dogs ) , dw\u00f3ch ( for personal-masculine nouns like soldiers , boys , etc ) , dwie ( for feminine nouns like rivers , girls ) 3 = trzy ( for non-personal-masculine and feminine nouns like apples , rivers , cars , dogs , girls ) , trzech ( for personal-masculine nouns like soldiers , boys , etc ) for bigger numbers the only special version is for personal-masculinem like for 3 . 
  so in polish big group of males ( like army for example ) have special grammatical form . 
  these versions also have different version of each verbs , so in polish one word like `` rozmawia\u0142y '' describes both action ( to talk ) , the tense ( past ) , plurality and the object ( group of females ) . 
  for present tense it would be `` rozmawiaj\u0105 '' and for males it would be `` rozmawiali '' . 
  you ca n't form one present tense sentence in polish without telling people which gender you are . 
  ... also the nouns change depending on the numbers - there are 3 versions of each noun depending on the number , and the rules are kinda weird : 1 apple = 1 jab\u0142ko 2,3,4 apples = 2,3,4 jab\u0142ka 5-21 apples = 5-21 jab\u0142ek 22-24 apples = 22-24 jab\u0142ka 25-31 apples = 25-31 jab\u0142ek 32-34 apples = 32-34 jab\u0142ka ... 
  this means almost all foreign programs translated into polish have the numerals wrong in the messages ( `` you have copied x file ( s ) '' would be in polish `` skopiowa\u0142e\u015b x plik ( i ) ( \u00f3w ) '' using the above rules , and for female users it should be `` skopiowa\u0142a\u015b ... '' ) . 
  just do what coservatives alawys do in such case - call the progress decadence . 
  i 'm more concerned about real-life exterme believers phenomenon . 
  you need to specify granularity , otherways every bandit in his dark alley is an indepenent state . 
  in polish ch\u0142odnica is `` cooler '' , and freezer is `` zamra\u017carka '' . 
   this is only my personal opinion , but when georgia started shelling ossetian towns , i feel an international reaction was justified . 
  do you feel the same towards ukrainian army for fighting separatists in slaviansk , donieck etc ? 
  the situation ( and russian actions ) are very similair . 
  georgia is just further from eu , and their president was too quick to react ( ukrainians learnt that and only reacted after media campaign and a long delay , so nobody thought it was their fault - the cost for that was lives ) . 
   you make good on your word , period except when it 's not profitable . 
  like preserving borders of some country that gave up nukes for that . 
  overreacting ? 
  you criticized rfe and i said it was important for many people living in totalitarian countries . 
   propaganda is propaganda is propaganda . 
  nazi publicizing katyn massacre done by soviets was propaganda . 
  it was also truth . 
  russians responding to them that it was germans who did it was also propaganda . 
  but it was false . 
  not all propaganda is equal . 
  if you lived for a few years in a communist poland you could appreciate radio free europe . 
  also you probably would n't equate western and russian propaganda . 
  people like you were called `` usefull idiots '' by communists .

  like if black people were meant to serve . 
  like those idiots were right making black people their slaves back then . 
  calling someone `` murzyn '' is n't racist but using `` murzy\u0144sko\u015b\u0107 '' as `` submissiveness '' ( because blacks were slaves back then ) is rude . 
  i 'm listening to the montenegro 's anthem for the first time and must say it sounds great !, 
  by mazurek d\u0105browskiego * d\u0105browski was a general , not a composer, 
  and polish `` no '' means yes, 
  * in march like in a pot . 
  * april mingler because it mingles , some of winter , some of summer . 
  i would n't translate `` murzyn '' to `` negro '' because the first is neutral and the second is pejorative . 
  i thought portuguese sounded mostly like spanish . 
  but then i played some portuguese videos and it 's really different !, 
  also i can hear some similarity with polish because of how much `` sh '' they say . 
  that 's so weird . 
  i guess it 's a very popular destination for people from all over the world . 
  i heard many times that french are very proud of their language . 
  but to that extent . . 
  really ? 
  there are no english descriptions in louvre ? 
  la marseillaise is pretty brutal . 
  i meant that as vilnius and lviv were once polish , they 're not anymore , just like wroc\u0142aw is not german anymore . 
  i did n't know austria would be willing . 
  the borders in europe were changed many times . 
  it does n't matter what nation ruled a city back then . 
  wroc\u0142aw is now polish , just like vilnius is lithuanian and lviv is ukrainian . 
  it 's not really popular . 
  you can see how many viewers the videos have . 
  comparing to , say , pop music , it 's a huge difference . 
  however i think that another band - [ percival ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srard1nce30&amp;list=plx6xhes_em-ddtdt8vbzd2qlqbs3c6tin ) - became more popular because of the witcher 3 . 
  the band provided music for the game . 
  i guess some gamers ( prolly most of them are young ) got interested in the music and listened to other percival 's songs too . 
  edit : also it 's worth mentioning that percival performs songs from different slavic countries . 
  and the witcher 3 is popular world-wide so it 's not only polish viewers . 
  they have [ four ] ( http://rokiczanka.pl/en/wideo/#/fwdmspplayer0?catid=0&amp;trackid=0 ) . 
  it 's not many but you may get to like other bands too : * [ kapela ze wsi warszawa ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhqmrtbq9tk&amp;list=pl5a18f130f70f443e&amp;index=24 ) * [ janusz prusinowski trio ] ( http://www.januszprusinowskitrio.pl/intro.php ) - it 's their website , you can play there some music and there is an option to download when you right click on the player * [ kapela oldnova ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgdr5y_haqu ), 
  * [ pie\u015b\u0144 woj\u00f3w ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rquo3popn9y ) * [ lipka ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isuxzc9dugo ) * [ w moim ogr\u00f3decku ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hp4endjmu1e ), 
  the first song somehow reminded me of ievan polkka but when i compared , it turned out to be quite different . 
  aww sounds mysterious . 
  i like that , 
  sounds like a combination of venom and enema . 
  pola means fields in polish . 
  is poola somehow related to this meaning ? 
  well , there are some discussions in polish tv too but it would be nice to have more official debates like this one in sweden and denmark . 
  however as far as i know , swedish tv is pretty restrictive when it comes to opinions opposed to the far-left . 
  that 's the effect of [ this way ] ( https://youtu.be/arjjmqdruui?t=46m24s ) of thinking . 
  when i heard about him the first time , i just thought he was a weird funny guy . 
  now i dislike him more and more . 
  another excuse to impose more control over the society . . 
  maybe they are just pretty open for changes ? 
  it 's not just polish mentality . 
  it happens in many other places all over the world . 
  in the time of polish-lithuanian commonwealth , the definition of republic was different . 
  that 's why it was called rzeczpospolita . 
  no , the word `` rzeczpospolita '' is a synonym of `` republika '' ( republic ) , both originated from latin `` res publica '' . 
  polish-lithuanian commonwealth can be also called rzeczpospolita but it 's just a short name for rzeczpospolita obojga narod\u00f3w . 
  also nowadays , our country 's full name is rzeczpospolita polska and it 's simply republic of poland . 
  it does n't mean commonwealth . 
  commonwealth is a different thing . 
  no , `` rzeczpospolita '' means `` republic '' . 
  i guess most people here do n't feel such a connection but we have some bands and festivals . 
  it just does n't seem really popular . 
  personally i really like folk music . 
  if you 'd like to listen to something polish , you may check these out : * kapela ze wsi warszawa : [ musia\u0142a\u015b ty dziewce ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmak4ds_ule ) , [ \u017burawie ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhqmrtbq9tk ) * kapela oldnova : [ oj chmielu ] ( https://youtu.be/tgdr5y_haqu?t=6s ) * percival : [ oj dido ( album ) ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aje_fzbb2so&amp;index=2&amp;list=pl3c86d37db2339a90 ) , by the way percival 's music was used in the witcher * rokiczanka : [ lipka ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isuxzc9dugo ) , [ w moim ogr\u00f3decku ] ( https://youtu.be/hp4endjmu1e?t=25s ) , [ to i hola ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujnz_cpidh0 ), 
  really ? 
  japanese or other swedes would be pretty disgusted i guess . 
  / r/videosofcities, 
  it 's a very nice souvenir . 
  i 'd call that `` france & italy '' tho , or maybe i 'm missing other countries ? 
  i do n't like this eagle , looks like a hen . 
  btw funny that you can see pkin in the background . 
  guess embassies are another thing . 
  anybody care to explain portugal and austria ? 
  so much money lost on another church . . like if there would n't be enough of them . 
  let alone it 's ugly . 
  i know but germany is usually considered western europe . 
  i 'm wondering why he considers germany and austria as in central europe ( another video ) but poland , czech rep. and slovakia are in eastern europe for him . 
  but while reading you lose focus on image . 
  listening vs reading skills in a foreign language is another thing . 
  using translation makes me uneducated ? 
  you can hear subdued voices of the actors . 
  anyway i understand someone may hate voice-overs , it 's a matter of preference . 
  of course you can but your eyes have to work more . 
  you need to keep up with both text and image . 
  here only movies for children are dubbed so the actual choice is subtitles or voice-over . 
  and sometimes i do n't feel like reading and watching at the same time so i choose voice-over . 
  i like a voice-over much more than a bad dubbing . 
  well , for emotions and passion they leave subdued voice of the actors . 
   movies on dvd/blue ray are either one of the two kinds of dubbing or subtitles . 
   movies online ( either streaming or piracy ) are almost universally subtitles . 
  there are also versions with voice-over . 
  single voice is not dubbing . 
  anyway the point of a voice-over is that you do n't have to read subtitles . 
  simple as that . 
  it 's something you can get used to . 
  in dubbing some voices may be annoying and not fit the characters . 
  when you have a voice-over you usually already know that voice and you do n't associate it with any characters . 
  it simply makes it easier to watch a movie because you do n't need to focus on subtitles . 
  illegal means prohibited by law . 
  if it was followed or not is another thing . 
  by the way , how do you know no one was ever punished by that law ? 
  even if no one was punished , homosexuality was illegal and that 's what i meant .

  not at all , poland as a country is a nation of those who * stayed at home * . 
  you might be confused with polish diaspora . 
  one does not become the most powerful and influential politician in a country by being an idiot . 
   what about the 3448 poles that requested asylum in germany in 1991 ? 
  or the 4212 that requested asylum in 1992 ? 
  or the 1670 in 1993 ? 
  i hope they were all told to go fuck themselves , because that was the only reasonable reaction to their request . 
  well , iran * was * the first safe country for them , as they came from soviet union . 
  harsh for latvia indeed . 
  the state-owned provider of mandatory social insurance will collapse spectacularly long before our retirement anyway , and if you want to receive medical treatment in a reasonable timeframe , your best option is a private hospital , thus most people are essentially paying twice for their healthcare . 
  watching how bad our team got this year was almost painful . 
  perhaps with kruczek gone now we 'll be back in the lead next season . 
  anyhow , congrats for pero , he was really unlucky last year by losing the world cup by 0 points , and beating allmost all possible world cup records this season ( other than some exotic ones like the percentage of wins in a season , ma\u0142ysz 's 2000/2001 remains unbeaten here ) is an amazing feat . 
   we 're on top of you , maybe from your point of view . 
  [ from * our * perspective , you surely look like one of those bunch of countries to the east of us . 
  ] ( http://www.geografia24.eu/geo120_mapa_polski/2003/org/pl_administracyjna_kolor.jpg ) the fact that you are between russia and belarus certainly do n't help that either . 
  we had higher gdp per capita than you both in the 90s , and after 2008 . 
  no , going by the current polls over twice the support of the second party , and getting more than half of the seats in parliament would be a landslide - and the fact that half of the electorate do n't even bother to vote is irrelevant to it being a landslide electoral victory . 
  on the contrary really , as for many months before the election it was ( and still is ) completely obvious which party is on the lead right now , and by * not voting * they only demonstrate that they clearly have nothing in particular * against * them ruling . 
  as for the `` 19 % '' meme - it 's not like it 's fundamentally different from barrack `` 28 % '' obama , david `` 24 % '' cameron or angela `` 23 % '' merkel . 
   serious question , is there a possibility for a vote of no confidence in government in polish law ? 
  there is such possibility - but only if there is a positive majority for a prospective successor . 
  the parliament can also vote to shorten its term . 
  either way , considering that the ruling party has a stable majority in parliament , both options would seem purely theoretical . 
  in fact , it would n't benefit the opposition even if it somehow happened , as according to the polls if an early election were called right now , the current ruling party would win by an even bigger landslide than it did back in october . 
   en '' \u0119 '' is not `` en '' , we distinguish between those two in both orthography and pronunciation . 
  polish already is instantly perfectly readable , no ambiguity , in the script we 've been using since we started to write down our language . 
  `` because my religion of progressivism says so '' is not an argument to begin with either . 
  and i am yet to see any other arguments in favour . 
  yet that 's all you did in the thread leading to this post . 
  i think you are under some wrongful assumption that the post-1968 new left values somehow have a monopoly on using the name `` european \u2122 '' . 
  `` there are no arguments for x , and an argument y against x does n't count as an argument '' . 
  great template , very useful for easily dismissing absolutely everything . 
  bonus feature : works exactly as good for both sides of the argument . 
   there are more and better arguments for one side than the other though . 
  that 's what anyone would say about * his own * values as well . 
   obama was supported by 61 % of the voters . 
  out of 558 people who actually , you know , vote in the us . 
  believe or not , but the members of the electoral college are also being chosen in elections . 
  countrywide , only 28 % of american voters voted for the electors supporting obama . 
  anyhow , your post was a prime / r/iamverysmart material , mate . 
   why do you compare the weird electoral college system truth be told , i did n't - usa was simply the first country i thought of back when i was writing that post . 
  my point was - countries ruled by parties supported by majority of * eligible * voters are extremely uncommon - in fact such situation is practically impossible unless it 's a country ruled by a very broad coallition , or with a very high turnout . 
   but of course it 's the `` lefty media '' who are manipulating . 
  the strawman you attempt to fight here is so big , it would be visible from the moon with the naked eye . 
   why would poland allow it ? 
  the government ruling at the time got so used to bending over to everyone , they did so out of habit in this case as well . 
  i simply do n't see any point in bringing up `` le 19 % ackchually '' every time this is discussed . 
  it 's a completely random and irrelevant trivia - i mean , have you ever seen anyone claiming that `` but only 28 % of american voters supported him guys ! '', 
  under an article about something obama says ? 
  nobody else does that , yet for some reason one seemingly ca n't have a post about poland here without obligatory mention of this meme . 
   laughable ? 
  hmmm laughable because you say so yes , laughable . 
  continuing the same way of thinking , one could argue that `` why bother about constitution , after all only 22 % of voters voted for it '' . 
  and even our eu accession was supported by mere 44 % of voters , why should their will prevail over the remaining 56 % ? 
   but only 17 % of voters i could have sworn this percentage is getting smaller and smaller each time i see this argumentation . 
   it 's not like the eu pays alot of money to east europe and the economy is growing in the east . 
  the economy was growing before we joined the eu as well . 
  actually , one could argue it even was growing [ faster ] ( http://www.bankier.pl/i/n/201312/ftddgix8ited_1c8e7608.png ) back then . 
  not at all . 
   i do n't think you understand how the pension system works . 
  no , i am quite sure it is you who do n't understand it . 
  in current form it 's pretty much a ponzi scheme however one looks at it , and the only way to keep it from imminent collapse in the future will be massive transfers from the central budget . 
   was commonwealth a democracy ? 
  perhaps in some very broad sense of this word , as the public rights were not universal . 
  noble republic ( `` our state is a republic under the presidency of the king '' ) would be a more suitable term . 
  i was discussing this in context of this  ( see that i do n't say country as most of the time they were part of a larger empire ) untrue claim , and not whether or not there was a `` democracy '' , and for how long . 
  we do n't ? 
   we have been peaceful neighbors for seventy years and they are our greatest economic and cultural ( oui oui oui , we have a public french-german tv channel ! ), 
  partner . 
  that 's only because you * won * - as in the end it is france to whom alsace belongs . 
  meanwhile , germany got so btfo by the rest of the world , that they kinda gave up on everything as they had no other option anyway . 
   they gained their independence from russia . 
  we actually regained our independence from * germany and austria * , and from that established base we expanded on russian-held areas of poland as well . 
   y as most of the time they were part of a larger empire well , out of all the `` time we were part of a larger empire '' , most of it was * our own * empire ( namely commonwealth ) , so we got that going for us . 
  that 's very intetesting , because support for . n in polls * peaked * in late december , and is slowly declining ever since . 
  [ check it out . 
  not really , because the action of `` ordering the arrest of the government '' is simply not among the possible actions this particular court is eligible to make . 
  it would be regarded as legally void at best , and as a coup attempt at worst . 
   president should have the power to dissolve parliament only under certain conditions , none of which are present right now . 
   i suppose the court could order the arrest of the government the court would openly exceed its competence this way , which would be a * valid * reason for the government to accuse it of a coup attempt . 
   pis actually hires people to spam comments on polish sites \\  implying they are the only ones to do so, 
   4 out of 6 polling companies show a drop , with the `` average of recent polls '' being 4 % lower than the october election results . 
  yes , as i have already wrote they indeed show a drop - a drop back in * november * . 
  ever since then , their polling * was * steady - more so , according to averages of several polling companies they even `` regained '' some support by now . 
   are you willing to bet it wo n't decline further , especially given their economic and fiscal policies ? 
  if despite all the negative propaganda efforts during the last few months someone kept supporting pis until * now * , even if at some point in the future he ultimately ceased to support them , it 's extremely unlikely that it would result in shifting this support to either . n or po afterwards - parties like korwin or kukiz would be much more likely to gain voters this way . 
   in fact , it 's already happening as most polls indicate . 
  [ not really , you can check the trends here . 
  ] ( http://ewybory.eu/sondaze/ ) a slight drop in november aside , support of pis remains relatively stable , while the support for opposition declines slowly - . n peaked around the end of december , while po continues downward spiral ever since they lost the presidential election last spring . 
   i was n't actually a big pis supporter . 
  i just regarded them to be the lesser evil compared to po in the last elections . 
   but the constant shittalking from german and eu politicians made me actually defend pis . 
  same for me . 
  you are right , everyone not outraged theatrically by even the most mundane things the government does gets downvoted to oblivion on / r/polska . 
   i would n't be surprised if somewhere along the way they will find a bullshit way to reconcile with both pis electorate and kaczy\u0144ski himself having a genuine and , at least in kaczy\u0144ski 's case , personal hatred of russia ? 
  i would n't bet my money on it . 
   polish-lithuanian commonwealth was n't really a significant military power it was , until mid 17th century . 
   the young , ambitious , intelligent people have gone all over europe , and the ones left are voting in the current regime ? 
  actually , the polish emigrants across the eu voted last year [ overwhelmingly in favour of the current pis government , or even more right-wing parties like kukiz '15 or korwin .

  real poles ( tm ) probably : / in next elections . 
  you 're doing it wrong . 
  the protection is from nazi fascist bandits . 
  inspired by evil cia , eu , jews and gays of course . 
  why ? 
  they started ww2 together . 
  who decides what exactly the understanding is ? 
  because it sure was stupid from ukrainians to give up nuclear weapons for a treaty that they understood gave them nothing . 
  regardin action - i think cancelling all investments in russia and stoping trade with them untill they back their army will be a good start . 
  their economy is 25 % export , usa + eu is over 50 % of that export and over 75 % of all foreign investments in russia . 
  if you want to be that technical , then nato treaty does n't require defence of c&ee too :  the parties agree that an armed attack against one or more of them in europe or north america shall be considered an attack against them all and consequently they agree that , if such an armed attack occurs , each of them , in exercise of the right of individual or collective self-defence recognised by article 51 of the charter of the united nations , will assist the party or parties so attacked by taking forthwith , individually and in concert with the other parties , such action as it deems necessary , including the use of armed force , to restore and maintain the security of the north atlantic area . 
  for example latvia is n't anywhere near north atlantic area , so its security does n't have to be restored according to this article , if you want to be dick about it , and if russia ever tries to attack it . 
  and it would suffice to technicaly fulfill 5th article obligations to `` take actions that it deems nessessary '' , which does n't actually mean anything ( usa may as well deem nessesary to tell latvia `` i 'm sorry '' , and cancel one meeting with russia ) . 
  do you really want to send a message to all the world that usa will interprete such texts literally ? 
  uk and france literally fulfilled their obligations in september 1939 by joining war against germany , but in fact they waited on their territory while poland was invaded , and only when hitler invaded france they started real fighting . 
  that 's the difference between technicaly and really fulfilling obligations . 
  do n't make same errors that started ww2 . 
  if russians liberate you expect 50 years of occupation . 
  dumb or paid for ? 
  i would prefer it takes place in moscow or somewhere east of our borders : /, 
  so we will help reclaim . 
  if not we will be a country without allies on the border of new ussr . 
  i still doubt it will come to that , i think situation will be solved in ukraine without war , and that russia will ultimately lose on this whole warmongering . 
  but if not nato needs to be united , especially c&ee members . 
  we will . 
  if not we will be next . . 
  yup , it 's funny how some people believed propaganda . 
  during cold war communists called them useful idiots . 
  i thought you wanted to know how ukraine is different than kosovo . 
  that 's how . 
  no need to get butthurt . 
  regarding russia surviving it - it would but putin wo n't be ruling it . 
   so only superpowers have the right to project their interests ? 
  and if russia is not a superpower anymore , why does n't the us intervene - like it promised to do so in the budapest accord ? 
  but only the superpowers can do it and survive . 
  usa wo n't use power caus it does n't have to . 
  economic sanctions will suffice . 
   i do n't see the relevance of this ? 
  ethnic cleansing is as good reason for foreign powers to intervene and give the minorities in your country independence as you can get . 
  ukraine have n't done this . 
  it 's different cause russia is n't superpower anymore and it acts like it is . 
  this will end the moment west stops paying for this shit . 
  also - you know - there were no ethnic cleansings in ukraine recently unlike in some other countries . 
  apart from being putin muppets , you mean ? 
  what 's easier to blow - pipelines or ships ? 
  anyway at that point we 're speaking freaking ww3 . 
  you have to have the money first . 
  poland will finish liquid gas terminal in \u015awinouj\u015bcie this year . 
  and we can send gas to czech republic if they need it . 
  baltic states have it worse , though . 
  i do n't know about other countries but poland has reserves for a month or so . 
  and the winter is ending . 
  and there are other sources of gas , and in the worst case you just pause production in a few chemical factories and you use 2/3rd gas less . 
  in the meantime russia has no money to pay for war , and has to build pipelines to china to survive . 
  germany had almost the whole army in poland . 
  their reserves was ending . 
  germany would n't be able to attack uk and france in 1939 even if it wanted to . 
  i think he meant waiting for half a year without actually moving the troops inside germany [ 1 ] , at which point germany had enough resources to conquer the whole continent . 
  if france and uk invaded germany early in september 39 there would be no ww2 , ussr would n't join the party in 17th september 39 , there would be no holocaust , no pearl harbour , no hiroshima or nagasaki . 
  but in the short term it was beter to wait , i 'm sure . 
  [ 1 ] one small raid stopped by a minefield does n't count , sorry . 
  i suggested not giving money to putin . 
  that there will be rebelions is just potential consequence of putin not having money . 
  and putin knows that and knows that he would n't rule russia for much longer in that case . 
  if eu had the balls to do that this whole clusterfuck would n't happen . 
  on the other hand appeasing putin will lead to bloodshed , and on much worse conditions for eu too . 
  i do n't want russia to be enemy . 
  i want it to be stable democratic state that does n't send army to neighbors . 
  if they want empire back it means problems in future . 
  they need to understand they ca n't do empire anymore . 
  listen to the duma talks - it 's like last 23 years never happened . 
  and i especially does n't want bloodshed . 
  that 's why i want trade sanctions and not war with russia . 
  my thoughs exactly . 
  let putin taste revolution on his ground . 
  russian gdp comes 25 % from exports . 
  halving it means 12.5 % smaller gdp just from that . 
  they have separatists republics paid to behave ( chechenia for example ) . 
  no money = terrorists and rebellions there . 
  they have big minorities too . 
  the whole deal with putin ruling russia was `` less freedom but order and stability '' . 
  if stability stops , foreign companies escapes and money ends - he would have majdan in moscow next month . 
  putin : `` i call a war on ukrainian government '' . 
  why are we still financing them ? 
  without eu money russia would default . 
  less dependence on russian fossil fuels ? 
  usa gas exports are rising . 
  poland is finishing liquid gas terminal in \u015awinouj\u015bcie this year so we can import gas from anybody , and building interconnections with czech republic so we can send them gas if they need it . 
  gazprom is also selling less recently : http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/gazprom-gas-giant-is-running-into-trouble-a-881024.html russians must hurry if they want to use their exports in blackmail . 
  that 's because government income ! = gdp . 
  and yes - 12.5 % less of gdp is huge . 
  it 's actually less according to that image ? 
  in 2007 it was 25 % of coal , 33 % of oil and 37 % of gas . 
  in 2010 it was 27 % of coal , 34 % of oil and 31 % of gas . 
  no exports to eu means 12.5 % less gdp for russia just from the exports . 
  no exports to russia means 1-2 % less gdp for eu . 
   eu will express also their concern , probably in a bit more angry way but they will not interfere since they import from russia most of the fossil fuel they need actually 32.6 % of oil and 37.8 % of gas . 
  it 's from 2007 so now it 's probably less . 
  still big of course . 
  russia is n't a great power anymore .

  i do n't and i never said that . 
  you 're confusing me with the other guy . 
  clearly , you do not even read the sources you 're pasting : `` only 10 percent of the nearly 30,000 known fish species have been evaluated for inclusion in the iucn red list of threatened species '' so , how the hell do you know how many fish ** species ** are endangered ? 
  why are n't you on wykop.pl anyway ? 
  it 's not about keeping ** markets ** profitable . 
  it 's about keeping fishermen content and employed . 
  which is wrong , because they 're not needed . 
  well , the jews in poland were also a native population . 
  they were polish citizens , too . 
  it 's not like they immigrated recently , or something . 
  my mother 's family comes from around a totally jewish town of 20,000 . 
  that was before the war . 
  after , the town was taken by poles . 
  sure , there were pogroms , and the jews were also kind of opressed in 1930s by right-wing freaks who had the power then . 
  there were also assholes who hid jews and extorted all they money because they had an advantage . 
  but history is convoluted and sometimes you end up with characters like this : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/leopold_socha this guy rescued several people and hid them in the sewers just because he wanted them to pay him . 
  but as the time progressed , the jews ran out of money , and this guy continued to help them even after all the money he previously extorted went dry . 
  the jews survived . 
  he died several days after the war end , hit by a soviet truck . 
  most [ righteous among the nations ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/righteous_among_the_nations ) were ( are ) poles . 
  it 's not like poles are a nation of saints , but they 're are n't all assholes , too . 
  like everywhere else . 
  it 's just because the conditions were so much more extreme than anywhere else in europe you get so many extreme cases . 
  well , do n't . 
  no one asks you to stop using german . 
  i 'd just like you to speak english as well , so we can communicate . 
  actually , it 's already done . 
  you 're absolutely right . 
  maybe uniformity in english does n't really mean what i think it meant . 
  i never really supported driving languages into extinction ( although , if it happens natuarally i do n't consider it a big loss , too ; we 're humans , we 're creating languages as we go , no need to cling to the ones we already have ) . 
  if i had any say in that matter , i 'd decide that everyone in the eu is required to learn english on par with whatever local community chooses as it 's primary language . 
  but that 's just me . 
  uniformity is the greatest friend progress can have . 
  is metric system boring ? 
  maybe so , but it helps a lot in trade . 
  would you rather return to the times when every town had it 's own scale ? 
  enjoy your arguments as you try to convince your customer that these are perfectly fine pounds of whatever do you sell . 
  i sometimes browse german groupon-like sites . 
  if poland had adapted euro i 'd have fairly easier time deciding if i want to buy a tablet from there . 
  also , no bank would rip me off on the exchange rate . 
  all things uniform help with cooperation and i recognize cooperation as the critical factor in civilized society . 
  while we should n't force anyone to use a language , if we are serious about all that `` europe united '' thing , we should promote an uniform type of communication . 
  and the time we 're living kind of suggests that english is the best candidate . 
  it does n't mean it in any way `` the best '' , btw ( omg , i bet i could translate `` you did '' in a sentence in 20 ways into polish , all having different meaning ) . 
  but it 's the standard and sometimes worse standard wins . 
  actually , people in poland kind of look down upon trade schoolers , too . 
  but doing so is also frowned upon :p . technikum attenders have it better but it 's no parent dream to have their child graduate from just that . 
  people attend those sometimes because they ca n't see themselves in the higher education ( feel that they 're `` too stupid '' or something ; not that finishing a bullshit degree requires intelligence , mind you ) , or they ca n't afford it . 
  going to a city ( warsaw especially ) and living there can get very expensive , even if you do n't pay a single zloty for tuition . 
  i have no idea how funding is distributed to schools in poland , but i doubt it is based on test scores . 
  the big idea that the schools are there to `` make everyone 's opportunities equal '' but it 's no secret that kids from rural areas have it worse . 
  mainly because of lack of choice . 
  in poland high school kids like to think of themselves as adults . 
  making `` childish pranks '' like that is more likely in secondary school , called `` gimnazjum '' . 
  and boy , that thing is tough , imagine several hundred 13 -16 yo kids doing their best to be cruel to each other . 
  but after that in high school ( `` liceum '' ) people are mostly relaxed and do n't want to cause trouble either for themselves or others . 
  it generates a bit of a gap when watching american high school movies : `` this girl has already developed tits , why is she acting like she 's 13 yo little bitch ? 
  '' , `` this guy has facial hair and he 's into bullying people because they do n't play sports ? 
  wtf '' . 
  the closest we have to american high school are `` technikum '' and trade schools . 
  it 's the same educational level , but some choose it over liceum as liceum does n't really teach you any marketable skills , it 's supposed to prepare you for university . 
  people who attend these schools are people who are n't probably going to get higher education , so most of the bad apples land there . 
  it 's still not as childish as something you see in american high school movies or something from op 's link . 
  well it should have . 
  i guess it whooshed over my head . 
  have an upvote , then . 
  umm , are you serious ? 
  what does that change ? 
  it was estabilished years ago , and only months after medvedev 's first nomination that this guy is only a `` benevolent face '' of the regime , serving to make a good pr for the russian government ( that is , putin ) . 
  he 's engaging in heartwarming political happenings and talks a lot about `` westernization '' and `` democratic standards '' while in fact he does n't ever bat an eye when they rig election or persecute opposition . 
  i am losing faith in humanity seeing that people actually fall for this bluff . 
  there 's no real border ... yet ? 
  if there 's no room but wall to the right , that means you 're the rightmost . 
  i 'd say that 's deep conservative . 
  it 's aimed at belarussian public . 
  the assumption is : people , who want independent belarus are belarussian and a significant majority of them speaks ( or understands ) belarussian . 
  also , belarussian indepentent tv should air programs in belarussian as opposed to regime russian tv . 
  the hidden assumption is ( i think ) , that they think that russian speaking belarussians are more keen on joining russian federation than the eu , so there 's little point in targeting them . 
  lol , how is this not ? 
  then what is ? 
  monarchism ? 
  i agree loudly !, 
  well if poland qualified for no-visa travel of it 's own , what would be the point of bargaining for this ? 
  we 're usa 's ally , we support them politically and militarily . 
  we want concessions and special treatment . 
  if we 're not getting them , what 's the point of being so dedicated ally ? 
  let 's go the french route , then . 
  moan , protest and oppose american foreign policy . 
  other important factor : 1 ) other countries on visa waiver program have higher denial rate than poland , 2 ) american-poles are a significant minority , especially illnois . 
  3 ) i 'm a fucking european , why should i pay for a visa to visit the colonies ? 
  well sure , we can always fight about stuff , but one thing i learned about germans is that they will remain germans and will get even more german if you keep them out of germany . 
  i have n't really cared about hitler nor did i care to keep germans out of germany in my life . 
  and as for the controversial anschlusses ... they 're not even remotely troublesome nor worth the trouble . 
  if people think germans will push more and more opressive demands ... let them . 
  nobody would accept any more demands . 
  i did n't see any other demands except for this one so far . 
  for what i know , they just do n't want germans to live in austria , france , czechoslovakia and poland . 
  is that such a huge thing to ask for ? 
  only a non-stylish person could have wrote that :p, 
  wood ?

   not enough working military planes available ca n't they fly on broomsticks ? 
  i want a fucking million dollars and i 'm restless . 
  pls gib . 
  because they do n't * really * believe it . 
  the ones that do are ones that blow themselves up . 
  i mean , it 's a really easy way to heaven compared to lifetime of devotion . 
  just make sure no archdukes are shot and it 'll all be fine . 
  while you ca n't really fence it off more border guard patrols would improve the situation . 
  obviously only if they are actually allowed to guard borders though . 
  when you really wish for `` remove bordergore '' causus belli . 
   both someone who earns minimal wage and someone who earns 10 000 euro pays the same income tax this is false . 
  you did n't write about same income tax rates , but same tax . 
  i 'm not sure i agree . 
  there are plenty of people who ca n't pass basic math matura . 
  for many students this will be easy , but there 's also plenty of kids that are mathematically in kindergarten . 
  what . 
  you pay taxes for anything above ~ 700 eur yearly . 
  i would hardly call being a vassal of ussr a victory . 
   germany lost ww2 , they do n't deserve it . 
  by that logic stalin won ww2 and deserved right to do what he wished with wilno . 
  so lw\u00f3w , tarnopol and nowogrod . 
  that 's almost as far east as mi\u0144sk . 
  should we give wroc\u0142aw back to germany ? 
  certainly not from ii rp . 
  what are you talking about , pre-partitions poland ? 
  are you the kind of `` lw\u00f3w nasz '' guy ? 
  poland was affected . 
  growth went from almost 7 % to close to 2.5 % . 
  i can be patriotic for poles in poland , not poles anywhere else . 
  pis did n't reign during 2008 , the global financial crisis , but instead during global bubble . 
  it 's easy to get growth this way . 
  ggg putin , uniting everyone west of them and east of odra . 
  they can come to poland if it 's such a big deal for them . 
  send wealths pls, 
  by friend 's boyfriend got punched in the face for walking during night . 
  if aggressive people want to fight , they will . 
  * a * trade deal . 
  not ttip . 
  i do n't know , the whole fucking point ? 
  leaks so far show it goes further than a mere trade agreement . 
  found the guy with elaborate arguments . 
  and her stance is opposite from everyone else who lived on the shitty side . 
  and the official reason was bullshit made to not get people too angry . 
  i 'm still waiting for the time when this law is used when somebody else than catholic is offended . 
  catholics are hellbent on insulting satan and nobody sued them yet . 
  fucking double standards . 
  english is a west germanic language . 
  just sayin . 
  we 're divided on many issues too though , so it would take some time to work out . 
  it 's worth a shot . 
  personal unions would make it so much easier to do . 
  goverment form does n't allow marriages though . 
  we 've got some historic ties too . 
  makes me kind of sad how usa treats us . 
  it 's wealth of feels , not monies . 
  polan can into pew-pew industry . 
  you can make classes of illegal activities rather broad with generic high/low social impact clauses . 
  polish criminal code is 125 a5 pages long . 
  i 'm pretty sure your precedent cases take a lot more paper , making them much more difficult for general public to understand . 
  it 's like with meat and slaughterhouses . 
  you can enjoy one without wanting to look at the other . 
  they lied so many times and got so many slaps on their wrists . 
  how long will this keep happening ? 
  in popular opinion there is n't a big difference between afghans and egyptians , so it 's natural people want a single phrase to describe them all . 
  you know , the place where all the sand , oil and turbans are . 
  what the fuck is wrong with being offended ? 
  being offended never killed anyone . 
  pedestrian rights are fine and all , but i wonder who will work on getting traffic jams flowing . 
  probably nobody and it 'll get even worse . 
  wroc\u0142aw is a fucking atrocity when it comes to traffic , i can get stuck in jams even when i finish work at 18:30 . 
  it 's all fine until one day you forget to put safety back on . 
  if we 're talking about thugs on the street i 'm pretty sure just waving gun around would be enough to scare them off . 
  1/3 of people are for them , they 've got plurality , but not majority of support . 
  it 's because the rest is so divided that such people get to govern . 
  taking a potshot in the dark : switzerland perhaps ? 
  in worst case there 's vatican . 
  ever heard of guerilla warfare ? 
  when you owe a bank a million dollars you 've got a problem , but when you owe a bank a billion dollar the bank has a problem . 
  that 's why they left . 
  you are putting too much thought into polandball memes . 
  they 're not that coherent and all of this is post-factum retcon . 
  this is just a pretext for establishing a new polish-chinese border . 
  that was just anchoring and shifting the overton window , so they can ban almost all abortion in future . 
  the `` see ? 
  we did n't ban all of it , we 're not that bad . '', 
  kind of thing . 
  i was thinking more of the mentally impaired ones . 
  they hope to get more members in the future that way . 
  depends on the field . 
  math and computer science holds reasonably well , the rest not so much . 
  `` ukraine in poland '' sounds like it 's about a new commonwealth . 
  i have no idea about this being a stereotype currently or not , but in soviet times it was like that . 
   do n't ( ... ) put religion above law that 's gon na cause some tensions between ukrainians and our government . 
  typically you do n't need to talk much , that 's true . 
  it 's when things get complicated you need to communicate clearly and then it 's really important . 
  it 's really a shame that they ca n't spend some time learning polish upfront ( and they do n't seem to have trouble learning it , it 's similar enough ) to get better jobs and help them integrate better . 
  a lot of those 17 % go towards uk citizens , so it 's not going to be that scary . 
  what 's important is trade difference before and after they leave . 
  it 's not going to be pleasant , but perhaps compared to uk blocking a lot of eu political efforts in the past it is for the best . 
  you need to look at political as well as economic needs of eu .

  frankly , i think it 's been enough time in the last 27 years to get off of the high horse and get informed , but that 's just me . 
  if you ask poles if they feel * western * , the answer is no . 
  if you tell them to choose between western and eastern europe , majority probably will choose east [ slavs , that side of the wall , we think of westerners as * them * , etc. ] . 
  but if you ask them what they are , they 'll tell you * central * . 
  we do n't have the * northern * part going for us like the baltic triplets do . 
  wrong side of the baltic , sorry . 
  wrong side of the alps to aspire for * south * like the balkans !, 
  our palmtrees are fake or potted , * duh * . 
  * central * is not to spite and be antagonistic , it just seems like the only * right * thing . 
  the fact that * still * current divide east/west stems from the soviet sphere of influence , makes people touchy on the subject . 
  you have here one wordy example !, 
  ;d btw . 
  i was both replying to you and to the guy below who asked what we consider ourselves , so it 's not an angry rant or somethnig . 
  i was just trying to show our point of view and just packed it all in one comment . 
  and * our * is of course divided into oblivion , because : `` where two poles , there three political parties , from which two are in coalition and one in crisis . '', 
  and that 's an old joke but when you think about it that perfectly illustrates that middle place when you have something in common with everyone around but then they 're not really * us * . 
  ( but by that definition we 're all special snowflakes , i guess ! ), 
  they 're not * too poor * , they 're * too cheap * !, 
  there 's a difference . 
  those really too poor of course exist but let 's not kid ourselves , that 's minority as for the reason ... 
  so we * do * have something in common ... after all these years . 
   it is , geography , politics and recent history only confirm that except geography does n't . 
  * no kuurwa !, 
  * which means : * well , of course !, 
   * in 1802 , napoleon added a polish legion of around 5,200 to the forces sent to saint-domingue to fight off the slave rebellion . 
  upon arrival , discovering that the slaves fought off their french masters for their freedom , many poles eventually joined the slaves against the french . 
  [ 2 ] the polish had a familiar situation back home , where they fought for their liberty against invading russia , prussia and austria that began in 1772 ; seeking to unite , some joined napoleon 's army ( of which part was sent to haiti ) . 
  [ 2 ] many polish soldiers admired their enemy and decided to turn on the french army and join the slaves , and participated in the haitian revolution of 1804 . 
  [ 5 ] the community partially descends from the 400 surviving polish legionnaries that either defected to the slaves or were taken prisoner . 
  [ 1 ] these poles were naturalised according to the new haitian constitution . 
  [ 1 ] dessalines called polish people `` the white negroes of europe '' , which was then regarded a great honour , as it meant brotherhood between poles and haitans . 
  many years later , papa doc reminded about this concept when referring to polish people . 
  [ 6 ] [ 7 ] for their loyalty and support for overthrowing the french , the poles acquired haitian citizenship after haiti gained its independence , and settled there to never return to poland . 
  to this day , many polish haitians still live in haiti and are of mixed racial origin , however some have blonde hair , light eyes , and other european features . 
  most settled in cazale , la vall\u00e9e-de-jacmel , fond-des-blancs , la baleine , port-salut and saint-jean-du-sud . 
  * [ wiki ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polish_haitians ), 
  meaning : nearly every average pole can afford it . 
  as in * common * . 
  if it helps , the first , and only , thing that i associate with moldova is wine . 
  aw , man , i was just fondly reminiscing the circlejerk where everybody from austria to lithuania claim they have the middle . 
  everybody in between and around , and belarus too !, 
  it did not break up , it got anschlussed by czechoslovakia , look !, 
  can we argue who 's in the middle already ? 
  to make this * our * thing is the best we could do about it . 
  and for some reason i find this fact very funny . 
  ah , the first thing i did this year !, 
  woke up just in time . 
  i have on my bucket list to be there just one time in person . 
  one day ... 
  i 'd say it 's completely up to us whether it is meaningless or not ... basic rules of the universe do n't change , hence the message does n't change . 
  it 's just that people do n't like obvious simple truths that require them to move and act . 
  hope you had a merry christmas there . 
  and happy new year !,

  i want more !, 
  is there more ? 
  people who come up with something like this are definitely my kind of people !,

  the other map with women told me i 'm most likely turkish , it got me thinking ... crazy govt ?

  checked .

   polish people from the demographic who uses the internet frequently happen to be right-wingers . 
  do n't be ridiculous . 
  i wholeheartedly agree with all you wrote here ; having said that , i ca n't afford to lose hope . 
  nope . 
  821 days 22 hours 28 minutes and 27 seconds till the next elections ... 
  only half . 
  i thought we 're smarter than that ... 
  but that 's common recently around here . 
  thanks germoney bros !, 
  also , do n't mind our current govt - they 're hell-bent on making everyone hate us . 
  we just need to wait them through ... 
  that was funny up until it stopped being funny and started looking like a real possibility . 
  now it 's just scary . 
  i just hope the eu wo n't kick us out . 
  thinking that they could save us from ourselves would probably be too much ... 
  i think jesus approves . 
  what / u/amekxone said and he announced that there will be extensive consultations with experts of all kinds and a thoroughly prepared , responsible reform that we deserve . 
  i think we 're in the clear here . 
  his speech was pretty damn decent . 
  that would work in poland . 
  we always do the opposite ... 
  they wo n't get 60 % . 
  that 's exactly 3/5 we were talking about the whole week . 
  not gon na happen . 
  by the way , they would n't dare right now . 
  they would need a 60 % majority to repel a veto . 
  they do n't have that . 
  he vetoed the two tied together bills that they tried to screw him over with . 
  that 's basically a * fuck you * to kaczy\u0144ski . 
  i 'd say this is grand .

  as predicted in news reports reporting ruble going down - investors move money to eu . 
  hence euro gets stronger . 
  and as long as there will be a real threat of sanctions against russia - both ruble and russian stock market will keep on loosing value . 
  o_o you can see eastern border of poland on that map ... ukraine = perfect country for farming . 
  point still stands . 
  tax evasion law ca n't work if all you have to do in order to evade it is to create a company branch on the other side of a border . 
  if luxemburg can find this hole now - how you expect corporations with money for countless lawyers be unable to do the same ? 
  i think we should get rid of veto right . 
  eventually . 
  for now make it 2-veto . 
  and eventually trash this garbage . 
  first partition of poland was very much a fault of implementing veto right for every parliament member . 
  total idiocy . 
  and one there is a need for one country to lead ? 
  this only makes eu harder to bare by other big and strong countries like uk or france . 
  yea , polish newspapers gave australia as an example , but i doubt politicians will even consider that . 
  in poland there 's some obscure and totally illogical tradition of dismissing laws from too distant or exotic countries simply on a basics that `` it wo n't work with polish mentality '' - regardless how much merit is in that . 
   i do n't think that national newspapers `` need to make the eu closer to brits '' . 
  ( ... ) eusceptic ( telegraph , times , sun , mail , express , spectator , private eye . . ) while some bits of the press are proeu ( guardian , independent , financial times , economist , new statesman , bbc , channel 4 ... ) . 
  these differences of opinion and approach are healthy in a democracy . 
  how can you make a decision on something you have no clue about ? 
  information is everything . 
  especially in making such an important and long-lasting decisions as joining or quitting eu . 
  that 's precisely why media need to inform people about eu - not just go into purely eusceptic or proeu points of view . 
  honest information is twice as valuable as a simple point of view . 
   just because it is your preference !, 
  it 's a fact in geological , geographical , demographical and even : political way . 
  preference got nothing to deal with that . 
  i think what he is saying is that there 's not enough of information available for general public . 
  yes , you can read through all 200 + articles on wikipedia covering structure of eu , it 's politics , programs , decision-making process , expenses , income , key figures , etc. 
  but that wo n't work for ... well : almost-everyone . 
  tv and national newspapers really need to make eu closer to brits - not just but informing what are the benefits and what are costs , but also by making brits feel as a part of europe ( eg . 
  stop using word `` europe '' as a reference to continental part of it - uk is just as much europe as france is ), 
   it has a whole load of factual information which needs to be interpreted to come to a good answer , seeing as a huge level of the debate is around economics and around specific laws being bad . 
  majority of people do n't have even a basic knowledge on economy or politics to understand any of these even if explained in most user-friendly way . 
  that 's a sad truth - when it comes to decisions that got very complex and long-lasting consequences `` crowd '' is unable to make truly logical choice based on deep examination of all the benefits and losses . 
  it 's much easier to operate with slogans ( `` we 'll loose sovereignty '' vs `` we 'll loose money '' ( or whatever is on the headlines today ) ) than educating people . 
   and yet the germans are still worried about `` hyperinflation '' . 
   fines for not following this regulation could be as high as $ 100 million or up to five percent of an enterprise 's annual turnover , whichever is larger . 
  i approve . 
   people must consent to having their personal data processed , and must be able to withdraw that consent as easily as they give it finally a way to truly delete your facebook account . 
  thank you eu . 
   again , a win for campaigners . 
  how about : a win for a people who like their privacy respected ? 
   people have the right to have their personal data erased ( with public interest exceptions , so journalists can probably rest easy ) . 
  ** this includes data passed on to third parties . 
  ** that will be very difficult to execute . 
  especially when there are companies specializing in resale of customer data . 
   people can object to being visibly profiled in a way that could discriminate against them on the basis of race , political beliefs , sexual orientation and so on , and the organizations processing their data must make sure this discrimination does n't occur . 
  well , good luck with that . 
  not gon na happen , sorry . 
  way too many ways to bypass that thing . 
  in general though for it companies in europe it does n't make any huge difference - many countries already have a laws in place that allow people to `` be forgotten '' from their systems . 
  it most certainly though will be a challenge for us-based companies and i 'm afraid many of these laws will be incompatible with foreign laws ( which sometimes force it companies to retain data with access to the local intelligence agencies upon request ) . 
   luxembourg has insisted for years it would support the proposed law only if non-eu banking hubs within europe , particularly switzerland , also sign up . 
  ca n't blame them . 
  this law is pointless otherwise . 
  truth is that we still do n't have laws adopted to regulate whole process , and there 's been some rather outrageous delays with that , so ... 
  i 'm glad to see some progress , but we 're still not there to ensure that companies involved in extraction got a clear way . 
  i guess sending them all back is unthinkable as well ? 
  especially if they 're brainwashed by russian propaganda 24/7 with no access to any independent media as russians carefully cut them off to ensure only one point of view - separatist - is allowed . 
  most certainly . 
  though this would have to be more like ... at least 1 % of population ( 74,000 ) to make a difference visible in country-wide statistics ... probably even higher than that , depending on the actual difference in amount of money pumped into economy by these people . 
  when germany takes leadership - people complain about it and accuse them of forming 4th reich or other shit . 
  when germany does n't take leadership - people complain about it and accuse them of collapsing the europe or other shit . 
  seriously - make up your mind journalists !, 
   it would exist the same way scotland or catalonia crisis exist . 
  sooner or later would go the same way . 
  last time we checked - in 2013 majority of crimean were happy with their current status and pro-russian party in crimean parliament got only 3 seats out of 100 in last elections ( yes , that 's the same party that currently got so-called * prime minister * ) . 
  imho there would be no crimean crisis just like there is no crisis in wales if you want to keep british analogy . 
   additionally it would be extremely likely that a couple hundred nukes would actually be stored in crimea , and by now in the hands of the separatists . 
  you seriously believe it ? 
  ca n't you see that who attacks and surrounds military bases are russian soldiers , not separatists ? 
  there 's not enough of them to capture even one base , not to mention several of them . 
  finally some eu-wide sanctions . 
  took a while , but never the less : good job . 
   it would be wrong for ukraine to hold onto crimea by way of nuclear weapons they would n't . 
  but russia also would n't so happily move into ukrainian territory knowing they they got significant nuclear potential . 
  so the whole `` crimean crisis '' would n't even exist to start with . 
  i linked to the whole discussion not to take out just one post out of context . 
  your post was just a beginning of the similar argumentation that was used here . 
  savannajeff very nicely debunked everything you said . 
   more democratic institutions   less burocracies , well done contradicting yourself . 
   more citizen initiative , no more legislation written by lobbyists citizen initiatives are very , very prone to lobbying and having a legislation written by lobbyists . 
   we need a european news outlet accessible by all europeans . 
  this . 
  in poland there 's basically no news coverage from eu at all . 
  if anything slips into media it 's something like dutch pedophiles , irish priests molesting kids or uk pm talking garbage about immigration . 
  and news from eu parliament ? 
  only when they introduce something that might negatively impact polish farmers . 
  totally ridiculous approach that got nothing to deal with honest information nor makes people * feel * that they are part of europe . 
  yea , you have slightly different link  that 's why . 
  case dismissed . 
  something you call `` pirate ideology '' actually got well known program , proper structure , and something to say . 
  this is just pile of bs . 
  crowd-sourced politics that are rational at the same time ? 
  what kind of paradox is that ? 
  double post . 
  original one : http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/206gog/vice_russian_roulette_the_invasion_of_ukraine/, 
  oh yea , guy is really great - shows stuff in a way where not only it 's interesting but also you start to care .

brutality , 
  i guess it is not lisbon itself but one of the surrounding `` towns '' like carcavelos , right ? 
  it is so pathetic of all this estonians who wants to be seen as scandinavian country so much . 
  would it change anything ? 
  anyway , deal with it , no one sees estonia as a part of scandinavian countries . 
  sink the ships , imprison the smugglers ? 
  of course i could ask what do you mean , since i did not say anything racistic/offensive , but i know what you mean . 
  nevertheless , i am a bit amazed since it is poland where the democration is endangered and freedom of speech/press is under attack . 
  but , it is poland where you can freely demonstrate , protest , write , etc. 
  since you are dutch i recommend you `` de oorlog '' - maar alleen de eerste aaflevering . 
  teh current tension between left and right are really similiar to this present before iiww . 
  unfortunatelly , our politics are blind and do not learn form the past . 
  it is horrible . 
  how you will explain a pensioner that he had to work his whole live for this 100-200 euro and someone will get it for nothing . 
  how you will explain a young spaniar that he has to live with parents ( i took spain as an example due to a high unemployement ) while someone will get a priority to social house and some money ? 
  what you will say to this millions of poles who had to emigrate to western states to be able to live on its own , to go for a holiday etc ? 
  while someone in their country will get more than their parents with 20 years work experience ? 
  support migrants : yes , but not in europe where the cost of living are really high !, 
  we can help them in me and african countries !, 
  and stop this arrising tension between our european countries and right/left believers . 
  http://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2013/dec/03/pisa-results-country-best-reading-maths-science but still we score higher than belgium , germany , austria etc. 
  ehh , jakubmarian.com such a realiable source . 
  gon na make a website too , make some interesting graph and call it polish people have the highest iq amoung other european nations . 
  btw , where are you from ? 
  i am gon na lover your score a bit . 
  law of war . 
  this one is horribly true . 
  you are a small person , please leave the union already . 
  poland is a part of the eu , and the freedom of work/reside is a part of it . 
  no one forces you to employe a polish migrant , please stop doing it and they will stop comming . 
  anyway , please stop moving to spain and do not send more drunks english `` gentlemans '' to cracow . 
  you talk about broken english , at least we speak 2nd language and many of us also 3rd and 4th . 
  while most of you guys speak only english . 
  now , lets maybe look why polish people migrate to uk ? 
  does it have something to do with the end of iiww ( during which polish soldiers fought for your county , and fought on every battle front ) and next you just sold poland to stalin ? 
  what resulted in 45 fucking years of communism ? 
  at least polish plumbers do not steal , and if they do you can deport them to poland . 
  at least we do not claim to be native brits . 
  at least we do not fill your prisons . 
  at least we do not claims unemployment benefits on a massive scale . 
  anyway , we will leave your island in 10-20 years , and they will stay with you forever . 
  and it is not going to look any better , believe me . 
  pardon , but in england and especially london you can easily find a job . 
  if thousands of poles and lithuanian could , they shall be able to find it too , especially if as you said they are brits and speak fluent english , get english diploma . 
  anyway , i can not image how poor you have to be to steal water . 
  there is no explanation fot their behave . 
  and no you can not be brit if you had black parents . 
  same as my kids are not goig to be chinese if they will be born in china . 
  talking about cultural awareness , hofstedes was always my favourite framework , along with hall & hall . 
  even if asians respect white people , it does not change annything you can not be called asian without being asian , get it ? 
  but in europe it is a different story , you will come live for 10 years and you are european , not talking about kids . 
  no , it is not about helping , do you know how much it costs to help someone in gerany/denmark or even poland , compared to dosme middleastern countries/africa ? 
  we shall help them there , build safe camps , help them to get back their nation !, 
  and to be clear this form of help i support and i do not mind to spend even 0,5 % of gdp on it !, 
  enrich yourself and leave my kids and country alone . 
  we do not want any african/me enrichement . 
  anyway , how they can do it ? 
  we already have some me food ( anyway , i prefere asian food , not me ) . 
  and how some somalian will enrich my country ? 
  i do not know , i am asking myself the same questions . 
  but the true is that in the next 100 years there will be no white people . 
  of course my comment was sarcastic and i have opposite opinion . 
  nahh i doubt it , you will rather become 2nd turkey . 
  add you base your opinion on what ? 
  your guts ? 
  it is what i dont like in westerners . 
  you think you know everything but you know shit . 
  anyway , it is partyly western foult that both poland and czech republic are fucked up . 
  simply , after iiww you just gave us to stalin , even though for example : polish soldiers fought on every front , read about it , you can be amazed . 
  anyway , poland has already over 500k ukrainians , is not it a large scale immigration , and not even from eu contry . 
  next , maybe look at our aid spendings ? 
  or maybe look how we help ukrainians and bialurisians ? 
  offering free universities etc ? 
  so stop spreading missleading information and start reading and base your opinion on facts . 
  please point out a lack of logic in my statement . 
  in countries like china or kongo , you will never be a chineze of kongoneze or how you call it , not even if you live there for 50 years . 
  if you as a white man call youself an african or asian , you will be a king of the night , read : idiot . 
  the borders are already open , everyone can go through without any tests , while if i go to moscow i have to pass a number of tests . 
  if you go to africa you have to be vaccinated etc. 
  media talk 24/7 about this wondeful enrichement coming from africa and me . 
  if we need enrichement it means we have no own culture . 
  maybe it is not me who is an idiot , maybe it is someone else . 
  distinct culture , what are you talking about !, 
  we are all white people , we need more diversity , more diversity i said !, 
  africa for blacks , asia for asians , europe for everyone !, 
  i am so happy , that we are openings our borders wider and wider . 
  finally we will get some enrichement , as we all know white people have no culture !, 
  afaik untill 100 seeds you are relatively safe . 
  in case of police raid , they will destroy your equipment an take the plants with them , and ye , you can get a small fine , thats all . 
  the situation looks a bit different if you steal the energy , what you of course do if you have more than , lets sat 3sqm ( 15-20 ) plants . 
  anyway , in poland you can get 5 years for a few plants ... 
  yes , portugal is a cool place too . 
  super bock  sagres !! . 
  anyway , you just have to clean the street , i mean all this people in lisbon who try to sell you hash/coco/weed . 
  but , anyway , amazing country and defienietly better place to host euro 2016 than unstable france . 
  ukraine is a failed state , a country without a proper history and legacy . 
  euro 2016 shall be moved to another country , france is not , and is not going to be safe for the next couple of years , at least . 
  romania and bulgaria looks like a good place . 
  also , poland and czech/slovakia could host the finals too . 
  not talking about buying german cars and german products , produced by companies which used a forced labour etc.

  that 's outrageous , you ca n't possibly charge fucking that much money for a most basic bank operation . 
  so you invent different hacks to simply send money . 
  look at paypal and it 's popularity - instead of sending money from account to account , you go around using ugly hacks . 
  your money 's route is like bank -  credit card -  your paypal account -  somebody 's paypal account -  his bank account . 
  instead of simply bank account -  bank account . 
  this process cost you money and so much time . 
  you 're just starting to invent simpler ways to do it , but still need a middleman , waiting for days , connected credit cards and all that bullshit . 
  just to send somebody 5 $ . 
  few over 40 . 
  everyone around 25 . 
  also no straightforward way to send somebody money . 
  banking is hardly international . 
  look how backwards is us banking system for example . 
  it 's not about fucking fees . 
  it 's about russia 's possibility to cut us off and still deliver gas to their western clients . 
  well , if field of study that the student is pursuing requires knowledge of particular subject , it is included in curriculum . 
  ( civil ) engineers definitely study chemistry for example . 
  in poland you learn needed parts of biology/chemistry during 6 years medicine programme . 
  i 'm not saying it 's bad . 
  i 'm rather saying it 's an victim of it 's own success . 
  so many people use it that it 's very crowded . 
  i like kebab . 
  just not those kebabs . 
  never eat kebab in underground passage is one of most solid life rules . 
  we are slowly getting there . 
  we have to improve public transportation along kicking cars out , because the current transportation is very overloaded . 
  daszy\u0144skiego is kind of bad example - there are underground passages only under western part of intersection . 
  ideally , you 'd have them under the whole area - if i 'm already underground , i 'd like to bypass all lights . 
   i 'm pretty pissed of when i 'm biking eastern part of wilan\u00f3w ( near the river ) and all the land to up to g\u00f3ra kalwaria is perfect for road biking . 
  not everyone likes to smell kebab ( in the more popular passages ) and piss ( in the less popular ones ) during their journey . 
  there is n't really anything old in that part of warsaw . 
  most of those skyscrapers were build at the empty fields or destroyed garages . 
  they still reek of shitty sandwiches and kebab . 
  i 'm longing for the day when it will be possible to cross rondo dmowskiego on the surface . 
  that 's because of complicated situation of ownership of this land . 
  slightly after ww2 polish stalinist leader bierut declared all land in warsaw to be property of the state . 
  that was deemed unlawful and now ( over 60 years later ) former owners are getting their property back - or in more cases , descendants of owners or simply people who ( possibly unlawfully ) bought property from former owners for pennies . 
  this is a source of a major political scandal here , because it was proven that some properties , worth hundreds of millions were returned unlawfully . 
  plac defilad - shown in the picture - is one of the hottest contest points . 
  oh really ? 
  so we might assume ukrainian nazis celebrate bandera because he killed poles ? 
  it does n't exist here from what i know . 
  i like the one in [ gdynia ] ( http://namonciaku.pl/3miasto/51,113053,16035213.html?i=0 ) the most . 
  just like german nazis celebrate hitler because he build highways ? 
  wtf ? 
  well , overall life expectancy seems like most fair indicator . 
  i mean ... it 's not fair to set the bar first and then do everything to fullfill that goal . 
  if rising life expectancy for 3 years would require us to spend two times more , i 'd say it 's an unrealistic goal . 
  if it cost us 10 % more , sure , go for it . 
   do you really think that what you have currently is more than enough and should n't be improved ? 
  as for efficiency ( measured as pure statistics you provided vs expenditure ) , we 're quite there , yes . 
  what really lags behind , is `` customer '' service . 
  it 's really what you would expect from government provided service . 
  why for example we ca n't register for a visit from at a website is beyond me - we have to queue just to register . 
  that 's something that works the same since communism and could be improved without much additional cost . 
  we could actually save money right now on decent healthcare control system - we ca n't currently control on a high level how citizen uses healthcare . 
  they could for example go to one doctor today and one tomorrow with the same illness . 
  both doctors would prescribe something , maybe two different refunded drugs . 
  we lose thrice , first on doctors time , second on prescriptions , third on citizen 's health - taking two different drugs without doctor 's approval is n't going to end well in most cases . 
  the described behaviour really happens , particularly pensioners have too much time . 
  if we are talking about pure quality of healthcare , measured as statistics you provided , and you would ask a layman like me - we should strive to improve quality at the points where it 's the cheapest . 
  focus on prevention and promotion of healthy lifestyle should be preffered over costly new cancer treatments or drugs simply extending life at it 's end stage . 
  of course that 's easy to talk about that when i 'm not the most concerned right now . 
  obviously you can quantify , but assigning binary score to those metrics is purely subjective . 
  if i pass the class without doing any work , i 'm way more efficient than guy who got a 3,5 but he spend 10 hrs a week to study . 
  you ca n't pass or fail healthcare , it 's not something we can score on a binary scale . 
  you can have the best quality costing too much money . 
  efficiency is the proportion of quality and cost . 
  you seem to confuse efficiency with overall quality of a system . 
  we probably disagree on some of this points . 
  but po improved the childcare system tremendously . 
  healthcare - we probably have most efficient healthcare in the world . 
  for so few dollars per capita we have quite a working system . 
  it 's easy to beat us when you have twice the purchasing power and spend twice as many gdp percent points on healthcare . 
  remember that high tech medical equipment and new drugs cost the same in every county in the world - we can save only on labor and domestically produced drugs . 
  economic points - he did great considering really bad situation in the world . 
  during po 's term minimal wage has risen from 936 pln to 1750 pln - nearly twice in 8 years . 
  that 's impressive considering world economical crisis . 
  oh , he fixed so much shit . 
  raising pension age and destruction of ofes are good example . 
  or doing more in regards to infrastructure than all of the previous governments . 
  sadly , current government is trying to reverse his every good move while retaining all the shitty ones . 
  you forgot about 4,76 % korwin . 
  more relevant than razem xd, 
  i 've explicitly said at least two times in this thread tree that i had exactly the same opinion when poles were killed in uk . 
  i 'm not trying to play it off . 
  though i 'm all for delivering justice through the court system , rather than lamenting on every single case . 
  i feel like we 're not getting anywhere in this conversation . 
  good night to you . 
  i certainly do n't get it . 
  why it 's a statement only if it 's different ethnicity ? 
  i was n't defending my country anywhere lol . 
  all i 'm saying is that it is not a news at all . 
  i said the same when poles were killed in uk . 
   you also tried to put me down with what my fellow countrymen did/do against a minority . 
  i tried to say that something that happens every day is n't a news . 
  road accidents are n't a news either , yet people die in road accidents - thousands of them - and that is worse than a beating . 
   it 's worse than that because killing me because i have money is a murder but killing me because i 'm not from your ethnic group is a statement that you 'll be able to kill anyone who 's a member of my ethnic group . 
  it is just as simple my friend . 
   and why is killing somebody for money not a statement that you 'll be able to kill anybody with a money ?

  merkel got noone to blame for these words but herself . 
  checking if they have no weapons , explosives , checking who they are , if they are actually from syria in a first place ( as opposite to some random african / middle-eastern nationals trying to smuggle themselves into germany pretending to be syrians ) , etc. 
   so does christianity my favourite argument for a defence of islam . 
  lol . 
  and some people still think it works . 
  laughable . 
  difference is that christians do n't want to see homosexuals killed nor promote beating women nor have entire churches shouting '' * dirty sluts , we should * *** kill *** * them * '' on a girls running around half-naked . 
   and speaking of secular tolerance , how strong are those values in poland ? 
  belarus ? 
  serbia ? 
  hungary ? 
  it 's different in every country you listed , just like it is different in norway ( ok , russia and belarus are quite similar , but that 's where it ends ) . 
  you tried to put them all into one basket ? 
  cause that makes no sense . 
  yep . 
  no country in the eu offers unlimited freedom of speech . 
  nor it should , imho . 
  rules of all sorts tend to be put in place because breaking them ends up badly for others . 
  even if they are not a member of esa , they are paying into the eu budget , and eu as such is co-funding the project . 
  so they do have some small share in it , 
   rules need to be enforced and laws need to be respected . 
  100 times this . 
  i wish all of the eu countries would put this as a priority . 
  did you even read my post ? 
  i 'm very well aware of that . 
  just pointing out that you should put the blame where blame belongs not throw it al on the eu . 
  you literally just contradicted your earlier statement . 
  if your reading comprehension is so bad - maybe you are the one who should stop commenting about anything on reddit , huh ? 
  fine , blame eurozone and blame ecb . 
  point the fault where fault belongs . 
   fucking sick of this fascist `` union '' . 
  jesus , people really need to take a fucking break , cause looks like they start to rave more nonsense than ever . 
  though on the other hand it might be a huge failure of the education system that it did n't manage to teach people like that kid here what does the fascism means . 
   he eu has control of the greek banking system eu has literally zero control over greek banking system . 
  none . 
  nul . 
  ingen . 
  eurozone countries can affect greek banking system , not the eu . 
  you are confusing two completely different things . 
   well what the fuck have we been doing so far then ? 
  junker was doing what he could . 
  which is n't much - eu has next to no ways of affecting eurozone . 
  as he said himself - fiscal recommendations eu was making were an empty words to the governments , nothing more . 
   who actually likes that guy aside from the german government . 
  i do . 
  seen some of his speeches live , seen how the guy behaves away from the cameras , he is genuinely a nice guy . 
  in terms of politics i also agree with most of what he is saying , including the every statement quoted in the article linked . 
  it 's also a great location to explore europe . 
  if you have a car you can easily visit a few countries for a weekend trips . 
  and it is a genuinely nice county . 
  you 're good in interwebz . 
   there are basically 0 romanian restaurants in the west that 's just as many as there are british restaurants . 
  lol, 
  that 's the spirit !, 
  i do n't know why , but i feel like your post assumes that spaniards that wanted to go to germany already did so . 
  meanwhile reality is much more complicated . 
  many of them do n't have a means of getting there and supporting themselves for first period until they find stable job and a place to live . 
  some of them do n't know a language . 
  many of the things that are a problem to unemployed spaniards suddenly are not a problem at all to any illegal migrant or refugee reaching the borders of germany as country takes care of them and provides far better , free support than to any europeans trying to find a work in germany . 
  so now every country can invade every other one simply on a basis of perceived problems ? 
  as / u/red _ dog1880 said - this was a no-win situation . 
  [ international energy agency says ] ( https://www.iea.org/media/freepublications/security/energysupplysecurity2014_germany.pdf ) that in 2012 german gas demand was 87.2 bcm , with 22.7 bcm storage capacity ( additional 8.2 bcm in planning or under construction ) . 
  so looks like you do n't have even 1/3 of a year covered . 
  and none of this is owned by government . 
  iea states that germany has no state-owned storage facilities - all of it is held by a private companies - and no compulsory natural gas storage requirements . 
  in the city itself quite rarely , but yes , it does happen . 
  what is it ... +5 \u00b0 c you have to assume for a difference between city and everywhere else ? 
  my thermometer ( in shadow ) says it 's true . 
  well then , there 's a spain and greece of unemployed people waiting for you , if you really need a work force . 
  there 's literally no reason to get immigrants from outside of the eu to cover the employment needs of any nation within the eu . 
   western europe buys about 30 % of gas from norway and russia respectively , well then , germany is already above average , and with this project it 's trying to make it even worse . 
   i think duda is a nationalist asshole who is trying to play polish public opinion that is very true , but in terms of factual political influence - he ca n't do much . 
   while poland itself if fully dependent on russian that on the other hand is not true . 
   maybe poland should instead expedite building the baltic pipe which has been in planning since 2001 instead of badmouthing germany for a change . 
  oh , we are building - the [ lng terminal ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%c5%9awinouj%c5%9bcie_lng_terminal ) ( opening this year ) - that will allow us to import gas not just from norway but also from middle east and even us if they 'd be willing to sell it . 
   those countries are completely dependent on russian gas . 
  most of it is a legacy from the days before the eu . 
  we have next to no infrastructure to supply gas from anywhere else . 
  but unlike germany - we 're not building a new pipelines to russia , we are [ trying to diversify ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%c5%9awinouj%c5%9bcie_lng_terminal ) . 
   there is no russian leverage over germany hahahaha , good one . 
  russia delivers roughly ~ ~ 40 % ~ ~ ( [ edit ] 36 % per [ iea ] ( https://www.iea.org/media/freepublications/security/energysupplysecurity2014_germany.pdf ) ) of german gas supply , and your industry is heavily dependent on steady supply , while germany has relatively low reserves to survive any crisis . 
  it 's enough they cut it by 10 % and you are already heavily affected . 
  of course that russian has a leverage over germany , it 's naive to think otherwise . 
  it will be years before that changes , and things like nord stream 2 only increase russian leverage . 
  germany is literally doing the opposite of what it should have done . 
   the way things are going , it feels like the federal eu would follow the same everybody-do-as-chef-say style union . 
  only if you let them to . 
  just like it happens with the refugee crisis . 
   must be awesome to live in a tent with 100 other people , eat mass produced food and get 140 $ pocket money each month . 
  either this or be homeless with no tent , begging for money from people , and hoping one passer-by will buy you a bun ? 
  it 's estimated that in poland there 's 30 000 people in such a situation . 
  far worse than these migrants in germany are . 
  they 're obviously here already , coming with the current immigration wave , so ... [ s ] why not ?!, 
   that the leader of a country korwin is not a leader of anything but his own tiny , fringe , party that could n't get into parliament during last few elections . 
  heck - he eventually ended up outside of his own party , upr , and created a new one , korwin this time with his surname in the name , so he could n't end up outside of it . 
  lol he is a pathetic old retard . 
  not much more than that . 
   very often he 's right you are being very generous to what he says in various speeches / interviews . 
  wow ... in this whole post there is only two statements i can agree with . 
  this one :  russia ?

  we talk so we can form very communicative packs . 
  we have ribs so they protect our vital organs etc. 
  things that nature gave us usually serve some purpose to survive and live , just like simple bacteria . 
  so purpose of reproductive organs is to bear an offspring so that human race can live on . 
  nothing problematic about it . 
  such offended, 
  because there was no real debate about this . 
  it was more of a funny anecdote . 
  thank you for this post . 
  it looks like revisionist history from russia spreads well since i actually believed in it . 
  this whole thread is just perfect example . 
  apples and oranges . 
  do n't even bother responding . 
  no , and he would n't be able to do it anyway . 
  he would make so many enemies that he would be dead the next day . 
  anyway i do n't see connection of your example to what we discus here . 
  i do n't understand comparison . 
  england is n't dictatorship it 's democracy . 
  could you please explain why you think they have no legitimacy to their property . 
  royalty in the eyes of law are just ordinary citizens . 
  they were awarded honorary title and as normal citizens they can inherit estates . 
  ant their fortune is theirs as is your home for example . 
  you suddenly want to make those people into slaves . 
  if it 's their private property why should it ? 
  is n't it how it works everywhere ? 
  how 's property an expense ? 
  if unelected people still hold power in your country it 's your fault . 
  it has nothing to do with representative functions of king and queen . 
  how can you promote class system ? 
  what 's the cost for the country ? 
  i was certain that in england for example they receive nothing . 
  royalty does n't make anyone suffer except maybe for communist 's egos . 
  hitler and stalin apologists . 
  now on reddit !, 
  yes , democracy . 
  i never said they ca n't . 
  i was only arguing that it 's wrong . 
  well yes . 
  on the other hand some people are very annoyed by my feelings toward stalin . 
  he after all killed my grand grand fathers and mothers . 
  i wonder what does it make them ? 
  yes , yes . 
  please tell me though , theoretically , if that would be ok if people of some german town wanted to bring back its old name hitlerburg ? 
  and citizens of hitlerburg would call it just like that . 
  so it 's fine i guess ? 
  and yes poles are fucking dumb lol xd . 
  so you are fine with towns being named hitler-burg that 's what you are saying ? 
  also i have never said here nothing wrong about russians . 
  you are projecting here . 
  edit : i give you 1/10 for being too lazy . 
  i never said anything berlin 's name though . 
  why would anyone would want to change the name of warsaw ? 
  it 's not the name of dictator . 
  he killed millions of russians . 
  if i was russian i would be enternally butthurt about stalin as well . 
  you know , people died in berlin fighting for what they believe was right even though they obviously were n't . 
  removing any symbols of german reich would obviously piss of veterans . 
  edit : thanks for down votes . 
  some people just love stalin . 
  i did n't meant to say that fighting for your town is bad cause . 
  nevertheless , symbols have nothing to do with it . 
  if veterans fought for peoples of this town , than they should n't mind . 
  if they though for stalin then they had a bad cause . 
  you can still find german veterans that believe they fought for their homeland . 
  and condemn what third reich represented . 
  however that may be ridicules . 
  there 's indeed nothing wrong with that if you believe stalin deserves a town being named after him . 
  are you playing dumb ? 
  would that be alright to change the name of one of polish towns to `` russia sucks '' if people want that ? 
  i read the article and i wast talking about suggesting referendum not the name change . 
  although i would n't be surprised if former kgb agent who restores communist anthem , which sounds nice but is strong political statement , could suggest it . 
  oh sorry fixed . 
  i mistaken it with leningrad even though it says volgograd in article . 
  it was once called stalingrad . 
  it 's clear that he likes stalin . 
  if he wanted to make this statement more political he would say that it 's up to citizens of volgograd blah blah . 
  but putin went and suggested something like that . 
  i ca n't stand that guy . 
  were you able to buy atomic warhead on black market in us ? 
  i do n't think so . 
  you should be fine . 
  china hunts only corrupted politicians in opposition , and europe is n't so bright . 
  still eu 's influence had noticeable impact on corruption in poland surly in some eau with russia in lead things could be only worse . 
  it 's slowly getting better . 
  old is dying out and it 's offspring has it harder . 
  capitol was n't inhabited by civilians . 
  it was separatist 's building . 
   got a proof of that ? 
  if you look around i 'm sure you will find some . 
  i saw it in actually objective polish document ( i know it maybe surprising to you ) where crew was interviewing some ukrainian soldiers when they got under artillery fire . 
  one woman from near house got hurt in the head . 
   and where did separatists got army jets ? 
  really ? 
  jets are only way to kill people now ? 
  the attack was n't directed in civilians . 
  was it ? 
  separatist were bombing ukrainian outposts as well harming locals . 
  it 's not news that this sub is n't objective . 
  however you are just trying to forcefully prove it by comparing videos of different caliber . 
   if you mean bombing civilians then they get as much attention as ** videos of separatist doing the same thing ** .

  as an eu citizen you might move to the uk . 
  their economy is a little more stable than finland 's one , and you 'd feel like at home too . 
  it 's not a racism , it 's the common sense . 
  letting shitload of illiterate people in is not going to end up well . 
  those people do not show any willingness of assimilation - the problem with them is that they put their faith above nationality/residency , which may lead to ghettos to be created in the future . 
  we got no chance to integrate that amount of people with the society , especially that they are significantly diffrent culturally than us . 
  i think i understood it correctly . 
  those `` bloody polaks '' are a fucking flywheel for your economy . 
  and as far as i know , polish is not a race , it 's the nation . 
  uk / ireland . 
  people from british isles are awesome , i do love your sense of humor . 
  i would n't mind living somewhere in germoney too , just the language is awful . 
  living in the netherlands would be nice too , you guys are pretty liberal , and your bike culture is very developed . 
  you seem to be the most reliable guy i 've ever seen . 
  i am very impressed by your application . 
  good luck , i hope you 'll become a moderator - we need people like you . 
  i did n't , i swear  !, 
  if i did , you 'd get a notification about the new comment . 
  i 've just edited this comment , you can see the diffrence between them near date and points . 
  cheers !, 
  read my comment again . 
  i will enlighten you - i said that we do n't need more cultural `` enrichment '' from africa . 
  if that goes so far , we may witness very far-right people getting into power , which may lead to another holocaust . 
  we need to get this shit together and tighten our borders , like australians . 
  common army ; common government , which would n't be as powerful as federated government ; common educational system, 
  federation is likely not to be introduced , at least for next 50 years , but confederation ? 
  who knows . 
  so what do you think we should do ? 
  if you 'll get a topic which you have no idea what to tell about , then you 're done . 
  the matura exam has changed last year , and they do n't inform you about syllabus you need to know . 
  they may ask you a question from any obligatory literature that you should have read within education ( so it might be even a book which you had to learn being 9 yo lol ), 
  yeah , we definitely need to get our shit together . 
  have a nice shooting mate !, 
  hey , i am in warsaw , been to the gym today , about to meet with friends to have some conversation and stuff . 
  have a nice day !, 
  actually , us presence here does n't make me any enslaved . 
  also , take a look at freedom of speech rankings and see that you 're very low there . 
  where 's your freedom russia ? 
  i have n't seen such a bollocks for a long time . 
  posh ( british ) english . 
  it sounds cool for me . 
  i live in warsaw , we are diffrent than the rest of poland . 
  lmao , it is not a bribery . 
  just our health services equivalent to nhs are underinvested and doctors need to accept people privately , as there are no more `` slots '' . 
  but it is going to be changed with computerization of those services . 
  by 2020 we are going to reach gdp per capita of $ 34,406 which is pretty close to italy - considered to be western europe . 
  the corruption almost does n't exist here - trying to bribe an officer causes instant jail . 
  our infrastructre is so damn good nowadays - to be honest , i compare it to the german one , as i visit both countries very often . 
  what is wrong with our restaurant culture ? 
  what do you mean ? 
  i had a dutchfriend who kept telling `` kankerhoer '' , and he was from the hague . 
  which is actually not true , i live in warsaw for 18 years and never been mugged , or anything here . 
  yeah , but i am applying for 2016 course , so got ta wait some time . 
  thank you , i will :d !, 
  i hope we 'll ever hang out and have a beer !, 
  going to study in scotland , prepare for new polish invadersss !, 
  to be honest , i have never heard about britons calling us stupid . 
  well , i doubt he 'll be punished for a jail . 
  i 'd rather say that he 's going to be taken into probation . 
  well , there are more than 400 000 of ukrainian migrants here , most of them stay on temporary visas . 
  low quality bait , 2/10 . 
  well , in 2011 warsaw was making 196 % of average eu gdp per capita . 
  please , get the hell out of my pocket . 
  how come that someone may just take fruits of my work ? 
  let 's say that i was working on some project for 3 years , earned like a million usd , and some far-left prick will take 75 % of my cash , just because he thinks i do n't need as much , and he would give it to others . 
  do you think that it 's fair ? 
  yup , unfortunately in 2020 it is still going to be a gap between poland and romania , according to imf approximations . 
  http://statisticstimes.com/economy/countries-by-projected-gdp-capita-ppp.php i am actually very happy that we keep closing the gap between eastern and western eu . 
  i hope it will be pretty much the same by 2030-2035, 
  rassija for life ! 1 ! 1 !!, 
  that 's true , a lot of spanish people moved here , mostly because of erasmus , but also because of a job . 
  central/eastern yurop does n't know what you 're talking about :d, 
  because we have different migration policies , different welfare system and many other things . 
  they want to go to germany , not to poland or czech republic . 
  we simply can not stop them from moving inside schengen area . 
  also , you simply can not make a sovereign state to take certain amount of people who will most likely cause problems and nothing more . 
  you might be right , but for me such teeth are just disgusting . 
  especially that as far as i know , the person is related to bbc and should somehow care about his general look . 
  older people in my country tend to put efforts in it too . 
  what 's wrong with this guy 's teeth ? 
  i 've found out that many britons do not care about it , is dental care that poor in the uk ? 
  sounds cool , i was considering bavaria for my intern once i graduate , 
  france and germany push `` ever closer union '' , where our countries would be omited during some negotiations ( something like 2nd class nations . ), 
  basically , german interests are often against polish ones , eg . 
  nord stream ii which does not give any economical advantages to germans , just the political ones and is highly against polish interests . 
  to clarify : i do not see neither france nor germany as our opponents , we are in one union , just split in `` two camps '' . 
  btw : please , show my nation some respect and start `` the poles '' from a capital letter . 
  thank you in advance brother , 
  it 's bad from poland 's perspective - uk helps in countering the eurozone countries . 
  the stronger non-ez flank is , the better for us . 
  you 're welcome . 
  i have met some finnish people working here , mainly in corporations and they like it here . 
  try to find a job as finnish + english speaker somewhere in central europe - there are many shared servce centers , or companies which outsource their financial agendas here . 
  you 'd be doing well in warsaw . 
  i 've found one within less than a minute though http://www.pracuj.pl/praca/hr-advisor-with-finnish-danish-mazowieckie,oferta,4401514, 
  sure , but nothing is impossible  !, 
  congratulations , keep up the good work . 
  let 's show others that we , ce/ee can be as strong economically as western europe, 
  i doubt that any of these countries would leave the european union . 
  pretty abstract concept .

  anyway , warsaw was completely destroyed , and not everything was documented enough to rebuild it . 
  dresden - same story , some parts rebuilded ( those were plans were saved . 
  or at least photographs ) , some are new . 
  modern warsaw has been built under communism on the other hand while modernism in architecture was peaking on the other . 
  they focused on building modern solutions that made a city more fit to cars , buses , trains and massive communication so the city could be more economically effective . 
  the old urban arrangement has been changed , i do n't think building historical architecture in such context would fit . 
  there 's no history behind it . 
  also , you are wrong about paris . 
  paris has a place for the historical architecture and for modern architecture as well ( the la defence district ) , vienna ? 
  same story . 
  this is a path for warsaw as well . 
  try to understand , that when planning a modern city , your needs as a tourist are only one of the many things , big business wants more office space in a given part of city , where you can easly get , mostly with a car . 
  there 's no sense in building historical architecture in places that were completely destroyed and which historically - in the urban planning sense - did n't even exist in the age of given historical style . 
  what you are looking at , is just the district for skyscrapers in warsaw . 
  it 's not all warsaw , there are parts with renewed historical styles as well . 
  crushing the palace of culture would be just a bad decision economically , the building is doing his job quite well . 
  far better is doing what is actually happening , the symbol is being neutralized by building other buildigs , with a similiar size , near the palace so it 's not dominating the skyline . 
  besides , most of pre-war warsaw architecture was also a stain , of russian imperialism in that case , as the most dominant style in the city was a russian interpretation of european styles , something you can meet in petersburg or helsinki . 
  just look at modern hiroshima, 
  racists and bigots were so completely right about refugees that it makes the fluffy left wingers bigoted , 
  the western world peaked couple days before ww1 started . 
  after that , it started to loose power relatively . 
  for the ceremony ? 
  you got it all wrong . 
  we did n't start ww2 and we 're not warmongering . 
  and it was n't a `` genocide '' but a genocide . 
  oh , sorry , misreaded, 
  well , obviously , if you do n't earn money , you have little to share with . 
  i know that cc is bad at pr , but him being fat does n't really mean anything about this person , while you 're trying to make his psychological profile just becouse he 's fat  . 
  catholic church is the biggest charity organisation in the world , and it 's also not a sin to be good at managing your money . 
  being rich is not a sin and being rich does n't mean that someone is not sharing . 
  gluttonous ? 
  nope , being fat does n't necessarily implicate that someone is gluttonous, 
  you 're blind . 
  basic ukraine . 
  this movie is n't anti-ukrainian with good poles vs bad ukrainians , just watch and see before you make a opinion . 
  only to simple minds that do n't know what causes world hunger . 
  hint : not him being fat . 
  btw , the fact that his fat does not mean that he 's greedy nor that he does n't share with other people . 
  it does n't mean shit , beside the fact that he 's fat , to be honest . 
  i do n't think that those people in the village care that he 's fat much . 
  creating a perfect human is n't the goal of catholicism . 
  catholicism also is not about getting to heaven as a reward for doing good . 
  this simply does n't matter for someone with at least basic knowledge about his religion . 
  okay , i 'm honest : modern and post-modern buildings    old architectural styles . 
  but the answer is : modern building are more functional . 
  it also reminds people he was austrian , remember the austrian pr trick : they managed to convince the world that beethoven was austrian and hitler was german , 
  let 's not turn europe into an open-air museum . 
  saving important buildings is fine , but we do n't need to save every single old building . 
  what are you talking about ? 
  the house did n't do any harm to anyone . 
  time passes , and the ` look , fat bishop so catholicism is stupid ' argument is still getting attention . 
  poles wo n't be to keen on helping ukraine , if they wo n't hear `` we are sorry for the genocide '' from ukraine . 
  ukraine does n't feel this is needed and i 've heard many times from them , that they do n't need our help . 
  i guess fuck them . 
  not true . 
  for example , middle east was much more western in the 60 's and 70 's than it is now , when radical islam i gaining more and more power . 
  look at pictures of iran of the 60 's and now . 
  western cultural code is loosing influence , and muslim cultural code is gaining influence in the western world , as more and more muslims are living there and the vast majority of them does n't want to leave their religion and pretty much all of those countries have problems with integrating those people . 
  you 're talking about is the leftover after the era of western domination , which was huge but which is shrinking . 
  besides , most of the world is having actually a religious revival , only the ( post ) christian world in europe and america is going the opposite way , islam is just filling the empty place in europe . 
  islam is n't shrinking , it 's the fastest growing religion in the world . 
  you 're also wrong about christianity , becouse those numbers are also rising , but in much slower rate , that 's why i think that islam will dominate the world as it 's more effective . 
  at the same time , native , secular european population is shrinking . 
  those are facts showing that you are wrong . 
  oh yeah , so it 's also a matter of islam . 
  there are various ways , but the consequences are the same - another part of the world , that was christian , will be eaten by islam . 
  decade after decade , western civilisation is shrinking and muslim is growing . 
  those are plain facts , it does n't matter much if it 's driven my arabs , turks or french . 
  islam is eating more and more parts of this world , 
  so tolerant !, 
  yes , you 're right , it was after the peak for turkey , however - it was still very strong . 
  of course . 
  that does n't change the fact that i was commenting something else , the ' 8th century germany ' geopolitical concept . 
  i agree with this , but that 's why this attempt is far better than any of the previous ones . 
  however it geopolitical terms , it is a similiar thing . 
  if napoleon had been succesful , sooner or later the capital would have been moved from paris as this empire would have to be more concerned on the continental issues than france is . 
  the continent however could not be united becouse uk , turkey and russia had their historical peaks of their power and everyone of them was using divide et impera if someone stronger emerged . 
  i agree that this attempt was far better than any of the previous ones , nevertheless , the geopolitical pattern is similiar , just with different methods , adjusted to different times . 
  it 's happening again . 
  the continent is uniting without the uk , historically , after that attempt there 's war . 
  at least no bad memories . 
  i guess poland is this strange lonely guy randomly saying weird , bizzare stuff , seeking for someone to talk to , but nobody normal cares . 
  belarus is giving this tempting look from time to time , but she 's bullied by the big , hairy , drunk guy . 
  ukraine too , but he thinks that all she cares about is money and that he might end up with hiv after having sex with her . 
  there 's also hungary , but he 's afraid it might get to overly attached . 
  and yeah , lithuania , he had some good time with lithuania once , but he does n't know how to approach her after she told him it was rape, 
  british geopolitical nightmare . 
  i 'm only saying that you ca n't allow to happen that the union would be based only on sentiment if you want it to survive . 
  however , if we 're talking about scottish independence , then what i 'm hearing is quite the opposite , in my opinion they 're mostly talking about money which pretty much proves my point . 
  why would scotland want to be in the union if london would n't be the jumping deck to a large market ( previously - the colonies , now - eu ) anymore ? 
  you ca n't base a union on sentiment , history shows that these kinds of unions exist as long , as the money flows . 
  nope , of course hard brexit means also negociations , it 's as simple as article 50 , just read the thing , there is an obligatory agreement to be found . 
  what tusk is saying is that there will be negociations without allowing british to much . 
  gdansk is doing fine , they want to put some life to elblag port . 
  nobody says there will be no negociations . 
  in this case , charles gives his throne to william in fast forwad mode . 
  brits love william . 
  gibraltar is quite the opposite of being worthless , 
  he meant that the british are using portugal for the last 700 years just to not make spain strong enough as a european sea power .

  dziennik and rzeczpospolita are much better at it ( though rzeczpospolita has a right-wing bias ) , and fakt , super express and gazeta polska codziennie are tabloids so you ca n't really expect anything good from them . 
  well , it 's the best selling newspaper in poland , but i 'm yet to meet anyone who takes it seriously . 
  [ the `` ufo tricked me ! '', 
  one is my all time favourite . 
  ] ( http://img.sadistic.pl/pics/jamg7ay8.jpg ) translation : `` these numbers were given by aliens : 1 2 3 4 5 6 these were actually drawn : 7 17 19 38 43 48 '', 
  well , cutting france out of this map because `` it 's a south american country '' would be more like cutting whole turkey out of map of asia because `` it 's a european country '' . 
  and if you look closely you can also see quite clearly the pre-wwii western border of poland . 
  so is kazakhstan . 
  and france is a south american country . 
  oh , once we almost succeed . 
  we even occupied moscow and enthroned our own puppet tsar for a while : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polish%e2%80%93muscovite_war_%281605%e2%80%9318%29 it was 400 years ago though . 
  communism in china ? 
  are you from '60s ? 
  communism is an economic pesudo-theoretical joke and you can still find people here believing it could actually work . 
  oh , seems you have proven yourself wrong with your own sources . 
  while it depends on who you ask if poland , czech republic , slovakia are in central or eastern europe , there is no doubt they always end up in the same group in every single such division you have shown . 
  and i call bullshit on every definition which considers poland , czech republic and slovakia eastern european countries , and do n't classify baltic states as ones too . 
  while i do n't agree with llmcntrm either , after i read your other posts i think that if someone here should learn geography , it 's you . 
  well , not really . 
  kashubians have some different traditions and speak at home in slightly different language , but they are regular poles ( i mean they declare both polish and kashubian nationality , but usually it 's polish first and kashubian second ) . 
  and silesians ? 
  if they are ethnic minority so are masovians , or people of great and little poland . 
  the point of the police is to maintain public order and to fight crime . 
  and if you have some serious crime , fighting it without guns seems really dangerous and difficult . 
  that 's why the police should have guns ( though they should of course use them only in the last resort ) . 
  my name is just a lame polish pun . 
  why ? 
  does n't that defeat the whole point of the police ? 
  we use algirdas and vytautas in poland . 
  though we spell it olgierd and witold here . 
  in fact , title is not really misleading , it 's `` world 's first ** life-saving ** face transplant '' . 
  well , being white christian is kinda default in europe . 
  so while you could mention it , it 's not really necessary because unless otherwise stated everyone automatically assume people talked about in news are white ( though christian ? 
  i think not anymore ) . 
  yea , `` teenagers '' . 
  just like `` youths '' in france . 
  i love how poland has a bipolar disorder and consider germany both the most trustworthy and the least trustworthy . 
  and if i think about it ... it checks out . 
  nobody wants to be in eastern europe . 
  i think by now only russia , belarus , ukraine and moldova are left there . 
  he has a `` huehuehuehue br br '' flair though . 
  i do n't recall we excluded baltic states from eu . 
  also , when you treat people like shit they probably are n't going to want you to integrate with them either . 
   only 21,5 % of testing children were retarded i 'd hardly consider more than one in five as `` only '' . 
  seems that there is something i can agree with most people in europe at last . 
  and that whole `` polonia dortmund '' and lewandowski circlejerk , do n't forget about it !, 
  probably slovakia or hungary . 
  at first i also thought about lithuania , but in the last 100 years they were trying really hard to appear different from us . 
  and if i had to choose from your pre-defined list ? 
  united states , of course :p . russia for most of history was like complete opposite of poland ( though we both love vodka ) . 
  it 's okay , we do n't even consider you to be an eu candidate anyway . 
  the only actually german teritory germany lost after wwi was , surprisingly , alsace . 
  germans were minority in schleswig , greater poland , and even in `` pomeranian corridor '' . 
  wwii though , that 's totally different story . 
  complaints to stalin . 
  glad to live in a blue country . 
   how important is it that the minister was black ? 
  well , black minister is kind of unusual in europe after all . 
   the way i see it , the us is heavily seen as super racist , but to my knowledge european and especially northern european countries tend to be super racist . 
  the difference is there is less diversity so you do n't see it that often . 
  well , everyone is a bit racist . 
  that 's a human thing ( though not a good one ) . 
  us is racist , and europe is racist too , though different kind of racist , as unlike us until recently we have never had large non-white population . 
  keep in mind that in europe whites are native europeans , and from european viewpoint nearly everyone in america is an immigrant . 
  that obviously have cultural implications . 
  immigrants discriminating against other immigrants is even sillier than natives discriminating against immigrants . 
  ( sorry for bad english , i hope you wo n't misunderstand my point ), 
  same in poland . 
  both she and reagan are held in high regard and are seen as one of the greatest post-war foreign leaders ( well , we have parks and streets named after reagan , i would n't be surprised if we got also some thatcher ones ) . 
  we do n't really have any significant communities of immigrants on minorities in poland , so they are rarely mentioned in media . 
  but as for minorities , i guess germans are called `` german minority '' , and belarusians `` belarussian minority '' . 
  we have very little roma , but whenever they are mentioned in media they are called `` romowie '' ( `` romani '' ) , even though that 's something you 'd never heard from regular people , everyone calls them `` cyganie '' . 
  as for black people , they are usually called `` murzyni '' ( dunno really now to translate it , `` negroes '' , `` moors '' ? ) . 
  some people consider it a bit offensive , but for most poles it is the normal way to call any black person , either from africa , usa , or anywhere else ( and i 'd say `` czarny '' - `` black '' sounds way more offensive ) , and polish linguists rather agree with them . 
  the term `` kolorowi '' ( `` coloured '' ) is very rarely used . 
  most people living in kosovo want to be independent - `` cool , if people living there do n't want to live in serbia then they can declare independence unilaterally , no problem with that ! '', 
  most people living in rs want to be a part of serbia - `` lol , never , that 's serbian imperialism !, 
  you guys must remain in bosnia and herzegovina and should rather all work together to improve bosnia . '', 
  now imagine opposite situation ( `` you guys in kosovo should just work inside serbia and things would move in right direction '' ) . 
  and i 'm not even starting on serb communities left in kosovo . 
  silly double standards . 
  as a pole i 'm cool with it as long as we get back our lands on the east too :p . 
  yeah , and they still have n't returned that thousands of artworks they have stolen in 17th century !, 
  wow , bob dylan is still alive ? 
  til . 
   would you rather everybody was in a shithole as long as they were more equal ? 
  knowing how insanely leftist is reddit , i honestly would n't be surprised if some of our r/european friends actually thought like this . 
  after all that 's the exact definition of every communist system which ever existed , exists or will exist . 
  well , that area was almost exclusively inhabited by poles and jews back then . 
  we are still majority in some villages . 
  but at the same time , wilno was still * the * lithuanian capital , even though there were almost no lithuanians there anymore . 
  uneasy history , i agree . 
  too much unnecessary harm was done . 
  when i read about polish-lithuanian relations in interwar period i always get the impression that both poland and lithuania could not understand motives of the other side at all ( polish - wanting to rebuild commonwealth as a major european power , together with nation we considered our `` brothers '' , lithuanian - wanting to preserve their young national identity from dissolving in polish one ) . 
   austria seriously ? 
  the last time austria was a relevant country was exactly 100 years ago . 
   greece allright , if even greece might be considered a `` major '' country , then poland must be like an european superpower . 
   if a population wants to secede from a country for whatever reason , it should have the right to do so . 
  why serbian majority areas in northern kosovo do n't have the right to secede from kosovo back to serbia then ? 
  your nick always reminded me of polish word `` bezbo\u017cnik '' ( godless ) .

   silly you it 's needs to be super popular and charismatic person to be able to pull such thing on his own . 
   direct democracy would help with that and how is that supposed to help ? 
  no we got elections for president and for prime minister ( pm is traditionally the person who is the face of parliamentary elections for the party ), 
  those questions are racist as fuck, 
  slowpoke article i expected it to be about how cdproject 's capitalization overtakes polish energy companies or something . 
  turns out it 's just article by some guy who has been living under a rock for quite some time, 
  well egypt existed before the world itself , 
   the lands were then controlled by the romans wait was n't the croatia we are talking about in region around todays czech , slovak , hungary , ukraine , russia , poland ? 
  ( [ map ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d3/slavic_peoples_6th_century_historical_map.jpg ) ) the legend you posted looks like modern rendering with today 's croatia location, 
  that comes in weaves, 
  no harm can touch them now , but have they checked if planets have arranged in a right way though ? 
   russia can not into slavic brotherhood . 
  rus * tl , dr for westerners : ru\u015b is a region/entity from which few nations emarged : 3 big ones - russians , belarusians , ukrainians and smaller ones like eg . 
  this is why you will hear ( mostly russians ) saying they are sister nations or even one nation split into multiple countries, 
  depends on various things like : - percived intention - context - voice tone  does that mean it 's not an insult to call a gay person ` faggot ' ? 
  if it said as friendly banter, 
  i would take it as so,

   you implied you did that , not me i simply said what can be an insult , you added some story to it,

  wow , the university is really impressing, 
  at best it will be a mockery , it 's hard to make it possitive,

  we are not saying it 's not true , but the article is written as some advert trying to say something without saying anything, 
  yea no data , no nothing just `` polan so gut '', 
  funny enough - not really . 
  ottomans got remebered as ones who refused to recognise partitions of polan, 
  often you got similar problems , but do n't share the border long enough to create any tensions, 
   they are mutually exclusive in western europe as well for the most part there just are n't many parties with such combination , not that it 's mutually exclusive, 
  reigning queen - does n't that imply a queen out of necessity eg . 
  becouse the king dies or she was in the line of succession ? 
  we had a pretty weird system where most of the kings were elected ( especially in her times where it was something inbetween succession and election ), 
  conservative and socialist are not possitions that exclude one another , it 's not us, 
  our little green men got set up in iceland , ireland , norway and now uk , only wait till protests start buhahahah, 
  for me most special thing about her is that she was a king * ( not a queen and at very young age at that plus she was n't given a regent despite her young age ) . 
  never noticed the saint aspect being brought up that much , especially compared to other saints like jp2 , stanislaus kostka , andrew bobola , faustina kowalska or maximilian kolbe / edit : * to explain king - person who gets coronated ( nearly always a male ) queen - wife of the king when i think about it it 's just like with today 's presidency - standard president ( king ) and 1st lady ( queen ) due to the presidents were in high majority males,

  [ wiki article ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pole_and_hungarian_cousins_be ) people generally do n't know the reasons - you can see it as a possitive steorotype that you learn through the rhyme since you are a little kid,

  i dunno how can anyone say that with straight face,

  for a untrained eye most folk costumes from the region look the same - like for me  [ map with polish folk costumes ] ( http://mazowsze.waw.pl/fotki/image/mapapol.jpg ) or [ another one ] ( http://culture.pl/sites/default/files/images/imported/taniec/inne/stroje_ludowe/mapa22.jpg ) ( dunno how accurate it is ), 
  no , `` xcity is best city in something '' , `` xcity won something '' `` x is capital of culture for this year '' and so on, 
  majority of threads like that get downvoted here, 
   first it was his bias , now it 's the / new section ... two completley different things, 
  you do n't follow the / new section to often , do you ? 
  and for france , poland , turkey , bulgaria , romania , hungary , germany , greece , spain , italy , russia etc, 
  that was before the edit, 
  it 's your bias not the sub, 
  as if it was surprising, 
  christians or jews women in arab/persian countries . 
  as for women headwear in general it 's was/is tradition in many cultures , [ traditional polish costume ] ( http://www.polskiekrajobrazy.pl/images/stories/big/55815581csc_01.jpg ) . 
  such head scarfs were very common not so long ago, 
  i do n't think it 's the same thing - hijabs is more of traditional thing , not purely religious, 
  not surprising considering continent 's history, 
  i do n't think there 's any . 
  you can not however hold your phone and talk/sms while driving - that costs 500 pln + 5penalty points . 
  having it on the phone holder for gps or talking on speaker is ok, 
  you start a vicious circle when you have to have a gun couse the criminal is now expected to have one , you got accidents with children playing with the gun , you got drunk fights that escalate to shotings , depressed teens with school shootings , more aggressive police that can not risk opponent reaching for gun etc. 
  all that for false sense of security, 
  for one case being usefull there are 30 of missuse , is it really worth it ? 
  i guess i will never understand how can people think it 's safer when people got free access to guns,

  i do n't have anything against being progressive nor conservative , this argument is just a blunt strawman,

  so no change ? 
  you assume uk will leave within a 20 years window ?

  in a very tl ; dr it 's mainly a filter for legislature ----------------------- in some more detail : - called senat - consists of 100 senators ( lower house - sejm has 460 ) - is organised into : marshal of the senate , committees , presidium of the senate ( marshal + vice marshals ) and the council of seniors ( like previous + represenatives of senate clubs ) and clubs ( aka parties ) - elections every 4 years along with sejm , single-member constituency ( for sejm it 's proportional ) - to be a senator you need to be 30 + ( for sejm you need only 21 , president 35 ) , plus all the standard stuff like not having criminal record , being citizen etc - can propose bills - can make amendments to sejm 's bills - dis/approves sejm 's bills ( if disapproved then it lands in sejm again and require bigger vote treshhold to be passed ) - greenlights referendums - can propose referendum - greenlights various state positions - appointments few state possitions - can send bills to constitutional court - along with sejm greenlights international agreements ---------------------------------- some parties wanted to disolve it and have just one house parlament claiming senat is pointless and just drains money , but that never was any serious movement, 
  but then it would be weird to have a tournaments with only ~ 3 teams participating : ), 
  posts or threads ? 
  to be precise : it 's school 's banner not national flag, 
  you are pretty late on that, 
  those are formal though , for every day we had jumper-like material vests ( they were very light though ) with school emblem - something [ like this ] ( http://www.duduta.co.za/media/catalog/men_sweaters/men-v-neck-sleeveless-sweater-vest-5.jpg ), 
  it does n't help much with social class segregation segregation though, 
  it was reintroduced some time ago in poland and few years later they backed out of it . 
  i thought it was cool . 
  can not find picture of those , but [ here 's formal one ] ( https://d-pt.ppstatic.pl/k/r/1/73/80/55c1bf49d86a5_o.jpg?1442685684 ) from gimnazjum i went to,

  never watched a full match , only some short highlight to look up what it is , i do n't really have opinion about it, 
  well duh , it 's not a thing anywhere else , 
  so that 's why people started to have pigs or miniature cows for pets, 
  in ex block eastern countries , especially russia, 
   there was so many bs about doped russians , cheating russians , there was cold war amount of dirt poured on our athletes well most of it was coused by the russian sport federation itself, 
   like ussr did back then just like most other countries in ussr ( end eastern block in general ) sport and education were/are highly valued,

  i would n't be poor in the first place . 
  i am talking about knp , not about that idiot korwin . 
  i stopped supporting him after what he did during the fifth may debate . 
  polan so relevant even its colonies had colonies, 
  yes yes yes !, 
  kukiz + national movement + congress of the new right + law and justice ruling in poland , jobbik and fidesz in hungary !, 
  yes polan stronk, 
  100 % agree i also think we should kick out all europeans out of europe to make room for immigrants, 
  what cities ? 
  with atomic bombs, 
  true , america is better than europe in almost every way . 
  most of the intelligent europeans escaped to america in the xix century . 
  europe would by more exciting , less powerful , and less cultured without me, 
  busted f * ck public healthcare, 
  what is wrong with crnaruka ? 
  serious question . 
  edit : you get down voted for asking questions . 
  r/europe in a nutshell . 
  hungary has many slavic traditions too , but it is n't slavic either :d not all slavic countries have slavic culture , and not every eastern european nation is slavic . 
  you are propably roman with a culture heavily influenced by it 's neighbours slavic neighbours . 
  does n't matter . 
  do n't get me wrong , i really like romania , but it simply is n't a slavic country . 
  romanians are n't slavs ... 
  christianity is what made america a superpower . 
  i do n't want them to be part of the eu . 
  [ relevant ] ( https://youtu.be/i2_ec1dtxgm ), 
  the reason is perfectly obvious : socialism . 
  ** every single socialist will land in prison , socialist activists will be seperated from the rest of the world , and in extreme cases - removed . 
  dracula can only do so much, 
  no , remove eu . 
  let 's take it back . 
  the more boars the less conservative we have progressive boars, 
  that 's adorable australia, 
  i have a better idea . 
  remove taxes , let women stay at home and their husbands work their asses off . 
  simple fix . 
  does n't equal to libertarianism . 
  and ? 
  good night left side, 
  because estonia is such a shithole . 
  well , he needs a land passage to crimea . 
  only crimea . 
  the state itself is completely irrelevant . 
  so every country that is at war automatically becomes relevant ? 
  i did n't say anything like that ... 
  a conflict in an irrelevant country with one side supported by the west , and one by the east . 
  so vietnam v2 ? 
  we are talking about legal issues here . 
  if you did n't notice already . 
  that 's why the current law is irrelevant . 
  but it 's quite obvious at this point that you do n't know what you are talking about . 
  if i do n't want to keep my dick private , does that mean i should wave it in public ? 
  but i guess that is too difficult to understand . 
  you do n't really get the concept of privacy , do you ? 
  crimea hehehe, 
  sexuality is private . 
  polan stronk . 
  polan western welfare state, 
  as far as my feet will carry me is n't a war movie . 
  it 's more about survival and hope . 
  umm ... no ... the key is fast progress ... 
  `` awesome !, 
  i hope more is done to drop gender rules in ie languages . 
  get with the times . '', 
  this means war prussia polan, 
  i said there are differences between genders , you asked what i mean , i linked to an article explaining the differences between genders . 
  having a hard time ? 
  men are different , women are different . 
  if `` getting with the times '' means abandoning logic , i prefer going back . 
  kukiz won in opole in the first round ... 
  the whole country went retard if you ask me . 
  except for opole in the first round . 
  i love this damn country . 
  and i thought we had bad courts . 
  polish : symetria . 
  basically an innocent guy is accused of robbing a store , nobody can prove he was n't there . 
  he is waiting for the trial , in prison . 
  bad shit happens there . 
  wo n't say anything more , i do not want to spoil it , but it 's f * cking great . 
  ( short film about killing ) it 's not that short , actually . 
  great movie comparing the typical crazy guy murder , without any preparations , to the cold and calculated death penalty . 
  german : as far as my feet will carry me - a german soldier gets arrested after the war , sent to the gulag . 
  he decides to escape , and has to travel through all of ussr to get home . 
  yes , that 's what i said . 
  they would n't have voted for korwin because of some of the bullshit he spreads . 
  they voted for kukiz because he is ( or at least seems like ) korwin without the bullshit . 
  the people who vote for the right want change . 
  that 's it . 
  remember when palikot got 10 % ? 
  well , now he is at 1 % . 
  where did these people go ?

  i liked that a lot and wish there was more truly quiet places here in poland . 
  my polish wife - who has travelled widely and eaten some very good meals in her life - * loves * taco bell . 
  when we were in iceland a few years ago we had to make a special trip to visit the taco bell in reykjavik . 
  grilled stuffed burritos ftw . 
  for poland it is the , apparently , the podkarpackie region/area . 
  centered around rzesz\u00f3w , it 's in the south-eastern part of the country , touching both slovakia and ukraine . 
  source : asked my polish wife and two of our polish friends . 
  we all live in krak\u00f3w so there may be some bias . 
  fifth gear is kind of like the grand tour : it was started when the old presenters got sacked . 
  you should have heard of it before , though , as jeremy accused them of burning down their set ( the old cool wall in particular ) at one point ... and if you 've watched the old episodes , you 've seen tiff needell on tg as he stepped in for james to do a bit of high-speed driving . 
  my phone , although these days that 's almost as obvious as oxygen and water . 
  i use it for many things . 
  - maps/gps stuff . 
  i travel a lot in europe and abroad so i have good maps ( i like navigon 's tho they 're expensive ) downloaded and saved - translations . 
  i 've got a lot of offline translation dictionaries . 
  - apple wallet ( tickets ) . 
  - gateguru & flightview to know what 's up with the flights . 
  - airport-specific apps ( frankfurt , munich , etc ) as backup for the above - traffic apps . 
  amzs , unterwegs , prevoz , traffikkflyt , darstraffic + , and the like ( waze , too ) - local bus and train apps . 
  `` sj '' for sweden , `` bus london '' and `` tube map '' for london , `` tft mobillett '' for norway , `` opal travel '' for australia , and so on - uber/mytaxi ( i 've been using mytaxi a lot recently ) - blablacar for giving rides to people - `` licenseplate '' for long road trips - `` bactrack '' the app combined with the bac measuring device to make sure i am ( or friends/family ) are ok to drive - airbnb 's app is pretty nice . 
  not sure how i feel about the company tho . 
  - weather stuff . 
  wunderground 's app usually since i like my weather to be * local * . 
  in poland i also use burzowo which tells of nearby lightning strikes . 
  - air quality apps like smok smog ( poland ) and `` global air quality '' ( krakow has a lot of smog :( unfortunately ) - apps to tell you where the nearest cashpoint/bankomat is at . 
  sometimes general map apps like navigon do n't have the latest data but i find that 1/2/3 apps from a given country 's biggest banks will tend to give better , more up-to-date data just in case i need actual cash - world time buddy ... best time zone app i 've used so far - the canary app for the canary device so i know what 's going on at home - tripadvisor for restaurant reviews . 
  yelp and zomato for backup - vivino to quickly look up some wine and see if it 's ok or not . 
  - paprika , the recipe manager ( tho i use it just for cocktail recipes and research ) - evernote ( my actual recipe manager , plus all kinds of random notes ) - apple 's notes app for grocery/shopping list ; i like that i can collaborate with my wife on this - photography stuff . 
  autostitch panorama for taking panos ( i hope they update it soon ) , filterstorm for editing . 
  - outdoor fun . 
  geocaching for geocaching , udisc to find disc golf courses - the canadiens app so i can wake up in the morning and , all too often , have a shitty morning - vr apps like `` skysafari '' and `` sky guide '' to identify stars and such , `` peak scanner '' and `` peakfinder '' to identify mountains , `` ship finder '' to identify ships , `` flightradar24 '' to identify planes in the air - apps to measure stuff . 
  there are seismometers , spl/decibel apps , `` cameraangle '' and `` tiltmeter '' to determine angles , object height , etc. . . - reddit for killing time and sometimes making very long posts that no one will really read - some games for when i get really bored . 
  recently it 's worms 3 . 
  edit : forgot to mention listening to audiobooks and music ( audible and books app for iphone , spotify and apple 's music app for my music ) , work stuff ( vpn app instead of the old school tokens ) , and news ( reddit again and bbc 's app ), 
  ummm ... osthyvel are available in poland . 
  i 've got a metal one for home and an all-plastic one for travelling . 
  i bought my parents a nice one when we were visiting them in the us ( at the tillamook cheese factory in oregon ) . 
  also , a slice of bread with cheese , meat , veggies , etc is common as muck here . 
  it 's called a '' [ kanapka ] ( https://www.google.com/search?q=kanapka&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewiqp4fhokvtahujliwkhvj5bekq_auibigb&amp;biw=1280&amp;bih=689#tbm=isch&amp;q=kanapki ) '' . 
  the direct translation is `` sandwich '' but a proper kanapka is always an * open sandwich * - without the 2nd piece of bread . 
  ps : for any norwegians or swedes in poland : where can i buy brunost ( obviously gudbrandsdalsost but anything will do ) ? 
  we have what was supposed to be a second bathroom . 
  the washing machine is in there along with a some shelves and some washing lines . 
  so it 's the half storage and half washing room . 
  stay . 
  permanent visa immigrant from the us living in pl . 
  canada , nz , australia , or the us . 
  in that order . 
  i do n't like the heat ... and nz is admittedly a long way from everything ... and australia tends to be too warm ... and the us is , these days , just for quick visits . 
  you have very good taste . 
  note , however , that they change on different dates than in the us . 
  we 're a couple weeks off from them . 
  i had some lubelski apple cider tonight . 
  i wish the polish government would get rid of the stupid cider tax so it would be cheaper and they could sell more of it ... but i guess they 've got their hands full with more important things ( ahem ) . 
  according to all of the uk subreddits , all proper british people are constantly drinking tea . 
  he does n't mention it the same way he does n't mention breathing . 
  poland : * fried * pierogi ruski ... if they ai n't fried , they ai n't as good . 
  btw , my favourite foods from elsewhere : - sweden/norway : reindeer stew . 
  - england : home-made pasties . 
  st. stephan 's day pie , too . 
  - ireland : irish beef stew . 
  - czech republic : cz version of hungarian goulash ( hov\u011bz\u00ed gul\u00e1\u0161 ) . 
  the dumplings make the difference . 
  - france : almost everything ; you guys can even turn trash like snails into food . 
  lately it 's been steak au poivre . 
  - italy : i was going to say spaghetti carbonara , but the worst version of carbonara i ever had was in northern italy ... so italian-style ( ha ha ) pizza . 
  meaning `` super thin crust that you eat with a fork '' - germany : real sauerkraut . 
  also i had some white savoury sausage in small bread rolls in thuringia that were awesome . 
  we get fritz sodas here as well . 
  they 're good but a bit too expensive . 
  water . 
  if not that , then beer or wine depending on the dinner and time of year . 
  for me , for poland it is definitely oscypek . 
  it will undoubtedly be unpopular here , but the british know how to do cheese . 
  red leicester is a good example of this , but so is ... - sage derby - double gloucester - wensleydale ( regular and with cranberries ) - caerphilly ... and of course properly-made , aged for between 12 and 24 months ( ideally ) , cheddar . 
  i think that it may not be obvious for a foreigner or someone not familiar with the vinbudin ( is ) , vinmonopolet ( no ) , systembolaget ( se ) , and alko ( fi ) shops ... because while they * may * think `` liquor store '' they should be thinking about whether or not they can afford a [ fifth mortgage ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=extrbkle27y&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=53 ) because , in the north , the hooch is not cheap at ye olde state-owned-n-run booze shop . 
  and , if you 're in iceland , it also means planning carefully so that you manage to visit when it happens to be open which is for about 20 minutes a few times a week . 
  sounds like a variant of the japanese `` moshi-moshi '' used as a telephone-specific greeting . 
  greetings from poland !, 
  staring , especially by those at or past retirement age , is practically a national past-time here . 
  if there is * anything * different about you ( e.g. 
  accent , language , clothing , hairstyle , age , country of origin , etc ) you can expect extra staring . 
  i do n't know about germany , but here it does n't mean anything other than a combination of boredom and not being taught about that particular bit of `` good behaviour '' . 
  it 's understandable because almost all of those recipes originate in the us . 
  the entire country has little to do with the metric system except when it comes to drugs and - to some degree - bullets and socket wrench sizes . 
  if there 's a recipe that uses `` imperial '' units that i like , i measure everything twice the first time i make it . 
  first measurement is with cups/teaspoons/whatever and the second is on the scale . 
  i update my copy of the recipe with the appropriate metric units . 
  it 's a tiny bit annoying ... but the saying `` you can lead a horse to water but you ca n't make it drink '' is apropos . 
  i 've driven a variety of both , but more manuals than automatics . 
  these days , though , i prefer automatics . 
  the esg in our citro\u00ebn c4 was alright and the dsg in our vw cc is pretty nice - i really love it when i take my foot off the acceleration pedal and it immediately goes into freewheeling/neutral mode . 
  i 've visited them all ( norway 4x , sweden 3x , denmark 2x , and once each for finland and iceland ) and am returning to norway in a month . 
  in order : norway , sweden , finland , iceland , denmark . 
  why ? 
  norway has the best mix of landscape types and nice people . 
  sweden has nice people but the landscape is n't quite as to my liking . 
  finland , again , has nice people but it 's just a bit too flat . 
  iceland is awesome and has friendly folks in it but is just too far away from everything . 
  finally , for me , denmark is n't far enough north .

  i ca n't imagine that german will become first eu language without massive salt in some countries ... 
  i ca n't imagine that german will become first eu language without massive salt in some countries ... 
  yeah but hard to imagine that ireland do not switch to english at some point in future ... 
  we leave you ? 
  yeah let 's compare daily mail and berliner morgenpost ... 
  it looks odd that it was builded during communist era , and removed after collaps of comunism, 
  who is on statue in 1988 , and why there is no statue later ? 
  also two year earlier there was failed attempt of the all-polish uprising in the all there partitions , but only the small number of revolutionares have fought against all three powers in krak\u00f3w ; they were defeated quickly . 
  who knows what would have happened if they wait 2 years more, 
  also since the end of the iiww there is in poland storng `` anti-german '' vibe which is used politicaly . 
  it was kinda justified in the first years after ww2 , when the war-generation was still active in pulbic live , but later it was just a `` political hammer '' to struck your opponents . 
  fact that german federal republic did not recognised postwar borders until early 90 . did not help . 
  also after the fall communism far-right parties were often using rhetoric of `` german danger '' , like for example germans are going to buy all polish land ( it was very vivid in the pre-accession to eu era ) and so on . 
  also tusk was even before described as `` filogerman '' and `` not-so-patriotic '' guy . 
  he was also described as `` liberal '' , which in polish political language is like a curse ( he actually was at the beginning of his career ultra pro-hayek ) . 
  moreover his first party liberal democratic congress had strong connections with german fpd . 
  so the news about his grandpa was for many like a ultimate proof `` he is german !, 
   they almost could n't be classified as minority in russia until catherine 's empire where they had the same rights as in plc you never heard anything about pale of settlement ? 
  which was a area where jews can settle , and it was introduced by a catherine , and only covers territories gained in the partitions of plc and in wars with turkey and crimean tatars  and they certainly were a separate community with its own laws and something you could call democracy within their ranks . 
  just like pirates on carribeans, 
  well they were `` early '', 
   polish kingdom ! = plc well it kinda was , i mean it was most popular name of the plc , for outside observers it was always `` kr\u00f3lestwo polskie '', 
  i recomend you `` mitologia s\u0142owian '' by aleksander gieysztor , it 's probably the best scientific book on this matter , basically everything what we know for sure . 
  i do n't know if there is a croatian version , but surely it is avaiable in english , french , and ukrainian ( [ apparentely ] ( http://umka.com/eng/catalogue/books/aleksander-gieysztor-slovyanska-mifolohia-slavic-mythology.html ) ), 
  we do n't know how they called themselves , also it would be very odd to call a state after some small river, 
  hahaha mighty poland , never conquered !!!!, 
  ( by romans ), 
  it 's interesting because you do n't see many statues of monarch from the premodern era nowadays . 
  afaik ukrainians made one of w\u0142adimir the great and maybe hungarians of one of their kings , but that 's all . 
  slovakia was for a short period of time within polish borders, 
  did n't know that . 
  interesting i was thinking slovaks are distinct tribe, 
  as a silesian you lived in a many countries throughout the ages : great moravia , czechia , poland , austria , prussia and so on, 
  so it 's same thing like with grand duchy of lithuania , which was a belarusian state with a lithuanian name, 
  looks like you really want transcarpatia, 
  moravians must be proud of their glorious history, 
  but you know that they get the priviliges in the begining of the xv century , so way before the massive polonization ; they choose polish language and culture because it was much more attractive to them and much richer than lithuanian , also because they want to exstiguishe themselves from the ruthenian nobility - ruthenian culture had a strong impact on lithuanians before the krewo union, 
  makes me want to play ck2, 
  no , polish people are pure blood of piasts, 
  i am not so sure . 
  how many nobles or higher class people were speaking czech , slovak , romanian , croatian and so on in the end of xviii century ? 
  not so much i believe , probably even less than were speaking lithuanian . 
  yet those languages and nations survived, 
  you should also count [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/henrician_articles ), 
  and the reason is ? 
  yeah as a state that helped preserve lithuanian language and culture from the teutonic danger, 
  yeah i know this, 
   `` litua a paganis '' litua  litva/litwa sound pretty slavic to me, 
  when i saw thread about macedonia , i could n't help myself, 
   just someones who abandoned their ways and kind of sold us out sounds like a traitor to me , 
  can we all agree that alexander was polish ? 
  i 'm confused . 
  i thought lithuanians consider jagiellonians as traitors ? 
  also obuda was a separate city ? 
  you are doing it wrong . 
  alexander was a hellenic macedonian , though today 's inhabitants of fyrom have nothing in co.mon with him or his people, 
  if you said something stupid do n't call it `` joke '' afterwards, 
  relevant : [ average penis size in europe ] ( http://i.imgur.com/ixriyz4.png ), 
  but you are just asuming that city was n't inhabited by polish and jewish people , i am not saying they were a majority , we do n't know it , but for sure they were present there before the xvii century . 
  just the original statement of u/pm _ me_your_ladyboys is a historical speculation, 
  lithuania always blaming someone else for they own mistakes and fails ; really you should just take a responsibility for your own history, 
  so you do n't have any sources ? 
  i was asking for sources about massive polonization of lithuania after the deluge, 
  any sources ? 
   we gave you sabaton songs about the glory of poland oh fuck i cringe every time i hear them  but thanks anyway, 
   since poland was kingdom while lithuania was just grand duchy . 
  you give to much importance to the whole division between kingdom and grand duchy . 
  moscow was for the most of its existence grand duchy , just like austria , burgundy and others . 
  also it changed nothing in terms of internal politics . 
  lithuanian nobles had just as same as polish ones impact on politics of the plc , i would say even bigger , because eastern magnates were wealthier and mightier than their counterparts from korona . 
   his father was n't the only one who ruled gdl . 
  let alone he was n't the only one who ruled gdl . 
  well algirdas was a grand duke , and jogailla succeded him , also kiejstut recognised him as a supreme ruler, 
   in return they had to adopt polish language and polish customs as you can already see that in their names . 
  there is a reason they did that , devils offer . 
  nobody forced them to adapt to polish customs . 
  it was a natural process , lol , you cant be serious . 
   the envoys who were transporting the crown were stopped by polish magnates in autumn of 1430 . 
  another crown was sent , but vytautas died in the trakai island castle several days before it reached lithuania . 
  they were acting in the name and on orders of jagie\u0142\u0142o . 
  you can not possibly think that jagie\u0142\u0142o himself stopped envoyes . 
  also the royal crown was given to witold in exchange of anti-polish alliance with emperor . 
  moreover the coronation was against the will of the pope , it was a emperor 's idea , and in the end lithuania would n't became `` independent '' but subjected to german emperor , just like kings of czechia . 
  and yeah lithuania was a jagie\u0142\u0142o 's patrimony, 
   sweden was twice as deadly as the nazis not really . 
  most of the population loses during deluge was due to epidemics , famine and so on , which was n't a direct effect of swedish actions , while nazi germany just killed polish and jewish people just becuause of their fucked up ideology, 
   our nobility to have lower status can you give some examples ? 
  there was never real difference between nobles of both nations , also some noble lithuanian houses radzwi\u0142\u0142owie , pacowie , sapiehowie , czartoryscy were among the most influential houses . 
  also it is not poland fault that witold was n't crowned , but jagie\u0142\u0142o 's who was at that time `` supremus dux lithuaniae '' and did not want to lost control of his patrimony, 
  ukraine for sure ( well before they lost crimea ), 
  til you do n't call it kircholm battle, 
  you still have [ our stolen property ] ( http://www.zwoje-scrolls.com/zwoje31/pol01.jpg ) , just give it back , and let 's forget about whle thing, 
  swedish troops bascially destroyed entire central europe during xvii century, 
  it 's sad when the best day of your life is marked by betrayel, 
  fuck , i studied medieval history and do n't know that, 
  exactly , in polish wikipedia we have articles about football players from polynesia and so on , while still lacking biographies of some important figures from polish history and culture, 
  definitely german ? 
  are you sure ? 
  the inhabitants were of mixed polish-baltic-german descent , duchy was de iure part of kingdom of poland , not empire . 
  and reichstag was installed in late xv century , and was a continuation of the much older institutions so all things i named were functioning exactly at that time,

  the malthusian or neo-malthusian model of population growth development is pretty much proven wrong for over 50 years now and the last popular science book that i 've seen and was repeating that myth is from 1991 . 
  this is statistical extrapolation of current trends , not propaganda . 
  if you 'd actually click the provided link you would know that falling fertility among muslims in europe is included . 
  but nah , everything is `` right wing propaganda '' for you . 
  you wo n't reach any place if you 'll keep calling succesful people `` shitters '' . 
  that 's really low and i do n't a bright future ahead of you with that attitude . 
  it 's going to be a long , linear process . 
  maybe , but not in few next decades . 
  that 's how they live today : http://appsso.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/nui/show.do?dataset=ilc_lvps08&amp;lang=en and there 's nothing bad in it , if you ask me , however i would prefer being close , but not in the exact same house . 
  that 's how history works . 
  the best of the poor are taking over the place in the higher parts of hierarchy after the blas\u00e9 rich . 
  sometimes it 's happening in a linear process , sometimes it 's revolution . 
  i often critisize immigration to europe , but i do n't blame them , it 's a natural process , it has to take place . 
  what we lack is an effective way to turn these people into europeans , just like uneducated peasentry was being turned into middle class people . 
  this is true , however , they usually have fewer children when they start having them in their 30 's . 
  it usually works the other way round . 
  for what ? 
  it 's not really on the top of a mountain , 
  never been there , but it does n't look bad http://cdn.goeuro.com/static_content/web/content/destination/bydgoszcz-deluxe.jpg, 
  the only source i got are my travels :( . 
  no excel calculations or graphs on mustaches i 'm afraid ... 
  well , if you visit those villages near opole or in lower silesia , you can notice , that many surnames written on old german graves or monuments are often german-written , but slavic-rooted . 
  silesia did n't became a german majority region only becouse it had german settlers coming since medieval age , but also becouse there were germanisation programs launched starting from late xviii century and also becouse people there were often choosing a different culture by themselves . 
  these ethnic boundaries between poles and germans ( and czechs ! ), 
  were very blurry on former prussian territories . 
  yes , i 'd like to see some stats however that could say how many moroccans in netherlands actually are scum . 
  what 's the threshold in netherlands ? 
  this type of mustache is quite common in that climate range all over the world , 
  not exactly , 
  this is quite common knowledge , patagonia is well known for it 's beauty . 
  do you want me to put it in different words that you might understand with your skills ? 
  which part do you not understand ? 
  uhm ... yes , i think you 're right . 
  the fuck is that germany is on american leash since ww2 ended and since ww2 they are gradually trying to have more assertive policy , even by using stupid excuses like this one on which we agreed when we were joining nato . 
  is n't that an advantage if your job is being a politician ? 
  the question that matters now is how ? 
  he stopped being pm in 2007 , it 's a decade now , time goes quick . 
  it 's not about hatred but your geographic position . 
  moldova already happened . 
  it 's not that we have bigger backbone , it 's just we ( finland , baltics , poland , maybe romania ) who are really threatened by this situation if it develops towards destabilisation . 
  it does n't have to be an invasion . 
  however a growing destabilisation is possible and this would be a disaster for our economy . 
  sweden in terms of geopolitics is basically on an island . 
  nobody says it is . 
  well , obviously , threats change during the time . 
  even usa supported islamic groups to fight communism in contries like afganistan . 
  people wo n't focus on the smaller threat if they 're fighting something bigger in given time . 
  that does n't mean , that this small threat stays small forever . 
  you ca n't blame media that they 're just reporting what 's happening . 
  9/11 happened , it 's obvious that it has to change the view on muslims among the masses . 
  muslim world is also changing . 
  it was much more secular in the age of various post-nasseric or post-colonial dicators than it is now when these countries are more often reaching for islam , to shape their societies . 
  people were n't so concerned about muslims becouse islam did n't play as big role in the societies these people came from , especially when it comes to territories that were dominated by communism . 
  in the 90 's islam did n't reclaimed as much human minds in the post-soviet territory ( after people stopped following commusnim ) as it has today , it has n't expanded as much as today due to the demographic boom they had and are still having . 
  i do n't know where did you came up with the ` refugee crisis ' . 
  it does n't concern me much . 
  it 's the stable , growing trend of muslims as the percentage of population that will eventually cause a change in the cultural background of the country if the trend wo n't be stopped at some point . 
  the demographic shift will be more visible after post ww2 baby boomers will start to die out as the immigrant groups are almost always younger . 
  also ... i did n't act like you suggest , 
  and this is where you 're generalising and exaggerating . 
  you may feel surprised , but most people here do n't think there 's a civil war in france , while what you 're suggesting is that poles think that france is basically gone , and this opinion you 're having is based on few people 's experience , not on data . 
  poles just do n't like the general , `` normal '' negative consequences of having large muslim groups in the country . 
  from organized crime , messy streets , bad neighbourhoods spreading , terrorist threat to a change in the cultural background of a country in a direction they do n't approve , while you 're suggesting that a typical pole thinks france is basically paristan already . 
  this is having no support in data , it 's your own biased imagination . 
  a typical `` they have a different opinion than me , they must be stupid , let me show on these few cases , how stupid the overall of their population is , so my opinion sounds smarter without me actually picking up the topic in any substantive matter '' attitude . 
  nope , if you ask people on the street why they do n't want muslims in the country , you will get the answer that they fear that this would start a process which would lead to current situation in we on this field , which they disapprove . 
  you 're generalising and making unauthorized ( in terms of logic ) extrapolation of your personal experience . 
  this is n't a data-based opinion . 
  no , the trend in the 50 's consisted mostly people from other european countries and the numbers were n't that high ( 200 000k people immigrating to france each year with a growing tendency ) . 
  france became more open to maghreb immigrants in mid 70 's and immigrants in the 50 's -60 's were often just french , leaving their lifes in ending colonies . 
  also , france is n't a good example , becouse it was the only we country that was open to immigration ( mostly from europe , poles , italians , spaniards escpaing civil war ) before ww2 . 
  no , it is changing , that 's why in most western european countries police started to control mosques . 
  also , the influx is still there so the change is therefore in progress . 
  you were talking about `` most of the last century '' , not `` last couple years '' of that century . 
  mass influx from maghreb started in the 70 's when france allowed people from former colonies to settle with their families but it took time until these numbers became a reason for `` occasional '' states of emergency ( first in 2005 ) . 
  sadly , you might me right . 
  i was talking about people who decided that it 's a good idea to spend money on making them stay in euro-zone . 
  which , during the most of the century , immigrated to europe in much smaller numbers and their overall population was much smaller which makes the situation different for the most of the century . 
  escaping reality costs money . 
  it did n't last to long . 
  you did n't had a terrorist attack for a while thanks to that . 
  it 's the new normal . 
  not true , the levels of immigration were much lower most of the century and they were mostly people from much more similiar cultures . 
  no , it 's under state of emergency . 
  opinion polls do n't include human adaptation to changes . 
  it 's more complicated than that . 
  people can get used to to everything , russians are supportive for their government despite russian economy being shittier with every year and with a rise of 3 million people under povery level in 2 years . 
  there are many factors that form a final opinion . 
  having large groups of muslims in the cities is the new normal for western europeans , they do n't remember how things once were . 
  for a foreign observer from eastern europe who does remember how things once were becouse he 's having that back home it 's a voluntary step back on a certain field . 
  i think the article should focus more on geography . 
  russia has very poor geography and their large territory is a burden , not an advantage . 
  it 's much harder to keep your infrastructure , trade and economy running , when you 're a large sparesely populated country , with huge distances between cities and with a territory , which most of it does n't have any economic value . 
  you need to spend more to protect this vast territory , you benefit only from small parts of it , becouse the climate does n't make it profitable . 
  when trading you need to spend more money and time to get into a place and when you want to make trade cheaper and faster , fewer people have to spend more money on longer roads , railroads and all other infrastructure . 
  these vast territories of nothing between dots of something makes everything harder . 
  not to mention that russia 's was about land communication and sea trade is much more beneficial . 
  it 's much better to be a small , but denesly populated island , with 15-30km to te next town , open to world trade thanks to the sea , with a fine climate thant makes most of your land profitable , not having to spend so much on your military ( well , if you do n't want to dominate the world ) and so on . 
  europe should suck out that me blood and change those people into europeans :p, 
  our historic muslim population is very small today mainly becouse most of them integrated with our culture so well .

  so now whenever some pole tries to say we are `` central '' europe i laugh merrily . 
  well , there is all that , sure , but in terms of guns we are more restrictive than the most hipster bubble in san francisco . 
  ironically , the current nutjob right-wing government is rather authoritarian , they do not really want the citizens to have guns . 
  a broken clock is right twice a day , i guess . 
  we were talking about what strategy poland took so that it does n't have much immigration , not about who to blame . 
  some say low immigration has something to do with strong anti-immigrant stances by ruling polish politicians . 
  i say it is bullshit , as they would not be able to seriously stop it , if we were a prime target . 
  well , if brexit is realllly hard , perhaps something can be done about it !, 
  and any non-white briton , remember . 
  2nd and 3rd generation immigrants are a source of sex crime and terrorism just as well . 
  more like disappointed that people go for such old lies . 
  the problem with far-right is n't even that they are morally wrong ( though they are ) but that they have no actual solutions . 
  unless we just murder everyone `` incompatible '' , that is . 
  the fellow i replied to wrote :  let 's not be cute , there 's going to be a-killing , we all know it . 
  maybe he just meant vigilante murders , sure . 
  that 's also possible and also an utter failure . 
  your world seems to be simpler than mine . 
  mine has many more options than just `` murder '' and `` appeasement '' . 
  but hey . 
  no , however even those millions of muslim immigrants with alll their issues are just a small blip for the west , its culture , its power and its wealth . 
  also , poland is not `` safe '' because it made some smart migration decisions , unless we agree that smart strategy is being much poorer . 
   texas in europe that would be finland , if anything . 
  another thing a lot of angry folks forget is that islam was not a source of terrorism for a loooong time , it is a relatively recent development , maybe since the nineties or so . 
  as muslim radicals continue their festival of barbarism and as new generations are born and see it as less `` cool '' , it will eventually fall out of favor among their communities and die down . 
  certainly , as isis gets gradually defeated it will likely hasten the waning support for their kind of extremism . 
  hilarious how the person you replied to has a vulgar edgy nickname . 
  i almost universally ignore nicknames , really , but sometimes they do confirm a preconception . 
  oh please , do n't be melodramatic , it never started either . 
  all kinds of shit was happening in practically every previous decade . 
  and i will still take terrorism over regular wars . 
  we did n't start the fire , it was always burning . 
  please , do n't paint a whole sub with one brush . 
  only part of it is fucking stupid . 
  no way , man , we are totally living in the end times , fighting the ultimate war of civilizations . 
  terror , separatism , violence never happened before , we * have * to revert to tribal fascism or we will all speak arabic in 10 years . 
  please , poland is `` safe '' against immigrant problems because it is relatively shit compared with western europe . 
  even though the west is 100 % caliphate right now , fucking * millions * of poles go there to work and live . 
  i 'd rather we made the same `` errors '' and be uk or france . 
  you are in luck , as uk is leaving eu , it will be able to reinstate the death penalty !, 
  uk had full control over importing hundreds of thousands pakistanis and it is mostly pakistanis who tend to create those sex gangs . 
  you can blame merkel all day long . 
  right , let 's have some ethnic cleansing !, 
  let 's become racist inhuman barbarians because we fear racist inhuman barbarians !, 
  more like nobody cares about people in care homes or council housing . 
  jimmy savile was not muslim and yet he abused young vulnerable people for decades . 
  do we assume police and councils are some kind of far-left fanatics who will protect muslim suspects no matter what ? 
  are the white working-class communities where the abuses took place bastions of feminism ? 
  i kinda doubt that . 
  it is still an extremely small section of their respective minorities . 
  the vast majority of any ethnicity does not hurt anybody . 
  i mean , these are pretty vile fellows and police should work harder to prevent and track down such horrors ( and not get defunded , perhaps ? 
  kk , may ) but painting a whole ethnicity through the action of a few degenerates is fucking stupid . 
  nah , just dumb strawman bait . 
  this is still faaar cry from `` zomg sweden is caliphut soon '' . 
  unlike some , i disagree a muslim-background minority is the most horrible thing ever . 
  i do n't want to debate this anyway . 
  fuck this topic , live with whatever image you prefer , i stopped caring about it ten thousand immigrant threads ago . 
  and in 2100 the whole world . 
  demographics are not linear . 
  yes , inevitably . 
  sweden being taken over by radical moose lambs is a far-right fantasy . 
  but but i was led to an impression that reddit knows all about islam and islamic cultures !, 
  a lot of them are n't joking , just check any thread on r/europe that mentions sweden . 
  sad thing is , when , inevitably , in 10-20 years sweden still exists and is not muslim , none of those silly idiots will own up to it or learn anything . 
  honeymoon effect , really . 
  many people give a new leader a chance . 
  he probably thinks ( i totally assume it is a he ) being openly flamboyantly gay is `` virtue signaling '' . 
  shit , i recently talked with some guy who was saying pretending to be transgender is trendy and that it is some widespread issue . 
  i know man . 
  we got a horrible government too . 
  okay , i am sure it happens , i just had an issue with it `` happening a lot '' . 
  i think at that point it is about the idea , not actual ownership . 
  arson by firemen ? 
  would have been news over the years , must have missed it . 
  they do n't want to just cause fear , they want to conquer the world or whatever . 
  however , fear drives the west to be harsher towards muslims , which in turn helps their recruitment . 
  because the vast majority of muslims does n't actually like , support or join isis and isis wants to change that . 
  right , this is a high quality sub with no shitposting !, 
  `` i am 100 % for gays but they got ta stay home and be decently covered ! '', 
  but he is , astonishingly so . 
  whenever i hear him speak i have to remind myself he is an actual potus . 
  it is so unreal . 
  some of your compatriots sure like to visit here !, 
  what can you do . 
  yeah , and the colleges are liberal since yesterday . 
  please . 
  they must be doing a terrible job , then , as trump won among the white college-educated demographic . 
  i do . 
  but let 's ignore it , let 's say he is n't . 
  who is his counterpart in terms of strength of views and power ? 
  we are not talking about `` leaning '' , we are talking about extremism . 
  i do n't see a trump equivalent that has a similar severity of extremist views combined with even remotely similar power . 
  while i greatly dislike left-wing extremists , wake me up when antifa has a supporter in the white house . 
  yeah , too far fetched . 
  i have no idea who the hell did it anyway , some extremely confused fringe . 
  i did watch a large part of the first season of muhte\u015fem y\u00fczy\u0131l myself . 
  sadly , a soap opera is , ultimately , just a mix of stupid characters saying random things , no matter how well dressed and in what fabulous surroundings . 
  nobody forces you to hug her . 
  what why i do n't, 
  i know he did , i just do n't like the result much .

  that is all . 
  that german islamists are trying to use the refugees for their own means and exploit their weakness is a completely different story and security services need to crack down on those . 
  uh no . 
  this report is about german islamists recruiting refugees , it is not about islamist militants coming in through refugee routes . 
  german intelligence says the same . 
  random internet picture . 
  i 'll make them tomorrow and show the result for your approval  / edit : have to delay one day , too much breakfast, 
  take some , put it on a plate , take knife and fork . 
  eat like a lasagna or so . 
  at least that 's what i do . 
  enchiladas , no meat . 
  * tortillas ( x6 ) * onion & garlic * zucchini ( x2 ) * paprika ( x2 ) * aubergine ( x2 ) * can of tomatoes ( x1 ) * cr\u00eame fraiche ( x1 ) * can of corn * can of kidney beans * cheese * some chili , salt , paprika , cumin , etc put in pan : oil , then onion and garlic , then aubergine , zucchini and paprika , then tomatoes , then corn and kidney beans . 
  season it properly , let it cook for a while . 
  take tortilla , put cr\u00eame fraiche on it . 
  put the vegetable-stuff into it , roll it up and put it in a casserole . 
  do so with all the tortillas . 
  put cheese on top , put rest of the vegetable-stuff in the casserolle too , on top of the rest , put cheese on top again . 
  put in oven 15 - 20m , 200 \u00b0 c - .

  welcome and good luck to the new mods !, 
  i hope / r/europe will shine once again , 
  regarding the visibility , at the time i posted that it was said the thread would receive frequent updates with links to specific comment chains to discuss the submissions . 
  i agree with you that specific submissions were less visible because there were no frequent and consistent updates , but you have to agree that the immigration-is-a-problem topic per se has not been made less visible . 
  and you also have to agree that the sub got a variety of new and different submissions during that time . 
  i also wrote this about the possible options the mods have : https://www.reddit.com/r/subredditdrama/comments/3etkl7/reurope_mods_create_an_immigration_megathread_to/ctibh3g thanks for your feedback . 
  haha , sure , i do n't want to give away my workplace , but basically submissions are being checked for a variety of criteria ( for example : only questions are allowed ) . 
  the presentation sources ( within reason ) , absence of insults and slurs ( incl . 
  racism ) , questions about the private life , personal data in the submission , and so on . 
  it was just an example , i will obviously not use said guideline in reddit , i used it to point out that i have learned to moderate respecting certain guidelines as opposed to seemingly arbitrary decisions . 
  i hope this clarifies this part a bit , `` special codex '' indeed sounds stupid . 
   how often are you on reddit in an average week ? 
  multiple times a day , cet afternoons and evenings mostly . 
   how often do you visit / r/europe ? 
  multiple times a day , cet afternoons and evenings mostly . 
  my go-to subreddit apart from / r/de . 
   what country are you normally resident in ? 
  germany  do you speak any languages besides english ? 
  ( if yes : which and to what level ? ), 
  german ( native ) , french ( basic ) , danish ( beginner )  what interests you about europe ? 
  european history , identitiy , politics . 
  random facts about all the countries and their cultures and traditions  what are your favourite and least favourite things about / r/europe ? 
  the only sphere of european public i know that one can interact with easily . 
  i love to get to know and discuss issues with a wide number of people from the european countries . 
  my least favourite thing is probably that racism and xenophobia have common-place in the past year . 
  if these incidents are singular , they can be dealt with easily and some good discussions can occur , however if all threads are dominated by the same rethoric and lack of quality content , it becomes an overall problem of the subreddit . 
   do you have experience as a moderator or similar ? 
  i have been a moderator for a variety of internet forums , but not reddit ( / edit : actually , i just became mod at / r/projectreality ) . 
  most importantly though , i work in the moderation of a german ngo website and have to moderate requests to politicians . 
   why do you want to be a moderator ? 
  because i think i can be a reasonable force in the moderation of the subreddit and do n't want to see one of my favourite subreddits go down the drain of the standard subreddits . 
   why do you think you would be a good moderator ? 
  where i work , i work according to a special codex and have learned to look for quality of submissions , and not care if they do n't affirm my opinion . 
  i am a firm believer of freedom of speech ( within reasonable limits , i like the system in germany ) and i have learned to accept and support other 's opinions if they are presented in a reasonable way . 
  i can also answer to user requests and i never resort to personal attacks and insults . 
   do you have any expirence with statistics , datamining or reddit bots ? 
  i have a degree in political science ; however my statistics knowledge is rather limited . 
  i have designed and conducted qualitative surveys though . 
   what is your opinion on the immigration megathread ? 
  what do you think went wrong ( if anything ) ? 
  while i generally supported it , it gave unnecessary fuel to the debate about freedom of speech in the subreddit . 
  i believe a firmer moderation of submissions , checking for duplicates and redundant content could have prevented the drama . 
  however , as the current state of the subreddit shows , the domination and one-sided discussion on immigration issues essentially clogs the subreddit and prevents the interesting and diverse content that / r/europe is loved for . 
  i came here to learn about what is going on in other countries and enjoy a healthy mix of political discussion , random facts and thoughts as well as cultural exchange . 
   what 's one weakness you have ? 
  i am lazy . 
   would you rather fight one horse sized duck or one hundred duck sized horses ? 
  one hundred duck-sized horses . 
   what single word connects all of these three of the following words : europe , pussy cat , teacher ? 
  explain why `` idle '' - `` the quite remarkable adventures of the owl and the pussycat '' was written by him ( eric idle , monty python member ) . 
  when we watched `` the meaning of life '' back in highschool , we discussed why we had to read shitty literature ( short stories ) for the final exams afterwards , and my teacher brought up this book as an alternative . 
  ( i leave it up to you to dcidewheter this story is made up or not ), 
  got a reply yet ? 
  which field & university will it be ? 
  there is also a link to the german version on the top :d, 
  i studied in denmark too and the atmosphere and quality of teaching in the seminars was much better than over here ( i study at a german `` elite '' university , so they should be on par at least ) . 
  did n't have any lectures though , so i ca n't give my opinion on that . 
   pedagogy i 'm in social sciences and we had tons of 90m lectures where you forget everything . 
  even some seminars are bascially 90 % front-talk of the lecturer . 
  surely one of my biggest issues with my programme and university in general . 
   exams 90 % multiple choice exams . 
  it gets better later-on when you can write some papers  bureaucracy works fine at my university . 
   pr\u00fcfungsamt both the secretariate of the university and the one of the programme i 'm in are extremely helpful and fast . 
   technology it 's alright . 
   facilities it 's alright, 
  yeah , half of their mainpage is about things happening on / r/europe . 
  rephrased . 
  by propaganda i just meant that war is shown as super pretty and awesome , the side does n't matter . 
  i did not contest that . 
  i just pointed out that some are from the post-ww2 area . 
  germany and italy have more foreign policy ambitions than the uk ? 
  seems weird . 
  and greece has more foreign policy ambition than it , ger , uk , esp ? 
  and luxembourg and germany have the same level of foreign policy ambition ? 
  would be nice to know their criteria . 
  not all of them are from ww2 ? 
  at least these are not : http://i.imgur.com/bd3zwxd.jpg http://i.imgur.com/4pmhlzl.jpg http://i.imgur.com/5rjamrj.jpg http://i.imgur.com/52gcwmn.jpg but yeah , nice collection of ~ ~ propaganda ~ ~ pictures of mechanical engeneering . 
  almost as bad as the original . 
  not only , but especially south america ; probably because allied influence was quite low overthere . 
  you can read more about it here : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ratlines_%28world_war_ii_aftermath%29, 
  after ww2 , many nazis fled to south america , there was a lot of them down there after the war .

  i do speak russian ( self learned ) , so i dont miss anything , but speaking russian is somewhere on the same level of uniquity as church latin . 
  it should be different . 
  in poland we also have the chance to choose languages - and we can get russian , but for the most part that limits number of schools you can go to , makes it more complicated with the scheduling etc. 
  its also not seen as as prestigious or whatever as german or french . 
  for example any school you pick will have french and german . 
  with most students going for german . 
  pretty much like slavic languages . 
  the west slavs ( poles and czechs and slovaks can understand eachother ( czechs and slovaks speak the same language ) without too much hassle ( more than portugese/spanish ) . 
  one speaks polish and the second responds in czech , 
  was n't aware , 
  youre probably saying older generation , those who learned russian and german or something . 
  current 18 y/o 's should have 9 or 10 years of learning english , and probably 6 german . 
  tbh the english is closer to 13 years now - usually starts from preschool these days . 
  not much polish spoken , some , for example in touristy areas of czrep and slovakia , but not much , they prefer to go with german or french afaik . 
  there is no point in learning polish . 
  the deal is that you can talk polish to a cz/sk dude , he will talk back in cz/sk and you will both understand eachother . 
  some words are similiar , some are identical , some are completely different , but in this case you still have context . 
  tldr the difference is even smaller when spoken . 
   triggered its always those small things ;p i was aware of the hurr durr we are not spanish hurr , pretty weird how so similiar countries make so much effort to distance themselves from eachother ;p russia and ukraine these days pretty much . 
  the economical relations were pretty good in certain sectors , but the sanctions have destroyed them . 
  thats the part where you can get by with polish , 
  exactly , so why they keep doing it ? 
  answering this question enters the fields of conspiracy, 
  o shit, 
   for the sake of simplicity all slavs are the same  we are all powered by vodka , and our women are beautiful . 
   worse how ? 
  :d its the eesti can not into scandi joke  do n't get your sarcasm here . 
  you used the term incorrectly , i reacted ... you reacted so agressively , it hurt you deep inside ;p  to get to level 5 you either need to ask us whether estonians speak russian as their first language or you have to say something bad about saunas . 
  next time i see you , 
  you planing an expansion ? 
  chicken of death from my understanding . 
  ok lets end this , a frenchman will come and try to beat us with a baguette if we continue, 
  most of my disagreements with people come from my oversimplifications . 
  if lets say there is that 0.05 % germans in poland , then ill say no germans . 
  while its incorrect - it keeps stuff simple , and i need simple , as with every refresh i have 5 new replies ;p  by the way : we have a similar situation in austria . 
  in the south of carinthia there is a slovene speaking minority but they are all bilingual and are slowly getting germanized . 
  but that does n't mean that the slovene language is non existing in austria . 
  til + its the same with our germans , they are polonized already tho , 
   so we are latvians or lithuanians now ? 
  you can be whatever you want snowflake   ah , that nice geographical oversimplification ... makes conversations interesting , and estonians mildly bothered   baltic finnic = finnic . 
  finland is also finnic = baltic finnic . 
  baltic and baltic finnic have nothing to do with each other besides the etymology of these terms . 
  you guys are finns but worse ? 
   estonians as baltic people or balts is not conventional , it 's just incorrect . 
  now serious time : i agree and i know , but for the sake of simplicity i just throw everything in one box , its not like im writing a scientific paper here . 
  sorry for triggering you, 
  have n't clicked on your article as i do n't know the site , but i know the problem . 
  generally its because israel is held to a higher standard by the media . 
  also israel bad , palestine and muslims good supports the msm narrative . 
  not sure what they have to gain from it tho, 
  was n't that far off , 
  from your link :  however , there is not a single locality or even a village neighborhood in today 's upper silesia or poland , where german would be a ( not even the ) language of everyday communication . 
  as ive said - the strictly german households are very rare , as all those people are polonized already ( if thats a proper word ) . 
  even if their first or in-house language is german , then they know polish as second for sure . 
  tldr : anegdote   anyway . 
  i 'm not here to nitpick . 
  we need more people like you :p, 
  cmon you know what i mean . 
  im not going to say baltic states with baltic people and the holy state of estonia , that is one of the baltic states , but is a completely different , special snowflake with the mighty finno-ugric people of awesomeness . 
  and wikipedia says youre baltic finnic . 
  its not that i 'm ignorant , its that my mind has a concept of boxes , and you guys are in one box . 
  with a `` balts of baltic states '' description, 
  im not talking about being fluent , im talking about getting by . 
  getting by means : where be shop i buy bread . 
  i have a friend that lives in berlin and talks serbian to his two classmates . 
  he learned from songs praising serbian fighters in yugo wars without any form of serbian lessons . 
  i can understand maybe one in 3 words of slovenian ( that i find written on wikipedia ) and get the rest from context . 
  i had close to no exposure to it in my life . 
  the thing with with english is that its basically spoken anywhere in the western world , so specific languages like german or french are not needed if you dont want to live there as youve said . 
  my angle is that the reach of english ends somewhere at the ural mountains , and even before them , around moscow the signal gets pretty bad . 
  in the central asia its like i would ask you to speak inuit . 
  ive mentioned it in the long list post , just the guy kept talking germany , so so did i. german being natively spoken in a part of poland is more of an anegdote . 
  i would say maybe in a thousand of households . 
  i am completely not aware of that ;p i mean i know there is some issues between ethnic balts and baltic russians , but i dont have your insider knowledge , 
  all the countries ive mentioned have some of these characteristics : slavic roots , russian minorities , use russian as official language , languages that are similiar , use of cyrylics , history of being parts of soviet union . 
  what else ? 
  and if russian does n't work - im very explicit that i would use a mix of polish and russian . 
  that is the will of the people to learn language of occupants . 
  thats kind of true too , but if the public schools would try - then the students would learn . 
  back then they had the means to force it down your throat . 
  same in poland , but generally i am sure you could get by in russian . 
  you guys have like 28 % of slavic people ( mostly russians ) , history of being under su , and from what i can get from wikipedia - 66 % of people knowing a second language know russian . 
   it \u00b4 s a very american thing to ask , and on reddit and r/europe one never knows . 
  i was aware of the whole affair , but saw a portugese flair and jumped on the chance to ask at the source   kind of a joke , but also referring population distribution , cultural patterns and how throughout history the coastal areas and the sea have been far more important than the border areas . 
  my estimate is probably 92-95 % of the portuguese population lives closer to the sea than to spain . 
  anywhere in portugal is close to the sea  we generally see you this way - there is no lessons about modern portugal , but there are many mentions of the great portugese empire being all across the globe  in general we know a lot about small spain . 
  ive added russian due to the old generation , and also significant russian minorities . 
  definitely more accurate than for example poland - where to talk pure russian you would have to find people older than 50 , and most of those people havent heard a word of russian outside of a classroom 30 years ago , 
  its a very tricky conversation  the german language in current state of emigration trends and geopolitical ones is better , as germany is a good , stable ally . 
  its great to know german if you want to live in germany , but if we go anywhere outside of it - its automatically useless . 
  im just saying that russian is a great language to know , far more global than german - and i would like to see some more cooperation with russia than the blatant rusophobia we have here . 
  not talking love , just fair deal and a handshake . 
   this is really mental gymnastic you are doing here . 
  then why am i still fat ? 
  ;(  for countries neighbouring german speaking countries german is way more useful than russian . 
  depends on the purpose . 
  you can talk with germans in english , and unless you want to work there - it will be all you need . 
   what is this obsession about russian ? 
  no obsession , just not rusophobia that is common in europe and especially poland . 
  in the internet too .

  why ? 
  because it was done bilaterally , instead of formally through nato structures ? 
  practically and politically it makes no difference . 
  it 's about nato members demonstrating their alliance . 
  one of the key reasons why they are n't an easy target is their membership in nato . 
  but this is a deterrent only as long as nato maintains its legitimacy . 
  to do its job , nato has to clearly demonstrate that it is ready to protect its members and that an attack on one of them would be met with a response from the alliance . 
  and that 's what france and the usa are doing . 
  it matters * precisely because * the countries in question were russia 's exclusive sphere of influence until very recently and you 're naive to think russians have let it go completely ( especially the baltic states , which were part of the ussr just like ukraine was ) . 
  the graph is in usd , i 'm pretty sure it 's just because of exchange rates and the recent strengthening of the dollar . 
  most of these countries have had a positive growth lately . 
  same with the dip in 2008 , e.g. 
  poland did n't experience a recession . 
  yes , and the pm is supposed to form the government out of parties that support government 's policies . 
  where 's the problem ? 
  for a less cynical and , in my opinion , more realistic summary , see [ nyt 's chart on the changes ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/01/17/us/nsa-changes-graphic.html ) and [ new yorker 's editorial ] ( http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/newsdesk/2014/01/a-major-victory-for-snowden-and-nsa-reformers.html ) . 
  i think you are being overly critical . 
  like complaining about it being just an executive directive ... what ? 
  that 's the only thing he can do as a president - to pass a statute you need congress . 
  which they working on and obama 's speech will help a lot to pass the reform , because it represents a huge change in the government 's rhetoric . 
  i 'm not the one you asked , but i heard he had a big role in facilitating the transition from franco 's dictatorship towards democracy in the 70s . 
  is that not true ? 
   banks are n't some kind of social service like you seem to believe , it is ruthless business . 
  and you seem to believe that if a business makes a lot of profit , then it is abusing people and not helping them . 
  in other words , the zero-sum game fallacy . 
  right , remember the times when houses were so cheap that average people would just save up for a couple of years to buy one ? 
  me neither . 
  i did n't say it was n't part of ukrainian history . 
  but it is a bad part and the protesters want to condemn it and break away from it . 
  oh yeah , what are you gon na do ? 
  kill yourself ? 
  the statue has everything to do with russia and its politics in the 20th century , which in turn have a lot to do with russia 's current attitude towards ukraine as its sphere of influence , which coincidentally is exactly what the protests are about . 
  not pure capitalism , no . 
  but there has been * just a little * more success with mostly capitalist systems than with mostly communist ones . 
   it should be banned to buy sex because no one should be forced to sell themselves . 
  how is anyone being * forced * to do it ? 
  the choose to . 
  sure , they may be driven by their difficult circumstances but it 's still their choice . 
  if you make prostitution illegal , you do nothing whatsoever to improve their circumstances , all you achieve is taking away that option and limiting their freedom . 
  how is this supposed to help anybody ? 
  yes , that 's definitely an important contributing factor . 
  however keep in mind that poland was the biggest beneficiary in absolute terms , but not nearly the biggest per capita . 
  other east european countries that received more in proportion to the sizes of their economies did n't do as well . 
  in fact , some of them experienced devastating recessions . 
  this shows that eu funds are far from being the whole story . 
  i assume that 's directed on the op who shamelessly made up that quote ( or maybe the guardian , in case they changed the title ) . 
   i 've been searching for a source of where he said the title , however i ca n't find it in the guardian article or otherwise . 
  does anyone know where he said it ? 
  my bet is on nowhere . 
  touche . 
   mind you , it was still very much partly the fault of the soviet union not partly , completely . 
  there 's no doubt that the famine was the fault of soviet policies , the debate is about the extent to which the outcome was deliberate . 
  which is a far better solution , imo . 
  it 's such very hard issue and i have n't got a clear opinion about it yet . 
  this post is just me thinking out loud . 
  i think we should n't allow procedures that are 1 ) medically unjustifiable and b ) either risky or irreversible . 
  but preventing them does n't require appointing an outside legal guardian - doctors should simply refuse to carry out such procedures . 
  the nature of parents ' motivations , whether religious or otherwise , is irrelevant . 
  however , the concepts of both medical justifiability and risk often are n't clear . 
  circumcision itself is the best example of such contentious issue . 
  the american academy of pediatrics [ says ] ( http://www.aap.org/en-us/about-the-aap/aap-press-room/pages/newborn-male-circumcision.aspx?nfstatus=401&amp;nftoken=00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000&amp;nfstatusdescription=error%3a+no+local+token ) :  after a comprehensive review of the scientific evidence , the american academy of pediatrics found the health benefits of newborn male circumcision outweigh the risks , but the benefits are not great enough to recommend universal newborn circumcision . 
  the aap policy statement published monday , august 27 , says the final decision should still be left to parents to make in the context of their religious , ethical and cultural beliefs . 
  so , according to that view , circumcision may be medically * unnecessary * but it 's not * unjustifiable * . 
  the benefits are n't big enough that you would do it solely for medical reasons , but it does have some benefits , so , as far as doctors are concerned , you might do it for other reasons . 
  circumcision seems like a pretty grey area . 
  i think suspending parents ' legal guardianship is a pretty drastic step and should be reserved for stuff that 's more black-and-white than this . 
  yeah , sure . 
  it just sounded as if you were talking about parents making medical decisions for their children in general . 
   the parents are legal guardians and at the moment they legally have the right to decide over their childrens bodies . 
  i do n't agree with that , but it 's factual . 
  what ? 
  how else do you imagine it , a five-year-old `` deciding '' if it should have surgery ? 
  children are simply incapable of making such decisions , the parents have to be in charge . 
  let 's say a child has a serious condition but it 's scared of hospitals and needles , so it cries and yells it does n't want to go , and you ca n't do anything about it because the kid has `` decided over its body '' . 
  it 's insane . 
  see , that 's how to works !, 
  you 're happy , because you are on the happiest nations list , because you were happy , because you were on the happiest nations nations list , because ... you guys just happened to land high in the first edition and since then you have been guaranteed to be perpetually happy . 
  same reason why we are misanthropic , miserable sods . 
  this is the most ridiculously editorialized post i 've seen here since that communist rant about `` working people begging for crumbs from their masters ' hands '' and shit a few months ago . 
  we should start a chart or something . 
  base score for each fallacy and hyperbole , bonus points for poetic metaphors . 
  ( that awkward moment when you do n't know if people are upvoting your comment because they took it seriously or because they got the joke ), 
  this article left out the worst part . 
  for many years the uk supplied syria with large amounts of dihydrogen monoxide , a key chemical used in manufacturing biological weapons . 
  how did you even to get thatcher into this ? 
  you are claiming her philosophy drives dutch policies today when the very topic of the discussion is evidence to the contrary . 
  we are talking about significant subsidies that are bound to distort supply and demand - the exact opposite of a free market . 
  amazing how you 've managed to spin a case of failed government regulation into an argument against the free market . 
  you should be a politician . 
   and i hope that they do n't think that britain/us would go to war just to ` help ' poor syrians . 
  i do think so , except for the `` just '' . 
  yeah , there are other motivations but it does n't mean humanitarianism ca n't be one too . 
   whatever the reason , that 's not it . 
  why does there have to be a single decisive reason ? 
  in geopolitics , especially in such a convoluted clusterfuck of a situation , there are always many factors at play . 
  we can speculate about their relative weights but no single one of them is `` the real reason '' . 
  i think humanitarian concerns definitely are * one * of the reasons here , maybe even the one that tipped the scale . 
  believe it or not , politicians are human . 
  besides , let 's get real , do n't you think countries * should * also consider their own political and economic interests ? 
  but people do n't like to think about it .

  it 's nothing personal , i just treated you like an embodiment of russia for narrative purposes , and i was really pissed , so i 'm sorry . 
   the last few days ithout rain also helped . 
  that 's good . 
  i 'm hoping for the same , but swollen rivers are gon na be a problem . 
  for me , portuguese sounds like a mix of russian and spanish - i speak neither , so that 's just an impression . 
  i really like it , though . 
  my thoughts exactly , 
  [ click and listen ] ( http://translate.google.com/#pl/en/konstantynopolita%c5%84czykiewicz%c3%b3wna ) - that 's the second word , google has some trouble with the first one ...  . 
  and about consonants : ko ** nst ** a ** nt ** ynopolita ** \u0144 ** czykiewi ** cz ** \u00f3wna ** nst ** - you have that in english [ constant , constitution , construction , constable ] ** nt ** - that too [ ant , enter , constant ] ** cz ** - it 's one sound ; like *** ch **** ocolate * ** \u0144 ** is soft - it 's ** ni ** but shorter ; like french * polo **** gn **** e * ** y ** - in polish it 's always a vowel ; like ** i ** in * b **** i **** tch * almost every second phoneme is a vowel . 
  and the division into syllables : kon-stan-ty-no-po-li-ta\u0144-czy-kie-wi-cz\u00f3w-na . 
  and now it looks pretty easy . 
  polish in general - sure . 
  in this case - not really . 
  it 's always moving north . 
  if the czechs have flood , sure thing it comes to us too . 
  it 's not worth it , he clearly has an agenda , so i would n't count on any rational arguments to get through . 
  so those are almost equal parts for poland . 
  i know it looks shitty in comparison to the rest of europe but i was seriously worried it 'd be much worse . 
  i 've never seen any act of * active * intolerance [ i mean violence , not derogatory talking ] , and people i know are in the vast majority perfectly ok with it , but what you can see on the internet forums is really disturbing sometimes . 
  or rather most of the time . 
  and there are haunted far-right politicians who do n't even respect another human being ... 
  but it looks like there 's hope after all . 
  good . 
  true , but vienna was still pretty awesome . 
  but yours is kinda better . 
   but with the eu calling a halt to the testing of healthy cattle at abattoirs , the need for the word vanished . 
  * phew * . 
  i already thought that the word consisted of too many characters and was against some brilliant eu law i did n't know about ... 
  and here i thought that they liked us . . , 
   things were a bit less black-and-white in this conflict . 
  after 123 years of occupation and terror that * ended * in 1918 you 'd have at least a little decency and stayed quiet . 
  ** edit : **  in fact , the entire history of the second polish republic is quite ... interesting ** you 've got to be kidding me ** ... that 's the most hypocritical thing i 've ever heard . 
  here comes the bully and points the finger at the victim and says they hit him back !, 
  russia attacked us , had been destroying the country for thirty years before finaly erased it completely , has occupied it for one hundred and twenty three years , razing , grabbing and killing in the process , over and over , and here you come and have the guts to even mention the second polish republic . 
  unbelievable . 
  ** the republic that would n't be the second , had n't you destroyed the first one !, 
  ** and then you destroyed this one too , and you 've occupied it for another fifty years !, 
  had it been twenty years earlier i 'd say : change the textbook , because your soviet one is biased . 
  and you 're the first russian i 've ever encountered to say such a stupid thing . 
   by the centennial of the siege of vienna , poland was being partitioned . 
  i find it quite ironic that austria was one of the invaders , while the ottoman empire was the only country that found the partitions invalid . 
  one would think it should be the other way around . 
  that 's heartwarming . 
   new york city is not the capital of new york state - it 's albany . 
  holy shit !, 
  we have a word for it : * solidarity * . 
  i want them in europe . 
  well , yes , that 's basically what i meant - the media just make it observable - they 're loud and often take an astonished tone as if what happens is unheard of , 
  and the media are surprised every year !, 
  the next time they 'll be surprised is when snow falls in december ... * just like every year . 
  relax , i was looking for poland and realized my mistake only when i did n't find it ... 
  eurozone , not european union . 
  there 's an [ interesting map ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/mapporn/comments/1f10oi/percentage_of_people_who_consider_themselves/ ) on the subject in general , but unfortunately estonia is omitted . 
  [ there it is .

  you do n't even understand what this is about . 
  you 're a hopeless case . 
  what makes you think that people 's ignorance is suitable measurement of something being significant ? 
  you as a citizen of a country that is so often underestimated should know that . 
  * really * . 
  i 've read an article which stated that they made it obligatory for school children to learn programming languages . 
  they 're the first in europe to do that . 
  if they pass out at 8pm , they probably started drinking the day before , so it 's still a pretty good result . 
  are you ignorant or just mean ? 
  every time you say something like this you end up downvoted . 
  seriously , man , does n't it tell you anything ? 
  it hurts me to see polish flag next to your name ... 
  information without context is worthless . 
  period . 
  the biggest issue this thesis is about are the bystanders . 
  you do realize that poland was the only country where when caught helping the jews one was punished by death on the spot along with his entire family and others who happend to live with them in the same house . 
  who they were was irrelevant . 
  they would have got killed as well . 
  i think this alone explains * the bystander issue * . 
  if i were significantly outnumbered , unarmed , surrounded by the enemy , and under a threat that my actions have a power to hurt not only myself but also the people closest to me , i would think twice before i 'd move a finger . 
  initially i thought it 's a * unicorn * and was like * wtf * ... 
  if you left , they would get a little better . 
  well , we have to agree to disagree . 
    there are problems in the meat industry but that we know about them just shows the checks work you 're right . 
  what scares me is that some dealings had been taking place for so long before they were outed . 
  in other words you trust the system . 
  the system that is proven to be flawed on more than one occasion . 
  the eu regulations are n't some `` by god imposed unbreakable holy laws '' - they 're executed and supervised by people . 
  i think i stick with trusting a single man . 
  too many people in the system to trust them all . 
  i do n't know how it is in other countries but in poland we had a few scandals with meat in the main role even before the one with the horses , so i might be a little paranoid . 
  still , better safe than sorry . 
  and of course there are some proven brands i trust but at the end of the day it 's a mass production and all the things that come with it . 
  my local supermarket - in theory not the best brand as supermarkets go - has incredible rolls - delicious crust , not puffy . 
  better than the ones from an actual bakery that 's just across the street from my home . 
  every morning and every afternoon there 's fresh delivery . 
  people do n't want to believe when i tell them where i buy it . 
  but the same chain 's supermarket in the other part of the city has different supplier and their bread sucks big time . 
  sure i do n't know how the animal was fed but everything what comes next is me trusting - the butcher i buy from does everything by himself . 
  buying animal , killing it , preparing meat , smoking , processing , whatever . 
  it 's a tiny family business , father and son , they 've been in it for years . 
  they care for a client . 
  they have the same clientele for years . 
  people are standing in line for their meat . 
  animals they buy are healthy and checked - he ensures because if something goes wrong his business is going to suffer .

  there 's ~ 1400 tonnes of tnt in that ship ... which makes it very easy , actually : it 's ` equivalent ' ( as in literally ) 1.4 kt of tnt . 
  the smallest nuclear bomb had power equivalent of 10 tonnes of tnt . 
  tactical nuclear weapons have the yield starting from roughly 0.3 kt of tnt , and generally around 1-2 kt of tnt . 
  so yeah , it 's equivalent of tactical nuclear warhead . 
  baltic countries have extremely small pool of people to draw talent from , and only country with similar problem that did qualify is iceland . 
   ... an ethnic group , yes , but not its citizens in general . 
  citizenship was fluid . 
  people displaced in the wars did n't necessarily return to the same place , however there was a state , formerly part of yugoslavia , that could take them after hostilities in ( or rather : between ) each state ceased . 
  that was actually significant issue after each war ended : legal status of former yugoslavian citizens after the dissolution was not easy to determine . 
   being a dissident is the opposite of keeping your mouth shut . 
  it does n't matter . 
  if my political opinion can result in my persecution ( which in turn threatens my life and freedom ) , i 'm entitled to keep the refugee status . 
  `` keeping your mouth shut '' has literally no impact on anything . 
   wat war crimes in yugoslav wars were mostly ethnic in nature . 
  think serbs killing croats , croats killing serbs . 
  not croats killing croats . 
  or , as in srebrenica , mix of ethnic and religious issues ( but still : serbs killing bosniaks ) . 
  the result of the war was establishing states : croatia , slovenia , serbia , macedonia , bosnia and herzegovina , montenegro and recently kosovo . 
  each state was safe for  if you 're chinese you wo n't get asylum here in the usual case even though that place is a dictatorship . 
  explains 200 000 chinese refugees currently recognized as such . 
   safe country of origin '' does n't mean `` western standards '' , it means `` you can live a safe life there '' . 
  to be precise :  no contracting state shall expel or return ( '' refouler '' ) a refugee in any manner whatsoever to the frontiers of territories where his life or freedom would be threatened on account of his race , religion , nationality , membership of a particular social group or political opinion . 
  in other words , if life or freedom of a refugee is threatened on account of his membership to particular social group or political opinion , he can not be expelled . 
  given the nature of assad regime , assuming nothing changes in that regard , that will apply to vast majority of syrians . 
  and no , `` keeping mouth shut '' is not valid approach when `` not keeping your mouth shut '' results in torture , imprisonment and potential execution . 
  taking your own example : see chinese dissidents . 
   getting back to yugoslavia again : we sent young people who spent their whole school lives here back . 
  forcibly . 
  yes ... because it 's hard to argue serbia is not safe for serbs and so on . 
  that 's why there were legal grounds to do that . 
  if the outcome of the war was different , let 's say bosnia did n't maintain it 's independence and was under serbian rule , and milosevic & co. remained in power , you would not be able to expel any bosniaks . 
  similarly , if assad remains in power , vast majority of syrian refugees will be able to claim it 's unsafe for them to return ( due to ethnicity and political opinion ) . 
  some will return regardless , but that 's the point : if they already settled , and have an option to stay , the longer they stay they less likely they 're going to move back under own volition . 
   as far as i know , theres a lot of polish people working in sweden in construction without any language skills nor higher education , how hard is it to hit something with a hammer ? 
  no , poles working in sweden are mostly seasonal laborers . 
  that 's the major difference . 
  sure , syrians can do that too but they wo n't be able to support themselves in sweden all-year-round that way . 
   to an interview ? 
  yes . 
  i can sort out obvious fakes in under five minutes , and assess coding chops accurately in thirty . 
  if you say so . 
  i 'm yet to hear about such hiring process , but hey - ymmv . 
   no , it wo n't . 
  have a look at how long it took for the yugoslavian refugees to return to then already not yugoslavia . 
  the comparison is completely absurd . 
  there 's no parallels between dissolution of yugoslavia and current conflict in syria . 
  the key here is dissolution : yugoslavia was federation , with each member-state maintaining certain degree of autonomy . 
  each member state mostly did n't commit crimes against own citizens either . 
  wars were fought between countries declaring independence , not within country . 
  there were distinct , safe entities for refugees to get back to . 
  syria on the other hand is not going to be safe even after the conflict ends , at least the way it currently goes . 
  assuming assad regime wins ( and that 's the most likely outcome right now ) , the government of syria will still be responsible for crimes against humanity . 
  it will not be possible to qualify it as ` safe ' for any western nation , and as such : it will be impossible to forcefully ` get rid ' of the refugees . 
  sure , some portion of refugees will opt to get back anyway . 
  it 's unlikely those already in eu will do so , even though they do declare that now . 
  the longer they are here , the better situation we put them in ( read : job , language etc. 
  ) , the less likely it is . 
   all they care about is that you can code , not how you learned it . 
  ... yes ... 
  but they still want to know you can code . 
  you ca n't just barge into office , say `` i can code '' and get going . 
  the process of vetting potential employee takes time even if you have clear legal status and references from previous employers . 
  hiring someone on face value is always a risk , and state will have to subsidize such risk for companies to take it , or mitigate it through other means ( courses , exams etc. 
  designed to verify qualifications ) . 
  even than you only made those people remotely competitive , not guaranteed the employment . 
   getting an education will help them a lot in syria once the country becomes livable , again . 
  it 's also going to do wonders to syria . 
  first of all , there 's very slim chance any of those people will ever go back to syria . 
  even assuming the conflict ends tomorrow , it will take decades for the country to achieve the ` safe ' status in the eyes of western countries ( assuming it will ever get one ) . 
  than there 's issue of market for qualified labour : again , first people to have future in syria wo n't be the ones with higher education . 
  it will take another couple decades for the job market to stabilize into something remotely resembling that of netherlands , sweden or even pre-war syria . 
  sure it is n't free of engineers . 
  however , you need to prove you 're engineer to be treated as such . 
  i 'm not denying there 's quite a lot of highly educated syrians ( and other nationalities ) in that group . 
  the issue is verification . 
  if i wanted to work in sweden , everything in my cv is verifiable . 
  it 's hard to verify something however , when the institutions and companies previously employing your prospective employee got blown up . 
  things like simple references are a problem . 
  that 's main issue . 
  sure , programmer does n't need explicit education as long as he actually has knowledge . 
  however , no company will employ a programmer without any references . 
  as for other trades : again , there are legal issues . 
  you gave example of a cook . 
  here in poland cooks and anyone involved in preparation of food have to have health and safety training , as well as undergo medical screening . 
  for that said cook ( or any help in kitchen ) pretty much has to know at least rudimentary polish . 
  sure , some jobs actually do n't require similar qualification , or are not regulated at all . 
  however we run into structural issues . 
  qualifications of people already in a country might not be compatible with job market at hand . 
  in other words , sure : carpenter can start working from day 1 . 
  however there are simply no job offers for carpenters in the country . 
  swedes want stricter control ? 
  last time i heard they wanted more immigrants . 
   the best qualified best qualified to do what exactly ? 
  without language skills , education impossible to nostrificate and metric ton of other issues i ca n't really think of any qualified labour those people could do . 
  wp is great os , superior to android in many regards . 
  the thing is , it 's neither polished , closely controlled system ios is , nor complete anarchy android turned out to be . 
  being in a middle without strong branding to truly compete did n't really work out for them . 
  tourism . 
   if you vote right-wing conservatives into office you know that this is the result . 
  the thing is , ` people ' did n't .

  no , mostly low gun ownership . 
   well , urban planning is almost non-existent in polish cities yeah ... it 's one of few factors , where communist period was better . 
  they had actually very good urban planning . 
  i live in early 1980s housing , and generally like it - sensible gaps between buildings , lots of green ; planned & built infrastructure ( like schools , market etc. 
  ) ; good commuting ( bus etc. 
   i 'm really not sure that 's true . 
  it might be not true just about you . 
   i mean , any hate for outsiders seems like an abstract thing . 
  one might hold some unfavorable stereotypes ... 
  compare our massive * islamophobia * ( let 's put aside whether it 's a good or bad thing ) with number of muslims in poland . 
  let 's be sincere , we hate each other ** less ** than we hate foreigners . 
  actually , on contrary , poland is rather safe , with very low rate of murders , and low of robberies . 
  major exception are car accidents , mostly due to our bad driving culture . 
  gated communities are rather an example of many poles being suspicious and distrustful to other kinsmen ( not even talking about foreigners ) . 
  even on private ( single ) properties you would often notice high fences or hedges . 
  poster above talked about `` elite thinkers '' , not average politicians . 
  neither he is an isolationist . 
  i would say that both ( obama and clinton ) are generally appeasers , albeit of course hillary is a hawk-ish one . 
  so yeah , imho she would more or less continue obama 's foreign policy ( dunno about other fields , but it 's less important from our pov ) . 
  trump would be definitely a worst case scenario . 
  free world still needs america , despite of all their flaws . 
  that 's the problem . 
  pis way of thinking is n't `` we are asking '' ( supplicant ) , it 's `` we are entitled '' ( victim ) . 
   considering clinton 's investment in conflicts in the middle east and africa i would n't call her isolationists . 
  neither did i. i said that trump is one . 
  there is no `` republican '' or `` democrat '' foreign policy . 
  both parties have groups and politicians supporting different stances : isolationists , hawks , appeasers et caetera . 
   piss off basically all of the eu ( minus hungary ) i still think that orban is actually using us , like `` you see eu , we [ hungary ] are not so bad '' . 
  yes , because of course average joe knows better . 
  not so funny if watched from inside poland . 
   considering the various countries that happen to be american allies throughout the world it was a thing during the cold war , when us supported some very nasty guys all over the world , but rather changed after 1989 . 
  now unless you have a really strong geographic , military or resources card ( like turkey , egypt or saudi arabia ) , you pretty much should stay a liberal democracy . 
  not doing it might not mean a lack of support ... but definitely at least a cold shoulder . 
   just wait another year until obama is out of office . 
  regardless of who gets elected ( trump , cruz or hilary ) the us will be willing to lease at least a token airbase in poland . 
  not a chance . 
  clinton would probably continue obama 's foreign policy , and trump is an isolationist , and would be eager to deal with putin . 
   sikorski , was a pis politician . 
  he was never a member of pis . 
  he was a minister in first pis-lead government . 
  along with some other sensible people , like religa or meller . 
   as a ~ ~ lechia ~ ~ arka fixed . 
   was n't poland the last country in europe to execute a man for atheism as recent as 130 years ago ? 
  no , it happened [ 200 hundred years ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kazimierz_%c5%81yszczy%c5%84ski ) earlier . 
   one of the last lynchings for witchcraft was also poland ~ 180 years ago . 
  it was part of prussia then . 
   something like joining eu one thousand years later  exactly . 
  sticking to paganism then would be like staying out of eu now . 
  look like it ended for polabians ( with our shameful help ) . 
   a main source of incoming is publishing and charging for these scientific papers . 
  paper = usually a text ( article ) in scientific journal , post-symposium publication , etc. 
   so even if the book barely sells , the publishing houses really do n't make a loss on it . 
  and prices are horrendous . 
  routledge publisher . 
  50-60 pounds for a 250-300 pages paperback ? 
  seriously ? 
   they did n't even last 2 last time lol they did n't have individual majority then . 
   just please do n't go full pis ;-) only 3,5 years more . 
  please wait . 
   if it had more power it would become oligarchy , if it 's not already that . 
  that 's why with more power should go more democracy . 
  direct election of commission president ( it 's just an example ) , with different candidates ( epp , pasd etc. ), 
  proposing different supranational platforms . 
   there are pizzarias in denmark , mostly western denmark , which serve pizzas with b\u00e9arnaise sauce on them . 
  sometimes i seriously think you danes try to topple english cuisine from the `` worst one '' throne . 
   as for topping i got no idea which one would be a typically polish judging on popularity : ** hawajska ** ( hawaii ) , with pineapple ( hate it ) & tuna/ham , sometimes also maize . 
  and essential garlic sauce ( hate it ) , and on thick crust ( hate it ) . 
  seriously , it 's everywhere . 
  however , if you think `` local '' pizza , it would probably involve kabanos & pickled cucumbers . 
  and yeah , garlic sauce . 
  somebody else could read that and learn something . 
  little strokes fell great oaks . 
  at least here we can agree . 
  by the way , that 's probably why this idea is proposed by kukiz . 
  he clearly knows , that it ca n't be done , so is using it for gaining support via `` compromise stance '' . 
  so gossip / homewomen 's media ( tips , recipes etc. 
  ) , telecasts , and bunch of local/regional dailies . 
  you seriously mean that * gazeta lubuska * , * z \u017cycia wzi\u0119te * , * na \u017cywo * or * tele \u015awiat * are influential on political opinions of poles ? 
  here are similar outlines of [ tv stations , national newspaper and weeklies ] ( http://static1.money.pl/i/h/74/art377930.jpg ) . 
  what is ( partially ) german-owned : major tabloid , one of major radio stations , and one of major weeklies . 
  except last one ( * newsweek * ) neither of those is known for strongly anti-pis stance . 
   what vast majority of german media in poland say . 
  major anti-pis media are : daily newspaper * gazeta wyborcza * ( polish owned , own company ) , weekly * polityka * ( polish , self-owned cooperative ) and television tvn ( controlled by american scripps networks interactive ) . 
  so where are your `` germans '' ? 
  it 's not international , it 's eu . 
   let 's check : before the elections , the tvp broadcaster was a propaganda tube for the old po government . 
  after the elections , the tvp broadcaster was turned into the propaganda tube for new pis government . 
  indeed , the difference is staggering . 
  but po did n't fire tvp journalists because of political reasons before ( sometimes they moved them to different , less prominent departments , but still on tvp payroll ) . 
  now pis openly fires many tvp journalists . 
  but previously it was at least more or less pluralist . 
  jan po\u015bpieszalski ( a major pro-pis publicist ) had his talk-show through whole po rule ( albeit it was moved in 2011 to tvp info ) . 
  while now tvp agenda is purely pro-government . 
   all i can see is the eu meddling in the domestic affairs of a sovereign nation . 
  all i can see is the eu worrying abouut the domestic affairs of its member nation . 
   no human right or democracy has been violated separation of powers , which is one of foundations of democracy , was and is violated . 
   how on earth is fidesz still hanging in there ? 
  diplomacy . 
  contrary to kaczy\u0144ski , orban knows how to appease opponents with small concessions . 
   it is body that used to have mostly judges coming from opposing party .

  they 're still against the change proposed by pis, 
   the baby is already in a womb . 
  it 's still the woman 's womb and not anyone else . 
  this changes nothing . 
  because you did n't adress the issue of body autonomy . 
  edit : yougotmoxy addressed the issue later in the comments and he values the life of a foetus more than body autonomy of the mother . 
   criminalize killing the child out of the country . 
  already done in poland . 
  metaphor is great . 
  it 's woman 's decision whether she let the foetus use her womb or not . 
  66 % are against , 4 % does n't have opinion on this . 
  communist regime is n't positive cart in polish history but they did few positive things regarding women 's rights and gender equality . 
   restricting in this context does not equal illegal except it does . 
  fuck off with this cppy-pasted pile of bullshit , you spambot . 
  majority does n't , but according to pis , they have `` democratic mandate '' so they can do whatever they want . 
  they showed it with all the shit they 've done to our constitutional court . 
   those kids [ picture of an oak ] ( https://www.diki.pl/images-common/words400/acorn.jpg ) even if foetus was a `` kid '' , a woman is still not in any obligation ( apart from legal in certain countries ) to provide her body to it . 
  it 's the same principle that makes legal not donating kidneys to someone who would die without transplantation . 
  according to wikipedia it 's less strict . 
  it looks like if woman 's health were to suffer she still has to give birth in roi . 
   if it 's because he took a look at poland 's birthrate and concluded it 's been falling at a consistent rate since 2011 that would make it debatable . 
  people are n't breeding cattle . 
  we already have * one of the most * restrict abortion law in europe ( not counting microstates ) : a woman may perform abortion if : 1 . 
  pregnancy is the effect of forbidden act ( such as rape ) , and the foetus/embryo has less than 12 weeks ; 2 . 
  pregnancy threatens woman 's life or health ( no limit ) 3 . 
  the foetus/embryo is uncurabely sick/damaged ( microcephalia , down syndrome etc. 
  ) , but not if it can survive outside of mother 's womb however the gynaecologist may deny the abortion due to conscience clause . 
  he may also not tell the woman where she can legal abortion and who will perform it due to ruling of constitutional court ( back in the days , when its ruling were respected ) . 
  many abortions are masked `` involuntary miscarriages '' due to stigma . 
  wealthy women often go to slovakia , czech republic or germany for their abortions . 
  ----------- edit : sorry , forgot about ireland . 
  it 's not popular and it has racial connotations . 
  edit : downvotes may hide my comment but wo n't change the fact that it 's still a slur . 
   the power balance is directly connected to the skills . 
  no , not really . 
  without restrictions set by the state , the employer has massive advantage over the employee , like in xix-xx century filled with awful lowly-paid jobs without security nets . 
  of course some extreme rare jobs like nuclear engineer or neural surgeon are exception to this but this does n't change the situations of millions of other , more easily replaced people . 
  pis is n't `` far '' right . 
  kukiz '15 is . 
  cut this eristic and do n't put words i have n't said in my mouth . 
  desirability of someone 's skill have little effect on someone 's salary if there 's big imbalance between powers of employer and employee . 
   the right gives more support to poor people who want to work offering them fantastic proposition of staying poor but with a job . 
  do n't worry , pis government ** will * find a way to lower our international reputation even more . 
  and the third of my country will applaud them . 
  how convenient for orban 's `` evil degenerated decadent liberal west '' narrative . 
  [ europe according to yanks ] ( http://i.imgur.com/yakxt5l.png ), 
   unless you count the victims of 50 years of communist occupation . 
  and maybe some killings made by anti-communist insurgency . 
  regardless of it , poland had n't any civilian run amok and shoot people for half of century . 
   also , do you know that the reduction in arms for civilians was a soviet strategy aimed at controlling the enslaved populations ? 
  `` do you know who else did x thing ? 
  hitler did ! '', 
  type of argument . 
   it 's even visible in the rates of eastern vs western europe . 
  ** what ** ratios ? 
   i see you proudly continue the homo sovieticus legacy . 
  not wanting to turn my country into lilttle us with little sandy hook or columbia massacres does n't make me homo sovieticus , it makes me not a fucking moron . 
  no , poland has one of the smallest gun ownership ratio and i like it this way . 
  no shootings , no massacres since the wwii . 
  these feels are n't relevant here . 
  almost nobody in europe `` identifies '' as an european . 
  does n't change the fact that british people are europeans . 
   i found it as second link in google , so it ca n't be so dangerous . 
  sweet summer child . 
  gun shows . 
  more like malware & invasive ads warning . 
  i bet ewoks were communist . 
  did n't you watch star wars ? 
  separatists are bad guys !, 
  and marathons and film theatres and schools, 
  maybe it 's thing in english . 
  britain is in europe you arrogant orangutan-faced fat bastard . 
  polish statistics on abortion are untrustworthy . 
  even if we wo n't count the illegal underground abortions and `` abortion tourism '' , legal abortions are often hid as natural miscarriages to avoid bad press . 
  yea this looks like an attempt to milk our forests . 
  courts have ruled that 's not allowed to sell forests , so they 'll made money out of `` infected '' trees . 
   i think it 's stupid but this is essentially what people over there wanted . 
  no , it 's not . 
  on the wood market , there will be mass amount of wood that was magically un-infested ... 
  it 's irrelevant because communists have made us one of the most homogenised societies in the world , not only by expulsions of non-poles but also with forced disappearance of regional dialects , tradition and quirks . 
  you do realise there was more terrorist attacks in xix and xx century than now and europe survived this ? 
  yep , poland is now a caliphate because of it . 
  yes . 
  poland-lithuania may have been , but it 's irrelevant now . 
  these two comments are awful , sexist and repulsive, 
  it 's called karma pimping, 
  so it 's good ruling then .

  in contrast , in poland , when i needed to open company account , it was a matter of going into a branch , waiting 15 minutes in line , sitting there for 40 minutes , providing one one-time code which arrived on my mobile phone , and i could go home and do transfers . 
  or when i wanted to log in to my * private * health insurance operator 's website , just to see what is possible via it . 
  after waiting for the letter ( ~ a week , i almost managed to forget what i wanted from the damned site ) , after i got back from my comfy overtime in the evening , i log in , and what ? 
  `` sorry , our website is available only during business hours '' . 
  this is rich . 
  as a person living in germany for the last 1,5 years , i 've yet to encounter this `` being smart about solving problems '' attitude in any company . 
  seriously , you guys seem to love to overly complicate the simplest things , give any bullshit reason as to why it is so complicated , and at the end , when i ask why on earth is it so damn complex , i * always * hear : `` how would you like to have it different ? 
  it 's impossible ! '' . 
  and when i tell about solutions from either poland or any other country , it 's always `` ooooh , right . 
  this way . 
  i guess you are right and it could be simpler after all '' . 
  are any of them looking for you know , less popular places ? 
  those would be the smart ones ... 
  which is exactly why they wo n't be too woried about too many other laws afterwards . 
  or is the parallel here somehow not applicable ? 
  i mentioned elsewhere , that i want my gut feeling to be wrong . 
  i have good feeling about his wife , though . 
  she seems energetic and driven , and looks as if she puts her attention somewhere , great things may follow . 
  well , most of my friends are reasonably well off , i agree . 
  and i really want to be wrong on this one . 
  i do . 
  i do n't like duda personally , and as a person ( he gives me chills and a shady vibe , with his fake smile glued on his face all the time ) , but it 's actually his ideas that are scary , how they do n't add up , economically . 
  i mean , raise the tax exemption ? 
  great , i 'm all for it , sounds like a win-win-win all around . 
  but how is pushing it immediately into next budget is going to help that budget ? 
  and where exactly will the cuts be ? 
  oh , you want to tax big business ? 
  great , i guess noone will care that big retail will move the tax cost onto customers . 
  and making poland economically less interesting for new big business sounds like a terrific idea . 
  lowering pension age back to old level ? 
  again , win win and win , right ? 
  but does that mean that all those small entrepreneurs trying to make ends meet will now have to pay 1700 for social security instead of already heavy 1200 , regardless of incomes ? 
  ( numbers taken out of ass , btw , it should be about the principle ), 
  well , some of us do remember , as during pis government one of the many points to fear was warrantless arrests in front of the cameras in order to scare people into submission . 
  and some may say that voting for duda does n't mean pis will win in the autumn , but there are also alarmingly many declarations that people take their victory now as the first step , and will try to bring pis back to power . 
  or to draw things differently : i left poland 1,5 years ago and not because i had to , or felt politically forced to . 
  no i had the opportunity ( education , skills and languages ) , and wanted to experience first hand the so called greatness of western countries . 
  see how the people live , day to day , how the companies operate , how the government works , etc. 
  the last months i had been leaning with my wife to start planning getting back - choosing where to , deciding if we want to buy a flat , or a house , or rent altogether , etc. 
  the rough horizon was some 2 years from now . 
  if pis wins in the autumn , in 2 years i will be checking out the political climate and most probably not thinking about getting back . 
  if i do during pis reign , i will most probably stash my savings outside of poland , and do my best to keep a low profile , because i do n't want to give of the vibe that since i 'm doing reasonably well , that means it must be something shady in my doing behind it . 
  it 's it really weird , that i fear for the next few years of my country ? 
  i mean look at it , even if you yourself do n't remember last time pis was in power : how bad must have had it been , for `` we 're not pis '' to become a valid political identity for 8 fucking years ? 
  and now we 're voting those people back to power ? 
  kukiz has no men to sit in the government . 
  tough to answer , from what i 've gathered most of his ( vocalized ) opinions are just whatever people want to hear , without any bit of being precise , and he changes what he 's saying every time he 's being asked . 
  but technically , he 's not really that wrong . 
  bronek should have not been sleeping over the campaign !, 
  sounds about 100 % accurate . 
  fuck that , good that i 'm already abroad , now i can at least harbour new fugitive . 
  europe - brace yourselves , some 80 % of my friends , and people on twitter comment about getting out of country asap . 
  most of it wo n't happen , obviously , but i 'm afraid that if pis ( the opposing party behind andrzej duda ) wins the autumn elections , then the shit will get real . 
  there are very few people who actually are ready for what jaros\u0142aw kaczy\u0144ski can have for poland in store ... 
  well , i 'll let you know when i find a way to describe mr kaczy\u0144ski in the same degree of truthfulness in terms that do n't tingle your spider-political correctness senses . 
  had he tried to become prime minister , it president himself - no problem . 
  but he got himself two puppets in highest offices of the land , and he controls everything , yet has no accountability and personal responsibility . 
  he really seems to be wanting to become dictator , and he do n't care for any and all democratic offices that are put in place in order to prevent exactly this kind of situations . 
  i 'm not claiming that the last government was saint ( or any of the past ones , on that matter ) , but they were not trying to dismantle the damn democracy . 
  well , the goal is probably to incentivize producents to come up with products that contain less sugar , so that there is more choices for people who want to eat healthier , but do n't want to be limited to one goddamn food that 's actually not sweetened, 
  no , i 'm asking what makes a human human . 
  opposable thumb ? 
  specific dna ? 
  soul ? 
  general intelligence ? 
  faith in god ? 
  ability to reason and discover and manipulate environment ? 
  self awareness ? 
  self preservation instinct ? 
  on the other hand : if you had 100 various fetuses in various stages of development from various species ( including great apes , and maybe other human - already extinct - species ) how would you tell which ones are human , and even more importantly - which ones are the right kind of human ? 
  ok , what makes a human being ? 
  i 'm really interested in understanding your position . 
  how is this progressive ? 
  `` democratically elected '' bunch of fucks , mind you . 
  still make me ashamed of my heritage, 
  also , jail doctors if there was harm to the fetus due to prenatal examination . 
  and ban contraceptives . 
  and limit in vitro fertilization ( they already canceled funding , so anyone who wants to undergo the procedure must fund it themself , and it costs some 5-8 times average monthly salary for one attempt ) , so that only one egg may be fertilized at a time . 
  this would bring effectiveness of the in vitro fertilization down to at best 4 % . 
  oh , and our bishops compared yesterday 's marches and protests to black masses and death civilization . 
  the favourite comparison is yet still nazi eugenics programmes . 
  wonderful country to stay in , a true museum of the middle ages . 
  heh , beyond madness . 
  he just announced on television that he does not respect anyone who `` dresses funny and walks in protest '' in a matter of life and death like this , while he was holding a picture of the protesters . 
  it `` is offensive to him '' that people protest . 
  ca n't make this shit up . 
  dude , you misspelled `` get shot down '' / s, 
  i think ( have n't been to poland for a while now ) they need prescription , which the doctor can deny on grounds of acting in accordance with his conscience , and if you have the prescription you need to find them in a pharmacy that has it , and where the pharmacist wo n't deny selling them to you based on his conscience . 
  generally : good luck with that . 
  you got fucked last night in a positive ( hopefully ) way , enjoy getting fucked by the stupid law now . 
  correct me if i 'm mistaken . 
  as a pole in germany : polish 4g beats german 4g without competition . 
  i mean , fuck it 's archaic here in de ... 
  is ... is romania poland ? 
  well , at least one person - that is minister of justice , no less - was caught red handed and on video as he had signed the presence list after the vote was over . 
  that means that he may or may have not been there during the vote . 
  but the list should be secured afterwards . 
  there are votes that there were people unauthorized to vote casting the votes , and there is no way of knowing that , because the only camera operating was a cctv with too narrow fov , and not the whole hall was visible during the vote . 
  it 's a mess . 
  no poland yet ?

  nothing makes me rethink my generally leftist views like other leftits . 
  people are fucked in the head , man, 
  whynotboth.jpg it 's from erasmus , but i also do n't get any other sort of loan/grant , so ... : <, 
   it 's a set of values . 
  well , about them `` values '' of immigrants ... 
  150 $ here , what the fuck, 
   avoiding their responsibility our fucking what ? 
  yes , but just a couple orders of magnitude less of them . 
  small detail .

  watch out man , cultural relativism is right there in the new rules of this sub : ^ ), 
   does it mean that sweden is ruined ? 
  you can ask / r/european about it, 
  i 've felt nothing but disgust towards their government since i found out their foreign minister is an old communist piece of shit who openly endorsed the supression of polish independence movements . 
  their dealing with russia did n't help at all . 
  i wo n't comment on their economic policy because i 'm clearly very biased and i do n't want any greeks to give me lectures about austerity . 
   other feels good that they escaped from the soviets , cancelled their industry and now are toilet cleaners of europe  i 'm expecting a normal discussion . 
  haha , that 's not how it works , fuck you, 
  i 'm honestly considering going back to firefox , chrome 's been getting worse and worse for me . 
  i already use it for facebook and youtube because they keep freezing my pc in chrome , just need to gather some motivation to set up all the addons and settings i need for the full switch, 
  let me just ask , are you the austrian leftist who one time claimed that communist occupation was a positive thing for latvia because it `` created economic growth impossible under capitalism '' ? 
  if it 's you , congratulations , it 's still the dumbest thing i ever read . 
   the eu should n't demand it why ? 
  this is such a fucking strange thing to oppose . 
  are you against calorie labels on food ? 
  edit : and by `` food '' i mean `` other sources of energy that can be used by humans '', 
   my main point is that people know how to drink alcohol and do n't need to be educated with warning labels . 
  guess what , i agree . 
  however , since calorie labels are not warning labels , i do n't see how that 's connected . 
  calories are just units of energy , man . 
   and if you are health obsessed you can find all the information you need online . 
  or i could find all the information i need on a tiny calorie content label on my bottle , just like i do for everything else i eat or drink . 
  so you can only not consume alcohol at all , or be an alcoholic ? 
  so the only people who can make use of calorie labels are bodybuilder , like arnold or coleman ? 
  not that it matters , because above i 've just posted a picture of a [ bodybuilder/pt/fitness guru ] ( http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_dtawqzv6d7m/s6f7xk71z7i/aaaaaaaaaka/-dg_sxvnpfc/s1600-h/dsc00316.jpg ) who admits to binge drinking all the time . 
  you 've now seen an `` alcoholic '' bodybuilder . 
  here 's a [ reading for you on the actual effect of alcohol . 
  ] ( http://www.leangains.com/2010/07/truth-about-alcohol-fat-loss-and-muscle.html ) you really wo n't be able to make a good point here , because you 're just wrong . 
  drinking alcohol does not a make a fit lifestyle impossible , calorie labels on alcohol are objectively a convenient , good thing . 
   i am not health obsessed . 
  of course you 're not , your ignorance in health matters shows that very well . 
  yeah when you get them in cans like me :d, 
  so you need to drink a bottle of vodka a day to possibly make use of calorie labels ? 
  i really do n't know where you 're going with this logic man, 
  money 's tight so i 'm very rarely at restaurants ( pls gib bitcoin ) processed ? 
  i 'm in germany and absolutely everything except for alcohol has its calorie content shown, 
   nobody who cares about their body drinks lots of alcohol [ tfw tonight , after my workout and a quick shower , i 'm going to get smashed on vodka with the most dedicated fitness chick in our entire gym ] ( https://c2.staticflickr.com/6/5298/5523482703_1e33825d32.jpg ) really bro , take your misconceptions about alcohol somewhere else ( to some straight edge ~ ~ circlejerk ~ ~ community ? 
  ) , the actual negative effect of getting wasted once in a while is a negligible , short-term decrease in testosterone levels , and that 's about it . 
  oh , and ** you have to guess the calories because there 's no labels . 
   if you drink much alcohol your problem is n't likely to be calories . 
  according to ? 
  i drink `` much alcohol '' , i also religiously count calories both for bulking and cutting and alcohol is the only area where i have to either guess or get my info from weird webpages ( and each one of them gives you different numbers ) . 
  this is really where you decided to make your libertarian stand ? 
  small , informative , useful labels on something that clearly wo n't even affect you ? 
  so what is supposed to be the argentinian claim to the falklands ? 
  `` we owned the place for like a year in 1830s , give back our rightful clay '' ? 
  an example of the elusive [ `` zmiana '' ] ( http://partia-zmiana.pl/biography/ ) electorate ? 
  ussr was russian empire 2.0 , obviously it was pretty bad for russians when it finally fell apart . 
  tough shit , maybe russians should n't have depended on a bunch of occupied nations and puppet states that absolutely hated them . 
  you know , the german loss in ww2 was pretty bad for many germans at the time , but you would n't be arguing that it was n't a good thing , would you ? 
  that 's a lot of conviction for a moron who ca n't tell if ravensbr\u00fcck is in poland or germany . 
  have a shitty day . 
  it wo n't change the fact that you still hold this idiotic opinion about poland, 
  master troler or are you that stupid ? 
  dude 's comment was  the poles were and are extremely anti-semitic . 
   this is not an accident ca n't escape the shame !, 
  mods censor things here all the time , i believe most threads about muslim migrants drowning christian migrants were quietly deleted, 
  sorry man , but it is a bit sickening that you 're now conditioned to jump to `` evil european colonisation '' as soon as you see `` place outside of europe '' and `` christianity '' in the same sentence . 
  social justice !, 
  disclaimer : after writing all this , i realized that you might not have been in sound mental health while replying . 
  just so you know - if you want to delete this mess of a post from above , calm down and answer what i actually wrote , not some imagined manifesto where i claim to hate all russians and consider them subhuman animals , go ahead . 
  i think that could only improve the discussion . 
  but in case you ca n't or do n't want to keep your victim complex under control , here we go :  first of all , there is no ` god_emperor ' in russia , do n't confuse us with poland . 
  no jokes allowed in soviet russia , got it . 
   secondly , the idea of that video was that ` russian occupation ' was n't entirely negative for the region , and had its positive sides , which is completely true . 
  we bring many factory and car for uncivilized balt i wo n't argue history with you , this post will be long enough as it is . 
  clearly you 're one of the russians who think balts do n't have the capacity to build factories by themselves . 
  why is russian occupation in quotes ? 
  still going by that kremlin narrative where they willingly joined you or something ? 
   have n't even experienced yourself i need to be personally deported to syberia by the nkvd or i 'm not allowed to feel what my grandmother felt . 
  i need to be personally starved to death by russians in prison or i 'm not allowed to feel what my grand-grandfather felt ( this one might be hard ) . 
  good to know . 
   justify your hatred towards an entire nation  and last but not least , people in russia are all individual people with different views and opinions . 
  okay , this is going to be the key here . 
  both my post specifically adressed the crazy bunch of ussr apologists on / r/russia , not the entire nation , and i think that would be perfectly clear to a person with average reading comprehension skills . 
  are you projecting ? 
  replying to what you wish i wrote , not what i did ? 
  while certain data , like putin 's approval rating or stalin 's recent popularity , give a quite * unsettling * view of the nation in general , that is beyond this discussion . 
  believe it or not , i have some russian friends/acquaintances , they just happen not to be ussr apologists , at least not when i 'm around . 
  i also know a russian who told me my grandmother probably deserved to be sent to syberia at 11 years old , that guy does belong to the group i hate . 
  see the difference ? 
   you still feel some sort of anger towards me just becuase i 'm russian and because i love my country and am proud of its history then it speaks volumes about you , not me . 
  no , it speaks only about you . 
  i do n't feel anger towards you because you 're russian . 
  i feel anger towards you because of your attitude towards your history . 
  i 'll be frank here because this is not your / r/russia hugbox , sorry : your history is horrible . 
  russia brought insane amounts of suffering both abroad and to it 's own citizens .

  so you * did n't * meant slavic countries then , as the peculiarity you seem to be interested in is the fact that they suffered under the soviet ocupation for half of century , not their language family . 
  the fundamental difference you seem to have missed is that it were the neighbouring countries which * came to * their hungarian minorities , and not the other way around . 
  yet . 
  also , look up the south china sea dispute if you think they do n't . 
  good riddance . 
  so is norway and iceland . 
  on this particular map it 's eu + efta . 
  looks familiar . 
  i guess [ this one ] ( https://www.google.ee/search?q=lasnam%c3%a4e&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ei=xqluvb-_ksgnsghdmyhgdw&amp;ved=0cacq_auoaq&amp;biw=1366&amp;bih=667#tbm=isch&amp;q=ursyn%c3%b3w ) might be warsaw 's equivalent of it . 
  [ this one is in the fucking centre of the city ] ( https://www.google.ee/search?q=lasnam%c3%a4e&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ei=xqluvb-_ksgnsghdmyhgdw&amp;ved=0cacq_auoaq&amp;biw=1366&amp;bih=667#tbm=isch&amp;q=za+%c5%bcelazn%c4%85+bram%c4%85 ) though , and i do n't think anything beats this monstrosity . 
   against russia ? 
  fuck no . 
  if we are now thinking about a scenario in which russia wo n't use wmds ( because , well , everyone is fucked once nukes start to be launched ) our forces are certainly strong enough to hold ground until us army ( and the rest of nato ) arrives . 
  it 's not like russia would use 100 % of their forces in such strike either , they have a lot of territory to defend . 
  imagine a typical boring and ugly commieblock estate on the outskirts of the city planned according to the sickest visions of le corbusier . 
  now make it 20 times bigger and have it * instead * of the city , because * nothing * in the city survived the ww2 and only a few selected landmarks were rebuilt . 
  and there are some a bit more bearable modern buildings built in empty spaces between commieblocks . 
  congratulations , now you have seen warsaw . 
  shame , because it was such a great city while it still existed . 
  at least for polish , half of those seem completely random . 
  not surprised by `` jan pawe\u0142 ii '' , `` polska '' or `` warszawa '' making the top though . 
  support of knp-without-korwin is 0.1 % though . 
   congress of the new right it 's called korwin ( * coalition of polish republic 's renewal - freedom and hope * ) now . 
   they do n't have any documents well , you are certainly not helping your point by pointing out that . 
  for all we know , they might be wanted criminals fleeing the justice system who threw their documents out in order to avoid identification . 
   centuries of statelessness a ** century ** of statelessness . 
  an important distinction , because you make it sound as if it was a half of millenium or something , and only then a mysterious polish nation suddenly appeared out of thin air . 
  also , as you can read in the very article you have linked , polish nationalism started to develop * the very moment * we have lost our independence , or even right before that moment . 
  the following 100 years of being divided between the three empires , along with 50 years of soviet occupation were obviously important to its development , but so were the preceding 800 years of polish statehood half of which we spent as one of the primary european powers . 
  our sense of national identity is a hybrid of those factors , and in your posts you observe a very narrow portion of it , which leads to hillariously inaccurate results . 
   you are not understanding what i 'm saying at all , sorry you are neither particularly knowledgeable on the topic , nor are results of your analysis an accurate description of the current state of affairs . 
  i understand very well what you are saying - unfortunately you are completely missing the point and while i appreciate your efforts , they are laughable at best . 
   here you 've conflated me saying the polish people struggled for a national identity with some sort of argument that polish culture did n't exist or that poland was n't a country . 
  well , perhaps if you have n't literally claimed that we * lacked * national identity which is quite synonymous with both things you mentioned here , we could avoid this problem . 
   that obviously leads to a crisis in identity , i do n't need to explain why . 
  * crisis * in national identity is not the same as * lack * of it . 
   read : mainly . 
  i do n't pretend to know about the austrian part but it was just as tossed about as the rest , if not more . 
  considering the last several centuries , it had the most peaceful history out of entirety of modern poland , but keep going , it 's fascintating . 
   mate , that 's what i 'm saying . 
  you are more catholic because it 's an important part of your identity that differentiates you from the rest . 
  which once again disproves your claim about `` lack of national identity '' . 
  also , it was already an important part of our identity when we were still in great powers tier , so there goes your another claim . 
   again , i 've just said it was an effect of centuries of being tossed around and subsequent understandable overcompensation unfortunately you just never said anything concrete on this topic , and as you keep failing to clarify on that it remains an empty claim . 
  there were many countries that were `` tossed around '' for much longer than us , and we are not an outlier by any means - quite the contrary considering that we were late to this club as it only started ~ 250 years ago . 
   modern polish nationalism arose as a movement in the late 18th and early 19th centuries `` modern polish nationalism arose around the time the * very idea of nationalism * was coined in europe '' . 
  how exactly it is connected to your `` no national identity '' absurdal claim , i have no idea . 
  the latter part merely states the obvious course of action in a situation when your territory just got occupied by foreign and ( with exception of austria ) hostile powers . 
   nah it was more to do with the fact that poland overcompensated for a previous lack of national identity stemming from centuries of being played around . 
   lack of national identity `` poland had no national identity before it was suddenly invented in 1989 '' . 
  this alone was a one big `` i have no idea what i 'm talking about '' flag , but , masochistic as i am , i kept reading curious to find out what other revelations i 'll find . 
   stemming from centuries of being played around literally * centuries * . 
  two of them . 
  and yes , they * are * important especially considering how big part of our national identity is `` for centuries we used to be a great empire that lately fallen due to inside and outside factors , but despite that we managed to survive and reborn ... twice '' , which due to circumstances gradually replaced the earlier `` we are the great and powerful country of the free people , with the most perfect type of government in the world , comparable only to roman republic '' one . 
  then again , if * poland * has a `` lack of national identity '' , i do n't know who does n't . 
   this backlash is seen mainly in parts that used to belong to russia , which also explains why the more conservative and nationalist party has by far the strongest support in the region that in 19th century was ruled by austria , and where poles had autonomy so vast that compared to either russian or german-occupied parts it was almost as good as if it remained independent poland . 
  but at this point i am completely unsurprised by your absolute lack of knowledge about poland . 
   a lack of national identity is also why poland is very catholic compared to , at this point i start to doubt whether you have any idea what this `` lack of national identity phrase '' you keep using ever means . 
  catholicism is * a part * of our national identity . 
   you look at eastern bloc countries or areas ( like east germany ) , most of them are more left leaning than right . 
  they have n't spent the last 10 to 15 years of soviet occupation on active anti-communist mass resistance , but suddenly were freed of it after ussr started to collapse , so it 's only understandable . 
   exceptions being poland and hungary who both went through more nationalistic phases after the fall of the ussr . 
  another interesting discovery . 
  so , when exactly was our `` nationalistic phase '' , between 2005 and 2007 ? 
  i do n't think i ever had an occasion to read such a pile of condensed uninformed crap as your post , but it was a fun ride . 
  comedy gold . 
   to think it 's ex-communist . 
  oh , but that 's * precisely * the reason why poland is so right wing . 
  communist rule was so shitty and incompetent , it basically compromised anything even remotely left-wing/socialist for many generations ( if not forever ) . 
  they were either deported to siberia and kazakhstan in 1940 and 1941 and died there ( at least several hundred thousands , though total is most likely a bit lower than 1 million ) , were resettled to now-western poland after the war ended ( 2.3 million total ) , and some of them ( several hundred thousands ) remained in their homes in now-lithuanian and belarusian ssr ( in contrast , almost all poles from the now-ukrainian ssr who survived the war got resettled ) and remain a significant minoriry in both countries nowadays . 
  of course it is . 
  it 's more than enough to have a grasp about where each party stands though , and there is no need to write a novel-long post about how the `` centre-right party '' completely ignores their own programme while ruling and only focuses on winning elections , or how the `` right wing party '' absorbed the populist electorate back in 2007 to someone who does n't really care about polish politics , do n't you think ? 
  the division shown on this map is basically forest vs farmland . 
  population density in northern and western poland is lower , as population is predominantly urban while the countryside is forested . 
  on the other hand , population density in southern and eastern poland is higher , thanks to high rural population scattered between ( a bit less frequent ) cities and towns . 
  [ map of land use in poland .

  it is , but their combined support is in 5-10 % range , and they are not considered to be major parties . 
  orange is pro-eu centre-right , blue is pro-us right-wing . 
  more like a bit less than 1/3 of the country . 
   yes , taxes were the biggest problem of communist poland . 
  i do n't know how to reply . 
  yes , you misunderstood my post on purpose ( or perhaps i have n't worded my post clear enough this time , who knows ) so obviously you do n't know how to reply . 
  let me rephrase this very sentence you have quoted in a most straightfoward way : total incompetence of commies left our country underdeveloped and impoverished ( and despite swift progress in last 26 years we still have n't fully recovered from that ) . 
  because of that , our population is not wealthy enough to afford paying high taxes * right now * . 
  how could you conclude from this that my opinion is that taxes were the * biggest * problem about soviet-occupied poland , i have no idea , that 's some absolutely exotic sense of logic . 
   taxes are robbery in general , of course they are . 
  a situation in which a powerful organization takes money from you ( by force , if not given voluntarily ) regardless of your consent would be consistent with my definition of robbery . 
  that 's not to disregard the fact that admitably to some extent ( police , army , justice system , crucial infrastructure ) it 's justifiable and benefitial , and could be alternatively described as `` mandatory state-usage fee '' , just like there is one for using electricity , water or gas . 
  in general though , the more money is left in citizens ' pockets , the better - especially in a country so devastated by years of socialist `` economy '' as poland where many people can barely afford to live on the money left after paying all their taxes . 
   man , you should sue them . 
  oh , i certainly would if i saw any chance of winning . 
   see that 's why you are in incoherent because there was no robbery , it was rightful recovery . 
  and factories stolen in 40s from their owners , were also `` rightfuly recovered '' , yes , that 's quite typical socialist rethoric . 
  at least this time you managed not to murder anyone in process , so there is some kind of progress . 
   and i am constantly reminding you that no other healthy economy introduced such a mandatory pensions system and that 's cool , but unfortunately in no way relevant to our discussion which is , i 'd like you to remind you , focused on forceful seizure of hundreds of billions pln in private assets by the state . 
   forcing to give money to private companies is a robbery . 
  oh shit , entire mandatory car insurance system is robbery . 
   you are confused about who is the robber here .

  oh , the arrogance and blindness . 
  germans still act as if brexit happened out of nowhere , as if there were no causes of such anti-eu stance among public of so many countries . 
  if they will keep denying problems exist , they will become so large solving them will not be an option anymore . 
  because they are main source of divisions in eu . 
  that is why certain states feel excluded from participation . 
  with such dissent and prophetized financial disaster in uk not happening it is only a matter of time before more countries will decide that there are more worthwhile alternatives than german economic dictate . 
  pretty much this . 
  although i meant mostly germany-centered group , other groups are certainly not helping . 
  if such groups are necessary , then eu collapse is inevitable . 
  they should be made with 100 % participation . 
  otherwise , certain states are practically excluded from decision making . 
  union like this can not last long . 
  groups like this are main source of problems in eu . 
  how can eu function if decisions are made outside it by exclusive groups ? 
  success breeds jealousy, 
  you speak as if americans were not doing the same . 
  also lol at `` american concepts '', 
  `` it represents a case of tu quoque or the appeal to hypocrisy , [ 3 ] a logical fallacy '' you did n't even read that link , right ? 
  you 're projecting so much you should work at cinema . 
  what you need gladius for , romans ? 
  if barbarians attack , just call lictor 's guild or use scuta to fend off the attacker . 
  alternatively , ring a bell and wait for vigiles to arrive . 
  no roman civitas actually need a gladius . 
  what are you going to do , carry it everywhere ? 
  when barbarians attack , just form testudo and wait for cohors urbana to arrive . 
  what next , should you have right to own a ballistae ? 
  no roman citizen should own anything more than a pugio to defend himself and his domus . 
  statistics prove that greater number of gladiem per 100.000 citizens increase m\u00eal\u00e9e deaths significantly . 
  you 're just compensating for your short stature and plebeian birth . 
  `` yeah , they will be in 15 minutes , can you not stab me please until they arrive ? '', 
  there is no tank ban . 
  you could purchase tank , if you could afford it . 
  your graph misses a lot of countries , not to mention it does not compare gun deaths to violent deaths overall . 
  as usual , we 're lagging behind western europe in progress . 
  when you feed someone , fund their education , healthcare etc / you do n't urge them to be loyal . 
  you demand loyalty and punish those who betray your country .

  as far as i know there is airport or two in romania .

  ballistic missiles are usually made with mobile launchers . 
  or the press got told what to write by rich corporations that are their owners . 
  personally i think they should have some predictions about inclusion of ai into services and prepare a plan for transition . 
  i doubt any of them cares , though . 
  short-sightness is very common among politicans . 
  not many people here put any trust in nato . 
  most people would agree that it 's at least likely that once russia invade us , west will betray us and abandon us using some petty excuse . 
  perhaps not in near future , but long-term sure . 
  it is a credible threat . 
  russia is plenty of high-ranking people that consider military invasion legitimate tool of foreign policy . 
  besides , there 's nothing wrong in having prepared reserve force . 
  honestly , i 'm more suprised by eurovision taking place in ukraine than that . 
  over 2600 hours here and not a single achievement . 
  this is quite common tho . 
  exactly . 
  scotland rebels and gets independent anyway . 
  we got both wales and scotland this way . 
  that 's exactly why . 
  we could support scottish rebels and bring end to uk . 
  my proposition : - concede defeat - cede north ireland to ireland - release wales as independent state - transfer trade power to spain, 
  i 'll take it . 
  pm me for banking info for transfer . 
  that deal was insane idea . 
  it 's collapse was just a matter of time . 
  men having penises is rather normal . 
  is man with penis something unusual in russia ? 
  it was always a fact of life . 
  it 's just this is violence not authorised by state . 
  write new article `` calls in germany for looser gun laws '', 
  kids that bullied him should be charged with cooperation in murders . 
  if that would be the case plenty of countries would n't build lng terminals . 
  read the damn article . 
  his brother was suspect , and he tried to prevent arrest . 
  for us , for baltic countries , lng terminals allowed us to get a better price from russia . 
  spending money on road that can be only used by current supplier is increasing dependence because it consumes resources that could be used on diversification . 
  if they refuse , you can always say if they will not pay they will be thrown into reactor . 
  that depends on what actually happens . 
  for example , during three miles accident people were exposed to 8 milirads . 
  thats equivalent of one rtg or two weekly doses . 
  most people 's health wlll suffer more simply by living next to a road and breathing car exhaust fumes , than by living next to nuclear power plant . 
  yet whenever nuclear plant is nearby they act as if fucking third hand is about to grow out of their stomach . 
  if german people want no nuclear power plants , fine , but cost of shutting them down and all releated costs should be fully paid by `` concerned citizens '', 
  nord stream increases dependence on russia . 
  instead of building another money pipes for russian military , you should built lng terminals . 
  i feel uncomfortable around slovakia . 
  can we remove them from eu ? 
  well , germans lost that battle , therefore they are angry . 
  did you know they called battle against russians in 1914 `` second battle of tannenberg '' ? 
  they were butthurt even 500 years later . 
  that 's not how patriotism works . 
  if they 're so plentiful , why wont they form their own faction ? 
  west would be more than happy to provide arms for them . 
  except for merkel , she seems to enjoy stream of migrants . 
  it 's not controversial , it 's simple . 
  russians are trying to steal our victory , and germans are butthurt cuz they lost . 
  look everyone , i get that this will not be good for uk 's economy , but from your comments it seems when uk quits eu atlantic ocean will swallow it . 
  you keep posting about `` suicide '' as if whole island would cease to exist .

  first , three is n't all . 
  second , contents of a holy book do not define a religion . 
  a religion is a complex set of ideas , the book being only a part of it . 
  in fact , you can have a religion without any holy book , that 's how most of the pagan religions worked . 
  in short , what you suggest is some kind of censorship and restriction of free speech . 
  moral and legal uncertainities aside , you need to draw a line . 
  for example , if you want to ban promoting killing outside of self-defence , you 'll have to ban the fringiest of fringe judaist and christian sects , while banning quite more of islamic ones , and probably no mormon , jw or sikh ones . 
  in fact , inciting violence is already illegal in many western countries , it 's just some islamists use religious freedom as a defence . 
  restricting freedom of religion would be a move in the direction you want , and most european christians would n't be affected by it . 
  it would also mean more jehova witness kids saved by transfusions against their parents ' will .

  when wolf 's fur catches fire and the wolf tries to run away from it , all it does is spreading the fire . 
  what you should do , is to prevent the wolf from running around and * put the fire out * . 
  and you should n't necessarily blame the wolf for it . 
  nah , po was going to lose either way . 
  why ? 
  spain is too far west to be involved much in the refugee crisis , and it 's current muslim population is n't that high either . 
  this problem is of less concern for them than , for example , high unemployment . 
  and `` muslims conquered bits of southern europe for a while '' does n't count , since it was n't becoming a part of european society , but * replacing * european society . 
  dogs are n't , it would be haraam . 
   excusing behaviour by the refugee by pointing out that germans somehow are also bad this tactic was used by soviet union a lot : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/and_you_are_lynching_negroes, 
   values like faith in one 's ability to adapt to difficult circumstances , or the perseverance to face extreme obstacles to bring your family to safety . 
  and the courage to start over in a new country where some portion of the population opposes your very existence . 
  those are not * values * , those are * skills * .

   your example of m\u00ed\u0237\u0301n is weird since for me the acute is placed on the n instead of the j , but if i use a `` proper '' font it 's correctly displayed . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/verdana#combining_characters_bug  the font should do the proper substitutions automatically to remove the dot before adding the acute ### dot removal test : & nbsp ; & nbsp ; i\u0341 & nbsp ; & nbsp ; j\u0341 ### dotless test : & nbsp ; & nbsp ; \u0131\u0341 & nbsp ; & nbsp ; \u0237\u0301 ### combined glyph : & nbsp ; & nbsp ; \u00ed dot removal test : i\u0341 j\u0341 dotless test : \u0131\u0341 \u0237\u0301 combined glyph : \u00ed i just noticed that that dotless j does n't come from verdana , so it 's even more complicated . 
  text rendering is hard . 
  i used a dotless j , u +0237 . 
  i also remember \u00e8 , as in * bl\u00e8ren * or the interjection * h\u00e8 * , or many , many french loanwords . 
  i also looked for words with \u00e4 , and apart from some german loanwords , i only found * kana\u00e4n * , * ba\u00e4l * , * a\u00e4ron * , * iza\u00e4k * -- all biblical proper names . 
  i agree though that apart of loanwords and tremas , * \u00e9\u00e9n * seems to be the only consistently accented word . 
  as a curiosity : if you want to put an accent on * ij * , like for example in * mijn * , some typographical resources recommend putting the accent of both * i * and * j * , but most fonts do not support it , or support it poorly . 
  test : m\u00ed\u0237\u0301n * m\u00ed\u0237\u0301n *, 
  croatian \u0111 vs icelandic \u00f0 . 
  the former is just a * d * with a stroke , the latter has evolved so far it has to be considered a separate letter . 
  what about * v\u00f3\u00f3rkomen * vs * voork\u00f3men * ? 
  i think i also saw * d\u00e1\u00e1r * somewhere . 
  also , what about \u00f6 as in * co\u00f6peratie * ? 
  almost all facebook `` like '' buttons on various webpages are loaded from facebook 's servers . 
  usually , this lets facebook receive the referrer ( a site where the button was inserted ) and set an identifying cookie which can be used to track the visitor between all sites with such buttons ( since facebook in this case is third party , first being you and second being the website you visit , these cookies are called third-party cookies ) . 
  this way , facebook knows what pages a user identified by that cookie visits . 
  with a bit of luck , facebook could even figure out that user 's identity . 
  some browsers can block third-party cookies , and you can also use various browser addons to further limit requests sent to facebook during ordinary web browsing . 
  this is of course not limited to facebook : every button or ad loaded from third party 's server can be used for the same .

  based on the same idea , you can blur your profile that your web search providers built of you : send randomised queries so your profile will look generic , targeted advertising wo n't work , and any interesting search query will get buried under hundreds of generic ones .

  is this thread related to the election results ? 
  not sure how well it applies to . nowoczesna , but here it is : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/radical_centrism, 
  no , they ca n't . 
  they 'd need to get at least kukiz and psl on board . 
   do n't expect much progress on gay rights and ivf . 
  given how po approached this subject , i think i 'd prefer a party that says `` no !, 
  and shut up ! '', 
  than a party that keeps saying `` maybe ... '' for several months and in effect does nothing . 
  according to the english-language wikipedia , they 're radical centrists . 
  there is no * left left * in the parliament . 
  ( i was waiting the entire campaign to make this pun . ), 
   i am just afraid they could get constitutional majority and could amend constitution . 
  nah , they 'd need  40 % votes for that . 
  does n't matter , she is representing them . 
  a party is not defined by its leader , especially if said leader is a figurehead . 
  sld makes up the majority of zl . 
  reproduction is limited by women . 
  those men wo n't give birth to any children . 
  football , rugby , handball , water polo , basketball , volleyball , tennis and hockey are basically all the same sport : `` put this small object into opponent 's designated area , while defending your designated area . '', 
  the difference is mostly about what you are allowed to do with the object , what happens if you cause the object to leave the field , are there any exceptions to the contact with the designated area , and how many people there are in a team . 
   but the problem is , in islam you do n't have any centralised organisation like , for example , in catholic church . 
  christianity is mostly organised in hierarchies : there 's catholic hierarchy , there are multiple orthodox hierarchies , which cooperate , there are state-sponsored protestant hierarchies ( anglican , swedish lutheran , and so on ) , there are some other protestant hierarchies . 
  christianity is like that from the very start , with jesus having disciples , with all those flock and shepherd metaphors . 
  but then you have smaller , independent churches in america , that do not feel obliged to belong in a hierarchy and split and merge wherever a single pastor feels like it . 
  guess which ones are more radical . 
  if the votes were gathered electronically , then yes . 
  but as i said elsewhere , this is still a research problem , you ca n't just post online `` citizen # 3636456 voted x '' , because then that citizen could use his receipt # 3636456 to collect the promised bribe .

  and all the lands given back to poland in 1919 after the treaty of versailles were ethnically majority polish . 
  areas of the former kingdom of poland with german majority remained in the weimar republic . 
  well , to be honest he is not wrong . 
  the west slavic lechitic tribe of pomorzanie lived there about 1000 years ago . 
  the name of region could come from them well enough . 
  now , the name `` pomorzanie '' has the exact etymology you have described . 
  so , in a way , you are both right . 
   so you have no argument , therefore you 're going to resort to being pedantic ? 
  * you * have no argument and are using oddly specific definitions in order to get your point across . 
   all mainstream anarchist movements are socialist , almost all notable anarchists in history have been socialists , the biggest mainstream anarchist today , is socialist , when people refer to `` anarchists '' they refer to socialist anarchists , otherwise they specify which anarchist it is . 
   furthermore , i specifically mentioned the likes of anarcho-capitalism in my comment , where your comment said `` i do n't see anything socialist about anarchism '' , and i expressly refuted that . 
  i know most anarchists tend to be socialists at the same time . 
  but still , despite your claims there is nothing inherently socialist about anarchism * itself * . 
   no , i said `` no fixed definition '' . 
  i understand that english is not your first language , but that does n't give you an excuse to lie . 
  which is exactly what i would describe as `` no real socialism '' . 
  as there 's no fixed definition , it 's perfectly alright to change definition of socialism as time progresses so it does n't include all it 's fuckups so far . 
   as opposed to this never happening under capitalism ... 
  there are capitalist countries which are peaceful , rich and developed . 
  there was no instance in human history of such communist/socialist countries ( and no , nordic countries are not socialist ) . 
   shitty logic that makes absolutely no sense . 
  if you try something once and it fails , then it has failed every time and it can never be tried again . 
  by your logic . 
  seems i am not the only one being pedantic . 
  you know excactly what i meant . 
   except it has consistently be proven right , so i do n't know where you 're getting that from . 
  by whom , some leftist blogers ? 
  some fedora wearing neckbeards on reddit ? 
  every prediction of marxist ideology so far was wrong . 
  there 's no historical determinism . 
  class conflict is not inevitable . 
  workers ' conditions in last century has actually gotten much better . 
  it turns our proletarian revolution does n't lead to paradise classless society . 
  and i wo n't even mention economical part of marxist theory which was ridiculed by every serious economist , including keynes . 
   sphere of interests !, 
  hello , are we playing victoria ii here ? 
  you have no sphere of interests . 
  every country in europe is free to ally with anyone it wishes to - and does n't need russian permission to do so . 
  moreso , russia acting as if it somehow had right to decide about alliances of other countries was actually a significant factor in those countries allying with the usa at first opportunity . 
  oh , now i see . 
  only socialist branches of anarchism are the * real * anarchism , so of course anarchism is a socialist ideology . 
  how aptly . 
  i guess those ones http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/anarcho-capitalism http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/christian_anarchism http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/individualist_anarchism http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/anarchism_without_adjectives http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/existentialist_anarchism have nothing to do with anarchism then . 
  all you say is that the fact that most supporters of anarchism tend to be socialist leaning makes anarchist a socialist ideology . 
  do n't you see how it makes no sense ? 
   socialism is has no fixed definition yeah , i heard that before , no real socialism . 
  how unfortunate that every time someone tried to implement marxist ideology in real world all we got was genocide , slavery , dictatorship , suffering and hunger . 
  but of course , you will tell me that the ideology is flawless , just the people implementing made mistakes so it was n't `` real socialism/communism/whatever '' . 
  no , of course it was n't . 
  because that 's impossible . 
  there is no way for socialist society to exist without every single member of it actively working towards that goal - which is absolutely impossible . 
  if ideology fails one time , it could be that it was implemented wrongly . 
  if it fails every time - there 's probably something wrong with ideology . 
  i ca n't wrap my head around the fact that there are still people treating marx 's works seriously in * 21th century * . 
  it was proven to be wrong multiple times . 
  it 's a dead end . 
  a lysenkoism , a creation science of ideologies . 
   anarchism is a political philosophy that advocates stateless societies often defined as self-governed voluntary institutions  anarchism holds the state to be undesirable , unnecessary , or harmful . 
  i do n't see anything socialist about anarchism . 
  it looks more like radical libertarianism to me . 
  though of course your and mine definitions of `` socialism '' might be vastly different . 
  anarchism has nothing to do with marxism , leninism or communism . 
  surely , there exist some branches of anarchism which draw from that ideologies . 
  yet you also have anarcho-capitalism . 
  there are as many forms of anarchism as there are anarchists . 
   degenerated workers ' state they were n't degenerated , that 's exactly how communist fairytale looks like implemented in practice . 
  and i 'd rather say a lot of people * over * estimate how popular communist regimes were in eastern bloc countries . 
   how did the us screw poland over ? 
  by promising and negotiating the nato-instalations-on-polish-soil deal and then backing down at the last moment ? 
  i 'd say it severely damaged perception of the usa here in poland as a trustworthy ally who will come to help us in case of war . 
  yes , i 'm butthurt because i do n't consider 40 years of soviet occupation of my country to be the defining moment of my nation . 
  sorry if it irks you . 
  exactly . 
  perpetuating the old nomenclature surely wo n't help it disappear . 
  are you sure ? 
  when was the last time you have looked at the map of europe ? 
  the geographical center of poland is to the west of any geographical center of europe . 
  hence even going by purely geographical definition we are more western than eastern . 
  if you mistakenly consider germany to be the center of europe , feel free to call sweden and austria eastern european . 
  that 's exactly my point . 
  still using the long outdated cold war era definition in 2014 and ignoring everything else looks really silly . 
  if we can be eastern , so can be austria . 
  it makes about as much sense . 
   why hospitals ? 
  we have no obligation to help the injured !, 
  paid from the taxes of the citizens using them . 
   why schools ? 
  we have no obligation to educate the people !, 
  paid from the taxes of the citizens using them . 
   why roads ? 
  we have no obligation to let people travel !, 
  paid from the taxes of the citizens using them . 
   why police ? 
  we have no obligation to protect the people !, 
  paid from the taxes of the citizens protected by it . 
  that 's not the case with asylum seekers . 
  and i 'm not saying we should n't take any asylum seekers , because there are some cases where we should . 
  but , as you can clearly see , your analogy is entirely false . 
  at last . 
  though i still hate how the us has screwed us over the missile shield the first time .

  i tend to stick to non-fiction though . 
  games - not my taste unfortunately , though i heard some of our recent stuff was met with warm reception i 'm not much into music and films so i wo n't comment on either . 
  actually it 's called wojak after a polish krautchan user who forced the meme on foreign imageboards . 
  the picture itself comes from the old vichan ( now defunct ) , where it was known as `` ciep\u0142a twarz '' . 
  cenzoduda is just a mutation of the old cenzopapa from a certain polish imageboard but yes , poland certainly is n't lacking in the meme department , though i got an impression that a lot of our memes are malicious or hateful in nature, 
  the term itself - maybe . 
  the economical and cultural division however was and still is very real . 
  east/west division in germany is much older than communism . 
  it was the original `` western europe / eastern europe '' border before the unification of germany happened . 
  i strongly disagree with the conclusion of this article . 
  the only thing that 's decidedly at ussr 's fault here is the bit about historical politics . 
  everything else poisoned the eastern european societies way before ussr was even a concept . 
  `` indifference to the results of labour '' is the result of prolonged serfdom , which in eastern europe lasted long until xix century . 
  the serf did n't care about the result of his work because - unlike the western farmer - he did n't work for himself and often was n't being paid for it ( or paid very , very poorly ) . 
  ussr really only expanded on this centuries old `` concept '' - instead of not paying anything no matter what kind of work you did , you got paid the same amount no matter of what kind of work you did . 
  `` lack of initiative and avoidance of taking any individual responsibility for anything '' - also the result of the above . 
  the serf was n't allowed to decide for himself ( his lord did ) . 
  and why would he need to initiate anything when the lord would n't listen to some dirty serf anyway ? 
  `` indifference to common property and petty theft from the workplace , both for personal use and for profit '' - mostly a result of catholic / orthodox culture actually , in which the individual is expected to be loyal to his own family first and foremost . 
  you can see similar things happening in many souther european countries like italy or greece . 
  western culture has been fetishized for centuries . 
  see russian tsar peter the great for one of the most famous examples . 
  `` obedience to or passive acceptance of everything that government imposes on them '' - serfdom `` a tendency to drink '' - ayy fucking lmao , the authors ca n't honestly believe that rampant alcoholism in the east was invented in xx century . 
  i ca n't speak for other countries , but in poland alcoholism became widespread after the introduction of the so-called `` propination law '' [ pl ] ( https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/propinacja ) [ en ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/propination_laws ) which obliged the serf to buy a certain amount of vodka from his lord . 
  unfortunately , central-east europe has been in the shitter for much longer than some people would like to imagine . 
  the history lessons do n't really do a good job in educating the masses here . 
  i 'd say corruption in poland got pocketed to certain parts of the economy , where it stubbornly refuses to go away . 
  the top offenders seem to be public healthcare , army and the football association . 
   this , combined with ukraine 's large population , would have probably meant that russia would have had to generously subsidize ukraine after ukraine would have entered the eeu and this is where you 're wrong . 
  russia is not eu with its complex cohesion programmes . 
  ukraine would be kept in for strategical reasons , almost like a pet . 
  the population and economy would be left to rot . 
  then you did n't meet many tourists . 
  or at least not the ones from the east . 
  really ? 
  in my experience people will try to answer in polish unless communication is borderline impossible due to poor language skills of the other party . 
  then they 'll switch to english . 
  and if they do n't know english - gestures , 
  the impact has n't been that huge since majority of high paying , knowledge intensive jobs stayed in europe . 
  in that sense , america is more of a threat to the european economies ( at least the highly developed ones ) than asia ever was . 
  unfortunately , with poor demographics , less influence over the world affairs and worse geographical position i feel we 're fighting an uphill battle here . 
  i 'd say it 's the third most popular breakfast choice after eggs and sandwiches . 
  i never heard about any of the brands you 've listed though . 
  we have nestle stuff and some local polish produce here ( sante is great ) . 
  to be clear , i also include muesli and other `` healthy '' products under cereals . 
  triggered, 
  i 'd also add : udawa\u0107 greka - to play greek - pretend not to know what 's happening ruski rok - a russian year - a very long time ( the joke being that the russians use ( d ) the julian calendar , so certain events like christmas would happen later , making their year seem `` longer '' ) \u017bydzi\u0107 - to jew - i do n't think i need to explain that one lol, 
   poland is open i 'm scared to ask what 's the origin of that one ... 
  it 's actually called the french disease ( choroba francuska ) in poland . 
  there used to be a fairly popular insult `` ty franco !, 
  '' , which refers to someone suffering from the french disease . 
  it functioned more or less in the same way as calling someone `` cancer '' on the internet nowadays . 
  going to third that one, 
  it all greatly depends on the age , location ( urban vs rural ) , weather , person 's mood and more . 
  i 've experienced situations where poles small talk like nothing , and situations where we act like a bunch of anti-social shut-ins . 
  if i had to choose i 'd say the latter behaviour is more common though . 
  there is an unspoken rule that you do n't bother random people on streets unless you absolutely need to ( eg . 
  a tourist asking for directions ) . 
  drink - probably this [ sweet drink ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/orangina ) from france food - i 'm partial to [ tiramisu ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tiramisu ), 
  the shitstorm on the internet would probably thrill me more than the actual unification process . 
  given that the `` two speed europe '' idea is dangerously close to becoming a reality , yes i 'd like to see poland join the eurozone . 
  any potential advantages to keeping our own currency would be totally offset if we became some kind of a second-rate member of the union . 
   given that an increasing number of people are calling themselves european do you have any sources for that ? 
  as i speak , the government structural and personal re-construction is the no . 
  1 topic . 
  the minister of finance is likely to be fired . 
  swearwords, 
  in poland i only heard arguments against the free movement in the context that we 're losing too many people to emigration to richer countries . 
  but generally speaking , free movement is seen as a good thing . 
  i 'd argue that [ biedronka ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/biedronka ) ( a polish-portugese discount chain similar to lidl ) is rather comparable to your wal-mart phenomenon . 
  since the prices are so low , the quality of products - dubious and the exteriors - kitschy ( [ it 's easily noticeable through it 's disgusting yellow walls ] ( https://www.wiadomoscihandlowe.pl/img/artykuly/2821_biedronka-dyskont-nie-dyskont_1.jpg ) ) , shopping there became a huge meme , like something only a stereotypically lower class person would do ( though obviously the middle class and above also shops there ) . 
  it does n't help that the word * biedronka * ( ladybird/ladybug ) sounds rather similar to the word * bieda * ( poverty ) , which is often abused in various jokes and parodies ( [ like this one ] ( http://img.sadistic.pl/pics/0aadb02bd2e7.jpg ) ) . 
  maybe it 's just me but i feel that populism got much worse with the proliferation of the internet . 
  never before has it been so easy for any random jackass on the planet to reach such huge masses of people in such a short time . 
  it 's closer to 20 now . 
  recent - electing pis overall - too many to chose from ... 
  this is n't what the term `` new europe '' means at all ... 
   its really only drunkards and angry folks around friends that say kurwa , g\u00f3wno and so on . 
  i take it you never had contact with people who work for the mass media ( newspapers , radio etc. ) . 
  these guys swear worse than a sailor on a very bad day . 
  kamil durczok 's famous `` tape '' about a dirty table could basically be considered a documentary about everyday work in mass media in poland and it would n't be an exaggeration , 
  knowing the stories from polish-belarusian border , if there is a difference it 's minimal at best . 
   is this in itself enough to explain for belarus 's three-fold advantage in nominal gdp per capita over ukraine ? 
  the only other potential difference-maker i can think of is bigger centralization of power among the belarusian elite . 
  well , my country ( poland ) is in a similar situation as yours . 
  actually , our government ( very conservative catholic one mind you ) recently agreed that poland will have to accept at least 5 million immigrants until 2050 . 
  ukraine/belarus alone will not be able to sustain such numbers , so we will likely see more asian immigrants ( including the brown skinned ones ) roaming our still homogenous streets soon . 
  honestly , while i do n't see immigration as a bad thing , multiculturalism should be discouraged imo . 
  integration should instead be encouraged at all times to minimize the risk of ghettoisation and potential conflicts with the host culture . 
  while that removes some of the fun side effects like the ethnic restaurants ( though not completely either ! ), 
  i believe it leads to happier societies overall . 
  to sum it up - yes , accept more immigrants in lithuania , but do n't slack on the integration efforts . 
  preferably avoid cultures that are proven to be resistant to integration . 
  i wo n't call them out by names but i 'm pretty sure everyone already knows who i 'm referring to . 
  a better question would be , why are n't russia , kazakhstan and belarus as poor as ukraine , given the close similarity of their cultures ? 
  and the answer is well known : * russia and kazakhstan have tons of natural resources ( oil , gas etc. ), 
  * belarusian economy is heavily propped up by russia ( 15 % of their gdp are russian subsides , i shit you not ) it 's going to be interesting to see what happens to these countries once europe moves away from fossil fuels ( eg . 
  by embracing electric cars ) . 
  either way it 's not going to be pretty . 
  i 'd add per\u0142a , kasztelan , \u017bubr and tatra to the mainstream ( ish ) ones .

  * _ respect by government officials _ . 
  basically , a single , simple mortal was no one in face of an government official . 
  as such ( s ) he was disrespected , treated as an intruder , forced to wait endlessly , to beg for positive solution of his/her problem and to _ wychodzi\u0107 spraw\u0119 _ ( walk from an official to official as long as the problem was somehow dealt with ) . 
  * _ corruption _ . 
  it was terribly common . 
  sometimes it was a bottle of vodka , or table of chocolate or a pack of cigarettes . 
  sometimes it was a quarter of a pig or a chicken , or a talon for some hard to get industrial goods and sometimes money . 
  the practical elimination of small corruption is one of greater achievements of the modern poland . 
  * _ forced attendance in communist holidays _ . 
  when there was a holiday important for communist propaganda ( like 1st of may or 22nd of july ) people working in big factories and other government owned enterprises , also schools , hospitals etc. 
  were forced to attend [ pochody ] ( http://bi.gazeta.pl/im/3/9519/z9519943q,pochod-pierwszomajowy--1968.jpg ) almost always under stupid slogans and often under portraits of [ murderers ] ( http://cyfroteka.pl/catalog/ebooki/41210/98563/ff/101/oebps/images/32.jpg ) . 
  i could recall more but i have to wrap presents for my children , 
  * traffic jams !, 
  streets in poland looked basically like [ this ] ( http://www.vw-oldschool.pl/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/1398335759_by_krzys_500.jpg ) . 
  sometimes like [ this ] ( http://www.nowastrategia.org.pl/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/t-55a.jpg ) . 
  traffic jams were totally abstract . 
  * unbelievable variety and number of cars . 
  80 % of cars on the communist poland streets were from this pool : [ fiat 126p ] ( http://www.gieldaklasykow.pl/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/fiat-126p-01.jpg ) , [ fiat 125p ] ( http://autobox24.pl/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/fiat-125p-1988r-1500cm-1-w%c5%82.-19.jpg ) , [ polonez ] ( http://girlonline.eu/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/polonez.jpg ) , [ trabant ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4d/trabant_601-s%c5%82.jpg ) , [ wartburg ] ( http://i61.tinypic.com/30m50g3.jpg ) , [ skoda ] ( http://www.czarprlu.pl/wp-content/gallery/nasze-pojazdy-moja-skoda-s100/skoda-100mojaa.jpg ) ( also newer model but i am not sure which ) . 
  the other 15 % were lada ( not sure about model ) , [ zastava ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/15/zastava_128.jpg ) , [ syrena ] ( http://klasykizg.pl/sites/default/files/styles/large/public/dsc_5711.resized.jpg?itok=bamctgsb ) , [ warszawa ] ( http://ogloszenia.ox.pl/files/notices/2014/12/08/warszawa-jan-pawel-ii.jpg ) , [ nysa ] ( http://truck-data.com/ltruck/nysa-522.jpg ) ( sometimes _ they _ brali do [ nyski ] ( https://img.czerwonesamochody.com/data/media/2/dsc02087.jpg ) ) and [ \u017buk ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/24/zuk_p1000094.jpg ) . 
  there were also some buses and trucks . 
  but hey !, 
  they were available in different colors !, 
  see , we were living in a socialist paradise and we considered shitty sweets and coca-cola , which you obviously despise , a true luxury . 
  how they say it in poland : `` a satiated man wo n't understand a hungry man '' . 
  try to live in a `` socialist economy '' for 10 or 20 years and you will almost surely admit that capitalism is a pretty good thing . 
  polish people rather do n't consider themselves `` post-soviets '' but we were on the same side of the curtain , so i will still answer . 
  i was a pre-teen back then and the most amazing thing was the amount of cheap sweets available . 
  good , western quality sweets were luxury goods during the communism times . 
  they were brought from the west by contract workers and very rarely bought in the pewex or baltona shops ( you had to pay with hard currency there ) . 
  for our western friends to understand the level of luxury : * single package of [ these ] ( http://www.wzgorzasmaku.pl/data/catalogue/stltk5odc2nc1mb3rvlzi5otiuanbn.jpg ) made you a pretty rich kid . 
  you could exchange single leafs of these for really cool things . 
  * when someone was lucky enough to get [ one can of pepsi ] ( http://puszki.info/art/63117_pepsi-19xx.jpg ) or coca-cola ( s ) he usually did n't drink it . 
  it was standing in a visible place of a children room and was shown to guests . 
  sometimes they were even allowed to keep it in hands for a minute or two  when ( s ) he eventually decided to drink it , it was a family celebration and everyone took a sip from the holy can . 
   here are historical reasons for the `` hatred '' and it 's not really something that we take too seriously , unless it 's russians . 
  even in case of russians , most people rather hate their historical actions , government , army or past and current leaders than normal russians . 
  it is an often statement in poland : `` i do n't like russian state but have nothing against common russians '' . 
   i 'm doing the world a favour by adopting their kids they were too fucked up to deal with you said it two times and i believe that you are manipulating . 
  the children taken from pathological families are only part of these being in orphanages and sadly they are very lucky if they are adopted . 
  why ? 
  because they are n't infants . 
  even if they have 5-6 years old , they bring tons of major problems with them . 
  they are as far from good born children as possible . 
  sadly , they stay in orphanages until maturity . 
  would you adopt a children which requires serious psychological work to become just normal ? 
  which work will most probably fail and you will end with a teen junkie hating you and stealing your property ? 
  maybe even threatening you physically ? 
  this is how children from pathological families look like . 
  almost no one wants these poor beings and your gay friends would also prefer a healthy infant than them . 
  even very young children coming from truly pathological families are very problematic - they have very serious health problems . 
  bad mother behaviour during the pregnancy period ( alcohol , drugs , cigarettes ) often negatively influences their intellectual possibilities and also causes problems like adhd ( if i recall correctly ) . 
  so there is no debt of society . 
  everyone wants young infants . 
  of course there are exceptions . 
  there are heterosexual families taking and trying to raise problematic children . 
  i have also heard about a homosexual couple which did what you are trying to present as a norm and succeeded in it . 
  two or three children adopted by them found love and the purpose of living honestly and it was a good thing . 
  but such sacrifice is not a norm . 
  most of people , both homo and heterosexual want healthy , unproblematic , tabula rasa child . 
  there is enough of childless parents wanting to adopt unlucky children from normal or almost normal families , so there is no need for `` doing them [ heterosexuals ] a favour by adopting their children '' . 
  regarding everything else . 
  name partnerships of homosexual people marriages if you want but deal with the fact that in the eyes of many societies they are n't equally beneficial for the society so they should n't gain the privileges granted to partnerships being able to reproduce ( taxes mostly ) . 
  everything else ( medical info , inheritance laws , etc. ), 
  is their human right . 
  will they get tax privileges and a right to compete with heterosexual families for children adoption ? 
  it 's not their private stuff anymore . 
  in my opinion it is their private issues which no one should interfere when we are talking about living together , sharing and inheriting wealth , having an access to medical info and such . 
  tax privileges for families are supposed to support child births so they are simply not for them . 
  right to adoption is a delicate issue and it interferes with third person 's life . 
  it is also an ideological problem despite of progressives ' claims that `` everything is already proven : children of two gays are even happier than children of heterosexuals '', 
  it was said somewhere in this thread that there are very few children `` available '' for adoption in slovenia and all of them are adopted . 
  if there is no choice it is obviously better to have two dads than no dad nor mum but if a child can live in a better ( closer ) substitute of a normal family why to choose the worse substitute ? 
  for ideology ? 
  but really , despite of what germans would like to currently think and despite of all dark pages of the history , polish society is pretty similar to the german society ( at least in case of autochthonous germans ) . 
  it is absolutely not socially acceptable to beat a women in poland and i believe that the same norm exists in germany ( i personally know maybe a dozen or two of them ) . 
  if you would expect differences related to violence or crime , you would expect it to be statistically more often in case of polish people ( there are still way to many primitives here ) . 
  the difference between 35 % of german women experiencing some kind of violence against 19 % of polish women experiencing such is hardly explainable if you assume homogeneity in this matter . 
  the `` private hands '' were somehow hands of their dedicated supporter and the line of the newspaper and its accompanying `` uwa\u017cam rze '' weekly paper changed almost instantly after the take over . 
  they just did n't foresee that the authors of the `` uwa\u017cam rze '' weekly will all instantly move to a new , independent paper . 
  i remember how they , including komorowski being the president of poland at the time , urged voters to not go to vote ( in referendum about cancelling h.gronkiewicz-waltz cadence ) . 
  i remember how they thrown out literally millions of signatures supporting calling of referendums because they did n't like the purpose of these referendums . 
  i also remember how they tried to steal 2 seats in the constitutional court because something like 11 out of 15 was too few for them . 
  po was anti-democratic for years and all these `` defenders of democracy '' were happily watching it from their armchairs . 
  the people protesting have their right to fight the political force they are not able to tolerate . 
  pis supporters did the same during the muddy years of po 's rule but trying to use such hysterical statements and manipulating the western world to believe that we are one step from a fascist state is pathetic and dangerous to our country . 
  i really believe that nothing truly alarming happens . 
  i am not saying that what is happening is a good or desirable thing . 
  i am also not pis voter ( but i suppose that i may soon falsely claim that i am one just to irritate various , hysterical `` defenders of democracy '' ) . 
  pis does exactly the same what po with psl did and what pis did before and what sld ( post ) communists did before . 
  each of the wining parties try to grab as much of the power as it is possible . 
  each and every of the winning parties try to grab the public media to put its people there and have a free propaganda tube . 
  each of them pushes their social agenda using means they have . 
  every winning party replaces top managers of national companies and all top administrative officers ( to gain control and to reward its prominent supporters ) . 
  each winning party does it in poland ( and it is wrong ) . 
  unfortunately , the previous government has almost unlimited support of mainstream media ( what currently happens on very popular onet.pl portal is unbelievable - it is an alternative reality ) and as it can be seen they are also very vocally supported by the western left . 
  it 's po and psl ( which lost the power ) and sld ( which is n't even in the parliament after the most recent elections ) who act unreasonably and seem like trying to achieve abolishment of the legally elected government . 
  so can we agree that po is `` democracy breaking '' party , just like pis ? 
  not `` some people '' . 
  i am talking about the same people . 
  they are screaming about unforgivable breaking of democracy today while they silently approved the same actions taken by po .

  we are still left with `` preventive measurements '' and `` reasons behind that '' . 
  please , intelligent individual , show me the way . 
  errr . . okay . 
  so we have this event , it is horrible and you would n't think that it would happen on such scale in progressive sweden . 
  what you want to talk about ? 
  reasons behind that ? 
  what it forecasts or what preventive should be implemented ? 
  which one is n't `` panicked bullshit '' ? 
  show me the way . 
  i would n't call permanent autumn an exotic climate but it might be just me : p, 
  yes , you are right . 
  so there is that question : why different standards ? 
  only because ukrainians have decency to not burn their papers ? 
  are we really such bureau * cracy * that when there is no paper we are running around like a headless chicken ?

  they can find their way to germany and sweeden going throught whole europe , i 'm sure they will be able to find they way back home if left on the other side .

  but it makes me laught , looking what is unfolding , looking at all these cultural and racial tensions and somehow people manage to pick on us poles hehehe . 
  it must be these face veils and good friday processions and bloody ponczki !, 
  if we need a war to keep our system working ... hmmm ... 
  i think i have seen it somewhere , some history lessons maybe ? 
  this is what i think too but maybe i was n't clear about that . 
   well , comon person wo n't feel that but you will hear what we have been hearing for all this time from economists : `` look at that wonderfull gdp ! '', 
  it makes them more money than it makes for us , it makes some money for us , but we both wo n't see them as it all goes into fat cats pockets . 
  * magics of gdp * . 
  if one person has all the money in the country of starving people , gdp sill will be fine . 
   their whole membership is disadvantageous to us lol , you , like germans , are building your factories and production halls in poland , paying polish wages while selling products for western market . 
  * `` oh it is so disadvantageous to us '' * come ooooon , we are your little china and you are enjoying that . 
   around 99 % of polish-produced passenger and delivery cars is exported abroad . 
  https://msp.gov.pl/en/polish-economy/economic-news/5329,car-production-in-poland-summary-of-2013-and-forecasts-for-2014.html as first closer example i know : stiegelmeyer , clinic beds sold for lots of money , i think they have two assembly complexes in poland . 
  and they do n't treat them like german or any western workers and they much enjoy this fact . 
  i 'm not happy with that but do n't dare say that our membership is disadvantageous for your countries . 
  by making stuff here and taking these things back home you are basically producing mony out of thin air . 
  well , comon person wo n't feel that but you will hear what we have been hearing for all this time from economists : * `` look at that wonderfull gdp !,

  if a kid was orphaned in the process is it bad enought to call it a victim ? 
   half-consents i might sound like an ass , considering you are one with the victims of such crime but ... is n't consent a binary thing ? 
  that 's what i 'm told , there is `` yes '' or `` no '' and that 's all . 
  `` i do n't feel like doing it but yes , lets do it '' is still yes , and `` i do n't feel like doing it so we do n't '' is no .

  quality argument mate,

  is he wearing the hungarian crown ? 
  [ this site ] ( http://atlas.cid.harvard.edu/explore/tree_map/import/show/all/0901/2013/ ) is pretty much the same thing with better ui . 
  you do n't actually know much about belarus , do you ? 
  what 's wrong with nationalism ? 
  it 's nice to see some quality political discussion , that 's why i love this site, 
  could you point out the actual flaws instead of just calling them `` retarded '', 
   freemason guy and nationalist guy who are you refering to ? 
  wow , how dare someone have a different opinion from me !, 
   my point is that some of them ( ... ) are claiming that they 're successors of ancient lithuanians . 
  how is that implied by presence of their ( and yours ) national symbols , and statues of their leaders ? 
  those are quite different situations . 
  one of them is two nations sharing long and continous history in one realm , and remembering it . 
  the other one is a nation claiming history of another , who `` created '' it long before they themselves came to the land and declared it as theirs . 
  this issue reminds me of the term `` prussian '' . 
  in english , it is primarily used to describe germans in kingdom of prussia . 
  we in poland however , only use it for baltic nation that existed before xiii century ( so called old prussians ) . 
  this is not a problem , most likely because all of them were either killed or germanised . 
  belarussians have as much of right to call their nation a successor to grand duchy of lithuania as you do . 
  actually , the group is so irrelevant that its general of 4chan is its biggest achievement . 
  funny how some radical atheists claim to be superior to christians in terms of intellect , yet they use terms like `` zombie worship '' . 
  it does that they fail art understanding what religion is about . 
  i 'd say it 's pretty dumb to trivialise the entire philosophical and cultural movement under that . 
  well before those things , there was no one state called germany , so you 're kind of right, 
  well there are more people in bavaria than in austria so it makes sense to put it that way, 
  major polish cities also have presidents , do they not exist ? 
  and how else would you call this guy ? 
  no , it 's because if they released it all at once every one would forget about it in a month, 
  was that reference intentional ?

  political parties get money from the country 's budget here, 
   and polish \u0141 = serbian \u041b ; l = \u0409 i was talking about how these are equivalent , not that they sound the same anyway this is a common sound process , there are even some serbian words where l became o, 
  what about afrikaans ? 
  what 's wrong with our w ? 
  and polish \u0141 = serbian \u041b ; l = \u0409, 
   for finland it 's this hilltop in koli national park . 
  i though finland and hilltops do n't go together, 
  because people need a scapegoat and ca n't realize that some people have different opinions, 
  belarusian is understandable and we have common heritage of i & ii republics, 
  well to be honest there 's not much to slovakian history . 
  you 'd basically be learning about hungary, 
  belarus is just as close culturally and speech-wise , but in different direction, 
  no one cares most of russia is n't ruthenia but russians manage just fine, 
  i think it 's pretty cool , reminds me of a cruise ship, 
  we have [ this ] ( http://fotopolska.eu/foto/84/84277.jpg ) [ thing ] ( http://www.polskaniezwykla.pl/pictures/original/277696.jpg ), 
  chinese history is in no way continuous, 
  omg , some people here complain that poland is ruled from bruxelles . 
  but you have it real bad since you 're not even a member, 
  you thought wrong . 
  find me a historical event that jews have n't been blamed for . 
  lecs\u00f3 - letcho langos - langosh oh my god , so hard to say, 
  yeah , most of the actual ukrainian refugees go to russia ... so you could say putin 's plan about taking over ukraine has workd . 
  it can happen irl when a person reads one kind of newspapers, 
  we only have black coal . 
   the first is that r\u0103zboi might derive from latin `` res bellum '' ( affair of war ) . 
  lmao it 's not . 
  the person who came up with that theory had a case of ass pain and wanted everything to come from glorious roman imperial language and not some slav-speak, 
  as an atheist , i like pizza, 
  this argument is bullshit . 
  if asia minor was full of christian greeks no one would state this . 
  one of the real reasons is turkey having bigger population than germany and failed states of iraq and syria, 
  you realize we will be paying more than receiving starting from the next year, 
   after the fall of the soviet union they have been taking in european money germany benefitted greatly by having access to the polish market , more than we have from getting `` free euromonies '', 
  he was a g\u00f3ral first, 
  because some russian dialects and ukrainian has voiced h instead of g as a sound , that 's the reason probably, 
  is n't that archaic ? 
  i heard the term `` szlovakok '' before or smth, 
  before 19th century it was an integral part of hungary, 
  it was a country created when serbia took a piece of bulgaria . 
  they claim to be descendants of ancient macedonians . 
  not really a nation , just bulgarians who think they 're different, 
  people laugh at eg . 
  `` italian americans '' that have literally no connection to italian culture apart from having a great-great-grandfather from there, 
  there are several documentaries on the matter . 
  most of the world does not use this subreddit . 
  it 's not representative of the society at all, 
  geez , what a surprise / s, 
  i know . 
  it 's just that the polish equivalent ( ksi\u0105\u017c\u0119 ) can mean both a duke and a prince , i never know which is which . 
  but duke would be probably more accurate to be translated as voivode . 
  the first tzar was bulgarian . 
  knyaz means a duke or a voivode . 
   except russia , ukraine , belarus and other ex-ussr countries why not there ? 
  a person can own more than one firearm . 
   the mother of democracy wow , you realize that period 200 years ? 
  after that a lot has happened . 
  they even had their own empire . 
  and not just any one , but the f ` ing roman empire . 
  they 're a national celebrity that unites the country . 
  a state symbol much like a flag or a hymn . 
  and that goes for a whole dynasty , not just one monarch . 
  if you want call galicia-lodomeria relevant , then you 're out of your mind,

  what are they then ? 
  young turks mentality alive and well , huh ? 
  nonsense . 
  if pis leadership started cosy-ing up to putin the party would implode from under them before you could finish saying `` placek z jagodami '' . 
  pis can sell a lot of bullshit , but they ca n't sell that the whole world suddenly conspires against poland and them . 
  it would make them look absurdly incompetent diplomacy-wise even to their stenchest supporters . 
  i think that relocation of nato summit would have been extremely effective measure when it comes to putting pressure on them . 
  there are some misconceptions here :  balwan = snowman in polish , big stone in slovak it also means an idol ( like a pagan statue vaguely shaped like a person ) tho it 's rarely used like that due to snowmen being much more common of a thing . 
   pilka = ball in polish , saw ( for cutting wood ) in slovak `` pi\u0142ka '' indeed means `` ball '' , but it also means a `` small saw '' with `` pi\u0142a '' being a basic word for a saw . 
   frajerka = pigeon in polish , girlfriend in slovak pigeon in polish is `` go\u0142\u0105b '' and `` frajerka '' would mean a gullible person of female variety , a sucker . 
  soc-dem one if anything . 
  come join the purple side of the force in front of pm 's office !, 
  we got p\u0105czki !, 
  translation : cena 1 g\u0142osu = = price of a vote liczba zdobytych g\u0142os\u00f3w = = number of votes received wydatki = = ( total ) expenses i 'll leave who-is-who for someone else on an offchance there is interest since i do n't have time atm . 
  it 's much , * much * easier to protest peacefully if police remains so . 
  oh we 're suckers for a minimalist design . 
  sometime to a fault ... 
  not sure if serious ... 
  they won but only a simple majority . 
  the whole problem is about them trying to ignore the constitution since they ca n't change it . 
  they do n't have a democratic mandate to do that . 
  democracy is the very thing we 're fighting here for . 
  it 's a bit weird since while government is in charge of publishing such verdicts it is compelled by the constitution to do so `` immediately '' . 
  theoretically there are other ways of publishing the verdict but they have n't been used before since this is the 1st problem like this . 
  since refusal to publish it goes hand in hand with the refusal to enforce it ( which is the duty of executive branch ) it is used as a symbol of breaking the constitutional order by the government . 
  we have several happenings planned . 
  for example for 18:00 tomorrow we plan to get as many chairs as possible put them in rows cinema-like and just sit there , looking at pm 's office waiting for the publication while eating popcorn . 
  we 'll provide popcorn for everyone :d https://www.facebook.com/events/972854072803164/, 
  we initially organized it and since we could n't broadcast our plans till earlier today initially only our members and supporters got the memo , but apparently other opposition groups such as kod are joining in . 
  i just came back from there to unfreeze a little and grab some warm clothes  the idea is to keep the protest going for up to a week or till the government finally publishes the damn thing . 
  it is an impromptu protest ( was n't officially registered at city hall ) so we could n't announce it before today due to legal reasons . 
  turned out pretty well considering . 
  we had 100-150 people between 18 and 22 and we 'll need at least 15 people at all times to prevent it from being dissolved but we 're prepping for the night and it should n't be a problem  sadly we wo n't be able to keep shouting or playing music between 22 and 6 but we 're planning to fight the government by defiantly playing board games and eating pizza . 
  few more photos : http://imgur.com/a/sfkww edit : it 's 6:30 now so we 're back with music and shouting and around 50 people already . 
  pretty damn great weather too !, 
  20-30 people spent the night around our tents and it was uneventful . 
  today should be interesting . 
  sidenote : there will be an impromptu protest in front the chancellery of the prime minister ( al. 
  ujazdowskie 1/3 ) at 6pm today ( in 35 minutes ) if anyone from warsaw feels like doing some shouting . 
  edit : actually the protest will continue through the night for at least 24h , so if you happen to have some time at any point today or tomorrow come hang out . 
  i 've read the nik report . 
  only * actual * allegation was the fact that 2 cars were bought using wrong procedures , but those were procured by agencja rozwoju rolnictwa for the institution , rather than by the institution itself . 
  rest of the document is made of general statements and observation without basis provided . 
  it was reported by wsj citing unnamed officials in us state department , tho in not those exact words . 
  no one has skin that is actually white . 
  the map uses a.good way of describing skin tones . 
  serbia can into nordic !, 
  oh he 's an asshole , alright . 
  but he ai n't wrong on this one . 
   give it a greek name eus varoufakis ? 
  can we get a rubber duck for scale ? 
  in this photo the slovenian bathtub looks almost like a sea and we all know that actual ships ca n't possibly fit in slovenia . 
  to make the parking more secure , obviously . 
  those damn new zealanders are known for being notorious car thiefs . 
  another anschluss ? 
  and while mongolians have n't burned any continents to the ground as of late , why chance it ? 
  smartflix . 
  much . 
  better . 
  fishing regulations mostly . 
   potato-y what does that even mean ? 
  make up a proper grievance , will ya ? 
  is one proper fucking negative stereotype so much to ask ? 
  what article hints at but fails to emphasize is a fact that official requirements to be eligible for card of the pole do n't match the reality . 
  in fact for ukrainians and belorussians as long as you do n't have a criminal record the documents they provide wo n't be looked at too closely and any possible glaring discrepancies will usually be overlooked in their favor . 
  at this point those fairly strict rules are just a facade obfuscating what is pretty damn clever and well executed migration scheme engineered in such a way that both eu official bodies and our eastern neighbors have trouble proving that we 're blatantly circumventing migration and visa rules of the former , as well as performing an organized brain drain operation against the latter . 
  bottom line is that almost every interested belorussian or ukrainian will be granted the card . 
  source : i know several ukrainians with the card as well as a few mfa officials ( old university buddies ) with whom i spoken about it . 
   i do to . 
  you now owe $ 70 for missing an `` o '' . 
  will austrian barbarism ever end ? 
  i wonder why twitter , of all things , is so unpopular in poland compared to the rest of europe . 
  you 've been convinced by * that * book ? 
  man , average plotek or fakt article has better sources and academic integrity . 
  that whole book is citing rumors as fact and overall character assassination . 
  my opinion of ipn tanked like a concrete dingy when they published that piece of crop and called it history . 
  based on this `` poor wording '' you get articles such as one we 're commenting here or this one : http://wiadomosci.onet.pl/kraj/ipn-lech-walesa-podpisal-zobowiazanie-wspolpracy-z-sb-pierwsze-komentarze/vc8lb4 someone should lose a fucking job over this because at this point wa\u0142\u0119sa would be in the right to sue ipn for their yearly budget or so . 
  be advised that the site you got sent to is heavily politicized and this surely is n't an objective summary . 
  https://ipn.gov.pl/en/news/2016/official-statement-on-the-inspection-of-the-first-batch-of-materials-secured-by-the-prosecutor-of-the-ipn-on-16-february-2016 the sentence in question is this : `` documents found in both files cover a period from 1970 to 1976 . 
  in the opinion of an expert-archivist participating in the activities , ** the documents are authentic ** . '' . 
  i sure hope it 's just a case of a dumb pr person writing a statement . 
  not even commenting on a moronic title of of this article that has nothing to do with that press statement that is literally the only bit of information there is at this point . 
  oh please ... 
  i 've worked on ipn files and believe me - they usually are n't the most one-dimensional sources out there . 
  honestly the `` confirmation '' bit in their press release is outright disgusting . 
  you can not confirm an authenticity of over 300 cards ( so up to ~ 700 pages ) of documents in several hours . 
  especially when you know that a forgery perpetrated few years later is an option . 
  to properly authenticate documents such as those they have to among other things : - confirm the dates on those documents and compare them with other information both on officers and a subject ( so if someone has n't made a series of reports in szczecin while spending 4 weeks in bieszczady ) - make sure that the style of documents is consistent with the years they were supposed to had been made - compare handwriting looking for both differences in handwriting of a single person as well as similarities between things supposedly written by different individuals . 
  - compare the language and style used by those people to the same end . 
  - look for mentions of events and make sure they are consistent with the dates on documents ( so if document dated 1972 is n't mentioning anything about an event from 1980 . 
  - compare those documents with other created in the same offices and by the same people . 
  and so on and so forth . 
  you know - all the stuff a fucking history student has to do when working on a source to get through a 2nd year of his bachelor 's degree . 
  none of which can be done in 5 hours . 
  you could be the most competent archivist in poland and all you could really say in few hours is that documents seem consistent with the era and that there are n't obvious signs of modern forgery . 
  i know for a fact that an uw history student trying to make such judgment based on that data and work would get to get their shit together real fast or repeat a year . 
  one would hope that the biggest historical institution in the country has at least similar standards . 
  i sure hope it was some dumb pr person that written this bullshit of a memo . 
  the `` confirmation '' bit in their press release is outright disgusting . 
  you can not confirm an authenticity of over 300 cards ( so up to ~ 700 pages ) of documents in several hours .

  so in fact segregation , separate laws for each selected group of people and privileges for those considered as `` handicapped '' or `` mistreated '' . 
  i do n't care if muslims are behind or ahead according to some ideology , they 're just different and their ways of life , relation to other people and especially women are simply intolerable . 
  no offence , but really these slogans and labels pinned on some ideas sounds like from a bad tv commercial . 
  what does it even mean that some idea is `` ahead '' of another and why should i even care if it is ? 
  no need to thank me , we 're just exchanging opinions and information , that 's what conversation is about  maybe you 're right , but that security was coming at price of a total control and insane restrictions . 
  it 's all still changing and if you wants to see , i was just posting [ crimes in poland between 2001-14 ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/mapporn/comments/4drsuf/criminal_poland_crimes_per_100000_inhabitants/ ) few days ago on / r/mapporn . 
  some countries did n't handled that at all , ukraine is just a sad example , but many other post soviet countries are n't much better , many just have natural resources but crimes , corruption and central gov and services control did n't changed that much . 
  that was just the `` right wing '' , or more exactly the non communist side and `` democrates '' , the communists that were kicked out of the party in 1968 in a wave of anti `` zionist '' campaign , before invasion of czechoslovakia . 
  finally it resulted in emergence of two major camps , or parties and a one just replaced the post communists as a `` left wing '' , but both have roots in `` solidarno\u015b\u0107 '' or around it . 
  you 're obviously right , sorry for that . 
   rotana group ( arabic : \u0631\u0648\u062a\u0627\u0646\u0627 , r\u014dt\u0101n\u0101 ) , also known simply as rotana , is the arab world 's largest entertainment company . 
  it is primarily owned by the saudi prince al-waleed bin talal , with an 18.97 % share held by news corp and 21st century fox . 
  i was n't completely serious , but also i ca n't remember when bulgaria or poland had a racist , segregating laws . 
  excuse me , but are you kidding or are you seriously believing in these `` progressive '' slogans ? 
  what the hell is actually `` balanced society '' and what 's '' morally and socially behind '' or ahead ? 
  this kind of `` arguments '' are good for an advertisement of some washing powder , not for politics . 
  as everything under that far lefty regime , it was partly illusion . 
  medias and even some official reports were n't reporting many crimes and reporting others for political reasons like demonstrating or writing and publishing censored opinions . 
  if you wants to include nutrition , medicine or living and working conditions then it gets even less safe . 
  in opposite to 90s it was just stable and predictable , now we 're back to more or less the same at least in this regard . 
  many people knows about stasi in eastern germany , or at least heard about it . 
  i think that 90s were similar in most of post communist countries , russians often likes to whine that it was so bad in there and of course it 's the fault of americans , as always , but it was just bankruptcy of communism and central planned economy all around . 
  poland was poorer than ukraine , literally bankrupt , besides of the mentioned events this was also a time of political instability when pms and govs could change every two months , dozens of minor parties in parliament and unstable coalitions . 
  crazy times , but still i remember it as quite a good time because i was just a kid . 
  same can be said in opposite way . 
  the western europe and actually usa compensating ages of slavery , colonialism and abusing homosexuals with crazy pc and privileged position for selected minorities . 
  they also view eastern europe as `` morally handicapped '' , victimise these chosen minorities and tries to force their `` morality '' . 
   the middle east media research institute ( memri ) is a not for profit press monitoring and analysis organization with headquarters in washington , dc . 
  i mean that regular policemen ( then militia ) were n't the worst and for sure not the most influential . 
  the secret police ( s\u0142u\u017cba bezpiecze\u0144stwa ) and secret services ( wsw , wsi ) were able to create with their contacts , knowledge and of course secrecy a kind of criminal or semi legal system with help of many corrupted or blackmailed politicians . 
  some people in poland have a hard time accepting inconvenient facts , but that `` genius '' wa\u0142\u0119sa just pardoned a boss of mafia , so called `` s\u0142owik '' . 
  the chief of police gen. papa\u0142a was just murdered in front of his house and the only motif revealed by the `` investigation '' was a robbery of his car ... daewoo espero . 
  i can go on with murders of former communist pm jaroszewicz , some ministers or this kind of mafia like executions , which were never really investigated ... 
  terrible and not a single official of that far left regime was ever judged for these massacres , just like in the rest of communist occupied countries . 
  poland is not a modern country because it 's still developing , it can be not considered as such because people are conservative and leftists use `` progressive '' slogans to brand their ideology . 
  so yes , we need some better pr , but i hardly doubt it 's possible to challenge the `` modern '' politicians and mass medias . 
   police more like the secret police and services than regular policemen . 
  is legatum institute really a credible source ? 
  somehow i do n't trust anne applebaum and left extremists like sierakowski which she 's hosting there . 
  yeah , it was said that he knew all of these languages but he had nothing to say in any of them . 
  interesting , i guess latin and greek was taught in schools then , but i 've had no idea that in protestant england someone would want to read books published in latin . 
  it was . 
  such kings were weak , poor and powerless , there was n't a central authority taking strategic decisions . 
  finally since the great ( third ) northern war , election of august ii wettin and defeat of stanis\u0142aw leszczy\u0144ski , they were dependant on foreign powers which forced and guaranteed their rule . 
  august iii was elected by his own supporters on the eastern bank of vistula with assistance of muscoviye army , when others elected lesczczy\u0144ski again ... 
  finally the last king stanis\u0142aw poniatowski used to be lover of catherine holstein-gottorp and happened to be a traitor which just signed partitions , took money to pay his debts and moved out to petersburg . 
  not just in there , it 's a global thing . 
  ok maybe except for spain where such heretic names like jesus or judas are tolerated ... hehe one of my great grandpas was a railroad engineer . 
  they were mobilised by germans just like policemen and forced to work or just get executed . 
  he was driving people to the camps , but helped to hide and escape several of them ... his older brother died in wwi ( in russian army ) , parents died for typhus and he was alone with two sisters . 
  i still have his pictures from the polish - bolshevik war , a teenage volunteer scared as hell , but still on a horse with sabre . 
  sometimes i really ca n't imagine how these people could live and survive such conditions , or i must be really lucky to live here in such good times and i 'm taking everything for granted . 
  i guess you must feel similar when hearing these stories , absolutely unreal , like from some hollywood movie . 
  go back to caucasia , pls !, 
  yup , was there once and it was a blast . 
  i remember a one huge cave we were visiting and funny language . 
  my grandpa was considered a `` ku\u0142ak '' , his family just had a bit too big farm , no matter that there were eight siblings to share it . 
  so , he was not given extra points in school as the other `` proletaryans '' and not allowed a space in dorm . 
  he had to work and fight for everything but still he managed to get his architect engineer degree and a serious job in warsaw . 
  he never in his life joined party or collaborated with regime and this is why he was not promoted over some level . 
  he was also a forced laborer , a slave worker in germany during wwii when he was barely 14 . 
  well , the name is very jewish , but i knew people with names like moses or samuel . 
  david or adam , not to mention jakob are some of the most popular names in poland even at now . 
  it is some problem to keep national identity without a country and a state , a political and international representation , but then there 's language , tradition and religion , especially when it 's a national , not global , religion like judaism . 
   ussr if i may ask a personal question , was your father a member of the party ? 
  internationalism was a policy of communists so it 's hard to talk about nationality or identity of its followers . 
  no offence to your father , but if not language , religion and traditions made his identity , then what else ? 
  just family ties and ethnic background ? 
  sure , you just need to wear a one and others will follow ... they will , trust me . 
  confirmed . 
  i 'm wildly not paying attention to german opinions about our elected persons and i 'd love to argue with someone about that . 
  also , i 'm stronkly boastful . 
  i guess it was the same all over this part of europe then . 
  until renaissance documents and literature was published almost only in latin , then it was both , also with local language or mixed local with many latin words . 
  in poland even many peasants spoke latin , there were quite a lot of jesuit schools and the catholic masses until quite recently were only in latin . 
  maybe that 's what austrians considered as `` foreign languages '' then , or just a quite multi national society . 
  there 's also an elected `` person '' . 
  even after we saved their sorry asses in battle of vienna , that arrogant prick leopold was disrespecting sobieski and his son because they were just some nobility and he was some fancy `` emperor '' . 
  no , it 's always more complicated . 
  it 's not a matter of belief , but a fact that there were such jews and quite a bit of them , many were just kicked out of russia to its pale of settlement which included the areas of poland , some followed hasidism and other ideological or religious movements which isolated them . 
  illiteracy was a serious issue of pre war poland generally , but jews had their own private , religious schools also and to learn local language it 's enough to use it , practice , just speak with the people . 
  the public schools and universities were obviously teaching in polish , but they were n't teaching basics , universities were n't for everybody like today and there was also `` numerus clausus '' just like in usa . 
  majority of jews were probably like majority of poles , working and resting , listening to the same tango , swing of fox and watching the same movies except for those made in yiddish and there were lots of these . 
  it 's sad that people learns only about negative things , holocaust was terrible , the whole german occupation was just insane brutal and inhumane , but that 's just a final chapter in a very long story . 
  for centuries jews lived here in peace , preserved and developed their culture and identity when everybody around was just expelling and killing them , alienation was an issue but that 's also because nobody was forcing them to assimilate . 
  well , i see some people writing more or less the same . 
  i guess majority was integrated and learned about their roots just when germans told them about it , but ca n't say for sure if i do n't know the stats ( if there were any ) , it just seems unlikely that majority could be isolated and live in their own communities . 
  i guess they mean [ kontusz ] ( http://193.187.64.80/image.php/5006/70_pic_galeriaportretow_antoni_szczuka.jpg ) . 
   how old is this ? 
  officially since 1573 and it was also a monarch , not just a `` person '' , but of course it was not an equal of some austrian emperor which was chosen by a god . 
  poland was in general `` progressive '' or just developed a different political system which happened to be less effective than `` enlightened '' absolutism . 
  he forgot to add that issues were resolved by unanimous vote , not the qualified majority . 
  still , it worked quite well for several centuries , but imagine that now a single mp can say `` veto '' ... 
  no , i do n't think so and you just confirmed that . 
  you still consider society as a group of competing interests , a kind of class war ... 
  there 're few issues specific for each of two sexes , but most of them are just universal , everybody eats , sleeps , most of people wants to get decent education and work . 
  no , you see a one not very serious expression , but that 's how an open minded person would judge the people , right ? 
  yeah and the redheads represent the redheads , left handed represents ... etc. 
  that 's how the `` progressive '' left creates elitist society of alienated , conflicted groups fighting each other for the status of biggest victim . 
  then it 's called `` equality '' .

  i do n't beg for any sympathy , but i 've met people who could n't belive that , they were taught all their lives that just the jewish people suffered under occupation . 
  and that 's why it 's `` unfair '' to call these camps `` german '' ? 
  just becouse someone could relate it to present germans or those few ones who opposed national socialist goverment ? 
  the reason why people could call wehrmaht the `` nazi army '' is the same as they say `` nazi state '' instead of germany , so either this army as well as the policies of the state ( like camps ) were german , or nazi . 
  make up your mind . 
  btw . 
  i 've never heard from a polish veteran that he founght the `` nazis '' . 
  there were few people like that , most germans supported the policies of their state , either for opportunist reasons , or a fear , but it does n't matter . 
  the point is that it was oficially german state , recognised both by germans and by every other state . 
  no , there are no more camps , just museums and graveyards . 
  it means that whoever writes obama speeches does n't know who made these camps for whom . 
  are you dumb ? 
  the whole thread is about how to call these camps , you say that 's `` unfair '' to call them `` german '' and i say it 's really unfair to call them `` polish '' or `` jewish '' . 
  got it ? 
  bullshit , everybody was hit by the crisis and it would continue if not his reforms . 
  there was no hidden anti jewish conspiracy behind it and besides of some stupid comments made by some of these politicians , there were no anti jewish policies . 
  i 'm asking for serious policies , not some opinions or comments which had no effect on jewish population . 
  you mean anti nazi posters ? 
  i 'm over it , that 's not my point , all i say is that this term got common . 
  aha , but the camps were `` polish '' . 
  just stfu idiot . 
  ... and what else are we talking about ? 
  would you like sweden to be called a nazi collaborator ? 
  and who call you nazis ? 
  are n't you confusing some jokes or trolls with serious politicians and massmedia outlets ? 
  should i ignore millions of their readers ? 
  since some of these papaers are the major ones , with millions of readers ... nobody attributes them to present germany . 
  these graphics were made by some amateurs and i agree that the one with contemporary german flag is wrong . 
  probably , but why then the same papers used it again , even after they were forced to apologise the previous times ? 
  i guess they need to learn the hard way , in the courts . 
  apparently it 's enough common to include it in a presidential speech . 
  i 've asked for a source . 
   anti-german atmosphere after a century of colonisation and abuse of local polish population , which was treated as second class people by the german regime , it 's not suprising . 
  still , an `` atmosphere '' is not an official state policy , which was never directed against germans or the other minorities . 
  i guess you 're talking about emmigration , not a displacement . 
   there was no german-polish community any longer of course there was , there was even a german party in parliament . 
  so i say it again , there was no poland when the camps were constructed and operated . 
  their location was in germany or german occupied territories , but apparently to call them `` german camps '' seems to be `` unfair '' for germans . 
  ... obama for example , should i list all of the papers which called these camps `` polish '' ? 
  unfortunatelly some people do and this is why many poles feels offended . 
  you moron , why should i care about how `` unfair '' it 's for the germans if nobody cares about how unfair it is for their victims ? 
  and why not `` german death camps '' ? 
  it was organised by the german state , not a national socialist party . 
  no , i do n't even think he 's writing his own speeches , but this shows how far it goes when people assume this phrase is something commonly used . 
  how do you know that ? 
  some of those papers are considered `` respectful '' . 
  i saw such phrases in die welt or spiegel , sometimes in a context of `` polish antisemitism '' . 
  insane or uneducated , but there 're people like that anyway . 
  i 'm trying to be calm , but it 's annoying how germans tries to whitewash themselves and put the blame on their victims . 
  which prooves that calling these camps `` polish '' becouse of their location is just wrong . 
  so you say that the people who slander poland for the policies of german state are `` nationalists '' ? 
  wow , i pity the author . 
  in 1920 there was a global crisis , hyperinflation and terrible poverty , thanks to the reforms of grabski we could actually build a functional state after wwi , bolshevik war and most of all a century of partitions . 
  to connect it with some strange opinions of a one senator or to picture it as targetted against the jews , you just have to be either ignorant , or simply dumb . 
  same goes for the other things , empty accusations and not a single referrence to the official policies , documents or activity of public services . 
   unfortunate instances of them being called polish death camps your president did it once , when awarding the highest american distinction for jan karski ... 
  ca n't find original report of fm , just secondary articles , but anyway ... 
  in 2009 about 103 times there was used this phrase in foreign medias , 20 times in german , 16 in american and spanish , 8 times in austrian , 6 in canadian and italian , 5 in french . 
  source ? 
  i 've had these conversations many times , none of the nazi apologists was able to proove these accusations and war propaganda . 
  what a bullshit . 
  there were no policies against any minorities , only against soviet communists and ukrainian nationalists , as well as the polish ones . 
  bishop hlond was the first man who reported about what germans are doing in poland , also to the jews , his reports were broadcasted by vatican radio , which was of course forbidden in germany . 
  konzentrationslagers were located either on german annexed territory or general goverment . 
  now they 're on territory of poland , but not when they were constructed by the german state . 
  they were built by germany and used by germany on a german or german occupied teritory , in poland there were no death camps . 
  so is it fair to call them `` polish '' ? 
  why not `` jewsih '' instead ? 
  there was no poland then , it was either territory annexed by germany or general goverment . 
  no , not everyone knows that german state constructed these places and filled them with jews , poles , gypsies etc. 
   polish nationalist ffs is everyone who cares about his country and its reputation , a `` nationalist '' ? 
  national socialists were just a party , but this party won elections and run the state of germany . 
  every state is run by some goverment and nobody 's changing the name of a country after every elections . 
  the first victims of those camps were etchnic poles , to call these places `` polish '' is not just wrong , it 's horribly unfair . 
  note , these are some amateurish graphics , not any official campaign . 
  i think they should leave eurozone a long time ago and devaluate their currency . 
  not to leave eu . 
  i was just commenting your arrogant opinion about them not being important and not contributing . 
  there 's no relation beteen vat and health care , there 's another `` tax '' for that and in poland it 's 75 % of average wage , about 2.000 z\u0142oty ( 500 $ ) a month . 
  i know , but once you join some club , you 'd expect to be treated at least with some decency and respect . 
  the only people responsible for your problems are your `` politicians '' , but you 're not recovering also becouse eurozone do n't want to let you go . 
  the least responsible are the greek people and some just forgets about it . 
  well , eu members have different vats , also for different products . 
  i 've said 23 % , which is the highest one in poland since donald promised to rise everything for a 1 % , he said it will be just for a one year ... 
  anyway , as you can see , states in this union can also have their own fiscal policies . 
  eh litwa , greece is as much important member of the union as you , or germans , are . 
  ffs this is the union , not a reich . 
  ha ha ... now , pay 23 % instead of 8-9 % murican sales tax . 
  ha ha !, 
   the phalanges , allies to the israeli defence forces , were ordered by the idf to clear out sabra and shatila from plo fighters , as part of the idf maneuvering into west beirut . 
  this was the reason , not just the religion . 
  i do n't mean all of the muslims , but many of them just ca n't accept other cultures , also the native european culture of the countries which are nice enough to host and support them . 
  if they dislaike europe , why then they do n't move out to some islamic state ? 
  there they would n't face `` racism '' or `` stereotypes '' . 
  sure , and this is why they 're slaughtering christians in the middles east ? 
  do n't lecture me on `` racism '' since muslims are by far the most intolerant people around . 
  except that some ideas works and the other do n't , but personally i 'm a big fan of science and natural law . 
  the lefty idea of a `` social contract '' and social engeeniring goes against the nature . 
  the `` progress '' in this meaning is just an empty slogan , quite overused by the leftys . 
  i prefere julius verne than marx , his visions were actually confirmend in reality .

  feel free to advocate for your country to exit nato . 
  let other countries be in it . 
  `` niderlandy '' is sometimes used , mostly in historic context , but still much less often than holandia . 
  while i agree russia was always european country , i disagree it was western european . 
   their whole history was hand-in-hand with europe 's until 1918 . 
  monarchs , authoritarianism , the whole deal . 
  russia had no renneisance , no reformation , no contrreformation , no `` spring of peoples '' in 1848 . 
  industrialization happened mostly in xxth century , there was no democratic government to speak of since novogrod merchant republic . 
  it 's hardly `` hand-in-hand '' with western europe. , and it 's ok - the circumstances were just diffferent . 
  another important differences - russia freed peasants significantly later than western & central european countries . 
  and collectivised farming just 2 generations later . 
  also  oligarchy , as many western countries in the recent past . 
  which ones ? 
  is n't it wise to join forces against aggression ? 
   p.s : not all superpowers have to be like america and prey on tiny , weak ( ? ), 
  oil abundant countries . 
  - . - ' russia seems to work exactly like that . 
   are you telling me latin emerged from slavic ? 
  come off !!!, 
  both emerged from common ancestor , and slavic is closer to latin than many people think . 
  for example they have similar declension rules , perfect-imperfect division , no articles , and both use 7 cases ( this i 'm saying basing on knowledge of polish , maybe other slavic languages lost some cases , at any rate common slavic had 7 cases like latin ) . 
  if you consider grammar rules - modern romance languages are further from latin , than slavic languages . 
  yes the animation had some errors ( for example there should be ruthenian , not russian before dividing into ukrainian/russian/belarussian ) . 
  and the dates are wrong . 
  i have n't missed it . 
  putin did . 
  russia anexed part of sovereign country , how is this not a `` conquering spree '' ? 
  it 's still keeping its soldiers in many countries against will of their governments ( ossetia , transdniestria , eastern ukraine ) . 
  it fought at least 4 wars in last 20 years . 
  it brainwash population , and falsify history . 
  it persecute minorities ( lgbt for one example ) . 
  it forbids foreign ngos , it censors internet , it 's common for journalists to be killed there . 
  it 's not totalitarian , but it sure is authoritarian country , and it gets worse quickly . 
  how much do you think it was worth to pay to avoid ww2 ? 
  because hitler could only start it because democratic countries decreased military spending and were generaly pacifistic . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_vienna http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_warsaw_%281920%29, 
  if it were n't for us , you 'd all be speaking turkish / s or russian for that matter . 
  why compare hungary to landlocked countries outside europe . 
  that 's their purpose . 
  and rossija 1 just has different approach to 1968 intervention in czechoslovakia  i mean zeman wanted to go to putin celebrations of ww2 and was against sanctions . 
  your president seems to like them , though ? 
  eastern poland likes russia even less than western poland . 
  average size of farm per farmer http://www.wspolczesna.pl/apps/pbcsi.dll/bilde?site=gw&amp;date=20130913&amp;category=rolnictwo01&amp;artno=130909731&amp;ref=ar&amp;border=0&amp;maxw=500 eastern and central poland has more people in countryside - families living there lived there for centuries , farms were divided between kids , they got smaller and more uniformly populated . 
  north west poland was given to poland and settled almost from scratch in 1945 - so farms are bigger , and more people live in cities , so there is more place for wildlife between towns and villages . 
  also overall population density is lower ( except poznan and wroc\u0142aw region ) . 
  for comparison . 
  overall population density http://rivers.icm.edu.pl/images/5/5e/pop_density.png countryside population density http://info-poland.buffalo.edu/classroom/maps/pz2.jpg average farm size http://www.wspolczesna.pl/apps/pbcsi.dll/bilde?site=gw&amp;date=20130913&amp;category=rolnictwo01&amp;artno=130909731&amp;ref=ar&amp;border=0&amp;maxw=500 not only boar-rich regions have less people - additionally less of them live in countryside , and each farmer has bigger fields there , so there 's more space between buildings . 
  population density map . 
  http://rivers.icm.edu.pl/images/5/5e/pop_density.png and population in `` poland b '' is more uniformly distributed , while in `` poland a '' you have a lot of forests , and fields - in poland b these are smaller and more often interrupted by small villages . 
  he is a pupet of kaczy\u0144ski , as anti-russian as it gets . 
  this is the best solution . 
  thanks , but i thought kasparov is outside russia ? 
  i am agnostic and i go to church occasionaly for the singing . 
  it 's great , especially on pasterka . 
  are there any putin critics you heard of that are alive and well and live in russia ? 
  it 's reasonable for a country at war to prohibit distributing information of military operations during peace ? 
  they just go for a short trip to czech republic or germany . 
  give them all possible sporting events . 
  the sooner they default the sooner the war stops . 
  nope . 
  at least - not only . 
  he also needs to keep ukraine a shithole so russians do n't start to get wrong ideas . 
  obviously it 's not . 
  ukraine in eu and nato with russia keeping crimea would be still very bad for dreams of russian empire . 
  god forbid it would start to develop quickly and people in russia would see that they too can have democracy and prosperity at once . 
  otherways why putin started this whole donetsk and lughansk after crimea ? 
  still poor . 
  keep investing in eastern poland . 
  ukraine is anything but irrelevant for russia . 
  and what are you going to do then ? 
  i like how they chain themselves to these huge ugly chimneys that evaporate pure h2o to cool stuff . 
  poland actually tried to create a colony in africa between ww1 and ww2 . 
  it was a hilarious failure . 
  at least no violence was used . 
  the problem is : 1 % out of a few tousands is  0 . 
  0 % out of hundreds tousands is still 0 . 
   going to look at me as a slav is that a thing ? 
  never had a problem outside 4han . 
  i really , really doubt czech republic had influenced middle east . 
  it 's funny how i always considered czechs less xenephobic than poles . 
  i guess grass always seems greener on the other side . 
  there are reasonable environmentalists and unreasonable ones . 
  i mean - greenpeace is just a scam , and people doing black pr for nuclear energy should pay the families of people that died due to coal industry ( only practical alternative to nuclear for most countries ) . 
  more people died due to coal than due to all nuclear catastrophes including czarnobyl . 
  not counting nuclear bombs of course . 
  but yeah , some things environmentalists say are sensible . 
  uusually it 's half-sensible , like with fracking - you can do it the cheapset way and make a mess , or you can do it properly and einvironment will be ok . 
  should have changed title to `` putin 's party lost local elections in kaliningrad '' or sth like that . 
  current title says nothing about the article . 
  i thought you refered to russian soldiers making vacations in ukraine . 
  poland : - toru\u0144 city ( central poland ) - it 's well preserved medieval city , part of the german-style poland , place where copernicus was born , and it 's just very nice for a few days . 
  there 's planetarium , nice riverside of vistula , but the main attraction is the old town . 
  - lublin city ( eastern poland ) - place where polish-lithuanian commonwealth was created , very important city in commonwealth during renneisance and baroque , has great renneisance-baroque old town , in unique lublin reneneisance style ( a mix of polish , italian , and ruthenian architecture ) . 
  completely different from well-known polish cities . 
  also it lies on hills over valleys of 3 rivers - makes for a great views . 
  there 's a castle , a german death camp from ww2 - majdanek ( better preserved than auschwitz ) , wooden architecture museum , botanic garden , underground passages in the old town , and a lot of great architecture . 
  and there 's few tourists , as only recently the city became accessible from abroad ( there 's an airport there since 2012 ) . 
  small sample http://static.panoramio.com/photos/1920x1280/78731887.jpg - also in less than 1,5 hour drive from lublin you can see zamo\u015b\u0107 ( city created in xvith century by one man and one architect as a perfect renneisance town - unesco heritage place ) , koz\u0142\u00f3wka palace , and kazimierz dolny ( small and very pretty town by the vistula river , `` bohemian '' place - lots of painters , singers , folk artists , and tourists , but mostly poles - foreigners do n't usually go there ) . 
  all of these are worth seeing for a few hours . 
  - bieszczady mountains - small mountains in south-eastern poland , the most wild part of poland , with the least population density .

  let 's take a look on spanish constitution :  art . 
  this is an expression of modern ideas on law based on ideas of enlightement and human rights . 
  in comparison to some of the rules from classic greece or rome the laws of old seem barbaric to us . 
  however , the fragment of melian dialogue i quoted is related to ** international relations ** . 
  there are no binding rules for sovereign countries except those they chose to accept and uphold . 
  this concept is known as [ anarchy in international relations ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/anarchy_%28international_relations%29 ) . 
  if you violate derechos fundamentales in spain you will be penalized for this by the state - which acts through police , courts , penitentiary system etc. 
  but if some country violetes the universal declaration of human rights there is no such institution . 
  there is no `` world police '' or `` world court '' because there are no binding rules . 
  sure , they are international courts but they have jurisdiction only over countries who ** willingly sign the treaty ** giving them such jurisdiction . 
  in other words , if country like usa commits war crimes , tortures prisoners and violates human rights there is nobody to stop them from it ** because they are the strongest country ** . 
  if however albania would do something like this , other countries may enforce some rules * they deem important * on this country , however by doing so they are not doing job of a policeman but vigilante . 
  that 's what this quote is about - ** might makes right ** . 
  this is true and it will remain true forever . 
  in the end all laws are based on state 's capability of using violence against the perpetrator . 
  only because you live in a relatively rich country in eu does n't mean that this universal truth somehow does n't apply . 
  i see . 
  well , it makes sence , maybe you are right . 
  finland has conscription or professional army btw ? 
  what are your opinion on recent developments in georgia and ukraine ? 
  is there any support for joining nato in finland ? 
  i 'm just throwing ideas here , i 'm not an expert in this area but i see no reason to just assume that wo n't work because it may be difficult . 
  you are from gibraltar ? 
  that 's cool - i was there once , awesome place to live !, 
   as for the unified eu military : despite gibraltar issue both uk and spain have cooperated in eu and nato for years , so i doubt this would be a huge obstacle . 
   i do n't think many finns would be keen on giving up any national sovereignty to foreign powers , particularly when it comes to the military . 
  fine , but how are you going to protect yourself ? 
  alone you stand no chance against russia ( and do n't tell me about winter war - it was 80 years ago ) . 
  ask your representative in congress , not me . 
  or [ read this at least . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_foreign_policy_of_the_barack_obama_administration ), 
  because we 're member of nato . 
  yes , because eu army will magically appear the same night when all nato forces dissapear or teleport back to us . 
  we 're talking long-term planning here . 
  err why are you treating me as if i could decide what poland will do ? 
  i 'm just a redditor . 
  * realpolitik . 
  well it would be nice if you could answer to the questions as well . 
   bottom line is we both agree that the eu needs to defend itself and the us should send it 's troops home . 
  yup , we can agree on that i think . 
   i certainly would n't expect them to die for us in a war . 
  are you in the military ? 
  if not your chances of dying for us or its allies are extremely low . 
   why should a stupid and desperate kid sign up knowing he 'd be deployed in your country ? 
  why kids did sign up knowing that they would be deployed in afghanistan or iraq ? 
  did you sign up ? 
  would you sign up ? 
   does poland have the same relationship with the us they did ? 
  and you feel as if you 're entitled to their defense . 
  what do you mean ? 
  what relationship iraq and afghanistan had with us before 9/11 ? 
  you think i am `` entitled '' to defending people living in iraq ? 
  i do n't follow . 
   yes they did die trying to rebuild those nations and in the case of afghanistan to attack those who were responsible for numerous attacks on the us . 
  rebuild iraq after it was invaded by us you mean ? 
  they die during invasion and later fighting against the rebels which started to pop up after us toppled the government and destabilized the whole country . 
  both war in afghanistan and iraq was a complete and expansive failure - no wmd were ever found , the region is more destabilized than it was before and both nations are worse off then they were before . 
   you are expendable as an `` ally . '', 
  oh i know . 
  that 's one of the reasons poland tries to improve it 's military and create some regional military initiative . 
   so you have no answer as to why the people you hate should die for you . 
  if you are talking about soldiers than fighting in the name of their country it 's pretty much their job . 
  if their enlisted it 's not up to them - or do you claim that us soldiers died in iraq and afghanistan because of warm feelings the local population had towards them ? 
  it is far fetched and optimistic but in the long term it may be the only thing which could ensure regional stability . 
  perhaps but it was white house which [ sent us troops to ukraine ] ( http://www.newsweek.com/us-troops-prepare-ukraine-soldiers-russian-onslaught-331906?piano_d=1 ) and [ called for more sanctions against russia ] ( http://www.forbes.com/sites/kenrapoza/2015/03/16/u-s-basically-says-russia-sanctions-will-go-on-forever/ ) . 
  what you or any other american thinks of this is one thing but what your government does is much more important to russia , poland , eu and all other countries . 
  i 'm more interested in facts and actions than statements and your feelings . 
  btw afaik all of potential presidential nominees from gop are pro-involvment in europe and more decisive actions against russia , perhaps save for paul . 
  it 's rather unlikely that us would become isolationist agan , no matter what are your feelings on this . 
  yeah but the lesson which we can take from that is n't `` using realism in international relations is stupid '' bur rather `` using stupid realism in international relations is stupid '' in my opinion . 
  from my point of view usa is an enemy of our enemy , which makes us allies . 
  you seem to think that this makes us friends . 
  if us has little to gain from its involvement in europe ( especially eastern europe ) then why you are still here ? 
  afaik that 's because nato is useful in containing russia and weak russia is something from which us gains quite a lot . 
  if you want to discuss we can discuss but facts not emotions . 
  what do you mean by stronger ? 
  power projection ? 
  if that 's the case than yes , iraq is weaker . 
  howeer iraq has modern equipment and weaponry and a sizeable , battle-hardened army . 
  they do n't stand a chance against a superpower like usa but i would say they are more or less on par with france , that is in case of a military conflict between only these two countries the result would n't be obvious . 
  actually it 's very realistic in terms of international relations - the athenians were just the weaker party this time . 
  because : 1 ) my personal feelings are irrelevant when we 're talking about our national interest 2 ) our national interest is not to be under russian influence again 3 ) national interest of nato and eu countries is not to allow russia to become a threat again and make former eastern block countries parts of its sphere of influence 4 ) our interests align 5 ) therefore alliance is mutually beneficial usa is an important ally of poland . 
  this does n't change my - granted , mostly negative - opinion on us as a superpower . 
  yup . 
  so why do you care again ? 
  are you looking for material for / r/europeisperfect or / r/shiteuropeanssay ? 
  why are you interested in my personal feelings on this matter ? 
  but muh basic income, 
   what the actual fuck ? 
  so we should only respect human rights and international law when it is convenient ? 
  well duh . 
  have you heard of [ melian dialogue ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/melian_dialogue ) ? 
  relevant quote :  for ourselves , we shall not trouble you with specious pretenses -- either of how we have a right to our empire because we overthrew the mede , or are now attacking you because of wrong that you have done us -- and make a long speech which would not be believed ; and in return we hope that you , instead of thinking to influence us by saying that you did not join the spartans , although their colonists , or that you have done us no wrong , will aim at what is feasible , holding in view the real sentiments of us both ; since you know as well as we do that ** right , as the world goes , is only in question between equals in power , while the strong do what they can and the weak suffer what they must . 
  ** nothing has changed in the past 2500 years . 
  this is probably the most reasonable option - the title of this thread is what it is because i wanted to start discussion . 
  yes we do  let 's hope that it will happen at some point !, 
  good point . 
  imho poland , lietuva , latvia , estonia and scandinavian countries should seriously start thinking about some regional initiative in this regard as well . 
  yes they are , if we look at them one by one . 
  if their militaries were united to some extent , on the other hand ...

  it would n't be hard to suggest people start learning other language . 
  people who use english as first language , also learn other languages . 
  for some it is french , for some it is spanish or german . 
  look at it as if you were an alien . 
  it gets quite absurd , because everyone could just learn * nobody 's language * . 
  but would n't federalizing europe force common foreign policy ? 
   these things will happen over time anyway there 's no need for them to happen , at least not for language . 
  i speak two languages fluently ( well , almost ) and to be honest i 've never really * studied * english . 
  by the way - english . 
  is n't it quite unfair that it 's english ? 
  i 'm not against , but why not french or a conlang like esperanto ? 
   common foreign policy it 's sometimes hard for a single nation to have common foreign policy . 
  imagine how hard it would be for 28 or more nations to agree on just one opinion . 
  european federation would hardly ever say anything , because there would always be enough people disagreeing . 
  the mentality of nations also differs throughout europe . 
   common security if you mean military , this would require common foreign policy . 
   fiscal/monetary union actually i 'm not against monetary union , but as currency is sometimes a part of national identity and has deep ties in history , i 'd rather see something like in uk happening . 
  scotland has its own pounds , but they are always equal to gbp . 
  it is possible , but i do n't want federal europe . 
  why would i ? 
  i want ** unity through diversity ** , not ** unity through unity ** . 
  i want international union , not supernational union , if you know what i mean . 
  europe is all about different , but related cultures . 
  federation could destroy it . 
  60 % of protesters are 50 + . 
  world wars taught us many things , do n't forget about this . 
  we lost our hegemonic position - it reminded us that we are not the only cultural circle here . 
  that all these colonies can live their own lives ; there are also other cultural circles with their own culture , with their own history , with their own power . 
  in their estimation , they are the center of world . 
  we can not waste deaths of milions . 
  and always remember this and other lessons . 
  \u266b we are world of contrasts , \u266a \u266a we know no peace , \u266b our magic item in pocket has acces to all wisdom , \u266b \u266a but we use it to watch funny cats , and more preferably - to argue \u266a we do n't all understand this , \u266b \u266a but that 's nothing new : western culture thinks it is `` the world '' , \u266b i am a bad phoet . 
  #panic , huh ? 
  all i can say is wow :d, 
  that area is problematic . 
  it 's like a drunk piece of balkans that has travelled and has no idea what it 's doing . 
  to be honest , any is good . 
  if it 's too small for pc , it will be just fine on laptop ( smaller in my case ) or mobile !, 
  smuggling is already a thing along our russian border and i 'm sure it 's same in lithuania 's case . 
  our `` border services '' are used to it . 
   law on political parties which requires that each party should have regional branches at least in half of the russian federation constituencies definitely not aimed at separatist movements xd, 
  sooner or later they would starve without secessing from rf . 
  putin is just spamming embargos on meat , diary products and all kind of `` goods '' from poland and lithuania - he is the one proposing extermination . 
  i highly doubt they are self-sufficient . 
  the master of evil :d but well , let 's save this for ... full-swing times of new cold war . 
  it 's actually a big deal :o just wondering if events like this could be some kind of way to independent kaliningrad . 
   stones for the rampart i can recommend it , too . 
  after ( and only after ) reading the book , i can also recommend a movie based on it - kamienie na szaniec ( 2014 ) . 
  it may be impossible to watch it , though . 
  i 've never seen english subtitles for polish movie . 
  the only exceptions are tv series aired on tvp polonia ... 
  we have something similar , this is why we have sound berms - `` screens '' ( as we call them ) by almost every freaking road ( not to mention our uncountable highways ) . 
  sometimes even in the middle of the forest ( after a long time of contemplating i came to conclusion that maybe they have been placed to decrease amount of weird noises that used to bother animals ) . 
  and an average pole . 
  we have three days off here : 01.05 - labor day/st . 
  joseph 's ( catholic ) 02.05 - flag day ( though it 's not free for majority ) / day of polish diaspora 03.05 - may 3rd constitution day / st virgin mary the queen of poland ( catholic ) . 
  saint mary was coronated by john ii casimir 01.04.1656 in lviv . 
  * ruch narodowy * and korwin mikke 's support are growing , though . 
  so sadly we may give other answer in a few years ... 
  jesus , and i thought our far right was annoying . 
  iceland - they would pay more than they would receive , macedonia - greece will deny it , turkey - `` democratic '' reasons , kosovo - spain will deny it ( because of catalonia ) , ukraine - do n't even need to say a word . 
  the list of `` official '' candidates differs from `` real '' candidates . 
   hitler started by annexing neighbouring countries he started with a book  but i see what you mean and agree . 
   even though other longer words can be composed by assembling adjectives . 
  i thought they were looking for longest words . 
  no , but policemen who do n't know this , do this with people , who also do n't know this . 
  yes , this is retarded . 
  only lower silesia flair , afaik . 
  i guess he supports * ruch autonomii \u015al\u0105ska * or just is attached to upper silesia . 
  i hope nobody will ever post warsawian version of this . 
  it would be too funny and embarassing at once for me . 
  well `` poles '' is n't an individual country either :d, 
  hispter poland stronk . 
  one of firsters . 
  ** personal opinion starting ** well , prussia was protestant . 
  russia was orthodox . 
  so poles had to find something they could have in common , but occupants could n't . 
  so , screw the possible federations , screw the jews , lithuanians , ruthenians and `` ukrainians '' - we are catholic now , everybody !, 
  you 're not catholic - you are supporting the occupants !, 
  and then , during soviet times , we had pope , who wanted to awake our patriotism - but by the way , he pulled us to churches . 
  going to church was one of the most popular ways of showing soviets that they have no real power or influence . 
  first part is sad , i would really fancy living in multicultural intermarium or something like this . 
  but then again , some nations would n't , because some of our rightist politicians wanted to polonize them . 
  however ( ... ) , then again ( ... ) ... 
  but who knows how it would end up , if it were n't for st ( since today ) john paul ii ? 
  everything has bright and not-so-bright sides . 
  `` atheist '' was supposed to have a very positive meaning here , but yes , there are some people like this . 
  if far-right politician ever wins any kind of elections , i 'll definitely run away to czech cieszyn or prague :p, 
  not very patriotic , atheist , funny , quite suspicious . 
  i 'd rather call it beautiful . 
  it 's just not even a bit similar to any language i know . 
   `` biedronka '' ( polish largest grocery chain ) biedronka is actually portuguese , afaik . 
  most people suprisingly hate it , it 's just a matter of time and it will have no real concurrence . 
  that will piss people off . 
   poor quality food you really want a war :d and what do you have except * smazen\u00fd s\u00fdr * ( sorry if misspelled ) ? 
  i remember we shared * ludwik w\u0119gierski / andegawe\u0144ski * in 14th century . 
  literally all of them !, 
  well if i were to solve these problems , i 'd just let poles use their letters and street names ( the way nobody will thank populists for it ) - not because * that poor christ of nations , the martyr-contry is oppressed again * , but simply to make the populists shut up and in consequence , lose support  they may be very dangerous with more support , because - as you stated - their only purpose is to damage our relations , which were ( and i hope still are ) getting back better after some painful both-side experiences . 
  oh god , poles . 
  well , poles believe that poles complain a lot .

   and anyway , the fact that the government is simply ignoring a ( legally valid ) verdict from the tribunal is blatantly antidemocratic . 
  the fact that tribunal was ignoring the legally valid ( under presumption of constitutionality ) statute regulating its operation while issuing this verdict is also undemocratic . 
   it does n't really matter what the `` man in the street '' thinks . 
  both sides in this conflict are in the wrong , and that 's the opinion both i and many of those `` undecided '' hold . 
  `` che hi ya '' would be closer to the original name in czech though . 
  uhm , i meant something along the lines of `` neither side has most of poland agreeing with them , despite what the original poster claimed '' , but english is n't my first language , so i might have worded that badly . 
  the polish government to do n't give a single crap about european parliament 's declaration . 
  well , by an odd coincidence , the polish members that voted for the resolution happen to be the guys who lost elections last year and still feel salty about that . 
  yeah , those polish immigrants to the netherlands , [ such a drain on your country . 
  well , de facto there are * no * legitimate forms of punishment , as every decision that could be genuinely harmful needs to be unanimous , and we can count on at least hungary to block it ( and vice versa ) . 
  the * existence * of constitutional court is mentioned in constitution , so not really . 
  on the other hand , the only thing constitution mentions about the * way tribunal operates * is that `` the organization of the constitutional tribunal , as well as the mode of proceedings before it , shall be specified by statute . '' . 
  well , it was specified by statute , a new one . 
  not proceeding according to it is while it 's still valid according to the presumption of constitutionality principle is clearly a breach of the constitution by the tribunal . 
  perhaps a new , better written constitution , free of such stupid loopholes will be adapted one day , but for now we can enjoy the spectacle . 
   that 's just pure bullshit . 
  it 's not bullshit , i happen to watch tv once in a while , and back before the elections the pro-po propaganda on tvp channels was simply unbearable . 
  even tvn seemed more unbiased in comparison . 
  admitably it 's the other way around right now , but at least this way we have more pluralism in mainstream media now , with tvn being biased pro-po and anti-pis , tvp being biased pro-pis , and polsat being mostly neutral , with perhaps slight bias against pis - a huge improvement , when compared to the earlier situation with pro-po circlejerk everywhere . 
   but this false equivalence proposing that whatever pis did `` po did the same '' is a ludicrous cocktail of denial and lies . 
  oh , but that 's exactly the case here . 
  the only difference being that pis simply did it less subtly and less gradually than po did . 
   because the bill pis released was ruled unconstitutional so , according to you , it was somehow ruled unconstitutional * before * it was ruled unconstitutional ? 
  i 'm afraid we are getting into time paradox territory here . 
  pretty idiotic , is n't it ? 
   thus not binding no , it is legally binding as long as there wo n't be a ruling stating that it is not constitutional after all . 
  that 's how presumption of constitutionality works . 
  who is the idiot now again ? 
  quite stupid and not at all foolproof , but then again the 1997 constitution is full of such holes , and it 's high time someone finally called bullshit on it . 
   right , but is it just about economics ? 
  pretty much , considering that poles who emigrated to richer countries tend to have more children . 
   do n't you think culture also matters ? 
  it does , but to a way smaller extent than economic conditions . 
   people make sacrifices based on cultural values all the time . 
  and people around here more often than not decide to live on a moderately first-world standard of living with no children , or one child tops , rather than barely making ends meet with three or more children , which would ensure a fertility rate above generational replacement . 
  in developed countries , children are expensive investments . 
   why is n't the cultural base of poland strong enough to overcome , or at least soften , the economic disadvantage . 
  great question , but then again the previous paragraph pretty much explains it in my opinion . 
   it should be . 
  more , it must become one . 
  luckily it 's not one yet . 
  and i hope we 'll leave it before it ever becomes one , preferably at the last possible moment . 
   present state of eu is n't working of course it is n't , the attempts at integration already went too far and it 's causing much problems for everyone involved . 
  unlike uk or us , eu is not a country , and poland is not its province . 
   and pis ignored that ruling . 
  just like the tribunal ignored the - legally binding at the time - bill regulating the way it is supposed to operate . 
  two can play this game , apparently . 
   when their govt follows their hungarian counterparts into selling to country to russia ? 
  considering that the party leader holds a deep personal hatred towards russia , and ruling party 's electorate is among the most anti-russian segments of polish society , it 's about as likely as the netherlands winning euro 2016 . 
  for one , they recently passed a law which will remove the remaining soviet statues and street names , not really a russia-friendly move . 
   they are ( among other things ) reforming the state owned media to become a propaganda machine for their policies . 
  which is indeed a terrible offense , especially considering that before `` reforms '' the state owned media were , for a change , propaganda machine for * former * government 's policies . 
  apparently , it 's okay only when the correct guys do this though . 
   maybe you have a theory or two . 
  we are well-off enough that having many children is not a necessity like in third world countries , but on the other hand we are not well-off enough to easily sustain multiple children on an average wage ( there are some measures to counter that , for example government giving out 500pln a month for every child to families with more than one child , though in my opinion they are somewhat misguided ) . 
  were we as `` poor '' ( or rather rich ) as northern ireland , i have no doubt we would have similar birth rates - after all , polish emigrants to , say , uk on average have over 2 children per woman . 
  as it 's already low , implementing laws like the one they seem to have in romania would only make it even worse . 
  getting rid of [ half of your potential future workforce each year ] ( http://www.johnstonsarchive.net/policy/abortion/mapeuropeabrate3big.gif ) like in romania 's case seems like an interesting development strategy indeed , but i hope we wo n't emulate that one either . 
  you are free to stay poor then . 
   i see that you will make up any lie just to prove me wrong . 
  whole your post screams of varsovian inferiority complex . 
  that 's funny , because your posts could pretty much serve as an illustration next to the article about delusion of grandeur . 
   it 's not really my fault that my city is so superior varsovians tremble at mere sight of krak\u00f3w . 
  nah , i actually thought krakow was overrated . 
  do n't understand me wrong , it * was * quite * nice * , but as i already said i 've been to at least several better cities , and that 's only in poland . 
   but please do n't move here why would i ? 
  to inhale your poisonous air ? 
  the only metropolis in that area is katowice anyway , and from what i recall commute there from krakow is a nightmare . 
   nah , it 's a well known fact . 
  no one with a sane mind would compare krak\u00f3w to any of those second class cities . 
  well , krak\u00f3w itself is a second-class city in europe . 
  and it might be a bit more known internationally , but to anyone who have actually * been * to those cities , it 's clearly in the exact same class as gda\u0144sk , pozna\u0144 , toru\u0144 or wroc\u0142aw are ( and to be frank , it 's not even the best out of those ) . 
   no , but all decent cities in central europe are . 
  source : you pulled it out of your ass . 
  especially considering that they are more similar to cities in germany than to krak\u00f3w . 
  then again , krak\u00f3w itself felt to me like a cheap and neglected copy of vienna , especially outside planty . 
   nope . 
  yep . 
   it 's not delusion , those are facts . 
  no , it 's your * opinion * . 
  and differentiating between facts and opinions is an important skill you sadly seem to lack . 
   those cities may be regionally renowned but krak\u00f3w is the only one that matters internationally . 
  the level of international knowledge ( like in krak\u00f3w 's case , as a cheap spot to get drunk and vomit ) is completely irrelevant to whether or not a city is beautiful , valuable architecturally , or whatever this discussion was about . 
   at best they 're cheap copies of krak\u00f3w . 
  yeah , soon we 'll hear from you that rome , kyoto or alexadria are `` cheap copies of krak\u00f3w '' as well : ddd delusion level over 9000 . 
   there is not a single castle in the world better than wawel . 
  there are literally dozens of castles on par with wawel or better in europe . 
  even in poland , i was more impressed by malbork . 
   none of these comes even close . 
  yes , that 's the delusion i 've been talking about . 
  personally , i 've found both to be better than krak\u00f3w , both in regards to overall architecture , as well as its maintenance . 
  the only category in which krak\u00f3w tops either would be the castle but then again , there are many better castles than wawel . 
   looks like someone is mad because his city is one big ugly commie block . 
  oh , i am indeed mad about that , as some of the ideas of our post-war planners rank high among the biggest crimes against urbanism in the history of mankind . 
  the city got destroyed in ww2 , and a completely different , way shittier one was built on its ruins ( though it 's slowly getting better ) . 
   krakow 's centre is top1 in europe though . 
  eh , i 'd argue whether it 's even top1 in poland . 
  pozna\u0144 and toru\u0144 are at least comparable , and gda\u0144sk and wroc\u0142aw also come close though especially in case of the latter they get negative points for butchered commie-era reconstruction . 
   deluded varsovians are funny . 
  not as funny as deluded cracovians though .

  according to [ wiki ] ( https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/wilno#demografia ) in 1916 demography in vilnus looked like this : 53,67 % poles , 41,45 % jews , 2,09 % lithuanians , 1,59 % russians , 0,44 % belorussians , 0,63 % germans . 
  trolling is an art . 
   stop election pis and kaczy\u0144ski they are n't helping after election in this year in some of the eu countries , our pis government will be considered as trustworthy , moderate leftist one . 
  thank you for reliable source . 
  i think , that this data is expressed in absolute numbers . 
  imho it would be more reliable if it would be taken proportionally to the number of forigners in your country . 
  i found this [ data ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/north_rhine-westphalia#demographics ) for your land : significant foreign-born populations [ 8 ] nationality population ( 2014 ) turkey 512,703 poland 185,091 italy 132,124 netherlands 70,022 romania 67,419 serbia & montenegro 62,982 kosovo 50,009 russia 48,021 spain 41,380 croatia 41.043 bulgaria 39,590 portugal 37,445 bosnia 36,986 morocco 34,943 i 'm not sure if both definitions considering nationanalities are the same ( for police and for wiki ) . 
  but it would be interesting to show them in capita criterion and not absolute ones . 
  here it 's the data . 
  please pay attention that we have no data from wiki to significant factors from your police report . 
  i found the number of germans by subtracting total number from wiki from total population of your land - so it 's biased . 
  i think you know polish . 
  we took many refugees in our modern , after wwii history . 
  greeks , koreans and lastly chechens and syrians . 
  one of our biggest city - wroclaw - has about 10 % of ukrainian population . 
  and everything is ok with it . 
  but we do n't want to take ` refugees ' that are taken with breaking of law ( merkel 's open border 's idea ) . 
  we do n't want to take ` refugees ' that are proportionally located in different countries - without even checking their papers . 
  you can take them all to the usa . 
  you will have opportunity to show your true , humanistic face . 
  if you are trying to find countries that did not accept refugees - then please get focus on - for example - israel . 
  would you like to get rid of jews from usa too ? 
  would you dare to be such a brave ? 
  or it 's easier to write such an accusation only for poles ? 
  please stop your whining about our democratic elections in poland . 
  you are american now - get focus on your new country . 
  i mean , that after translating this article it 's content disapeard . 
  i can find it in the wide stripe on the right side of the translated webpage . 
  as far as i understand it 's an article , that lays on official data but is interpretation of authors . 
  it would be great if you could provide exact numbers in criterion of nationality . 
   do poles not remember a time when they left or fled from their country , being mostly uneducated and unskilled ? 
  i guess not . 
  of course we remember , that many citizens of poland escaped to usa . 
  they were poor , often illiterate and had to sign papers using small circles . 
   if only i had a time machine so as to send back all the poles refugees and migrants/immigrants over the last ... lets say hundred years and what is your american heritage , that gives you ability to get rid of other nations ? 
   the other group has only one common feature : it is eastern european . 
  these perpetrators commit a third of all nationally reported burglaries . 
  have you got any reliable sources ? 
  with for example distinction on nationality ? 
  i do not want persuade you that you should feel something in relation to the hungarians . 
  it 's just your business . 
  i was just trying to answer the question why the romanians consider you as hungarians . 
   again , why should anyone besides linguists care ? 
  because of common history probably - which would be interesting to find . 
  because you can share the same customs or beliefs , food , etc. 
  - which would be interesting to find imho too , and most generally imho - find someone that shares something with you . 
   i thought hungary and poland were each others vvvvvbffs ? 
  do you try the ` divide et impera ' stuff ? 
  / s let 's say - `` very good friends '' . 
  hungarians will be always the first imho  . 
   in europe there is only you and hungary that use this group of language . 
  edit : + estonia . 
  which does n't change the fact , that you are exceptional in mostly indo-european continent . 
  and that you have something in common . 
   so are german and iranian . 
  accurate observation . 
  but you are more unique . 
  in europe there is only you and hungary that use this group of language . 
  during communists time in our part of europe , romania was closed . 
  my parents for example talked about trains that had closed doors while traveling via romania to bulgaria . 
  their government had their own unique way of ruling . 
  we did not exchange in many levels . 
  after collapsing of communism , we had a lot of gipsies from romania in poland . 
  journalists were describing them as romanians - thanks to pc . 
  so in poland was and unfortunatelly is ( i hope weaker and weaker from year to year ) prejudice that they are gipsies . 
  i have met only few people from romania - but they were all great people . 
  i once cooperated with romanian 's company and they were all professional imho . 
  i hope that this attitude will change in near future . 
  tl ; tr - we do n't know each other to much . 
  thank you romanians . 
  hope this attitude will be shared by us as well . 
  by the way - do you know , that [ we can see you from poland ] ( http://www.dalekieobserwacje.eu/rumunia-widziana-z-tarnicy-most-wanted ) ? 
   what 's your fucking problem ? 
  calm down please . 
  and behave . 
   see what will happen . 
  local ` intelligentsia ' will re-jumping each other in the race to express that this was a fault of the muslim boy that was killed . 
  and how smart and relativistic they are ? 
   pole doing the same ? 
  because we do n't kill each other for throwing a petard . 
  do you do it in italy ? 
  http://www.superstacja.tv/wiadomosc/2016-12-30/pozegnanie-bohatera-pogrzeb-polskiego-kierowcy-lukasza-urbana/ be careful - there are catholic priests in this video and politics from pis . 
  people like you can be killed by this footage . 
  would you like to talk about your prejudices and fears ? 
   when muslims killed someone you must be joking . 
   tater muslims you mean [ lipka tatars ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lipka_tatars ) . 
  and yes . 
  they are civilized . 
  and respected in poland . 
  we have relatively small islamic minorities in poland . 
  but they also killing our citizens . 
  that is sad . 
   if you threw a firework into a polish chav house the same would happen , it does n't matter if they 're arabs . 
  seriously ? 
  have you got any single example that throwing firework into polish house ended by killing ? 
  ** any single example ? 
  ** or you are just trying to be smart and trying to relative everything ? 
   it is not that kids get fooled by someone but when you are spending hours and hours in a room with smart , eloquent , mature and even little bit handsome man that is protective and in a position of power then sometimes this guy only has to reach for what girls are willing to give him . 
  sorry but it seems to be a fetish scenario that is played in your head . 
  maybe i was grown up and all of my friends at that time .

  just like all these people showing the `` omg catholic lunatics taliban , we are so backwards '' tantrum here and there . 
  but ... 
  but germans were considered evil not because they voted for hitler but because they either actively participated in execution of his demonic plans or profited from them . 
  they were germans who fought in wehrmacht , served in ss , worked as gears of the machine of death . 
  finally , they were germans who used their uebermench position to do unspoken atrocities on occupied lands . 
  ok , most of them were passive probably and only few of them ( as we were taught ) actively opposed the regime . 
  i feel a pressure to confess that this time i totally agree with you . 
  for me , personally it is a very important lesson and a proof that listening and occasionally discussing with people of very different political and social views makes sense ( because at some point you can discover that they are n't totally alien and there are some elementary similarities between you and them ) . 
  and man , this feels good . 
  wow !, 
  an actually insightful comment on r/europe ... now , that 's something extraordinary , 
   there are very few spaniards working in poland . 
  according to eurostat , only 7k . 
  compare it with the 67k poles in spain . 
  normal people from the we working on regular positions ( as opposed to high management or freelancers ) are still pretty exotic . 
  each one you encounter is counted as 10  also , if they are educated and highly skilled , i would additionally double it  i had a chance to work with one guy from spain - software developer . 
  his technical skills were pretty solid . 
  what amazed me were his language skills . 
  in two years his accent was perfect - literally undistinguishable from native speaker 's accent - you could only catch him on some exceptional , rarely used rules ( and he did n't know a word when he started to learn it ) . 
  i am still wondering if he had a special talent , or maybe spaniards are so talented or maybe for some reason polish language is easy for them . 
  as a person working in software development i am very happy and somewhat proud that they have chosen poland . 
   why are they in the eu then ? 
  trump is clearly anti eu and so is poland . 
  they both support far right wing and are anti democracy . 
  all they do is undermine the eu . 
  buuhuuu evil poland , right ? 
  great news !, 
  when we will have means of deporting all unwanted and illegal migrants ( and when we will actually do it ) then the acceptance for genuine refugees will definitely improve . 
  this is a truly constructive approach . 
  the next step imo is to stop the ngo traffickers in mediterranean sea . 
  what you described in the part telling about relations between employees and employers is basically poland in 90s . 
  the situation was similar for less paid jobs somewhere in early 2000s , too . 
  the only solution for such kind of situation is a decrease of number of people willing to work for such employers ( economical migration , yay ! ), 
  or a mass improvement of potential employees financial situation ( 500 + social programme ) . 
  in case of poland one could argue that it is a matter of barbaric communist past and that our `` businessmen '' simply do n't know how to do better , yet . 
  unfortunately , it seems that they will probably act like that if only the situation gets worse . 
  especially , that even now , after the introduction of the 500 + , all these `` businessmen '' are crying how it has destructive influence on their business and how causes women to leave their shitty jobs . 
  i seriously hope that ukrainians working in poland right now are treated better that we were back in 1990s . 
  all of above is really sad for me , because i honestly believed that the times of rude , ruthless bosses who exploit their employees is behind us for good . 
  it 's about negotiation position . 
  it is not about lost transit fees . 
  it is about prices we pay being much bigger than prices you pay and even bigger prices when they wo n't have to consider we as a part of equation when dictating us their market ( haha ) prices . 
  they can offer you smaller prices because they know that with ns/ns2 they can exploit us freely . 
  and the only thing we cares is the price they get . 
  so it is ee which pays for your lower prices in such scenario . 
  pure business , totally understandable in case of loosely related countries , but was n't ue supposed to be something more ? 
  that 's not about threat to we . 
  it 's about limiting russia 's strength . 
  they want to sell to we , so they ca n't fuck with us too much . 
  see that : https://www.rferl.org/a/russian-gas-how-much-gazprom/25442003.html we already pay more than we only because they can charge us more . 
  if you get our last negotiation tool , the prices they will dictate may easily double prices you pay . 
  it 's about weakening of the transit countries . 
  until ns was a thing , russia had to find deal with them to transfer to we markets . 
  with ns , they can dictate much more harsh prices and conditions . 
  with increased throughput it gains even bigger leverage . 
  it was enough to poland to build the liquid gas terminal to instantly make russia 's conditions much more bearable . 
  we already know that we ca n't count on we in case of gas deals with russia . 
  both poland as well as the baltic countries invest into gas source independence ( and this is good ) . 
  and schroeder ? 
  he simply bought himself a warm job in exchange for extra favourable approach to the russian plans of screwing ee . 
  ns2 is nord stream 2 . 
  immigrants , we accuses ee that it is acts without solidarity when it rejects displacement of migrants from mena . 
  i agree that there is a grain of truth in that accusation . 
  at the same time , we countries ( germany and france especially ) deal with the country being the biggest threat of ee countries over their heads , seriously damaging its negotiation position , to get better gas prices and says that it has nothing to do with solidarity - it is just business thing in their opinion . 
  both moves are dick moves , but our western european friends seem to consider themselves crystal clear in that matter , is n't it so ? 
  russia is well known , at least in the east , for ruthless use of its monopoly to dictate as high gas prices as possible . 
  the transfer to the we markets is the only tool ee countries have to keep prices in reasonable bounds . 
  we are pissed that you pull the only negotiation tool we have out of our hands and leave us on monopolist 's mercy just because this monopolist bought you with lower prices . 
  it is not about transfer fees it is about `` we do n't care about you as long as we get our sweet gas deals '' . 
  this is all about solidarity . 
  in case of ukraine it is even worse . 
  they were ruined through war zone instability introduced by the same dealer who gives you your sweet deals . 
  they opposed russia because they believed ue is more civilized and more trustworthy than russia . 
  and now you , westerners sell them for lower gas prices . 
  yeah , nothing about solidarity . 
  just pure business , right !, 
  please explain to us how the ns is not a matter of european solidarity ( tm ) . 
  before you say something about migrants , please remember that ns was built ( and ns2 agreed on ) way before the migrant crisis . 
  ns is the thing which makes germany , france , netherlands ( iirc ) and some more we countries equally implausible in the matter of so called solidarity as poland or some other ee countries are because of migrant approach ( and i agree that ee acts bad in that matter ) . 
  if we do n't like hypocrisy , why not to eliminate it on both sides of the new iron curtain ? 
  in my personal opinion , we do not respect ee 's right to defend its interests nor consider its citizens fears . 
  we leaders want to simply pacify us . 
  but it is not important . 
  what our ( pl ) government is doing is even worse . 
  leaving italy and greece without help is shame , shame and lack of honour . 
  screw we progressives , screw our disillusioned eu overlords . 
  we do n't have to surrender to their ideology , we can have our own ideas for civilized behaviour . 
  but for god 's sake !, 
  we are in union with italy and greece and we must help them somehow . 
  our pm could go directly to italian and greek pm and simply offer them our help . 
  is it supplies ? 
  personnel ? 
  equipment ? 
  money ? 
  this is what honourable nation and government would do . 
  we do n't have to buy progressives ' ideas for dealing with migrant crisis but we should have some initiative . 
  even if italy made some mistakes in the past , it does n't matter . 
  we should help them now , like in family . 
  also , as much as i believe that allowing too big numbers of people from mena ( muslims or others ) can have only bad consequences for our societies , i know that there are genuine refugees between these swarms of economic migrants and that there are simply good people between them . 
  why not to try to find them and help them ?

  russians . 
   also we basically shove integration in your face until you see the arabian and vietnamese immigrants wearing cowboy hats and are yelling at each other in a bar about which baseball/american football/basketball teams are the best . 
  so immigrants integrating into your culture and society is good , but here in europe dogs bark out of their asses and immigrants want their culture integrated into our societies . 
  that is a big difference . 
  good . 
  if poland would relax its border controls and start letting people through , it would be like blood in the water . 
  gunboats and a no tolerance policy . 
  hunt down the people-smugglers and turn back the boats , no exceptions . 
  the cost of the program is no problem - the eu loses more money by letting problems get out of hand before dealing with them , so by clamping down on this it will actually save money . 
  aliens is pretty good too . 
  yes there is . 
  check this video out : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aadzeyo9wde plus the audiobook is on youtube . 
  the book is way better though . 
  so what we essentially have so far is three numbers of a winning lottery ticket . 
  ( close to sol , earth-like , habitable-zone ), 
  so are they going to try to find some scientists to blame this one on too ? 
  well at least now they can build new ones that are earthquake resistant . 
  barring some sort of epic calamity befalling rich and developed western european countries , we wo n't catch up for hundreds of years . 
  the more developed former communist countries like poland and the czech republic * might * get pretty close , but we 'll never actually catch up . 
  countries like bulgaria , romania and serbia are fucked . 
  :\\ thanks russia !, 
  in accordance with modern political correctness , ukrainians are higher up on the oppressed scale , so we ca n't talk about things like that because it might offend them . 
  europe and the west has so many cultures and so much history that i do n't think we 'll ever run out of names . 
  plus we are making new ones . 
  perhaps in 100 years we 'll be naming the jovian exploration missions something like earendil or valyrian . 
  cool , just send it through belarus and poland then , k ? 
  from a polish perspective i think it sounds a little stupid . 
  i think czechlands would be a better option if you want to reduce from czech republic 's 4 syllables . 
  `` eastern europe '', 
  stay quiet , krak\u00f3w turning into a mega tourist magnet would suck . 
  some tourists are good , but past a certain point it 's detrimental . 
   american flair yup , checks out . 
  it was not built with polish hands . 
  nearly all the workers who built it were shipped in from the soviet union , and poland paid for their upkeep . 
  the crusades and inquisition had nothing to do with christianity . 
  how the hell did you pull `` war has a positive effect on society '' out of `` the long peace has made european societies soft and weak '' ??? 
  all i am saying is that comfort and safety breeds complacency and docility . 
  europe is no longer the strong and virile culture that it once was . 
  unless this changes and europe gets it 's balls back , it will be left behind by the rest of the world . 
  do n't let europe be drowned by the illusion of permanence . 
  the long peace has made european societies soft and weak . 
  one day when war returns to europe , it will be an ugly wakeup call . 
  russians spy like crazy , everyone knows that . 
  why should we stop giving a fuck and just make it super easy for them ? 
  they want to keep you in pieces . 
  i support trade and engagement with people of kaliningrad , but i think this has more to do with a certain type of russians hanging out near polish military installations in masuria and tricity ... 
  i seriously doubt it would be good for poland to recover anything from ukraine . 
  western ukrainian infrastructure is in shit condition and it 's full of the more nationalistic ukrainians . 
  well no shit sherlock . 
  [ look at the map of europe between the world wars and tell me how the soviets could possibly defend czechoslovakia from germany without moving their troops though poland . 
  ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d1/europe_in_1923.jpg ) poland fought off the ussr in a [ war ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polish%e2%80%93soviet_war ) less than 20 years earlier , one in which the soviets wanted to destroy the country and turn it into a soviet republic , so letting large numbers of soviet troops move through the country and begin combat operations to the south-west would have been stupid on poland 's part . 
  besides , poland did n't have good relations with the czechs during that time . 
  they [ started a little war ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polish%e2%80%93czechoslovak_war ) with poland while it was busy fighting the soviets in the aforementioned war . 
  that 's picking at words . 
  i believe he was attacking the type of person that is often also a cyclist and/or a vegetarian . 
  the globalist cosmopolitan urban liberal , somewhat hipster-ish , `` progressive '' ( whatever that means ) , multicultural and absolutely convinced that their way is the right way . 
  just being a cyclist or a vegetarian has nothing to do with it . 
   what is dead may never die . 
  it 's not strong . 
  poland is one of the most pro-eu countries in the eu . 
  i am a fairly eurosceptic pole and even i am overall pro-eu . 
  it 's just that i also realize that we pay a fairly high price for our membership in the form of lost labor force and no protection for our budding industries . 
  but due to cohesion and investment funds , we overall benefit . 
  meanwhile wealthy eu countries gain labor force and a fresh market for investment and acquisitions . 
  everyone gains , but wealthy eu gains more . 
  if there is a rising scepticism with the eu , it 's because of the migrant crisis and immigration problem , and the euro currency crisis . 
  we 'll just import people from the east , mainly ukrainians . 
  there 's a saying : the kremlin plays several pianos simultaneously . 
  you guys are so cute together . 
  [ all those hours playing shogun 2 are kind of paying off . 
  well if you go back there now you might catch some ghost types . 
  like kaczy\u0144ski right now . 
  eu membership is nice and has a lot of benefits , but sometimes i wonder if we would have been better off if we stayed outside the eu and built up our economy for ~ 20-30 years before joining . 
  more proof that ukrainians and poles are the same people split across two cultures . 
  if you get a paywall , google the link or title of the article and you will bypass the paywall . 
  a taste of female privilege . 
  so you 're saying that croats are actually poles ? 
  i thought it was just a bunch of bulgarians that think they 're ancient greeks . 
  you must realize that it 's difficult to sympathize with a nation that committed genocide against yours and destroyed a lot of irreplaceable things in your country during the very same war . 
  he asked about european countries . 
  that depends on how industrialized it would have been . 
  i think it could have been strong enough to be the one doing the attacking . 
  russians were complaining yesterday in their media about `` hostile rhetoric '' being spouted from a `` once-friendly capital '' . 
  i ca n't wait to see how many more tall buildings will be built in the next 10-15 years in warsaw . 
  the city 's skyline has changed much since 2000 , and judging by the number of projects underway and propsed investments , i think it will build up a nice skyline in the coming years . 
  also , i love the look of the moscow 's [ mercury city tower ] ( http://www.metropolismag.com/mercury_city_tower_neu.jpg ) . 
  i love that sleek kind of `` sci-fi '' look , and it kind of reminds me of the citadel from half-life 2 . 
   the problem is is russia willing to cooperate with europe ? 
  i think the most important thing to discuss is what exactly is `` russia '' when we ask questions like this . 
  when you 're talking about regular everyday people as `` russia '' then yes i do believe russia is willing to cooperate with europe . 
  the reality is that when it comes to politics and the economy , `` russia '' is actually a narrow slice of the population that runs the most important institutions and economic resources of the country , and they do not want to cooperate . 
  i think the general population in western european countries are n't very conscious of this and often forget when thinking about russia . 
  so until the day comes , eventually , when this situation changes , we should definitely deal with russia but not get too close . 
  from my experience and knowledge , social segregation happens automatically once a certain critical mass is reached by a minority group . 
  good , but then what about the winter olympics ? 
  porn mode cruise control ftw . 
  it 's not like we 've been meeting it either . 
  for a long time it 's usually been hovering around the 1.8 % range instead of the 2 % `` nonbinding agreement . '', 
  personally i think our political establishment lacks the bravado to raise defense spending to a more appropriate level ( considering our geopolitical situation ) in the range of 2.5-3 % minimum . 
  the idea of raising defense spending is generally popular among the people , as long as military institutions are effective .

  for me understanding czech and slovakian is far more easier , since we are west slavs and you are east . 
  i also miss krak\u00f3w , even though i 'm polish . 
  i love to driving there . 
  poland borders with russia, 
  why they did n't ? 
  guys . . 22 years ? 
  why there 's so big corruption in romania ? 
  there 's always some news about someone getting arrested for bribery . 
  i 'm not saying that eu is a devil , but over 70 % of poland do n't support joining eurozone and we should respect that . 
  why no love for z\u0142oty ? 
  how about no ? 
  what you gon na do now ? 
  poland payed price for being in the eu , why do we need a monetary union dictated from germany if euro is among the trashiest currencies and 1 euro soon will be worth less than 1 dollar ? 
  eu countries have right to delay introducing euro . 
  basically you can claim that you wil use it in 2222 and when it 's 2222 you can say 2500 and that 's not against the agreement . 
  a lot of countries use this technique, 
  why do we need to adopt euro if most of people are against it and we do n't really see the advantages of it ? 
  hong kong was n't european before 1997 . 
  whut ? 
  3 years for smuggling a person ? 
  are we insane ? 
  those harsh border control laws ... 
  greenland is not in europe ... 
  is this guy singing sami ? 
  he looks like, 
  yeah esperanto is cool . 
  it looks very similar to romanian , though it 's poilish invention . 
  that 's very interesting . 
  dresden is actually drezno, 
   zenon jankowski yep , sadly also there 's interesting story about hermaszewski  he is a survivor of the volhynian massacres during which ukrainian nationalists murdered 19 members of his family , including his father . 
  hermaszewski narrowly escaped death himself when the ukrainian insurgent army attacked lipniki on the night of 26 -- 27 march 1943 . 
  in polish wikipedia he 's presented as a one who survived the massacre as a toddler . 
  he was found lying on the snow , while covered . 
  so generally that man had a lot of luck , seriously . 
  it 's because of mass-media . 
  unfortunately there are dozen of gangs from romania who steal and kidnapping . 
  they are presented as romanian citizens due to `` political correctnes '' . 
  they wo n't just say they are gypsies . 
  yay !, 
  we welcome romanians to change those stereotypes about your country in poland . 
  i like that comment under this video . 
   romania : here is our chance to break stereotypes of our country !, 
  sends gypsy vampire warlock well done romania . 
  miros\u0142aw hermaszewski went into space = poland can into space . 
  not in internetz though . 
  no one inteligent would die for the government . 
  maybe , idk, 
  in polish - owca . 
  learn polish with ama_deo ^ ^ tm, 
  i understand part of it , that is not enough for understanding whole text . 
  `` wiwzi '' that 's sounds funny, 
  i do n't unterstand ;(, 
  yup , that 's actually interesting . 
  when i wrote that people in ukraine should n't fight for corrupt politicians , that british soldiers shoudl n't go to ukraine . 
  i got a lot of downvotes and i was called `` pussy '' and `` putinbot '', 
  our government is pretty stupid . 
  they do n't understand that not everyone loves army and want to die to defend homeland and your home . 
  i 'm pretty young i want to die peacefully as a grandpa . 
  a lot of people would agree with me . 
  nah , never say that . 
  or at least not serious . 
  wilno can stay being governed by republic of lithuania . 
  ^ ^ to ^ ^ 2016 ^ ^ xd, 
  yeah , yeah . 
  i 'm actually proud that i want to defend my life and i do n't want , poland to forcibly take my life , because of politician 's decisions . 
  war is only between politicians . 
  i would n't die for it if i have my life in front of me . 
  politicians would be the first one to flee from poland , like rats and the regular people would be used as a cannon fodder . 
  i think that 90 % of poland would escape too . 
  only idiots who think that they would change something who go to army and fight . 
  our goverment is using us as a weapon to defend their interests . 
  not me though . 
  i would run away . 
  you 're turkish , you 're born in germany . 
  everything is according to plan, 
  poland : [ hel ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hel,_poland ) close enough, 
  imho if war would happen i would immediately run away from poland . 
  i do n't want to die for ukraine . 
  sorry guys . 
  yeah i will be downvoted . 
  so do i, 
  omg , that looks really ... bad, 
  i 'm tired of those `` iq maps '' or `` iq stats '' where everyone gets different scores . 
  1945 best year . 
  take that . 
  it does n't make sense . 
  germany 's debt is 80 % of gdp while russian or estonian is olny few %, 
  and russia, 
  neuschwanstein is not a really a castle and in my opinion is an architectural failure . 
  the building was build in xix century to remind medieval castle , but instead they did something that was quasi-medieval castle made in china . 
  i love architecture in england . 
  everything seems to be like for harry potter movie . 
  so mysterious and magical , also a bit terrifying, 
  definitely the best one . 
  the location is incredible, 
  [ lithuanian invasion of wilno ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a3/celebrations_of_vilnius_return_to_lithuania_near_vilnius_cathedral_in_1939.jpg ) was done in 1939 before nazi invasion and after agreement with soviet union of allowing using lithuanian railway for soviet military . 
  soviet union used this during soviet invasion of poland in 17th september 1939 occupying half of poland except wilno region which was invaded by lithuania ( just as the agreement ), 
  poland stronk !, 
  ireland we anschluss yuo !,

  it 's preatty interesting if lithuanians have common roots with semitic languages . 
  our - european ( in most cases ) - languages comes from common root : [ protoindoeuropean ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/proto-indo-european_language ) language . 
  do you suggest that lithuanian has something common with semitic languages based on pre-protoindoeuropean times ? 
  russia - vladimir putin - meaning : vladi - leading ; mir - peace ; -  leading of peace  putin -  someting connected to route ; czech - milo\u0161 zeman - meaning : milo\u0161 : someone who is loved ; zeman : something from german : have no idea what , but dengerous  croatia - kolinda grabar-kitarovi\u0107 - meaning : kolinda - i have no idea - probably it is not slav name ; serbia - tomislav nikoli\u0107 - meaning : tomiti - torture , torment ; slav - glory ; -  someone tortured by glory ; or someone that tortured others by his glory ; bulgaria - rosen plevneliev - probably not slav name . 
  i know that all of the names sound like a ` broken condom ' etc. 
  but please consider that other names common in europe has also bizzare genesis . 
  please see paul , adam , eve , michael , kevin etc. 
  is n't is hebrew in origin ? 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dalia_ ( given_name ), 
   fundamentalist islam is just a step worse than fundamentalist christianity . 
  really ? 
  do christians kill non-believers , becouse it gives them the ticket to a heaven ? 
  do they kill people becouse of their sexuality ? 
  do they kill people becouse of pre-muslim , tribe rules and imagination of family honour ? 
  can you really put an equal sign between fundamentalist christianity and fundamentalist islam ? 
  it seems that in poland we have no data in nationality factor . 
  it would be interesting to see how much for example narcotics crimes or human trafficing were done by different nationalities . 
  exactly . 
  it seems to be another theory of relativity trying to excuse and equal every behaviour . 
  it 's just an another example of desired vibrating multiculturalism . 
  they seem to look for a far away purpose that is quite close . 
  none of that cities is in our part of europe . 
  anyway you are welcome . 
  you are right that it is hard and stupid to blame the 6-month old government for everything bad . 
   you replied to : `` and it 's not going to get any better [ ... ] '' no . 
  i did n't want to judge any predictions or divinations . 
  maybe he is right , maybe not . 
  i do n't know . 
  hard to say . 
  i just replied to ` cutting down bia\u0142owie\u017ca ' - when it is about the parasites living in there , ` evil gmo ' , ` chemistrals ' , ` current government ' and all of this buzzwords that are emotional and are not merit . 
  but you as a german - is it not strange for you that this message is keep in / r/europe subreditt for few hours without sources ? 
  when other posts are deleted at once and users are banned ? 
  i will be banned for that few sentences probably like last time - farewell my friend . 
  hope it will be another 30-days punishment or not permanent . 
  anyway - stay strong . 
  i 'm trying to ask for the source again . 
  there is no source for this data for few hours . 
  are sources important for this subreddit ? 
  it sounds like an accusation  - i did not vote for them fyi . 
  i just do n't like the exposing of prejudice and hatred . 
  we still do n't know the source of this data . 
  the title suggest that this was measured for 1-year periods . 
  this hated government was elected 6 month ago . 
  i know that it is easy to blame them for everything - it is funny and modern , but could we just talk about the rationality ? 
  for example - what is the source for that data ? 
  if pm2 .5 factor is more important than for example no or pm10 factors ? 
  or we should just draw the only smart conclusion that it is fault of pis government ? 
  yes everything is worse from few months but could you please stop posting your political agenda in every message ? 
  maybe you are right . 
  but the op data has no source yet and if it is even reliable , it is based only on one factor - the pm2 .5 . 
  i 'm sure that we can draw different conclusion based on other factors - such as pm10 , co , no , formaldehyde etc. 
  overall estimation of pollution in eu is in the second link from my previous post . 
  you must admit that it looks differently . 
  what is the source ? 
  i was trying to find it and i googled this : [ air pollution in europe : real-time air quality index visual map ] ( http://aqicn.org/map/europe/#@g/48.9213/9.0604/6z ) and this : [ europe pollution index ] ( http://www.numbeo.com/pollution/region_rankings.jsp?title=2016&amp;region=150 ), 
  according to [ central limit theorem ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/central_limit_theorem ) to perform the poll and predict the arithmetic mean , the set of asked person should be randomized . 
  it means - let 's ask 1000 people - but they should be choosen randomly 1000 people from population . 
  and not let them answering by themselfs . 
  i was looking at the methodology and found [ this ] ( http://lordashcroftpolls.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/lord-ashcroft-polls-you-should-hear-what-they-say-about-you-eu28-poll-report-feb-2016.pdf ) . 
  i 'm not a statistician but the metodology in this document is described as this :  28,720 adults throughout the eu were interviewed online between 20 january and 1 february 2016 . 
  imho it is not enough accurate description to draw conclusions about the validity of research . 
  it could be done for example by online survey that was published on a website . 
  information about the website could be spread into particular set of internet users and for sure could not be reliable . 
  to be reliable they should be randomized for whole populations . 
  hope this helps - romanians . 
  there are asian men too . 
  shame on you sweden . 
  how could you ? 
  ^ ^ ^ / sss, 
  austria or australia ? 
  be precise please - where from expects [ iskanders ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ol%c4%99drzy ) ? 
  i lived in poland under soviet rule and under our own rule . 
  believe me - it is not comparable . 
  and we are not learning , but we are forgetting quickly . 
  and it is good . 
   first of all there are twice as much polish users than german users subscribed in / r/europe . 
  just curious only about this one sentence . 
  i was trying to find sources for that claim for a while , and i have found only this : http://mind314.github.io/europeusers/ have you got any other sources ? 
  that may be truth . 
  jewish minority in poland was not integrated to our society . 
  most of them not even speak polish despite of living among us for few hundred years . 
  this community was diversed . 
  some of them were well integrated - they were poets , writers , doctors etc. 
  but most of them was orthodoxiously religious one , living in their own environment . 
  it is the same diversity in todays israel - they have religious part called ` haredim ' that refuse to integrate to the rest of society and are spending time to learn sacred books and religion . 
  in poland before wwii they were the majority . 
   nevertheless a lot of people were ( and still are ) hiding their jewish origins you mean in poland or worldwide ? 
  you mean the local news about rzesz\u00f3w ? 
  there are many different types of journalists and activists with different attitudes and goals in poland . 
  some of them are very vocal about any cases that can describe poles as racist and xenophobic - cases that can be used as stereotypical generalisation . 
  fortunately ( for us - poles and for you portuguese ) it seems that in this case it was their mistake . 
  on the other hand - it is pity that this probably fake incident was publicized in portugal , poland , reddit etc. 
   says it 's local news . 
  did n't know that was against the rules . 
  this rule seems not to work in some cases : https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4gf6zp/portuguese_student_victim_of_racist_attack_in/, 
  step first : acknowledge the problem and name it . 
  i do not have the data . 
  but we like living in multi-age houses with our moms - like italians , 
  it seems that in poland even cctv are racist or xenophobic . 
  there were many details in the previous one too .

  it 's no coincidence that people are setting up shops with `` german household chemicals '' and `` german sweets '' and that they have a cult following from some . 
  outrageous , is n't it ? 
  that those dumb natives ca n't get what you mean even if you speak extra slow and extra loud ? 
  dimwits , who do they think they are !, 
  absolutely agree . 
  you know how people in multi-nationals are learning english so the hq has an easier time telling them what to do ? 
  well , the native speakers should also be learning on how to communicate unambiguously with non-native speakers , a sort of cultural sensitivity classes , if you will . 
  well , do you , per chance , remember [ the fuss that krzaklewski 's election staff kicked up ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cn0qo1qpv0a ) during [ the 2000 elections ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polish_presidential_election,_2000 ) , saying that marek siwiec mocked ( st. ) john paul ii , with further mocking at kwa\u015bniewski 's behest ? 
  ( and kwa\u015bniewski still managed to win despite that , in the good old days for sld before [ rywin-gate ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rywin_affair ) . ), 
  it was [ 14 ( 17 since the incident ) years in total ] ( http://www.gloswielkopolski.pl/artykul/3621302,marek-siwiec-nie-zniewazyl-jana-pawla-ii-koniec-sprawy-sprzed-17-lat-zdjecia,1,2,id,t,so,sa.html ) before the court concluded that it was not a criminal act , but plain mockery . 
  at least everyone 's keeping their heads screwed on in the present case , and there are no [ 7.2662 mm ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkrs6semcuk ) perforations performed for the time being , so that 's a definite up-side . 
  ha-hah , silly amurican !, 
  no , it does n't . 
  i just do n't like the sight of two men buggering each other when i 'm doing a break-in . 
  i mean , it 's their place of living , so it 's none of my business , but i 'm trying to do work there , so it 's kinda off-putting . 
  no , [ not really ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_moscow_times ) . 
  a bit of context , if you please ? 
  what are we looking at ? 
  i would say an eclectic collection of 19th century polish painters , such as [ malczewski 's paintings ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jacek_malczewski ) - * inter alia * * the blind faun * ; [ artur grottger 's paintings and sketches ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/artur_grottger ) ; [ a few , iirc , works by jan matejko ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jan_matejko ) . 
  many of the paintings will ring hollow for foreigners , however , i reckon . 
  maybe except malczewski , since he 's so extraordinary and different from anything else . 
  there is also a nice collection of renaissance * burgher * family portraits , a few weapons and pieces of armour from various periods . 
  not the biggest museum i 've ever been to , but not a small one either , and personally i liked the collections . 
  i am relatively confident it 's a smurf account for one polish poster . 
  i am not the whole country , for what it 's worth . 
  nor are the particularly bellicose people on your sub representative of the whole country , i hope . 
  to the 1980s ? 
  i do n't know whether you 've seen it , but have you seen the 1984 bbc 's tv drama , * threads * ? 
  it is rather hard to find it in its entirety , but i suggest you seek it out as - in my belief - it gives us a few notions of how not just nuclear war , but its aftermath may play out for some time . 
  what is more readily available , is [ a rather interesting debate ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y0vct-xwb7m ) sparked by that film , which i also recommend , in case you have n't seen it . 
  you see , what you and / u/mogurakun point out is part of the problem , is n't it ? 
  the atrociously short attention spans , the inability to understand context , and the hashtagification of the world as presented by the media . 
  i once read [ tarkovsky ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/andrei_tarkovsky ) made the introductory sequence of his * solaris * intentionally dull with the hope that bored people would leave the cinema and it would weed out those who did n't have the patience to really understand the film . 
  who knows , maybe ? 
  did you write that because you earnestly believe it , or was it something else ? 
  eu/nato retortions against spain for abetting russism when ? 
  [ sarcasm is for illustrative purposes only . ], 
  i do n't usually like short-cuts , but i will cut this short this time : what i 'm getting at is that , as became lucidly evident on the occasion of london 's russian embassy 's #gaybeargate and the reactions that followed both on here and on the russian sub , the so-called west and russia appear to be locked in their own echo chambers , medially speaking , and it 's hard to see how many russians will not resort to pointing out that when what they perceive as the enemy ( correct me if i misread the signals the russian media are sending ) , i.e. 
  nato as a proxy for the us , is criticising them , then they must be doing something right . 
  equally , when #russiadenies , we appear to be all smug and superior ( which some russians do not fail to take note of ) , but have we done anything about the situation ? 
  but what is the situation , first of all ? 
  in my view , that there appear to be , let 's call it , irreconcilable differences between how the west would like the world to run and how russia , as dictated by putin 's policies currently , would have it . 
  so what can we do about the situation ? 
  bomb russia , naturally !, 
  [ sarcasm and exaggeration used for illustrative purposes only ] but no !, 
  how can we - that 'd be the end of all humanity , because to bomb russia is to start a nuclear war - and russians , i believe , also regret the fact that they ca n't really use those icbms with impunity . 
  so we 're deadlocked , are n't we ? 
  but what about good ole dialogue - what happened to that ? 
  yeah , but , you ca n't just talk about human rights violations in russia , because what about the lynched negroes ? 
  was the egg or was it the chicken that was first ? 
  who was first to offend ? 
  are american retorsions the effect of russian action or the cause of the next one ? 
  how can we have dialogue when we do n't want to talk ( as a side note - [ the polish co-chair of the polish-russian commission for difficult issues resigned ] ( http://www.polskieradio.pl/5/3/artykul/1561493,polskorosyjska-grupa-ds-trudnych-rezygnacja-profesora-rotfelda ) in dec 2015 on the grounds that it was difficult to find common ground following russian aggression in ukraine , and russians said the broken dialogue was on the polish end , so there we were again , stuck ) . 
  the russians that come here and do n't automatically bash putin get hive-mind gang-banged into down-vote oblivion , because evil russists from asia , the get of mongols who follow der putinissimus - and well , yes , maybe sometimes they have crude words to offer , maybe at times the best some of them can offer is calamitous , but not to try to listen is to end attempts at productive dialogue ( because yes , a form of hostile dialogue will continue even over our iron curtain 2.0 , but not one that builds bridges ) . 
  likewise , it may be hard for someone of western sensibilities to try to find common ground with russians - because pride , the imperative not to bow your head , not to lose face . 
  and the lies , the manipulations , the echoes of the chamber where your truth and your truth alone is the truest truth and why would you listen to the weak gay-pigs ? 
  so dialogue does n't work , because we 're not honest about it . 
  how can we be honest - nato promised not to move east , but it did . 
  russia promised to respect sovereignty , but it did n't . 
  the cuban missile crisis and the hissy fit jfk threw !, 
  and now you plant an anti-missile shield on our doorstep , so you can bomb russia into oblivion with impunity , a russian might say !, 
  but wait - warsaw uprising and why did the soviets have to stop on the shore and wait for the uprising to bleed out ? 
  why , because they were overstretched , the supply lines were thousands of kilometres long !, 
  it was impossible to move another three kilometres to the other shore of wis\u0142a and into the west bank of warsaw !, 
  but the west intervened in russia during the revolution !, 
  they always hated russia !, 
  there were british soldiers on russian soil , invading !, 
  but !, 
  but !, 
  and so on ad infinitum , ever trying to square that circle . 
  -------------- * ad rem * to report the waship movement was news reporting , with perhaps a pinch of banter regarding the smokey-pokey chimney-choo . 
  to mull over it like so is to masturbate furiously ( a fault all sides are not devoid of , i 'd wager ) . 
  it 's not a god-damned football world cup , we do n't need updates in real time and , last i heard , [ nato logistics for afghanistan went through russia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nato_logistics_in_the_afghan_war#northern_distribution_network ) and i did n't exactly hear a fuss about that . 
  so , cut the crap with `` anger '' , oh dear western media , because you 're making me angry at how stupidly circular our logic is - and making me angry over words on the internet is a feat worth admiring . 
  whose anger is it ? 
  `` spain is facing criticism '' - criticism from who specifically ? 
  auto-ironic hipsters . 
  source of data ? 
  well , vlad has some track record of appearing to do the good things for the domestic populace ; the issue state actors other than russia take with russia is that it sometimes tramples fundamental principles of the modern world , such as sovereignty , or it tramples non-russian interests ( e.g. 
  us interests , for one ) , such as syria . 
  whether amidst all the smoke and mirrors of what putin is and is n't he 'll have managed to do good for his people remains to be seen at the end of the day . 
  which is , in a very basic and generalised way , somewhat reminiscent of what 's going on in poland . 
  that pis has the support the polling groups claim is a product of them appearing to try to do the right things for a domestic populace ( as promised in their election platform ) , which may appear to trample democratic principles ( the constitutional court i 'll admit appears to be a transgression ; the other things quoted in the article - limitation of civil liberties , control of media , and politicisation of civil service are debatable - the latter two definitely par for the course whenever the government changes , so the drastically different reaction from our western partners raises a few questions ) , or which may trample non-polish interests ( such as foreign investments and profit margins ) . 
  whether they 'll have served us , poles , well at the end of the day remains to be seen , but judging by how rocky this boat ride has been ( rocked by both pis 's apparent ineptitude and blunders and by the scale of protest and discontent not entirely unaided by foreign actors ) , it 'll definitely be a testing period to see us through the next three years ( and three years is , by my reckoning , all they 'll get ) . 
  such is life . 
  and we lynch negroes . 
  or is it them ? 
  does n't matter anyway , as long as there 's some lynching somewhere , then all 's as the mores dictate . 
  / r/russia [ conforming to expectations ] ( https://np.reddit.com/r/russia/comments/595irh/butthurt_westerners_getting_angry_by_a_caricature/ ) . 
  i am surprised it has taken that sub this long to spin this present topic about that twat tweet . 
  love of what ? 
  what was your `` kekekek '' supposed to entail then , if not mockery at perceived polish inferiority in the absence of data concerning the russian federation ? 
  why would you single out poland ? 
  there is [ a figure for 34 countries ] ( http://666kb.com/i/ddgqhhm1y4ajeg7ip.png ) ( polish decimal notation , apologies ) , as far as i can tell . 
  there are 21 countries where the percentage of 25-29 year-olds living with their parents is lower than in poland , and there are 12 where it is higher . 
  what makes poland stand out to you so ? 
  is it about countries formerly trapped behind the iron curtain ? 
  even then , there 'd be 4 countries where the share is higher than in poland , if we do n't count yugoslavia and the balkans , and 8 if we include them , by my count . 
  so , what exactly drew your gaze to poland , apart from a possible case of obsessive russian fixation with all things polish ? 
  share , might be we 'll all share a laugh together .

you just wait !, 
  soon we will into space too !, 
  poland can into neurosurgery . 
  the research part in the whole deal is done by the brits , and hence getting the proper funding as far as i know . 
  of course more money should be thrown at the experimental surgery ( especially in the neuro field ) but that 's a statement you could hear in every single research centre in existence . 
  harvesting the olfactory bulb is an integral part of the process , and in theory lab grown cells could be used instead . 
  but why would you ? 
  we do n't have proper tech , but even if w did there there is a question of surface protein compatibility . 
  it 's a good efficient method that suits the purpose right now . 
  there is of course a possibility of a glioma growth , but it 's a minor one . 
  if the cell cancer prevention mechanisms are intact , there should n't be any abnormalities when it comes to mass growth . 
  a member of science club of neurosurgery in wroclaw here , and a frequent guest on a surgical ward in which the procedure has been performed . 
  feel free to ask any questions , i 'll answer them right after i 'm back from uni . 
  for the love of god , this is / int / without all the crap , stop bringing those things over here . 
  you ca n't really avoid memorizing huge chunks of information in medicine ( pharm , anatomy ) but my point is that in theory the focus is ( or at least should be ) put elsewhere . 
  as a med student : no , at least in poland they are n't , the main goal was always to be able to quickly react to problems , and solve the medical riddles . 
  there is much more deduction going on then a simple `` memorise , repeat . '', 
  this is the only uplifting thing in the whole conflict . 
  this and possibly a new era of space program ? 
  pls , guys . 
  cold war is a really good name for a distro . 
  lets rebrand gentoo into cold war . 
  it even fits the general theme of gentoo . 
  cold war 1.2 then ? 
  brace yourselves for a cold war 2.0 !, 
  this will be so common in the nearest future that i can guarantee that press will quickly abandon the subject . 
   didnt usa and europe first tried to use their economic power and sanctions against russia ? 
  are you serious ? 
  did n't they do so in response to violation of ukraine political integrity ? 
  russia acts like a bully , and uses `` poor russians '' argument to force ukraine into puppet state again . 
  then eu in response imposes sanctions ( and does so openly ) . 
  what does russia do then ? 
  they fire back , but ( being innocents as they always were ) use a bunch of arguments such as `` polish apples are infected with a sneaky anti-russian disease '' or `` excuse us , we did not notice a drop in gas sent to poland , that must be a mistake '' . 
  yeah . 
  of course , let 's treat eu 's and russia 's actions the same . 
  i welcome german troops with open arms . 
  the more the merrier . 
  i 'm dead serious . 
  guys , the last time we had major conflict we moved our beautiful capitol from a gorgeous city of krak\u00f3w to a village called warsaw . 
  judging by his comments , the more he is paid by kremlin the wider is the gap he is willing to leap inductively . 
  i always assumed it was designed to be quirky , absurd and somewhat corny . 
  attracting attention through absurdity is basically abc of marketing . 
  i should know , the whole `` hovercraft '' monty python gag is stuck in my head better then `` duck tales '' lyrics . 
  so you could say that the campaign was a success . 
  there is only one answer to that question : [ enjoy ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spnepzuy2v4 ) and if you want something that 's more recent and more `` western '' : [ listen to this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rchakk7e0xa ),

  90 % of polish doctors do n't even vaccinate their kids , just a thought future polish doc here ( 1 year left till earning my md ) . 
  you are full of shit . 
  i do n't know one doctor with kids that were not vaccinated . 
  you are just pulling shit out of your ass , because you were too lazy to learn basic biology and chemistry in school , and now you spend your time on anti-vac blogs written by people like you , kidding yourself that you 're doing something substantial . 
  if you 're so into vac denial-ism , go to university , earn your degree and apply for a position in a immunology reaserch lab and try to prove that what you 're thinking is true . 
  but , wait , you ca n't because that requires not being a lazy piece of shit . 
  oh , you are one of those types : biology and chemistry was hard at school , so you read some anti vac blogs and realized you understand more than the scientific world does . 
   is that a 120 mm cannon , or are you just happy to see me ? 
   i 'm not really sure what you refer to . 
  do you mean our brand-new cutting-edge super-duper-futuristic-looking pl-01 ? 
  jesus , that 's a slick looking tank , 10/10 would drive it to work , and to pick up kids from school . 
  i 've never even been baptised . 
  i 've been born in a country that it 's 90 % catholic , while at the same time people actually practicing are less than 20 % of a population . 
  you say things like  you 're a christian with hinduism stuck in there in a pathetic attempt to try to seem neutral when i clearly wrote that i identify as an atheist too . 
  you say that i hate muslims , when all i wrote that some sects ( or splinter groups ) of muslim faith are violent . 
  why are you trying to warp my responses to make me appear a christian nut who wants his believes protected and other crushed ? 
  are you lacking arguments in that discussion ? 
   some religions more worthy of respect than others you seem to think and you do n't ? 
  some sects of hindu are basically `` do no harm incorporated '' , while at the same time violent muslim sects are beheading a msf doctor working in africa ? 
   idea that there was this guy 2,000 years ago who walked on water changed water into wine raised people from the dead and then died himself and got up again after ? 
  i can smell the fedora from here . 
  it 's one thing to be a non believer and quite another to try to be disrespectful on purpose . 
  people like you are the sole reason people have negative connotations with the word atheist . 
  truly we as a group are worse than some crazy christians . 
  do you think crazies who walk around the market square carrying pics of aborted fetuses , spouting bullshit about massive genocide should be allowed to do so ? 
   is south park illegal in poland ? 
  is it being aired on a billboard in a public space ? 
  if not , than it 's not illegal . 
   what if fsm people started protesting pasta restaurants for cooking and serving their god for people to eat ? 
  should they be shut down ? 
  quality strawman . 
   ca n't make fun of xenu ? 
  i can . 
  in a public space . 
  it 's a cult , not a religion . 
   is onion ? 
  am i forced to read the magazine ? 
  is it broadcasted in a public space ? 
  seems like you have completely missed my point . 
  you ca n't be forced to view disturbing material . 
  if pics of mohammad or buddha g having anal sex with a goat sound like an insightful critique of religion to you that 's great , enjoy it at home and share it on the internet . 
  just do n't force others to look at it , and do n't provoke religious people for the sake of provoking , because it does n't prove anything . 
  not everybody is stuck in an angry militant atheist phase . 
  can someone explain to me why blasphemy laws are a bad thing ? 
  how it currently works in poland is you can actually make an art installation depicting a penis on a cross our some other angsty bullshit , but only if it 's in an art gallery for example . 
  if you try to publicly show that thing you are risking a lawsuit . 
  same goes for extreme and graphic violence and pornography . 
  it 's not censorship , it 's protecting public space from unnecessary things that are controversial for the sake of being controversial . 
  unregulated freedom of speech is not necessarily a good thing . 
  example : us and kkk rallies . 
  ah , i get it . 
  i 'd argue that the collective mental breakdown is n't even a british thing .

  hell , they even got to power by pretending that they got over themselves already . 
  cheers for the heads up !, 
  i almost ruined myself a perfectly good evening . 
  sure they can . 
  while they have no direct control over spectacles they could pull the funding . 
  obviously . 
  but they better be ready to suffer political consequences of it , since both public and opposition are in their rights to pummel ruling party into a pulp over it . 
  that 's my point . 
  it is not . 
  whole idea of the law about having sex in public places is about minors randomly stumbling upon it . 
  as long is something is closed to the random public members it 's all legal . 
  actually last few weeks we were busy bashing turkey over their actions regarding turks and overall syria/isis situation . 
   a zoo is considered public space , despite selling admission tickets . 
  i 'm not sure how it differs from a theater in that respect . 
  well , zoo is n't informing visitors that they can expect witnessing sexual acts performed by employees while visiting . 
  not really . 
  there are several country-wide newspapers like `` fakty i mity '' , `` nie '' or even `` angora '' that are based upon attacking and offending catholic church . 
  porn is when a piece of media 's only goal is to sexually arouse audience . 
  i 'm pretty sure that this play does n't suit this definition , ergo is n't porn . 
  this case kinda proves the point . 
  what minister tried to do had no legal standing and was promptly ignored by local authorities he tries to put pressure on . 
  the attempt was followed by a huge blowback that forced said minister to say that he was `` misinformed '' and how he is an object of `` propaganda attack '' that he tried to censor things , while he really did n't yada , yada yada . 
  only half of the theater funding is public . 
  it does n't mean that politicans get to decide what is and is n't shown there . 
  especially since the spectacle in question will hardly be losing money . 
  edit : also - you realize that those are pretty much exact words of gomu\u0142ka , when he was pulling `` dziady '' of the stage back in ' 68 , right ? 
  fact that theater has `` public '' in its name does n't make it public in a legal meaning you have in mind . 
  the play is shown in a closed space with tickets required to enter , so it is definitely not `` public '' , since random people ca n't stray in there . 
  also sex in public places , while indeed illegal , is illegal in a same way as crossing a street in the wrong place , or bad parking . 
  hardly a criminal matter . 
  and what exactly is a difference between pretended and real sexual act in a movie or play ? 
  assuming that there wo n't be a close-up of gynecological kind . 
  i do n't really see one . 
  especially since full nudity in theater is as common of a thing as they come . 
  i 've been on several plays that involved nude actors of either or both sexes . 
  whole thing was a marketing ploy to get public 's attention . 
  fact that the minister made an utter fool of himself going full gomu\u0142ka , is no-one 's fault but his own . 
  and his pathetic excuses and half-arsed explanations bout how he was `` misinformed '' by the way play was portrayed makes it even more grotesque . 
  if he had any sense , he would say that he was mistaken and shut the hell up . 
  it still sells tickets and they are the major part of its funding and this play sure as hell is going to make money . 
  question of `` ownership '' is irrelevant here . 
  the '68 one was more on the grounds of politics , since the adaptation of xix century 's play was done in such a way that in conveyed criticism of relations with soviet union . 
  whole tax argument is as misguided and/or manipulative as they come . 
  with tickets already sold out for next few months this play will be clearly paying for itself and then some . 
  it was an attempt to threaten the theater `` do what we say , or that public funding will go away '' . 
  so question is not if taxpayers should pay for such plays , but if politicians should use taxpayer 's money to pummel artists into submission . 
  and he outright demanded of wojewoda to stop the premiere . 
  something like that . 
  it actually resembled a [ ban of `` dziady '' play in 1968 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1968_polish_political_crisis ) by communist regime that sparked a political crisis . 
  same mindset , but this time with more catholicism . 
  it 's journalist 's job to ask politicians hard questions . 
  especially ruling ones . 
  and he refused to answer any , just kept repeating that he has a `` right to present his statement to the people '' . 
  she might have not been nice , but was spot on , if you have a statement to make , call a press conference . 
  i was watching it and could n't believe my eyes . 
  gli\u0144ski behaved like gomu\u0142ka reborn . 
  same mentality , but this time with crosses . 
  if chechen wars thought us anything it 's that russian military looks good only on paper . 
  also , fighting isis may require more than throwing industrial amounts of grad missiles at their general direction . 
  it 's definitely more than just ordinary seat changes . 
  for example parliamentary special services committee has been always lead by an opposition member . 
  pis says `` nope '' and takes it for themselves , crippling parliamentary control over this sensitive area . 
  and do n't tell me that passing a law that invalidates pre-electoral picks for 5 constitution court judges was legit . 
  especially since they done that in the middle of the night refusing any discussion on the bill whatsoever and it was signed by the president on the very next day , faster than any law in the last 25 years i can think of . 
  if you add things such as attempts to censor theater , aggressive anti-left rhetoric and a fact that few dozens of ministerial nominations went to people that are borderline nuts or outright disgusting ( like a vice-minister of justice who was defending pedophyle-priests by blaming children ) it sure makes for a damn ugly picture . 
  perhaps that brilliant joke was only funny first 1000 times they 've read it ? 
  not sure how that joke is supposed to apply to wwi tho . 
  french-prussian war , perhaps , but definitely not wwi . 
  french doctrine then was in like with all the other powers and consisted of throwing tens of thousands of soldiers at positions that were way too fortified for them to handle . 
  over and over hoping that enemy runs out of warm bodies first . 
  that 's the problem with term of `` ethnic cleansing '' . 
  it involves both murdering whole populations and removing a dozen people from the village you are about to fight for . 
  good thing they 're wasting no time and already attempt to censor theater . 
  edrogan 's party was the 1st mainstream turkish party that extended its hand to kurds and he still gets bonus points for that , that 's true . 
  not sure if that makes them `` islamists '' tho . 
  conservatives ? 
  sure - hdp is a fairly left wing and progressive party even for western european standards after all , so many people might have not been too conformable voting for them , so i would n't go as far as saying that edrogan kurdish votes were for only islamist reasons . 
  and saying that there is some kind of deep hatred between erdogan voters and those who supported hdp and that arming them will lead to a war between those factions seems outright bonkers . 
  and since hdp is known to have links with pkk i 'd say that your claim that whoever voted for edrogan in the past would never think of supporting pkk in any way is debatable . 
  not to mention that you 're now only talking about turkish kurds ( citing election results ) while in the post i responed to you seemed to have talked about kurds in general . 
  overall your post are either oversimplified or attempted manipulation . 
  since when half of the kurds are `` islamists '' ? 
  i 've never seen anything even remotely supporting that claim . 
  actually arab dark ages is a term used by arab scholars to describe time since the end of its golden age ( that is since siege of baghdad ) till today . 
  for the love of all that is secular - use imgur instead of tinypic.com, 
  agreed . 
  whole definition mess around this subject is absurd . 
  every comment about socialism should probably be started with a definition of what one means by that . 
  turn the clock back 100-120 years and you would have all that written about actions of [ polish socialist party ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polish_socialist_party ) and [ pi\u0142sudski ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/j%c3%b3zef_pi%c5%82sudski ) . 
  broker peace with kurds offering support for kurdish real state on iraqi and syrian lands they control and problem will disappear . 
  rooting them out in police/military actions ca n't possibly work anyway when they have a quasi-state right nextdoor . 
  i by no means support their attacks on civilian administration members , nor claim that they 're wise , but that 's what happens in prolonged separatist conflict . 
  both sides keep striking at eachother , become more and more militant with every suffered death . 
  same things happaned in ireland , basque country , chechnya or indeed poland . 
  a real chance for kurds to eventually get their own country due to isis situation is probably the best chance to end ppk-related violence to date . 
  if by `` isis gone '' you mean returning to the situation from before its emergence . 
  and that 's why the only real solution to this war that i can see is some kind of agreement all all those sides where each gets more or less what they want . 
  territory-wise . 
  kurds surely wo n't go back under baghdad 's control after all that , it 's naive to think otherwise . 
  problem being that turkey and to lesser extent iraq have very little to gain resolving it unless they can broker serious peace with ppk .

  not only pis mps voted in favour of not trashing this project .

  which satisfies everyone . 
  it 's not as easy dilemma as both extremes try to make you believe . 
  similar to voting for far left . 
  extremes are extreme . 
  you clearly do n't understand what happened in poland . 
  first and foremost , judges are elected for a 9-year-term and they ca n't be reelected , so there 's no possibility of anyone being on the bench since 1980 's . 
  nobody was removed , just the opposite - the previous parliament elected too many of them , hoping that it would compensate them for losing general election . 
  the crisis started when the new president decided not to swear in not only the surplus ones , but the whole batch . 
  boris is khazar in origin , not slavic .

   she says that it was not rare to see german officer helping local populace escape before the soviet army that was feared as violent and barbarian by both sides at this stage of war . 
  it were n't soviets who commited atrocities after warsaw uprising , murdering thousands of people neigbourhood by neighbourhood then levelling the city . 
  go figure out , there are countless testimonies out there . 
  ethnicity plays secondary role here , there are also dagestani people among the wahhabists .

  as a person who lived during communist reign , in the transition period and in an emerging market country - i can only agree with every single word which you wrote . 
  each time i dare to point it out in this subreddit , i get downvoted to hell . 
  it 's easy to look down on `` backward eastern europe '' and say that we need to be thankful for eu funds without which we would have perished . 
  we made huge progress during the interbellum period and since 1989 till joining eu and now we 're repaying the funds which we receive by providing cheap labor and a relatively large market outlet to western european economies . 
  we could form a joint venture with china ... 
  and czechia in the middle . 
  ... then we take berlin !, 
  it does n't sound german . 
  there is certain likeness because of intonation which i believe to be typical for 1930s radio . 
  the person which was reading it was polish - https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/j%c3%b3zef_ma%c5%82gorzewski . 
  so , no pogroms in 1920s and 1930s . 
  please correct your statement . 
  imagine kids running towards you from behind each corner !, 
  unfortunately , that 's correct . 
  most of us remember passing through gypsy villages in romania on our way to black sea riviera ( a vacation of our dreams during communist times ) and being chased by half-naked kids begging for money and candy . 
  that 's where it comes from - such poverty was never to be seen anywhere in poland at the time . 
  conservatism is bound to tradition specific to a place and a time . 
  what are `` european standards '' ? 
  german ones ? 
  french ? 
  hungarian ? 
  polish ? 
  there 's plenty of them and the good thing in the eu is that you are free too choose as you wish . 
  razem is a totally new player . 
  pis uses all toolls it has to hand . 
  their goal is to reign past the current term of office and they need to appease voters of many denominations , including moderate nationalists . 
  during the reign of pis in warsaw , the tempo of reprivatisation was significantly slower - it could not have been halted due to the legal framework being in place . 
  the main accusation against civic platform ( po ) mayor is insufficient due diligence and that her husband had participated in the scheme . 
   look at poland 's pogroms against jews for example all during the 20 's and 30 's i 've only heard about the made-up ones during that period , could you elaborate , please ? 
  that 's a problem with polish law . 
  we inherited communist law framework and built upon it , creating many new acts ridden with loopholes and heavily influenced by lobbyists . 
  and western europeans still wonder why pis has won . 
  post-communists became largely perceived as corrupted due to series of scandals in 2004 , same happened to the progressive part of the post-solidarity movement in 2015 . 
  pis is thus the only major actor left in the polish political scene and represents the conservatives , not the nationalists which is the picture presented by the media in western europe .

  ban any mention of eu meps like some french media do with terrorists !, 
  oh , you were trying hard . 
  we even exported [ an advisor ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/j%c3%b3zef_retinger ) . 
  he resigned and came back to europe in order to establish the eu and the bilderberg group .

  women are supposed to be treated equally to men , oder ... ? 
  that 's the definition of a frozen conflict . 
  shots being exchanged over the border every now and then , a heavier shelling every few months/years but no decisive offensive . 
  poland - according to / r/europe - is a police state . 
  tell me what 's good for me , again . 
  i 'm against any form of censorship . 
  they always mentioned the citizenship status . 
  they all flee to germany after a short rest in poland . 
  from : witold waszczykowski to : frank-walter steinmeier hi , could you let me know whether any polish citizens were among the victims of the new year 's eve events in cologne , please ? 
  i am aware that your office may not be in possession of this information , thus please feel free to forward my request to the appropriate office . 
  regards, 
   i 'm a reader and i never wanted to learn how a shooter looked or what was his name but i would want to know the shooters motive . 
  appearance and name often divulge heritage of a person . 
  is this something which needs to be hidden from the public ? 
  so , what laws about freedom of speech and art have you had in mind ? 
  it is likely that your sources will have to backpedal - again . 
  this is a classic straw man attempt . 
  what laws regarding freedom of press and arts ? 
  and , oh , the tribunal is not the highest court . 
  do your research and stop repeating bullshit . 
  germans just signalled that they had a number of leads to build confidence in their intelligence capacities . 
  i know a spanish guy who works on a farm . 
  he 's not picking the crops himself , but works in an oversight/expert role . 
  he really knows how to grow lettuce :d,

  as long as they catch on by 2020 we ought to consider it a success . 
   the opposition that fought bloody street fights with the nazis , mind you . 
  yes , i 'm aware of basic historical facts . 
  i though that mentioning them twice in 10 sentences is quite enough . 
  i really do promise pinky swear that i 'm fully aware about left-wing opposition to hitler , their 30 % support in '32 and '33 as well as a fact that spd as the only party ( with already absent communists ) voted against granting hitler extraordinary powers in ' 33 . 
  i 'm also aware of the street fights between sa and left-wing paramilitaries . 
   sources ? 
  alright , maybe that was too grand of a statement , but a fact is that actual armed or otherwise active resistance against nazi rule during war was very small compared to all the other conquered nations . 
  and that was the main point i was trying to make , that there is no comparison between support for nazis in countries such as belgium , netherlands , france , yugoslavia , or poland and germany itself . 
  and pleas do n't ask me to provide specific sources for that . 
   again . 
  conquest is defined as `` the subjugation and assumption of control of a place or people by military force . '', 
  - which the nazis did with paramilitarian units ( sa etc ) . 
  save for the ones i mentioned in 1st paragraph ( extensively enough this time , i hope ) as well as some christian elements the rest of the country by large did n't exactly needed to be forced to support nazis by sa bats . 
  nor provided any noticeable resistance once they sheepishly aided hitler 's final rise . 
  i stand by my statement that there are better words to describe this process than `` conquest '' . 
  oh , i do agree on both counts that existence of such sentiments is indeed a sad state of affairs and it is both commendable for majority of german politicians to pacify them and despicable for pis government to fan them . 
  and yes - young people embracing nationalism is something that worries me greatly as well . 
  i 'm actually quite involved in criticizing the current government for their pro-nationalist stance and flirts with far-right as a member of left-wing `` razem '' political party . 
  on top of day-to-day media presence which we use to rise those issues we operate a site http://zero-tolerancji.pl/ that monitors and alerts about instances of such pro-nationalist behavior on all levels of state administration . 
  i claim that word `` to conquer '' has a certain , very specific meaning especially when one is discussing topics such as wwii rather than writing bad press headlines . 
  use of this word in this context attributes equality between `` conquest '' of germany and actual later nazi conquests such as conquest of poland . 
  the nazi takeover in germany can be much better described by dozens other words and while actual opposition by socialists and communists needs to be remembered along with its bloody suppression , fact is that nazi rule as well as the war effort benefited from overwhelming popular support . 
  support comparable and often significantly bigger than the popular support enjoyed by other waring nations . 
  so while once again the dearly paid socialist opposition as well as other crimes of nazis against parts of german society have to be remembered it would be incorrect to call that rise to power `` a conquest '' . 
  even more so when we consider both the level of suffered repression and fact that for example in poland same conquerors did n't even manage to gather a handful of figureheads to form a collaboration government , yet alone millions upon millions of soldiers ready to kill , die and murder in their name across all of europe and beyond . 
  so no . 
  while no one is saying that 100 % of the germans supported hitler or whatnot a claim that germany was simply `` the first country conquered by nazis '' is about as far from being a fact as historical statements come . 
  i was thinking more along the lines of `` germany shocked by an animal-like display of violence between ~ ~ indo-european ~ ~ ( probably pakistani ) immigrants as homeless and long term unemployed dativ was brutally murdered by his reportedly employed , but known for elementary school level education genetiv . 
  in shocking statement german national security advisor mr. arsch schitzel tells fox news that this is yet another evidence that both german state and the eu exist only theoretically anymore . 
  he expects whole europe to devolve into chaos and tribal conflicts till the end of the week . 
  this is what taking in syrian child refugees leads to ! '', 
  it 's an awful habit . 
  i had an ukrainian flatmate for a year and later lived with my italian girlfriend for 10 months but hardly learned either language due to almost exclusively speaking english out of laziness . 
  stay tuned for fox news tomorrow special on this terrible event . 
  actually only the 1st one is correct . 
  commonwealth of both nations is a name xix historians came up with . 
  so is that a `` maybe '' ? 
  are you sure you are n't one of those romanian germans ? 
  you seem to be intrinsically opposed to the very idea of * fun * . 
  sounds * exactly * like something a resentful , de-latinized italian ( or should i say lombard barbarian ? ), 
  would say . 
   i 'm sorry , but i do n't buy that . 
  this is n't something that `` happens '' to you , it 's a sentiment that you 're in full control of . 
  that 's true both for both mathematical ( as in there were n't exactly 13yo german war criminals while there were 4yo victims ) and psychological reasons . 
  people are more likely to tell their children stories about what happened to their family members who did n't survive the war , rather than how they were murdering people , sending them to concentration camps etc. 
  therefore there is a 10-20 year gap between passing of the actual witnesses and there are way more people who heard the stories 1st hand from their family members on polish than on german side of things . 
  same reason why post-war expulsion of german civilians much fresher in the memory . 
   do you think it 's easy to just accept that eastern prussia was essentially annexed ? 
  as i already mentioned in yet another comment poland had nothing to do with the fate of eastern prussia . 
  it was gone the moment germany lost the war being the actual excuse for it . 
  there literally was n't a possible post-war result that kept german enclaves on the map . 
  as for rest of the territories east of the oder it 's not like poland and poles were happy about trading our eastern lands for them and having millions of people forcibly relocated there by the soviets . 
  you 'd be hard-pressed to find a person claiming that it was a worthy exchange . 
  i mean , i get the sentiment and where it comes from but find it about as misguided as the sentiment of those halfwits in poland who are masturbating vigorously thinking about lw\u00f3w and wilno . 
   it 's reasonable to expect you to do the same and be a little less `` touchy '' on your history in the interest of a better conversation moving forward . 
  sure , and that was kinda my point as well , but as i tried to showcase in those personal examples it 's not exactly a thing some , especially older people , can get over easily . 
  which was removed ? 
  ablativus or vocativus ? 
  could you make a list of what their purposes are ? 
  i assume they still `` answer questions '' , right ? 
  it 's weird how almost all romance languages completely gave up on 6 ( 7 with locativus ) cases latin used . 
  seems like only romanians resisted the urge to primitivize their language , clearly guilt-tripped by slavic neighbors . 
  i tried to explain this phenomena [ answering ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5wbi0v/son_of_german_nazi_governor_returns_art_stolen/de9rd3b/ ) a similar comment above , if you 're interested . 
  what 's the point of the comment then ? 
  an offhand trolling attempt ? 
  it 's not like poland wanted to trade our eastern territories for german ones in the first place and had millions of people forcibly resettled west by the soviets . 
  and as far as east prussia goes it arguably had to go either way after germany lost being an actual excuse for war in the first place . 
  i mean , i ca n't imagine a post-war outcome that would possibly left that territory under german control , no matter how anachronistic it seems these days with eu , open borders and all . 
  i do agree that blaming today 's germans for sins of their ancestors is wrong ( bordering on counterproductive ) and that germany indeed done a good job acknowledging and taking responsibility for its crimes to the point that , despite the shortcomings , it is rightfully considered an example to follow in that regard . 
  problem is that history of the war and the atrocities lives longer in memories of those who were subjected to them and their descendants than in the minds of perpetrators and their children . 
  therefore this is still a very fresh wound for many older people who lost their loved ones and themselves been victims of german atrocities . 
  same , to lesser extent , goes for their children who had the stories told by survivors . 
  it will take time for this topic to seize to be a powder keg . 
  and i do understand the frustration of especially younger germans who ( rightfully ) feel victimized by being to some extent treated as guilty by association , but with trauma of such proportions you ca n't expect all the reactions to be logical . 
  let me give a personal example . 
  my now 81yo grandma was 4yo when she was for the first time forced by occupational authorities to come to the town square with the rest of the town under the threat of arrest or even death to watch hangings of local jews and people caught helping them . 
  her mother tried hiding her when people were rounded up for those `` events '' but it was n't always possible and by the age of 7 she witnessed dozens of such scenes . 
  she does n't hate today 's germans on intellectual level , but even hearing german spoken on tv triggers borderline panic attacks in her . 
  and it 's not like her own experience was among most traumatic . 
  i have an aunt who survived [ \u0142apanka ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/roundup_ ( history \\ ) ) summary execution on the streets of \u0141\u00f3d\u017a by pretending to be dead while laying under the bodies of her brother and mother who hid her behind her when being murdered in as a part of terror campaign to punish the city for acts of sabotage in one of the factories . 
  myself being half a century younger i rarely think of those things , but my blood still boils when i stumble upon some young german halfwit writing [ comments ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/documentaries/comments/5vgxhv/the_fallen_of_world_war_ii_2016_a_very/de2bq7x/ ) like `` the first country the nazis conquered was germany '' . 
  to sum things up - overwhelming majority of the poles appreciates german efforts to atone for the past , deems then satisfactory and wants to move on with bilateral relations rather than dwell in the past , but it is still a very touchy subjects and offhand comments or actions who may seem benign in your eyes or even in the eyes of impartial observer may flare up emotions and sometimes lead to overblown and unfair reactions from our side . 
  since it is still a relatively fresh wound . 
   his priority though is not social issues but modernizing french economy . 
  that 's my biggest fear . 
  `` modernizing the economy '' is usually a keyword for deregulation , dismantling safety nets and the rest of neoliberal `` solution '' for everything from chickenpox to global warming . 
  so basically everything that has been pushing people into the arms of far-right for last decade or two . 
  seen it in poland , seen it in the uk , seen it in the us etc. 
  sure , but calling far-right movements similar to fn `` patriotic '' is a bit of a stretch . 
  they seem to be less interested in well-being of all their compatriots and more in ethnic and `` racial '' phantasmagorias . 
  sure , and if we decide to ignore his awful human rights record his presidency may seem not all that bad , but typical centrist `` spinning in circles while doing nothing '' about internal problems for 8 years ( half arsed healthcare reform is more or less nothing ) is one of the reasons trump won . 
  if macron ends up being similarly devoid of will and ideas to fix social issues the polls before next election will be looking the other way around . 
  sure , he 's infinitely better than le pen , but centrist and their inherent ineptitude seems to be a harbinger of far-right governments these days . 
  right . 
  good luck supporting a family for 2000z\u0142 in any academic city , not to even mention warsaw . 
  at the moment you may or may not better income sometime in your late 30s , early 40s . 
  i have a novel idea tho !, 
  how about paying people a fucking living wage and employing them without breaking the law and cheating on taxes ( health insurance pension fund ) by using trash contracts ? 
  also your idea of `` suspending passports '' is obviously impossible to implement , even if we were to pretend for a second that it makes any sense .

  it 's somewhat correct idea , but i do n't see how could you deny those benefits to people with permanent job unless you would lower taxes for them for first 4 years . 
  lifting schengen is least that is about to happen . 
  maybe he meant fact that we have 2015 and version of friend finder court ruled about was from 2010 ? 
  or maybe he sees german law bad , and likes facebook that much . 
  / s a little, 
   if you go with stereotypes i try not to . 
  but it is exactly about this . 
  toreon as user toreon ? 
  `` central europe '' would be fine . 
  thanks . 
  so did canadians get contract signed or not ? 
  it 's a geopolitical description left from dark times of the soviet empire . 
  we are in one body called european union last time i checked . 
  you could easily describe us as new-eu or better eeu - eastern eu . 
  we are n't talking about un statistics here . 
  geographically [ poland lies in , if not western , then central europe at most . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/geographical_midpoint_of_europe )  it doesnt mean you 're all evil commies . 
  yeah , not every one is evil , right ? 
  do n't forget before that we were evil nazis , as they as well occupied poland . 
   how is the left commonly perceived in your country ? 
  atm - bad . 
  there are two parties who say are left . 
  both of them are almost non-existent in media for now . 
  both are rather unattractive choice . 
  my personal feeling for this moment - in next elections both wo n't get in as well , and we will get another right sided parliament ( whether it will be more or less right depends on few factors ) if trend for happenings in europe will continue . 
  as always biggest problem for pis is pis itself . 
  no , you earned yourself 2k by doing work for your boss , as you signed contract for fixed amount of money per month . 
  your boss started the business , invested some money and time thus he gets more than you . 
  if you do n't like that deal you can ask for rise ( and probably you wo n't get it , but i wish you good luck ) or quit the job ( like many people do , before leaving poland ) . 
  you know what he meant , you know he is right ( taxes are killing industry and service sector ) , you know taxes are poorly managed , when it comes to collecting and spending , and you try to troll . 
  not nice . 
  but mentioning nazi past is a no-no ? 
  and the fact it was n't us who chose the side of the fence should at least make one think about it for a second . 
  romania has industrial amounts of raw gold ( 300 tonnes according to article , like woah ! ), 
  and would let foreigners dig it ? 
  ~ ~ ooookay . ~ ~ edit - a.s.b. 
  apparently not . 
  we have schlongs . 
  and beards . 
  someone is disturbing your privacy without any valid reason and you care about that someone 's feelings ? 
  i would n't be that lenient , as you wrote he asked for it , but i guess it further proves you guys up north are nice  edit - about poop jokes , right , sorry for that . 
  oh yeah , indeed there was such theory here . 
  that would give some more light to it . 
  it is well hidden . 
  story with a twist . 
  nice . 
  would that mean that recent assaults are strictly tied to recent immigration wave ? 
  hmm ... 
  was it that normal in uk ? 
  jailed . 
  keeping that away from public is putting citizens in risk . 
  those characters look so suggestive it would be hard to mistake them with each other . 
  and i 've been only to denmark . 
  brilliant . 
  - not in mood . 
  - ok . '' it is n't that hard , is it ? 
  normally it is enough to look at that peeker to make him/her stop . 
  or simple - `` do you have to stare at me ? '', 
  - said loud enough for others to hear . 
  why make a fool out of yourself ? 
  you need personal space but find `` poop on me '' joke appropriate way ? 
  hmm ... 
  i 'm stunned . 
  i just do n't believe that . 
  it 's above my highest levels of abstraction . 
  where dafuq you took those germans from ? 
  threatening german that cares for germans ? 
  what kind of lunacy is this ? 
   that 's a fucking problem . 
  crazy immigrants is one thing but natives going along is key to ~ ~ domestic ~ ~ civil war . 
  you took it out of my mouth . 
  that person is lost . 
  poor soul . 
  i ca n't decide if it is 2nd or 1st place to live in europe on my list . 
  rich , civilized ( for now at least ) , great road infrastructure , great mountains , 5 hours from croatia . 
  if it was n't for language i 'd definitely consider looking for job and permanent stay there . 
  `` do n't print these or that or people will know . '' ? 
  fine example . 
  at that precise moment anglo-saxons ruled something like half of the world so he was pretty much right . 
   so why would germany be at fault , and not other countries that may vote for it ? 
  german eu mps are most active ones atm with schultz being leader of this ( some of your politicians officially say he is like being in amok ) . 
  keep at least schultz at bay and pis wo n't have it that easy . 
  it becomes more and more probable that this attack was to move public opinion from immigrant crisis . 
  how real or stupid would that be cologne reminded europe that there are real problems elsewhere . 
  timeline please and it should be clear . 
  it 's polish , you could at least respect her . 
  ibris survey ? 
  my friendly advice - do n't believe in ordered result surveys . 
  another thing is it is only two months since elections and poles do forget easily - po with their shady doings got 20 % ... 3 years is long time . 
  i 've shown you example in which it is different prices for each eu country , and you write it is n't that way . 
  somehow it is . 
  thanks to eu not being united in this matter and polish politics being lousy poland pays 30 % more for russian gas than f.e. 
  germany does . 
  i asked legit questions . 
  exactly . 
   the uk will not be negotiating with countries , but with the eu . 
  russia sells oil and gas for different prices to different countries inside eu . 
  why would it be any different with uk ? 
  because those commodities have some special status ? 
  yeah .

  also - i kinda understand the need for walls around russian embassy in poland , 
  oh , right . 
  you do n't have to read `` war and peace '' , or `` crime and punishment '' in schools in russia ? 
  or do you just nto like them ? 
  i thought they were great ( even though obviously we see history from different pov in poland ) . 
  poland ( no particular order ) : - `` the peasants '' by noble winner ** w\u0142adys\u0142aw reymont ** https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_peasants - great book about lives of peasants in small village in poland during partitions . 
  just a very good portrait of interesting period , and interesting ( but simple ) people . 
  - `` ferdydurke '' by ** witold gombrowicz ** https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ferdydurke - kinda abstract/absurd book about people trying to escape the need to conform to society expectations , and failing , repeatedly . 
  imho top 3 polish book . 
  - `` solaris '' ** stanis\u0142aw lem ** - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/solaris_%28novel%29 - hard sci-fi about how naive our expectations of contact with alien life are . 
  the best `` alien '' in sci-fi . 
  aliens from `` blindsight '' are close second place . 
  - `` white and red '' ** dorota mas\u0142owska ** http://www.amazon.co.uk/white-red-dorota-maslowska/dp/1843544237 - book about young people from society margin in modern poland . 
  they are called dresiarze ( polish chav equivalent ) . 
  - `` the last wish '' ** andrzej sapkowski ** ( it 's short stories collection , not a novel , but imho it 's the best sapkowski has to offer - his novel are a little worse than short stories ) - postmodern fantasy , a combination of chandler detective antihero + slavic and ee fairy tales plots + what would life in tolkien fantasy world look like if it was n't a fairy tale but a real world . 
  notable absents : shame that `` ice '' by ** jacek dukaj ** is n't translated , because otherways i would choose it over `` white and red '' . 
  also shame it 's xxth and xxist century only , because `` the doll '' by ** boles\u0142aw prus ** is also polish top 3 book , and it 's only 20 years too old to be here . 
  ** ryszard kapu\u015bci\u0144ski ** - i just do n't like his books . 
  ** henryk sienkiewicz ** - his books are fun , and very popular , but not so good to make it into top 5 . 
  he is a polish dumas . 
  ** antoni go\u0142ubiew ** his novels about boles\u0142aw chrobry are great , but again - no english translation . 
  ** jolanta chmielewska ** her `` ironic crime stories '' are great , and very funny , she sold 10\u00a0000\u00a0000 copies in russia and 6 000 000 in poland , still no english translation . 
  uk : monthy python and the saint grail . 
  spain : the nympho 's diary . 
  asking that question in english is kinda funny , 
   there has been a treaty , you know ? 
  you mean the iran treaty ? 
  imho it 's wise to keep working on the shield . 
  there has been usa-russian reset recently , and look how it ended . 
  as they say : `` speak softly and carry a big stick '' . 
  it 's not politincorrect , it 's just incorrect . 
  yes , it 's `` holandia '' in polish , but they mistranslated that into english . 
  well , if you compare state media ( 100 % dumb shit propaganda 16 hours each day ) to rfe ( sometimes misleading ) it 's still obvious which is better . 
  what 's wrong with it ? 
  half of poland listened to it in 80s . 
  first informations about czarnobyl catastrophe came from the west through rfe . 
  it probably saved some lives . 
  radio free europe worked out . 
  small high-readines aeromobile battle-group operating on russian territory eliminating people that write propaganda on the internet . 
  anything less is a half-measure . 
  poland . 
  no , 7 cases in all the dialects i know . 
  nominative is sometimes used instead of vocative , but it 's the same everywhere in poland , it 's not specific to one dialect . 
  we have bia\u0142ystok dialect , which uses preposition `` dla '' ( for ) in places where regular polish does n't , and consequently it uses different case with these verbs , but it still has all the cases , just uses them differently . 
  english equivalent would be `` tell for him '' instead of `` tell him '' . 
  the funniest thing is - he complains that he is quoted out of context , and that media falsify his image by showing only controversial statements . 
  but no matter what you ask - in the end he says sth like the above quotes  and btw he thinks global warming is a scam . 
  according to korwin-mikke it was probably fault of heinrich himmler , who have n't informed hitler of his deeds . 
   everybody has the right to exercise and take part in competitions . 
  we should only be glad that invalids do . 
  but it has nothing to do with sport , it 's like chess for idiots . 
  ...  in society there is a rule - you become like people with whose you contact . 
  so - watching ( otherwise impresive ) - strugles of para-sportsmen - can cause ( fortunately temporary ) - problems with movement coordination . 
  if we want for humanity to develop - we should show healthy , pretty , strong , honest , wise people in tv , and not perverts , murderers , weaklings , losers , idiots , and invalids - unfortunately . 
  he 's like a mine of dumb and offensive quotes . 
  somebody created this : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuus79gpnjg , 
  btw currently the most promising scientific theory says , that women are on average as intelligent as men , but the variability is higher for men ( there are more of both unusually dumb and unusualy inteligent men than women ) . 
  basicaly this : https://cdn.psychologytoday.com/sites/default/files/styles/image-article_inline_full/public/blogs/54311/2011/01/54391-45190.png?itok=pxhofisv this is probably caused by the repeated x chromosome in women , when men have only 1 copy of it . 
  in female brain half of the cells have x chromosome inherited from mother , and half from father . 
  in male brain - all the cells have the same x chromosome - from mother . 
  so there 's less averaging-out in men . 
  source : http://ukcatalogue.oup.com/product/9780199927531.do, 
  this is one of his least controversial statements , too . 
   the poles do n't like us because we 're coward and mostly atheist nah . 
  we laught at you because of that , not dislike you . 
  the worst thing in our relations is your weird attitude towards russia , and the recent anti-polish-food campaign . 
  still you are probably in top 3 most liked neighbors . 
  looking at the table - it does n't seem that countries with more black people have higher rates . 
  uk why are your laws so dumb ? 
  somehow in poland i 's legal to rip cds . 
  so i really doubt it 's eu . 
  ru\u015b / rusini is usually translated as ruthenia/ruthenians . 
  it was on napoleon side , 
  they could n't force ussr out of ee either , 
  there is no lower distance limit ? 
  cities closer than 100km should have line in red , that 's all . 
  would n't it be better to just show dots for each city ? 
  the lines add no information in such case , and just make it harder to see the clusters . 
  it 's missing many cities . 
  in poland there should be 39 dots for example . 
  also the visualization is strange - it covers the map on average proportionaly to the square of the number of the cities ( because for n cities there are ( n ^ 2 - n ) / 2 lines between them ) . 
  so if your country has 3 times more cities - it looks 9 times as `` covered '' on this map ( depending also on their placement ) . 
  edit : ok , so it apparently do n't show cities that are 150 + km from another city with  100 000 population . 
  then it 's not incorect , but i wonder what was the reasoning behind such criterium . 
  both are occupied by russians . 
  i 'm sure quality of life in donbas and crimea is great right now . 
  why should lithuanians care russians have https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/stockholm_syndrome ? 
  should be kebab or pizza in poland , but i guess it 's hard to collect stats from 1000s of these places , and mcdonald is much easier . 
  divisions differ in different countries . 
  i 've never heard term `` northern europe '' used in poland . 
  in poland most used division is `` the west '' which starts at germany and includes everything from there , also italy , spain , scandinavian countries , and usa . 
  sth similar to southern europe is sometimes used , but we call them `` mediterranean countries '' , and sth similar to northern europe is used , but we call them `` scandinavians '' ( it does n't include baltic states of course ) . 
  there 's `` the east '' , which includes russia , ukraine , belarus , sometimes also romania , balkans and baltic states . 
  then there 's central europe which includes poland , czech republic , slovakia , hungary , sometimes baltic states . 
  also some people in poland consider germany and austria `` central europe '' , but most think they are `` the west '' . 
  i do n't really care , in english i use english terms , in polish i use polish terms . 
  it 's not like ee stereotypes are going to remain forever . 
  depends . 
  in places with well preserved architecture like krak\u00f3w , toru\u0144 , lublin - nope , at least nowhere near old town . 
  in cities where there is nothing to lose ( communists messed up already by building socrealist housing and commiblocks in old town ) , or with fake old towns - no problem .

check smaller bakeries , a lot are still around and they do proper , tasty bread instead of baking the deep frozen thing available in bigger stores . 
  it might be a local thing , but i noticed the same shift that happened to beer a few years ago - `` craft bread '' seems to be more available and there are more choices . 
  yet waaaaay more spot on than `` dziobak '' . 
   luckily * fasten your seatbelt beep from hell * took over .

  the smear job , that bbc did before the event , painted both countries as run solely by football hooligans and that the whole gig as death camp for foreigners .

   12 - 3 + months of unpaid internship ftfy, 
   the origins of poland i love this part the most . 
  it 's like bible 's book of genesis - `` first there was nothing . 
  then czechs sent some peasant king a gift of christianity along with a busty wench and it was good . 
  that 'd be it . '', 
  just as if nothing existed before 966 or `` the gift of christianity '' was so great that everyone embraced it on a whim .

  i highly doubt that the generation that hit uk recently is very religious . 
  out of 50 guys/gals i know maybe 5 are of the `` church-going type religious '' and i am not even sure if they continue religious practices outside of their parent 's eyesight . 
  but my sample size is n't very representative . 
  not really , it 's just a recurring joke here in pl and this was first link in english . 
  glad that foreigners remember that tho . 
  i guess no more speeding tickets for [ mr. prawo jazdy ] ( http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/7899171.stm ) .

   motorway that does not fill all criterias of proper motorway in poland it means that they have n't been able to setup toll booths yet . 
  people speculate that it might be rigged with hard to detect mines and other deathtraps . 
  also - there is a huge forest fire nearby , i wonder if it 's related . 
  how about romania ? 
  not very recent , but they let their ceausescus go with a bang and they 've been doing pretty well . 
   t\u00dcv statistics do not lie ignorance is bliss . 
  that 's some impressive forward thinking to name a region so it works as a car brand too !, 
  and yet 50 % of the streets in every city are named after russian scientists , like gazov , ogrodov , kwiatov , etc , 
  the fanpage is n't calling to `` shoot all faggots '' , but to `` fuck rainbow profiles '' . 
  not sure if romantically or not . 
  no idea how extreme that profile was , but there are similar profiles like that every time something gets facebook ( or social media ) popular - you get people that are in `` fuck this particular fad '' mode , regardless whether it 's lgbt support , the pope , beer manufacturer creating branded country flags , drugs or politicians doing something crazy . 
  i was under impression it was en vogue during presidency of our late president . 
  that was funny as hell when politicians had to sweat out explanations of roman salute all the time :d, 
  whyyyy ? 
  are you still having winter ? 
  he will remove personal income tax , limit government involvement in economy , ban voting rights of everyone on government payroll and without jobs , limit bureaucracy and so on .

  but everything in the folder spelled luxury and shit seriously looked like paradise . 
  i wish i remembered what this island was tho :(, 
  i am unsure how `` exactly '' those programs work or what are the requirements for government to allow it , but i saw renderings of [ hollywood ] ( http://www.hollywoodcirclefl.com/ ) 's regional center and i read that fl is a super popular destination among chinese people ( 70 % or so ) , so there are more sites for sure . 
  i also saw a few eb-5 resort offers on smaller islands , but i always had a cognitive dissonance whenever someone talks about helping poor local areas boost employment and they offer an investment in almost a paradise like location next to a golf course . 
  kinda opposite of usual poverty stricken or underdeveloped eu regions that get special economic treatment . 
  this is correct . 
  even usa has such programs , one of the most popular is the eb-5 . 
  it requires an investment of $ 500k + and there are plenty of interesting opportunities ( hotels , resorts , so on ) , even in popular locations like florida 's south beach . 
  i just thought i 'd take a glance without proper eye protection and now i can barely see . 
  thank you internet . 
   if you really want to get down to it . 
  the largest part of prussia/east germany that got destroyed and ethnically cleansed is now in poland . 
  it all depends how far back in history you are willing to go - because the whole region changed ownership quite a lot . 
  can you elaborate about the other worries ? 
  was n't there an initiative to change czech republic name to czechia ?

  this is crazy steep . 
  i bet strava people wage total wars over king of the mountain achievement there . 
  not sure what your definition of `` full of '' is , but according to wikipedia - 11 high ranked military died , 4 of them with `` church related '' ranks/duties . 
  regardless , way too many important people on one plane . 
  sooo - blue oyster bar then ? 
  prolly a tea flavored big gulp of sugar water . 
  there is n't much in terms of negative feedback in the media , some minor drunk cases or waving upa flags , but nothing serious . 
  i 've heard old people complain or tell horror stories , but all i 've seen so far are hard working ukrainians doing jobs that poles hate ( delivery couriers , warehouse staff , graveyard shifts , all the usual minimum wage fun ) . 
  pretty much same thing as in uk - natives complaining about foreigners stealing their jobs , while at the same time - not wanting to work at any of them .

  it is quite fascinating how his parents failed to educate him . 
  perhaps they were similar , heh, 
  it is also a monumental range of topics that would consume the sub entirely forever . 
  if you are interested in history , r/askhistorians has [ a really cool and extensive faq ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/askhistorians/wiki/faq ) on almost every popular historical issue . 
  all weebs are nazi . 
  i knew it was a baaad idea from the moment i saw the first one . 
  europe has had so many scumbags over its history . 
  it is defined by them , really . 
   he simply outlasted his usefulness as a leader . 
  that 's usually the problem with many unelected leaders - even if they are decent people they simply burn out or run out of ideas , but with no mechanism to replace them they have to trudge on . 
  sometimes it is good as a violent dictator might mellow down after a while . 
  i do n't care , i have no respect for that fuckmuppet . 
  funny enough while `` polak '' is the native polish word for a pole , a phonetic english version `` polack '' used to be a slur in the us . 
  so yeah , depends on the usage . 
  i do n't know if poland is exactly pro-trump , though it is definitely much less anti . 
  on the side of the government , the ruling polish party shares many of the same proto-fascist reactionary sentiments as trump and rejecting what has until recently defined the western civilization and its liberal democracies . 
  but even they are not that happy about trump 's russian sympathies and were watching him closely today . 
  on the side of the populace , most people probably do n't care either way , as usual . 
  i do n't think trump exactly woos them , but they are not as averse to his sexism and racism as people in the west . 
  and he gets automatic points for being the us president . 
   many of us fear that trump will use poland to weaken us from the inside . 
  pis poland is already an anti-liberal trojan horse . 
  being further used in this manner by trump would not be at all surprising and would probably just hasten the inevitable showdown between them and western europe . 
  oh , oh right , * that * . 
  i get confused with all the nasty stuff i do . 
  damn , soros conspiracy foiled again . 
  i can insult him in better terms , if you wish . 
  yeah , first we save some seals then bam !, 
  gulags everywhere . 
  how do you get outsize outrage here ? 
  it was widely reported when he visited those countries , just like it is now . 
  many people dislike him wherever he goes , not just to poland . 
  starting points are different and homophobia relies on ancient cultural stances . 
  also , a state that says `` gays are n't bad lol '' will usually not persecute those who think otherwise . 
  i know , was talking about russia and china . 
  their atheism was state-enforced and did not arise from becoming more open minded over time , like it happened in the west . 
  you could have private cars in poland , they were just shit and not always easy to get . 
  i am simply opposed to judging ideas on the basis of zealous followers . 
  heh , practically every thing i might love or follow has some twats somewhere being obnoxious about how great it is . 
  does n't mean i should reject it due to simple contrarianism . 
  i mean , fuck erdogan , but that does n't mean we have to believe in every thing that sounds good , eh, 
   when somebody with zeal and enthusiasm tries changing your mind for some reason , this is time become suspicious . 
  this is a dangerous route , though , which can just as well lead someone to climate change denialism or anti-vaccination . 
  right , and you are just naturally logical and above it all, 
  that is why we ca n't into space , do n't want to encroach on lord 's domain . 
  things that are `` obvious to everyone '' are not actually obvious until credibly confirmed . 
  for every `` i knew it all along '' there are a few other assumptions or predictions that are completely misplaced . 
  yah ... good luck !, 
  while every country can always go to shit , it can always get better too . 
  turkey will , one day !, 
  the ball would be in the cherman court . 
  if they want to relocate migrants , they need to create mechanisms to ensure those relocated comply . 
  my bet would be biometrically scanning everyone and making most of any help contingent on them complying , as well as making it possible to deport them to countries that care for them . 
  this might help weed out people who are just opportunistic vs those who actually need help . 
  then again , some of them are screwed either way . 
  even if you are `` economic migrant '' from , say , afghanistan or eritrea , you probably have nothing to go back to anyway and end up stuck , like those crazy bastards in calais . 
  soooo , ee should not fear quotas as everyone will just pack and move to germoney again . 
  germans will not tell you to keep them imprisoned in camps surrounded by barbed-wire , lol, 
  but you just said in the previous comment that almost everyone who gets assigned leaves !, 
  no one will refuse to integrate if they are not there !, 
  sorry if i seem exasperated , but this is such a common sentiment in ee . 
  why would you even fear nukes ? 
  no one will launch nukes at you , because then you will launch your nukes and kill everybody . 
  nothing has changed , you wo n't be any safer unless you conquer the world or something . 
  so if they will just leave anyway , eastern europe should accept the plan without problems , right ? 
  there is a contradiction there - on one hand , all immigrants will leave , on the other , they will settle , multiply and sharia terror in 10 years . 
  there is just not much rationality in ee reactions to the issue . 
  it is not the same , but i have been following the situation in turkey and there are indeed some striking similarities . 
  then again , such authoritarianism is ancient , its just we kind of assumed , both in turkey and poland , that we left such bullshit in the past . 
  hahaha , first poles would have to even realize plc is seen as something bad and imperialistic by lithuanians . 
  for many years , many analysts have been saying - even during the last time pis was in power - that foreign policy was never their priority anyway . 
  most of it is just posturing for the domestic audience . 
  they do n't care imperialist dreams like intermarium are seen as silly by outsiders or even our would-be partners , they only care that their voters lap it up . 
  also leftism and homogay !, 
  was all that trolling worth so much karma ? 
  i bet it was !, 
  very nice . 
  movements in many countries are always a bit different , even if they claim ideological similarity . 
  however , pis is in many ways similar to both what lepen and trump represent . 
  they all share disdain for much of what used to be considered essential elements of western civilization . 
  secretly , we all do hate the germans though . 
  yeah , but that 's mostly regional disputes . 
  my point is china does not show much global ambition , apart from securing resources . 
   did you seriously think that was schnapps coming out of that tap ? 
  this is the future we should all be fighting for . 
  i usually know which thread will be a waste of time . 
  hopefully one day the world will wake up to the venetian menace . 
   tell that to china 's neighbors . 
  that 's still mostly regional politics . 
   as flawed as the us is , i 'll take them over china or russia for `` world dominance '' any day of the week . 
  i agree . 
  russia in particular is straight harmful in terms of what kinds of governance models they promote . 
  they can not be defeated without seeing mushroom clouds all over middle east . 
  the chinese are n't even interested in maintaining a world order , they generally look inward . 
  they do have a lot to manage , though , a billion people is no joke . 
  a serious oversight . 
  so far , it has faltered , we have a glimmer of hope . 
  mcconnell is a cunning bastard and he may yet turn the momentum , but so far it proves very hard to push through . 
  dude , you can attack any argument in this manner . 
  thank you for your sacrifice , i r smart , wo n't click it now .

  you support gay therapies and talk of `` homopropaganda '' . 
  just fuck off edit : i ca n't respond bellow since my other comments here are automatically deleted . 
  this sub went down to the shitter biggly there are lot 's of pis zealots that have these extreme views . 
  they even have their people in the parliament like pi\u0119ta . 
  what i presented is their mainstream , conservative parties in muslim countries like turkey or tunisia have exactly the same views on lgbt issues as pis https://wiadomosci.wp.pl/atak-polskich-homofobow-na-geja-w-berlinie-dzieki-polonii-udalo-sie-ich-zatrzymac-6116570420725377a polish chavs attack gay people regularly . 
  these are the same folks that want to defende europe from islamization . 
  cbos is a bullshiting government agency, 
  fun fact , it 's not only judges that work in courts !, 
  if you had any idea about the matter , you would know of judge 's assistants and others helping out . 
  there are much more of these lower ranked folks in western courts . 
  different countries have different systems, 
  do n't waste your breath , there is no talking with them . 
  these little people feed on hate, 
  would be nice to know what parties are counted as `` eurosceptic '', 
  former heads of supreme courts and constitutional tribunal as well as countless other academics , are racing each other to drop as much shit on pis and their authoritarian hate boner as possible and you 're going with an opinion of one professor ? 
  they are calling for immediate stopping of the , now passed , law, 
   the vast majority of poles support these changes + there are no different than what we see in western countries . 
   law and justice i mean , it 's right in their name / lame joke, 
  this is kinda funny in it 's grotesque way, 
  do n't give him any attention . 
  that 's what he wants, 
  b-but it 's cheap ?? 
  they very much do , but they are much more subtle than tvp, 
  germans do a lot . 
  it 's their favourite part of 20th century . 
  though i ca n't blame them , everyone wants to play victim in this game . 
  do n't, 
  needs more background explosions, 
  it was a condominium of both crown and lithuania courland was semi-independent though, 
  thumbnail already did, 
  me too / s :p no , but really , some folks in the land of blooming onion need to grow up and loss all of these nationalistic , racist and homophobic stuff . 
  it 's pathetic, 
  i do n't see much of it here . 
  not a single homophobic comment actually . 
  or is divorced, 
  p o t \u0118 \u017b n a p r z e m o w a, 
  petty nationalism \u2611 religious zeal \u2611 islamophobia \u2611 genocides \u2611, 
  my point still stands . 
  ee with small exceptions is not `` poor '', 
  then if you consider poland , estonia or hungary `` poor '' , you have to be a moron . 
  in terms of gdp per capita ee is where the west was 10-15 years ago . 
  was uk or germany poor in the year 2000 or 2005 ? 
  all of central european states have `` very high '' hdi for fucks sake, 
  define `` poor '', 
  but these are n't always direct translations right ? 
  there are some suffixes or vowels in the middle added ? 
  slimy arrogant cunt vs hateful old fuck !, 
  who won ? 
  who 's next ? 
  do n't speak for `` right wing people '' . 
  being a dumb homophobic cunt does n't make you right wing . 
  merkel is very much on the right . 
  and belive me , you 're not the first loony to play with `` he/she disagrees with me therfore he/she has to be a lefty '' card, 
  / r/polska is, 
  he does n't speak english . 
  what would you expect him to do ? 
  next time turkey should send someone more competent, 
  that `` somerset house '' is gorgeous, 
  that 's not what he said . 
  you 're trying too hard, 
  tell me about it, 
  oh i was just thinking about a polish `` scumbag '' . 
  this guy is just perfect, 
  where 's police ? 
  shoot to these fuckers with rubber bullets, 
   that polish undeground catch person like this and kill them beacsue of this . 
  like you know 0 tolerance for this was in polish society . 
  few executions were actually held and they were late with that order . 
  it 's a popular myth . 
  number of polish righteous among the nations is simmilar to the one of polish szmalcownicy ( people blackmailing and hunting jews ) , but szmalcownicy were far more efficient . 
  you wo n't hear about this on history lessons in poland, 
  this wo n't get upvoted here . 
  / r/europe is full of petty polish nationalists . 
  it 's an interesting article nonetheless, 
  how about you stay civil and do n't personally attack people ? 
  edit : i remember times when being a petty asshole did n't get you upvoted here, 
  na-ah , it 's beautiful : x,

  let it not be cpg grey , let it not be cpg grey ... kurwa how many times this pile manipulations has to be debunked so that people will stop posting it on reddit ? 
  he basically says that all of british revenue from tourism is made thanks to royal family . 
  he suggests that st. paul 's would cease to exist with queen 's abdication . 
  i feel like people who post this on reddit do n't even bother to watch it themselves, 
  how ? 
  by sitting on fancy chairs ? 
  profits they supposedly bring come from enterprises , that in republics are owned by the state . 
  monarchy is about tradition and symbolism , not money . 
  monarchs unify nations they serve , their role is priceless, 
  come on , st. paul 's and buckingham palace would stop attracting tourists without the queen ? 
  just as versailles stopped ? 
  this is a really crap argument , these sites would n't disapeer with monarchy gone . 
  haha that source though . 
  it 's like a news outlet managed by edgy 16 year olds,

  it is almost pure theoretical disscussion . 
  10 xi 1444 , the worse day of my life , 
  like gb ? 
  we will be interested in condition of that divorce . 
  poland do n't have might nor nobody seriuos in poland want to enforce that project so only willing countries would partycipate . 
  it is not idea for today but rather for tommorow if ( and it is big if ) situation change and eu will retreat from that place while russia do n't dominate it . 
  condition are rather restricting so no need to be extremally exited about this nonetheless poland is trying to be present in the region . 
  but it is activity not restricted to germany or france as they try to imply . 
  for me it is much ado about nothing . 
  good one . 
  of course eu do n't pretend to be empire ? 
  but it is good one because it suits germany and france ? 
  like reviving old empire ? 
  i would n't call it retarded just visionary  regarding turkey , from my pov you are sailing in just that direction and do n't see abstacles in near future which will divert you from that course . 
  how does it look from inside ? 
  beside both project have no chance in current situation but history did n't end and they could be answers for question not asked , yet . 
  but we do n't know what is planed for this part of the world . 
  commoners did n't expect fall of roman empire , austrohungarian empire , 3rd reich and soviet union . 
  european union is not the stablest project in history , either . 
   poland is a threat to russia are you ok ? 
   by being the usa 's faithful lapdog poland is creating some friction with it 's european neighbors . 
  it was n't problem with gb but with poland it is ? 
  more ger+fra bullying and more countries will look for support from outside eu . 
  i know , i live nearby but 2,5 k e is high in ee . 
  i wanted to know if that kind of money is country avarage or rather position specific . 
  this is bait to click busydoholandii.org it should be deleted . 
  do you care to elaborate ? 
  2,5 k eurs after taxes in slovakia ? 
  wow , slovakia really make a progress . 
  what do you do ? 
  maybe because the jews fled from all over europe from persecution to us ( 16th century ) where they had their golden age . 
  they lived here for many centuries , having better conditions than locals so quite contrary to this glorious western europe . 
  before world war ii poland was home to the largest diaspora in europe , and the percentage of jews in the whole population was the largest in the world ( probably because it was so bad here/s ) . 
  during the war the germans massacred them , but after the war , the germans and the jews were getting along . 
  after the war , the warriors for independence were proseciuted by the security apparatus with a huge overrepresentation of the jews . 
  taking all this into account , i would call them ungrateful , and talked more about the anti-polonism of the jews , and not vice versa but i am probably xenophobic . 
  ok , enough . 
  we got nothing to gain with dissccussion heading that way . 
  only our enemy got . 
  there are few threads which could be expand but it is not forum for that . 
  i wish you all the best in your duty , to gain the highest skill and no opportunity to use it . 
  whatever , i hope i will see you in thread about american constitution where you will be preaching new history and will try to convince them that their constitution was n't first . 
  but who am i kidding , you would n't dare to do that . 
  did you vote for po ? 
  modus operandi seems fitting , belittle your country and oppose everything what could be seen as positive about one . 
   taking into an account your attitude and more recent treatment of polish actors in lithuania ma\u017eeiki\u0173 nafta , discrymination of polish minority  it 's polish geopolitical goal to keep lithuania independent whether you like it or not . 
  your independence is mean not goal for us . 
  it is better to fight in lithuania then poland but when fighting could be more favorable for us in poland pragmatism is a way to go . 
  no reason to waste soldiers and equipment in uphill battles for which we receive only `` shitty gratitude '' . 
   then you 're free to leave nato and eu , good luck . 
  lol , lithuania will expel us ? 
  poles are megalomaniacs , looks like you were too long with us in one state . 
  for its time ? 
  hard to compare , first of its kind in europe and second in the world . 
  i was heavy participating in that thread . 
  do you mean me ? 
  i did n't expect anybody to celebrate . 
  i treated that as another card from calendar thing . 
  regardning constitution , is it soo much diffrent from parlaments threads ? 
  yet i do n't remember any negative remarks about them . 
   have a nice day . 
   it was a shitty deal sticking with you . 
  blunt but honest . 
  as you wrote , alt-history , we will never know what would be better . 
   it should be an no brainer we would side with next country that could help us against russia in future . 
  fair enough , we should be less romantic and more pragmatic . 
  we poles got valuable lesson from that . 
  taking into an account your attitude and more recent treatment of polish actors in lithuania we should not interfere with your independence in coming war with russia . 
  we got nothing to gain and you do n't want our involvement in your relation with moscow . 
  lesson learned . 
  `` we are prepared to help sort the conflict out '' australian way . 
  `` because at present all i hear is this desire to not do shit '' i provided you with exemples of our involvement and you still did n't provided similar for belgium . 
   and then you try to change the subject to 19th century colonialism . 
  it is not changing topic . 
  i present you reason why you got obligation or justification to act , if you will but we do n't . 
  you basicaly try to force us to pony up while we did n't take part in the party . 
  crazy bully basically . 
  something like that : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/prussian_homage but seriously , different times , different circumstances . 
  germany is proud and strong state dominating poland we do n't need another tool to play that melody . 
  as i wrote i got ambivalent feelings about that . 
  i do n't expect germany to act in this issue accordingly to polish feelings . 
  it would be retarded . 
  we got accute megalomania but not as much  i tried to wrote as selfless as possible but there are limits to my selflessness . 
  it is in our interest to not have germany 's army strong enough to be able easly conquer poland . 
  on the other hand there are feelings and there is long history of respect to well performing army in poland even not ours . 
   also you prevented us ? 
  us like janusz `` traitor '' radziwi\u0142\u0142 ? 
  considering that deluge was as devastating for gd as for crown do you really prefer barbaric swedes over `` peaceful '' poles ? 
  stupid question , i know  but more seriously , do you think lituanians would have better position in union with sweden then in plc , why ? 
  it was signed as effect of lithuania being conquered by sweden , i know that russian threat was real but was it really worth it ? 
   spam if you are n't interested in just do n't read it . 
   what , i 'm a nazi now ? 
  did i said that ? 
  btw , are you ? 
   i do n't allow freedom of speech because i consider these things annoying ? 
  i have no problem with you expressing your attitude . 
  i will just ignore it when it suits me . 
  1611 , enjoy . 
  `` hardcore polonization actually happened after napoleonic wars , when russia started russification . '', 
  as a counter balance to russian action but i can understand your sentiment about that much more .

yes . 
  being affraid of their nukes only makes them go further and further until they come to your home . 
  those troops will use existing bases that are now staffed with 30 % of their capacity . 
  so it only means relocation of troops and equipment ( still expensive , sure ) . 
  * in front of, 
  seconded . 
  there 's no better source of bushcraft knowledge than ray mears . 
  yeah , since the soviet union collapsed they have developed plenty of successful military products . 
  / s last week they said that they have 3 ebola vaccines in human trials , remember ? 
  have a cold glass of water please . 
  no one forces anyone to work . 
  and more demand for workers means higher wages . 
  no but the closer you get to capitalismt the more progress you get , the closer to communism , you first get stagnation and then recession . 
  i like eceonomic growth and freedom . 
  you may like being told what to spend your money on . 
  to each their own . 
  let me know which book i should read to get your point of view and you read my book . 
  wan na make that deal ? 
  he just took too much of the pis pills , chill out . 
   and for the record , we torture only terrorists and only in cooperation with uncle sam . 
  by the way - can we get our flag ? 
  it 's like ukrainian flag only upside down : http://szl.wikipedia.org/wiki/fana_g%c5%afrnygo_%c5%9al%c5%afnska, 
  no , i ( we ) just lived what you are describing . 
  it does n't work . 
  it never works , not even once in history . 
  sure , capitalism is n't perfect but no one ever came up with anything better ( that works ) . 
  yeah , what you 're suggesting is basically socialism/communism . 
  we 've tried that for 50 years and no thanks . 
  since we got rid of it 25 years ago we 've got the highest economic growth in all of our history happening right now . 
  i suggest you read free to choose by friedman . 
  if public owns `` stuff that generates income '' then this stuff gets stolen or broken as it 's `` no ones '' . 
  witnessed it many times over by living in communist and post-communist country , ca n't wrap my head around people still supporting this economic nonsense ( socialism/communism ) . 
  is this true or are you making a joke ? 
  have some sleep and stay positive !, 
  they 'll have a great time in rome , i 'm sure !, 
  goodnight , 
  chill out , it 's probably the safest route one can take . 
  plus , the amount of plane crashes is officially exhausted for like 10 years ... plus , italian and german pilots are awesome . 
  they 'll be fine , i 'm sure !, 
  the national budget got that money , not politicians . 
  where are the going ? 
  maybe there 's no reason to be alarmed ? 
  i 'm sure everything is going to be alright , mate , 
  or , you know , everyone can be racist . 
  you 're being downvored becasue you come across as someone who supports this slavery . 
  overcrowded cities or not , it 's not for you to decide for others . 
  incentives are good , slavery is bad . 
  well , question it as much as you want but other people are allowed to do as they please . 
  not as you please . 
  more of what you had the day before . 
  lots of hate on poland in the article . 
  furthermore , it just says `` it 's wrong '' repeatedly and does n't offer any alternative . 
  and it makes poland look like we 're a bunch of unsuccessful , always wrong and incompetent people . 
  that 's just not true . 
  we had an awesome transformation from communism to capitalism and saying that what we did wo n't work in eastern europe without backing it up with facts/analysis is shitty jounalism imo . 
  i honestly do n't get what the point of this article is other than hating . 
  op , what do you make of it ? 
  lots of people here so per capita it 's not as impressive . 
  it ' better to have more money than less . 
  i 'm sure this deal was consulted with other eu members . 
  plus , 100 million euro is n't really a super huge amount of money for a country our size . 
  soon in the news : moldova buys polish `` rosomak '' apcs and msbs rifles worth 100 million :d, 
  eu funds are n't given to the goverment to do as they please . 
  they are targeted at certain groups of people / local goverments and are thoroughly monitored . 
  you 're basically saying that every single net-recipent should do as the net-contributors say . 
  that is wrong on many reasons . 
  one day we 'll be net contributor too . 
  keep them coming !, 
  you are the most welcome here , 
  ca n't you make some changes to the constitution once in 50 years ? 
  why ? 
  thanks for that . 
  ok , noted . 
  thanks for clarification . 
  i simplified too much . 
  again , even if you think that `` those whites deserve it '' , it 's still racism . 
  call it what you want but it 's still racism . 
  we do . 
  we spend more of our gdp on military than any other country in europe . 
  and we spend these money wisely . 
  i do n't get your point . 
  no-one here wants to go to war . 
  we just want our allies to show rediness to help had the shtf . 
  edit : my bad , folks . 
  gdp bit is not true !, 
  we 're high on the list but not on top . 
  second paragraph still stands . 
  do they really take a dump this way ? 
  serious question . 
  how strong is the portugese army ? 
  and what is your opinion , would your army join us ( poland ) or baltic states had russia started a war with us ? 
  if you do n't want to support your own army , you 'll be supporting russian army . 
  until it collapses . 
  workers unions prevented shipyards from firing some of the staff or lowering wages so the shipyards bankrupted . 
  of course everything was blamed on the goverment rather than said unions . 
  however , this attitude changes now . 
  my generation ( i 'm born in 84 ) is much more reasonable and , let 's say , capitalistic . 
  we were n't raised in a communist country so we do n't expect the state to give us food , shelter etc. 
  grow up . 
  no one needs your bitching .

  right now there are few meaningful entities in the world ( sorted by gdp ) * eu * us * china * russia everything else is just a figure on a chess board . 
   the idea that the eu is the second most influential entity in the world is rather funny . 
  we 're out of cold war period for quite a while . 
  what decides about power in modern world is economy . 
  and eu got very powerful economy , even if it 's divided ( part of a reason why i 'd like to see eu even more united , preferably to the form of united states of europe - something that uk actively opposes ) . 
  there 's no veto in eu . 
  it 's not united paralyzed nations . 
   zomg the eu does n't want countries to secede from others , because ecb or something else !, 
  it 's more because they 're afraid of new spring of nations . 
  put yourself in a spanish perspective . 
  they will do anything they can to make life of independent scotland as difficult as possible for quite obvious reasons . 
  and then there are other countries with their own ethical minorities that either want or wanted international recognition . 
   that 'll mean they 'll be `` forced '' to drop the pound and adopt the euro , so far it 's not even certain if scotland will be allowed to keep pound . 
  there 's a large opposition to this idea in the uk . 
  so either they 'll have `` scottish pound '' ( or however they 'll decide to call it ) or negotiate with eu to get euro . 
   let 's be honest , independence would not bar any country from eu membership . 
  it 's not that obvious . 
  after all everything is about the law - how treaties should be applied to the new political entities . 
  i think general consensus for now is that scotland would have to negotiate it 's entry just like every other country does , only they can speed up the process by quite a bit ( eg . 
  instead of years we would have months ) . 
  but nothing is settled yet . 
  i guess they 'll get it on a table closer to the referendum . 
   fully joining the common european market it sounds like you think it 's something bad . 
   the ukrainian nationalists are going to be very pissed about this . 
  peace , or happy nationalists ? 
  that 's basically a choice that acting president got . 
   i think there is quite a chance we will leave . 
  yea , especially for uk which economy is mostly eu-dependent . 
  prepare for spain-level unemployment . 
  some companies already consider moving out from uk if it leaves eu ( nissan was the first big company to touch this topic ) . 
   the uk is a major economy in the world and the eu . 
  to be exact : it 's 7th . 
  germany is 5th , eu as a whole is 1st . 
  that 's according to international monetary fund and world bank ( two independent rankings ) . 
  that will drastically change if uk decides to leave eu . 
  even having a referendum on that is already decreasing interest of foreign investors in uk . 
  uk is attractive because of eu , not the other way around . 
  both supplement each other - the more uk is involved in european union the more it 's economy will be . 
  according to wikipedia : you are 4th largest contributor . 
  7th when you consider contribution per capita . 
  at the same time uk is 3rd largest country ( in population ) with 2nd highest gdp . 
  sounds like british contribution in deed is n't large . 
   it 's just a matter of political prioritizations that place the interest of the people above the interests of small groups of capitalists . 
  but ** that is magic ** . 
  very , very few countries in europe ( heck : in the freakin world ! ), 
  can do that . 
  ( oh , and before someone jumps on oil : tell me which country got as reasonable economic policy to exploiting their natural resources as norway ? 
  i do n't know any . 
  resource on itself is meaningless if there 's noone with long term thinking to manage profits from it . ), 
  it 's estimated that around 25 % of labor in spain is hired on a black market . 
  ( still does n't change the fact that there 's a high unemployment rate there - just not as high as official statistics show ), 
  sounds like * steve jobs act * ( you do n't translate names and surnames , so jobs act definitely got something to deal with steve  ) . 
  it does n't have anything to deal with kaczynski or tusk . 
  people got work before kaczynski got into power ( 2004 is when unemplyment starts going down , 2 years before elections ) and shit hit the fan soon after tusk tookover due to world-wide economical crisis . 
  that 's the major mistakes poles make in their national debate : totally forget about world-wide context ( no wonder anyway - news do n't say about anything outside of polish border unless there 's a war or someone is embargoing polish food exports - lol ), 
  might not be as good idea as you think . 
  part of the reasons why crimeans are so unhappy is because of new government 's pro-eu attitude . 
  bringing up eu pms will make it even harder for them to swallow . 
  let 's see first how the meeting between us , eu and russia will go . 
  if nothing changes - most likely some harsher action will occur - now even turkey seems to get involved ( they do n't want to see crimea back in russian hands just as much as kiev does n't ) so the situation is changing with each hour . 
  cluster bombs . 
  russian got a few of these . 
   is n't germany doing just that with wind turbines and solar power ? 
  germany is a leader in ecology . 
  poland is pushing for energetic independence - or rather : diversity . 
  two different , but complimentary , topics . 
   although that still leaves eastern europe dependant on russian natural resources . 
  not only eastern europe . 
  gas is used pretty much everywhere in heavy industry . 
  germany is one of the largest consumers in europe ( heck : they got their own direct pipeline to russia called nord stream ) . 
   when/how did poland warn the west about russia ? 
  genuine question , i 'm curious . 
  and since when would you like to know ? 
  it 's really , really complex , cause all depends on what level you 'd like to see it . 
  one of most recent events on a plane of economy was poland pushing for european energy policy and making eu more independent of russian gas and natural resources ( ie . 
  next to uk poland is most active in trying to get the shale gas extraction ) . 
  on more military-related topics : georgia and ( failed ) anti-missile shield come first into my mind . 
   is n't germany a `` russian expert '' , especially compared to other western nations like the uk and france ? 
  comparing to uk and france - most certainly they are . 
   though poland stayed in russian sphere of influence longer then germany and ... well : basically left half of germany never tasted communist vodka , 
  i was looking more from a perspective of someone who lives in uk , 
  there wo n't be a civil war . 
  if anything : war between ukraine and russia . 
  civil war might have happened year ago - but not now . 
  now ukraine is way too united . 
  and do n't get me wrong : most of poles , myself included , would like nato to defend ukraine . 
   if nato ca n't enforce the status quo , what use is nato ? 
  primary purpose of nato is to defend it 's own borders . 
  well , it does n't have that freedom either - there are various international treaties limiting that . 
  whatever eu is there or not . 
  uk really needs to learn that alone it 's next to meaningless in the world - with eu however it 's suddenly a part of the second most influential entity in the world . 
  whatever they 'll do - russian government will decline any involvement . 
  ( just imagine this sudden report of a raid on russian warehouse reporting few apcs , uniforms and weapons stolen ) . 
  fyi : that 's exactly what they do now - telling everyone that it 's just crimean militia . 
  do n't know why , but i find it really funny . 
   according to sociological research , around 20 percent of poles hold nationalist views . 
  define `` nationalist views '' . 
  i honestly doubt even 10 % sympathises with right wing nationalists in any way . 
   it ( pis ) is mildly nationalist and is against the introduction of the euro , but does not openly oppose the eu and can not be called xenophobic they are actively xenophobic supporting harsh anti-immigrant as well of anti-homosexual laws ( or at least : preventing them from gaining any recognition ) . 
  the same applies to the respect for other religions which is guaranteed by polish constitution maki  the small remaining right-wing electorate is targeted by other marginal parties , of which the national movement is just one .

  case in point . 
  bruh , alphabetical order please !, 
  you clearly do n't know what lgbt communities are going through . 
  enforcing lgbt laws eu-wide only serves to deepen bigotry and opposition to them . 
  their whole argument is that homosexuality is being pushed down their and their children 's throats . 
  to add to what / u/n1i2e3 said , he 's a great diplomat . 
  eu relations have been great when he was in office . 
  however a prime minister leaving for an eu office sucked the support out of his party , thus leaving room for pis to get power . 
  some unpopular moves made this leave for an eu office an escape from his failures or `` crimes '' alleged by pis . 
  not on board with either party , i like the guy , but i can never tell when he 's being honest and he often comes off as more pretty words than action . 
  it 's cause poland blocks motions to reform the posted workers directive . 
  not quite , there was no talk of alternative solutions on either side to my knowledge . 
  just a pig headed quota plan . 
  oh im not defending our lack of inaction in the crisis , merely the opposition to the quotas and the sanctions . 
  poland is not at fault at least for the latter one , as we always met nato goals . 
  the problem is that this is working one way . 
  theres plenty of things the west should be held responsible to the eu for but wo n't because they 're major members unlike us . 
  the lack of unified plan or anticipation is a eu-wide issue , not of east alone . 
  but we 're punished even though we never agreed to those obligations ? 
  we 're being dictated and blackmailed to pick up for the failures of the west , by the looks of it . 
  makes no sense to agree , not to mention the solution is utter shit that not even the refugees in question approve . 
  yeah there is no quick solution to these sort of issues . 
  the hurry is also harmful . 
  i get solidarity but being outvoted on a forceful measure that goes against the people and the refugees is no way to go around it . 
  this is not the way to solve the problem on any side . 
  i believe the problem is we did n't negotiate any alternative means to solve the problem other than forceful acceptance of quotas . 
  glad to see poland leading in * something * , 
  ca n't say the same for russia 's economy . 
  it makes sense as a diversion so there 's no united opposition , but to what , exactly ? 
  the fact i feel something coming from russia but do n't know what it is is a bit chilling . 
  this does n't sound right to me , i think it would be clearly obvious national politics went out of use since ww ii . 
  as you can see by crimea , it 's more trouble than its worth and i 'm sure putin is aware of that . 
  what lands ? 
  i mean i suppose you can make a case for finland or the baltics , but what about sweden ? 
  i 'm not sure what russia gets out of destabilizing the western world like that . 
  / r/eyebleach, 
  welfare , maybe . 
  citizenship , also . 
  but border control ? 
  just ask us . 
  yes , it can hurt your eyes and fry your brain . 
  i ai n't even mad . 
  bring some korean girls as well pls, 
  the difference is indistinguishable in practice , to me at least . 
  i would like to see the relevant statistics please . 
  we sorta do n't . 
  ukrainians on temporary work permits do n't apply , our immigration scale is miniscule ( 2-3 % ) . 
  in poland they mostly run small bazaars and asian cheap import clothing stores . 
  i do n't think i saw one vietnamese person in our uni 's, 
  overwhelming ? 
  it 'd be difficult to even meet the eu quota ( ~ 10k ) , refugees just would n't want to live here . 
  i just appreciate a separate category for kaliningrad . 
  in poland , we have patriot/quasi fascist manifestations and they 're largely tolerated by the local authorities dead to reds and whatnot ; i suppose it 's more `` ours '' though , and less so a cult-like organization like knights templar . 
  color me surprised , i thought hungary is ruled by a conservative government , thus giving some glancing tolerance towards such movements . 
  am i misinformed ? 
  progressive tax makes sense and is n't an issue as such ; i believe abolition of corporate taxes and striving towards least amount of types of taxes is a better approach . 
  reichtangle approves . 
  being a man , i suppose egalitarian is more proper term to use , but it does n't roll off the tongue so well as feminist . 
  i 'm speaking from personal experience , i 've a brother in states who was there for 10 years now , and while we 're both polish , we pretty much talk polglish instead . 
  i can see language being less of a factor defining culture and a rising shift towards language homogenization as time goes on ( as per sweden ) . 
  english is n't an influence of any country in particular , its just the easiest language to learn . 
  so , why no way ? 
  the trend appears to be visible to me at least . 
  about 30 years ago you would n't think english would be the most common language of europe to communicate , but here we are . 
  i wish he spoke in more concrete terms . 
  supporting offices , security efforts and victims is just common sense . 
  he almost nudged the topic of causes of terrorism but spoke of nothing specific . 
  on the other hand i can see the intent being uplifting and dissolving outrage rather than showing his plan . 
  hard arguments please . 
  devil 's advocate a bit , those are * not * the reasons , its fear of terrorism and cultural appropriation , not an influence of values . 
  i do n't think anyone defends this in poland , but nobody directly attacks it either besides feminists and the marginalized left wing that wishes to gain some traction ( no left in polish sejm ) . 
  its a relic of catholic upbringing and sign of its influence in poland . 
  that said it 's all shit , wish we were n't the asshole of europe as far as civil progress and secularization is concerned . 
  i ship this . 
  i somewhat get religion . 
  religion shaped national identity in religious countries and vice versa for non religious ones . 
  language , i also kind of get , even though for younger generations , native language is going slowly out of use and within one or two more generations we 'll likely see an english speaking europe . 
  at that point its only a tool of communication . 
  traditions and customs , though ? 
  which ones ? 
  how do you define traditions and customs ? 
  how are they distinct for each country and make you considered one of them ? 
  i 'm polish and there 's literally no polish-specific celebrations side for independence day and a couple of religious holidays noone but the devout catholic cares about ( except its free days which is nice ) . 
  how does one define that ? 
  likewise for uk , which i understand to be a culture shaped by its migrants . 
  is celebrating tea time and praising the queen enough as far as customs and celebrations go ? 
  where is the line ? 
  and it deserves it , 100 % . 
  i assumed they already did go full retard . 
  frankly , all of the countries that got defined by its migrants , not just uk . 
  uncontrolled immigration always is , ca n't blame that on migrants though . 
  pshh , why one wife ? 
  get four so you can dole out more babies at a time !, 
  in the end all will bask in the glory of our ~ ~ muslim ~ ~ catholic country !, 
  to be honest , common sense has n't been in high supply nor high in the agenda in this government . 
  yeah , per baby !, 
  rack up 50 babies and you 'll have a nice 5k euro salary !, 
  all sponsored by our taxpayers !, 
  correlation , not causation . 
  solutions to this are n't ever simple nor easy .

  i assure you , i am . 
  yes , and also some more dangerous ideas -- he actually wrote in his party program that he 's gon na ** delegalize ** law and justice ( pis ) . 
  while this seems unlikely , it surely is a bad sign . 
  also , he does n't have much background , and little is known of his motivation . 
  couple of years ago , he was running `` ozon '' magazine , that was clearly targeted at young pis supporters -- opposing abortion , mildly supporting church and `` traditional values '' , giving these issues `` a modern face '' . 
  he is one , great mystery . 
  we 'll see how this develops . 
  and i forgot to mention , that this guy has split off civic platform , after it 's chief , donald tusk , became tired of palikot 's scandals . 
  then he proceeded to form his own party . 
  civic platform is central-liberal party in poland , one of the few , if not the first that ruled full term . 
  their accomplishments are ongoing highway building-frenzy , effective use of eu funds , not buying swine flu vaccines , maintaining gdp growth entire time during financial crisis and not bailing out banks ( i do n't think polish banks even needed that ) . 
  second is law and justice ( pis ) , nationalist/socialist party with catholic overtones . 
  their rule , lasting for 2 years , ending 4 years ago accomplished reduced bureaucracy growth and tight control of the budget policy . 
  they also paved a road for effective use of eu funds . 
  they remain biggest polish opposing party . 
  third place is a surprise . 
  rpp ( palikot 's support movement ) is almost one man founded party . 
  janusz palikot is polish businessman and politician . 
  his party program is very liberal , focused on reducing bureaucracy and making entrepreneur 's life easier . 
  he is also aggresively anti-religious and focused on modernization . 
  he became known because of his scandalous press conferences , where he was presenting dildo to the crowd , and other time , a pig head . 
  i hope that this tells you something , if you want to learn anything about contemporary polish political scene . 
  ohh , i get it . 
  so it seems that polish word got exported to english . 
  nice . 
   edit : also , i fucking love kielbasa !, 
  also , post office and train companies . 
  also , backwardness . 
  only 60 % of people in . pl can actually use the internet . 
  is that a modern society ? 
  how is that comparable to american heavily online society or australian mostly atheist society ? 
  i do n't want to deal with religious , pre-information era people my whole life . 
  it 's incredibly tiring . 
  you 're talking about jews here :d poles has suffered for at most 300 years , beginning from 1700s , and for the furst 100 years only because they ruled themselves into this . 
  the rest is foreign interventions . 
  i do n't think so . 
  i thought that this thing was designed to let you into schengen zone on the normal rights . 
  at least that 's what they said on polish media . 
  it seems that plan failed and status quo continues . 
  i may be wrong , though , i have n't checked my facts , really . 
  i am the typical `` post-1989 generation '' pole  . 
  i drink beer and whisky and no vodka whatsoever , say `` kurwa '' even more often than this guy , live in a fairly big city , work programming job and go clubbing every now and then . 
  i am currently in progress of entirely losing my interest in politics , i have plans to emigrate to australia . 
  i think a lot of youngsters are that way . 
  conservatives of solidarity generation are pushing us out from this country as they are too hung up on their conservatism and ideological warfare to fucking modernize . 
  you have kielbasa too in bulgaria ? 
  cool . 
  is it your traditional kielbasa , or is it imported ? 
  because i even saw kielbasa in usa and uk store and i 'm pretty sure they import that from poland ( or make it the polish way ) . 
  i do n't think visa will be necessary . 
  you would be searched on your own border , though . 
  i am not particularly against romania and bulgaria joining schengen zone ( hell , a lot of people said the same things when poland was accessing it ) , but electing an anti-corruption party may help . 
  if it not helps with corruption itself , it will surely influence european politicians , and so it may hasten the process of you joining the schengen zone . 
  that 's just my idea . 
  how is this even possible for this man to be elected ? 
  i mean , there 's only so much shit you can hear about a politician and do n't care . 
  this guy has lost his entire credibility years ago . 
  and i only know about him from all the scandals he 's involved in . 
  wtf italy ? 
  i know the guy controls media , but really ? 
  what the fuck ? 
  why all other european countries wo n't accept germany 's economic model ? 
  it 's clearly the best . 
  i 'm from poland and i say : you all fucking do what germans tell you to do with your fiscal policy . 
  they have it all figured out . 
  and do it before they go mad and tear this beautiful union to shreds by not fucking paying : greek bureaucrats , french farmers , polish road builders and italian guidos . 
  yeah , achievement unlocked , piigs . 
  now instead of building world superpower in place of usa , and prolonging western civilization 's reign of the world , we 're going back to quarreling nation states . 
  go bow to your future chinese overlords . 
  you 've got a slovakian flag , you know better , neighbour . 
  a lot of people in europe consider poles thieves ... 
  although it 's not quite true assumption now , i think it was kind of justified some time in the past . 
  upvote for you . 
  perfect response , now my rant looks kind of stupid . 
  comes from an american , who , because of his nations military strength and high gdp can travel around the world without visa . 
  you know what ? 
  i could n't travel to us and compare it to europe , because my country is a poor shithole and the us does n't allow people from shitholes through it 's borders . 
  as a citizen of federal europe , the us goverment ( or any institution of the world ) would have no opportunity to differentiate between me and any birt/german/french , which i consider awesome . 
  also , no one said anything about unifying law across europe . 
  actually , that 's what wrong with todays eu -- too much stupid , centralized , economic law . 
  every country should be able to set it 's own law , like today . 
  but things like military , currency , foreign policies should be controlled paneuropeanly . 
  if you lived in spain , you should know , that there are differences of the same magnitude between spaniards themselves . 
  an englishmen gets spaniard as well as basqe person does , or catalonian . 
  well , maybe slightly less , because these two nationalities live nearby for ages , but mechanism is the same . 
  and the state says it 's perfectly capable of maintaining these ethnic groups in itself . 
  no one argues . 
  it 's the same in the uk with scots , welsh , irish and english , but easier , because they speak the same language now . 
  it is like that in many countries , including my home country , poland , where we have significant minorities of silesian people with their language ( this group gained their national consciousness fairly recently , but there are people , who speak only in silesian ... hardly understandable by any pole ) , kashubs and so on . 
  i ca n't see a reason why such minor cultural differences would n't work well at a higher tier of eu and nations , instead of a one state and `` minorities '' . 
  why i 'm in favor of a federation ? 
  it is simple . 
  i come from a country that benefits from the eu . 
  we get our infrastructure built for eu cash and make use of convergence policy . 
  i think it 's great as it is direct money pump into our economy . 
  but that is just a case for newer eu member , probably a german or a brit is kind of less amazed by that . 
  but they get new markets for their companies . 
  vast markets , where western european companies outcompete everyone else in terms of quality and price . 
  it 's instant money making . 
  and convergence is the price you pay for your high salary jobs in multinational companies of germany , france and the uk .

  we have this discussion in eu - about what will lay ahead and whatever it 'll be federalization or not - for last few years . 
  do n't show typical american ignorance . 
  eu wo n't be doomed if it wo n't change into a federation - there are many alternative scenarios , like a deeply integrated confederation , forming an unitary state ( basically : goes even further than a federation ) , or pursuing only economical union , while in every other respect remaining as they are today . 
  and that 's just a beginning - there are many more ideas that take bits from a different types of governments . 
  eu is not usa . 
  scenarios from us wo n't work in eu . 
  stop thinking in silly absolutes . 
  let 's not be so ignorant please . 
  [ google shall give you many more alternative scenarios ] ( https://www.google.com/search?q=future+of+eu ) . 
  now that 's something !, 
   these states were the equivalent of european countries . 
  so were parts of the germany . 
  and to make it more funny : germany unified later on than usa did . 
  and some of them are more powerful than some of the states in usa . 
  you want to try china than ? 
  a rising superpower ? 
  or russia - a former superpower ? 
  i 'm 100 % certain i would n't be able to locate all of the european nations . 
  i 'm not even sure if i heard about all of them in a first place i doubt there 's a single person on this reddit that could list all of the european nations from a memory , yet alone locate them . 
  again : * nations \u2260 countries * administrative division of a country \u2260 countries, 
  yep . 
  you still keep on going offtopic . 
  we 're not discussing an impact on legislation . 
  we talking about percentage of laws that came from brussels . 
  these two are linked ( number of laws that come directly from eu is just a part of overall impact eu has on a legislation ) , and impact of legislation is more important for the author of this article , but it changes exactly nothing to the fact that '' \u201975 percent to 80 percent of laws are made by eu institutions '' is complete bs with number taken out of nowhere . 
  will be or wo n't be . 
  nothing is certain yet . 
  eu will evolve , but there are many different paths than federalization . 
  us might collapse at some point in future . 
  it does n't change a thing . 
   none of the europeans ones . 
  sure you can . 
  just think about it . 
  ... ok , so here is one : scotland . 
  yes , it 's not labelled `` state '' but it is a part of an administrative division of an european country . 
  and i 'm certain you 'd list quite a few more after thinking about it , 
  already posted : http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/22ijgp/the_polish_soldier_who_snuck_into_auschwitz/, 
  `` true impact '' is an extremely subjective term . 
  i just called on what the lady said . 
  it was n't truth , and , from purely objective statistic - it 's not . 
  i think you imagined that i 'm arguing about something i never even mentioned . 
  if not - please , show your numbers . 
   the difference being that each state was , in the past , the equivalent of a member of the european union that past was long before i was born , or even : before my grand-grand mother was born . 
  germany was also made of small countries that later unified into one very long ago . 
  i do n't care to know where each one of them is either . 
  unification of usa into a single country : 1788 unification of germany into a single county : 1871 ( and than again in 1990 but that 's irrelevant to this example ) so you see - last time germany was made of separate countries happened to be much later than when usa was yet noone is asking me about the location of bavaria . 
   so when people are telling me `` fuck man , americas are retarded they ca n't name loads of the states in europe '' , well , neither can we do the same for them . 
  there is no relation between these two situations . 
  * in one you have administrative division of a single country . 
  * in the other one you have different countries . 
  these are vastly different . 
  each one ? 
  certainly not . 
  i also would n't be able to pinpoint all lands in germany , or oblasts and republics in russian federation . 
  still though i would be able to show at least 5 of them , which is more than i would in russia or germany - quite impressive considering that poland neighbours with both of these countries and i never even been in us . 
   does the eu have the natural resources ? 
  yep . 
  quite a lot of them . 
  right now coal , and north sea gas ( + to a degree crude oil ) are most widely used eu resources in energy production . 
  eu also mines uranium but it 's barely anything to satisfy the needs ( only 3 % of eu needs are satisfied by mining within it 's territory ) . 
  in longer perspective shale gas will play an important role . 
   what are the potential difficulties ? 
  costs . 
  that 's the major real obstacle right now . 
  eu could supply itself with energy from renewables , nuclear and coal powerplants in 100 % . 
  but we 're very much dependent on gas because it 's cheap and there 's plenty of infrastructure ready for it . 
  then there 's politics , especially the fact that corporations like gazprom have relatively strong lobby everywhere around eu . 
  in a very long term perspective there 's also [ iter ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/iter ) and [ thorium reactors ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/thorium_fuel_cycle ) but for now the will to develop these projects is rather underwhelming ( there 's pretty much nothing done about thorium and iter is suffering from constant delays and whatever technology will be developed into anything more serious is still under a question mark ), 
  duplicate : http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/22i1r2/eu_top_court_rules_eu_data_retention_law_invalid/, 
   reverse flows technically possible afaik it already happened during last crisis . 
  germany pumped gas to ukraine . 
  so it 's not just theoretical possibility . 
   gazprom has raised legal doubts over reverse flows did n't gazprom said that it 's straight on illegal because contracts they signed forbid resale ? 
  i seen one of the gazprom representatives saying something along these lines in the news . 
  yep . 
  i agree with pretty much everything said in that quote . 
  if you are trying to make a counter-argument to what i said there i must be missing it . 
  source ? 
  everyone are better in that . 
  lol, 
  hopefully in a from that respects private life . 
  most of the plugs from that wikipedia page are cross-compatybile amd some features are purely optional . 
  sir , you made an intelligent answer to a troll post . 
  do n't feed the trolls . 
  `` a bit '' - i see what you did here !, 
  tv translation time !, 
  yea , this article is ful of bollocks . 
  the fact that words translate differently depending on a context ( one word has multiple meanings ) or that sometimes one word gets translated into two ( or more ) is rather common , regardless of the combination of languages . 
  if you have sleed = \u015bnieg z deszczem then you also have prze\u015bcierad\u0142o = bed sheet . 
  and 3 summers ago could be translated either to `` 3 pory letnie temu '' or in more casual way `` latem 3 lata temu '' ( that might vary depending on a context ) , but in general sense `` 3 lata temu '' is an aceptable translation , as whatever you meant `` summers '' or `` years '' will come out from context . 
  just like `` czy widzisz ten d\u017awig '' translated to `` do you see that crane '' is meaningless without a context for english-speaking person ( is it a bird i 'm looking at , or not ? ), 
  `` the '' is something that most of the european languages do n't have . 
  you sir , just won all of the arguments in that topic !, 
  hehe  fair enough  we 're getting into way too subjective topics to argue about them , 
  all what i claimed is under links provided . 
  you just need to read it . 
   she says at least 75 % of all eu countries laws come from brussels . 
  i dare to call that bs . 
  [ here ] ( http://www.jcm.org.uk/blog/2009/06/what-percentage-of-laws-come-from-the-eu/ )  the house of commons library has published a new , much more comprehensive study of the percentage of uk laws that originate from the eu . 
  it is freely available as a pdf and despite running to 59 pages i 'd strongly recommend reading it in full .

  whats humiliating about them ? 
  i agree it should be legal and will vote for the party that has this on their agenda , but being happy because dutchies with drones ignore our laws is just stupid . 
  also , when you write `` butthurt ? '', 
  to me you look like a fucking idiot . 
  lol at leftists thinking this is a great thing . 
  it 's against the law here for a reason , most of poles are against it . 
  would you people be so happy if the american nra started dropping guns to europe via balloons , because they believe guns are a human right ? 
  why ? 
  asian neighbourhoods are completely normal . 
  go to a polish neighborhood in chicago and nothing 's gon na happen . 
  but when muslims ca n't behave , form shitty ghettos and fuck around with sharia patrols and whatnot it 's suddenly the white man 's fault again . 
  the west just ca n't win , can it ? 
  what do you want me to prove ? 
  avg wage in poland is 3 982pln as of today , so 953eur . 
  i imagine it 's less in baltic countries . 
  good enough for you ? 
  wan na take those downvotes back now ? 
  yes ? 
  are you people so disconnected from reality that you do n't realise this is the norm in poland , latvia , lithuania , romania etc etc. . . ? 
  that 's exactly what i made for a year after my university , plenty of the polish live at this level their entire lives . 
  and yet we pay our debts , we have to . 
  are you also going to cry about my ( and my peoples ) poor fate ? 
  ridiculous . 
  i doubt you know what hunger is if you consider one thousand euros to be a hunger wage ... 
  ca n't afford food ? 
  what are you on about ? 
  their average wages are still higher than most of eastern europe , and so is their purchasing power . 
  come on now . 
  also , you replied to a question but did n't answer it , what 's the deal with that ? 
  should n't have lived beyond your means then i suppose ? 
  say if i get a mortgage on a big luxury house , and then lose my job , are you gon na bail me out ? 
  yet purchasing power is still higher or comparable to most of eastern europe , is n't it ? 
  how do they pay their debts in romania , must be a miracle or something ... ? 
  oh no hungry greeks , just a thousand euro a month !, 
  only a thousand , how can they live like this, 
  remind yourself this when your comfortable office job gets outsourced to india or bangladesh . 
  sure , absolutely , everyone should have studied it to be a cheap outsourcing corpo-drone . 
  fuck all the people working hard their entire lives unable to make a living , they should have just gone to a top university in a big city and there would be no problem !, 
  also you have to give the government all your personal details in order to even use a cellphone , even if it 's prepaid . 
   it 's fucked . 
  i have nothing against lgbt people , but someone please explain to me why poland should give katherine 's daughter citizenship ? 
  it 's not to be given out like candy just because some lady points to a kid and says ` ill be her second mom from now on ' . 
  right , poland definitely is not a post-soviet country . 
  i 'm done arguing . 
  what ? 
  yes he is , by definition : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/business_oligarch, 
  also , sikorski planned to be minister of energetics specifically to be able to look out after his oligarch friend 's business matters . 
  no , the guy gives you a shitty whitewashed explanation and you buy it . 
  people are trying to explain and they get downvoted . 
  this is just not a good place for discussion . 
  what 's so controversial about the first quote ? 
  the leaders of ukraine openly talk about bandera being a hero of the ukrainian people . 
  they give speeches in front of upa flags . 
  the world is not black and white . 
  turns out reading / r/europe does not exclude you being unable to find legit sources and see through a silly fucking joke, 
  exactly - instead just keep appeasing them , seems to work great so far . 
  go to paris , next to the eiffel tower . 
  plenty of working gypsies there . 
  you do n't have to look , they 'll approach you first . 
  wiser men have tried and yet none succeeded . 
  at this point you just figure that maybe it ca n't be done . 
   no one likes nomadic cultures in modern societies . 
  right . 
  it 's not because they steal , run scams , pickpocket and refuse to work and integrate . 
  it 's because no one likes `` nomadic cultures '' in modern societies . 
  makes perfect sense . 
  so i ca n't be anti-gun either , because there 's very few guns here ? 
  think long and hard about what you 're trying to say . 
  edit * aaand immediately downvoted . 
  :-d thanks !, 
  so europe was literally the nearest location these ` refugees ' could safely go to ? 
  that 's nothing , the local refugee center is full of nigerians . 
  apparently the richest country in africa is still not safe enough . 
  we 're ... filthy ? 
  the fuck are you even talking about ? 
  that was my money . 
  you do n't get to say what i should or should n't spend it on . 
  the whole thing was theft , plain and simple . 
  what exactly is the european dream , what is he talking about ? 
  dude are you really asking if having 4 beers a day is not normal ? 
  you worked with them in the netherlands though , correct ? 
  it 's just my anecdotal evidence , i was in the netherlands numerous times and was surprised at the amount of fat people i had seen . 
  it 's hard for me to believe you score lower than germany and poland , all you have to do is go to a random city in those countries and compare results , you 'll see for yourself . 
  there 's no way in hell the netherlands has a lower index than poland, 
  how can you undermine the authority of a migration expert , the guy specializing in migranty things !, 
  oh yes , the joke was very inappropriate and offending , it literally triggered me , shitlord op should check his privilege asap . 
  the turkish guy above did n't get offended from a silly joke , yet you donkeys are up in arms with your pc crap already . 
  ever wonder why people find you annoying ? 
   eu member-states are avoiding their responsibility  avoiding their responsibility  responsibility, 
  no , but it makes your question stupid . 
  are you confused about what the president does ? 
  do you want a photo of him signing the mentioned legistature , thus allowing them to become law ? 
  i remember , the pis government actually lowered my taxes . 
  also , they did not steal my ofe funds . 
  overall quite happy with how they ruled economy wise . 
  why did n't you mention the fact that komorowski did nothing to stop raising your taxes , making your retirement further away and stealing your retirement ofe funds ? 
  is it because you 're still in school and not working ? 
  him making `` gaffes '' is the least of my concerns . 
  did you learn in school about ronald reagan ? 
  do you know who he was before he was elected president of the united states ?

  british foreign relations on the other hand ... well , now there wo n't be any doubts who to blame , so there 's the plus . 
  may is a clever politician , giving brexiters some responsibility so that in need she could fall back and scorch the earth . 
  thanks for your explanation . 
  i would n't guess . 
  point being : states are not some nearly-ethernal entities with centuries and centuries of existence , be all and end all . 
  they are created much like national identity is . 
  while eu is not a country and currently people in the eu do n't want it to become one - who are we to tell that eventually people wo n't identify with it much like we identify with our current nations , and tribes in northern finland identified with themselves just 3 centuries ago . 
  of course . 
  neither was finland until 19th century ( or 1907 if you want to count the year when it became a proper , independent state ) . 
  it 's one of the youngest countries in europe . 
  saudi arabia purchased 388 french leclerc tanks . 
  wait ... no ... that 's not what he means , is it ? 
  generally it is n't in the interest of a nation to disband the eu either . 
  eu is not there for the `` sake of eu '' - if you think than then you are the one grossly missing the point , not just of this conversation , but of the entire political system that exists in europe . 
  and yes , union does serve the interests of citizens , only problem is that majority of the people , yourself included , do n't really know in which ways it does , and often various national issues are blamed on eu , even if eu as such had absolutely nothing to deal with them . 
  i am much more concerned about national governments not serving the interests of people than the eu . 
  eu has rather good track record in doing what their little power they have allows them to do , on the other hand national governments decide pretty much everything while at the same time after recent elections i ended up with a bunch of incompetent idiots . 
  that 's really wild speculation . 
  the reality is that finns voted 57 % to join the union , with 71 % turnout , giving this decision a very strong democratic mandate . 
  objectively you might be right , but for some people ( eg . 
  national conservatives ) these bounds are incomparably stronger . 
  the interest of the citizens of the regions in finland should come first . 
  the finland as an organisation ought to be completely expendable , and disbanded if deemed to not be a benefit for the citizens . 
  calling others `` idiots '' or `` eu propaganda '' wo n't change the reality . 
  and the reality is that this state of uncertainty hurts both : british and eu economy , and it 's not just `` some bankers '' that are affected by it , but numerous people , from scientists , to small companies looking beyond domestic markets . 
  junckers reaction is perfectly appropriate . 
  european ... 
  good 1/3 of the posts here give me headache . 
  how difficult it is to use [ google ] ( http://lmgtfy.com/?q=juncker+political+career ) before posting bs like '' * he was never leader of anything * '' ? 
  jesus , that anti-intellectualism is getting out of hand . 
  and it 's not like you are etching these words in a stone on a desert - you are using internet , answers to basics like that are seconds away . 
  you want to see rocket launch ? 
  read further down :  industrial output during the year rose by a record ** 97.8 ** per cent . 
  yep . 
  the scale of shifts is unprecedented , with some of the most notable journalists fired during last months having more than 8 years working in tvp ( 8 years was the time previous government was in power ) . 
  this whole narration of `` it happened during every previous government '' is precisely one of the government propaganda machines working hard to justify their actions even though it has little to deal with facts . 
  there . 
  nailed it . 
  and it 's not just media - same with politicians ( \\* cough \\* ukip \\* cough \\* ) . 
  i think they can hold one as soon as article 50 is invoked . 
  waiting till uk leaves the eu would be an economic suicide . 
  the major advantage of separation would be to avoid the sinking boat syndrome , hopefully luring a lot of companies from england to scotland . 
  not to mention that they wo n't have to waste time on negotiations that eventually wo n't apply to them . 
  what that damage would be ? 
  pretty much the only bad thing i can imagine is if border would be shut and england would put tariffs on everything from scotland . 
  and that 's extremely unlikely to happen . 
  in any other scenario it 'd be only beneficial for scotland , at least as far as economy goes + most of the arguments #leave camp used during their campaign ( with notable highlight being '' * this is ours independence day !, 
  * '' haha ), 
  there are no loopholes being used and noone is * forced * to work towards euro nor anyone is * forced * to take it when they are eligible . 
  it 's all up to national parliaments . 
  we are obligated to join eurozone * eventually * but there is nothing eurozone can do to * force * anything you talk about . 
  they can be in schengen and have a bilateral agreement with uk no to have a * hard border * , as you called it . 
  one does n't exclude another . 
  schengen would be applicable only to scottish citizens , not british . 
  thank you for sharing . 
  i 'm sure there 's few more languages than just polish using it , just did n't wanted to shoot in blind . 
  english used in eu parliament is already rich in a vocabulary that 's a mix of words borrowed from various languages , often making it far more consistent with the continental languages than british english is . 
  to give you an example - using `` actual '' for * current * ( as in current events ) is fairly common in eu parliment as it derives from words used in continental languages ( in polish it 's aktualny ) , while it 's not even a thing in * proper * english . 
  [ here ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/translation/english/guidelines/documents/misused_english_terminology_eu_publications_en.pdf ) you can find more examples of words that are being used in eu parliament english but are incorrect in british or american english . 
  i would n't be surprised if eventually eu would have its own english , recognized by the international community , much like india does . 
  english evolves for the needs of people faster on the continent , with fewer native speakers , than it does in uk or us . 
  and after all that 's what it is all about - language is there to serve people in communicating with each other . 
   it 's quite rare never heard it being used in poland aside from people of making fun of czech . 
  slow news day ? 
  before ww2 poland was 2/3 roman catholic polish , now it 's like 91 % . 
  in deed , massive change . 
  only in a different direction than you think it is, 
  less visible over time ? 
  i 've been tracking eu politics since poland joined the union and have exactly opposite impression . 
  i assure you that 5 years ago you and most of the people upvoting your comment did n't even have any idea what epp is . 
  there 's been a huge increase in visibility and prominence of the eu parties during last election cycle . 
  it 's off the scale . 
  no idea how you came up with * less visible * . 
  and yet it 's exposed in most of the newsstands as if it 'd be one of the bestsellers in a country . 
  these screaming covers are clearly the way to go - even if people wo n't buy it , they 'll still see the message . 
  the more often they see content like that the more familiar and acceptable it becomes . 
  spotted a hidden german option !, 
  and yet this government managed to surge biggest protest since the fall of communism in poland . 
  quite amazing if you think about it . 
  you 're just repeating their propaganda . 
  i do n't know if you noticed , but majority of the journalists * replaced * were working for tvp much longer than last 8 years , some started their careers right after the fall of communism . 
  it 's not true that every time a new party wins they replace most of the crew , that 's something unique to this cadence of pis . 
  while the last time they won elections was also a record-breaking in terms of journalists fired - it was n't anywhere near the * purge * we 've seen this time . 
   they take our council houses - but let 's not build affordable housing . 
  to be fair - abusing the system of council housing was surprisingly common few years back . 
  but they reformed the system and now it 's fairly tight . 
  * poles - helping solve the holes in council housing system since 2004 . 
  *  they fill our hospital beds - but let 's ignore the thousands of qualified healthcare professionals from the eu who work in the nhs and the hundreds of thousands of uk emigrants and retirees enjoying free reciprocal healthcare around europe . 
  the better argument is that statistically - poles pay in far more to the nhs than they take out . 
  you have to remember that polish immigrants are usually in prime of their age - they rarely get sick , older people usually are back in poland , and poles tend to keep their kids at home and help them on their own instead of going to the doctor on every opportunity . 
  not to mention rather negative opinion about nhs among polish immigrants , even if adults do get sick - they are very likely going to go back to poland and pay a private doctor there instead of opting for nhs . 
  from top-25 news during last year : 15 imgur , 6 english-speaking , 1 nl , 1 de , 1 be + 1 i.redd.it, 
  well , there 's [ * what happened in your country this week ? 
  * ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4qz95o/what_happened_in_your_country_this_week_20160703/?st=iqdvigmq&amp;sh=74f823b4 ) , so at least we have some good stuff going on ... though i miss the times when people posted and entire paragraphs of news from their country ... 
  skip to last paragraph for tl ; dr , meanwhile , a summary of the article : a chechen family found refugee in eastern poland , got their entry doors covered in gasoline and ignited . 
  since the beginning they were a subject of racist attacks . 
  they say that when they go shopping people harass them , say stuff like '' * poland for the poles , and you , gypsies , get the fuck out to your country * '' , husband was attacked by a man with broken bottle , but managed to escape before any harm happened . 
  even their neighbours do n't let them live in peace , with one of them commenting to the newspaper : '' * it 's their fault . 
  ever since they came in there is no peace . 
  previously , there were no such comedy * '' ( pardon my rough translation of the quotes ) they report that there is no week without attacks on the family , on several occasions a groups of skins attacked them with bottles and gas , once they stole their shopping .

  are sure ? 
  i mean its controlled and spied alot more then in for example the us . 
  bloggers/vloggers/people with an internet following of over a certain number have to sign a document that makes them swear that they will never spread propaganda about russia and its plans , they are not allowed to post lies , they can not socialize on most websites with people out of russia etc. 
  probably , they 're russian . 
  wait , russia slutty women are polluting our clean beautiful country ?!, 
  quick save the wodka and pierogis and lets hide in the tatry o.o, 
  latvia , romania , ukraine and turkey are just too good < 3 xd, 
  well they 're kinda slutty sometimes : /, 
  eeeeyyy , or atractive people . 
  or any good internet . 
  or anything european . 
  shame , they 're all out of apples . 
  wow the ruskies are n't even trying anymore ... 
  is it even milk ? 
  or is like some sort of water with a power or something ? 
  thank you for correcting me . 
  well i would n't blame them if they wanted to change it to this . 
  after living in the uk for 9 or so years i 've come to learn no one likes the queen and she does nothing ... 
  it ai n't a party till you sit in your own vomit whilst vomiting on your crotch . 
  its more like fifty shades of eastern europe . 
  our countries are not used to this at all ( well the czech rep. is being a bit mean , who writes numbers on peoples arms anymore ? 
  he wanted to give the serb minority more rights , which nobody agreed with . 
  they all want to go to the countries that give out a lot of benefits ( germany , uk and sweden ) . 
  i understand that its not fair for only those 3 countries to take all the refugees , but come on do n't force them to go to countries were they will be so un-wanted and hated . 
  they traveled through hell and then they could get placed in more hell , let them go to the destination they want to go to and where they see fit and when the us defeats isis or whoever or the situation in syria somehow gets better they will go back to their homelands or stay in europe and become european citizens and travel throughout the countries . 
  can someone kick kopacz out of office i do n't like her : /, 
  fuck yea we are !, 
  * party popper *, 
  it was my duty as a pole to subscribe to this . 
  oh my holy jan pawel best mlg videos 2k15 420/10 . 
  you know poland is pissed if they start burning the god damn eu flag . 
  eastern european countries do these marches because they see what radical muslims have done to the western countries . 
  not all muslims are bad we know this , but among the good there are always large quantities of radicalized muslims . 
  eastern european countries have gone though a lot and they do n't want terrorist attacks in their countries . 
  you can classify it as racism but personally i do n't classify this as racism ... 
  probably in the making right now . 
  i mean , its better then knowing your son is dead . 
  personally , when the people on the roof are shown , no it looks legit . 
  not all of them . 
  and they were not polish citizens they were ukrainians who 's ancestors were polish . 
  i do n't get it . 
  dude i did n't get winnie the pooh at my first day that 's not fair ; e ;, 
  that 's just beautiful .

  god damn  . , 
  maybe he was apart of / r/europe ? 
  i like that guy :d, 
  all this migrant and refugee stuff made me forget what immigration is and shit , forget everything i said im too damn confused and i just realized what they 're protesting about ... 
  but . . ukrainians are cool . 
  im so damn confused about the migrate crisis when it comes to poland . 
  i see articles like `` 54 % of people in polish believe it is their duty to help the migrants '' and now they 're protesting and shit . 
  i mean they 're christian calm down no mosques will be built . 
  oh kurwa that 's a lot of people . 
  just like , ignore them trying to convert you and learn polish and you 'll be good . 
  they also avoid romania and anything that is not germany or sweden . 
  go to that place those guys ran away from they have a free room now . 
  no but seriously . 
  if i were running away from war and got put in a country of my religion , given a house for my family and a job , i 'd probably go as far as selling my soul to that person . 
  yea ikr . 
  may i just say , they 're ungrateful bastards . 
  pardon my caps but why would you ask korwin mikke for his opinion ? 
  why ask him anything ? 
  he 's insane . 
  5 seconds in , his pecks are moving . 
  i mean , the guy 's got a point . 
  if only someone invested in eastern poland we 'd be blue ... 
  aparently that shit ai n't even edible . 
  is it finland or iceland that has canned rotten fish and fish fermented in lye ? 
  that actually a good point . 
  agreed . 
  europe is a very complicated place , i just want this shit to finish . 
  because europe does not want refugees either so why does america take all the good ones and europe gets left with the rest ? 
  im saying america best not be a huge useless cunt . 
  if the us actually does such a thing im turning russian . 
  i do n't know , it just confuses me ... 
  i was actually wondering about this few days ago . 
  this video explained nothing . 
  but i do n't want to : /, 
  how do you hate cabbage ? 
  shhhhhhhhh  . , 
  dude how do you not like golompki . 
  this was posted here a really long time ago : /, 
  ooooooh , nooooooo ... 
  horrible ... did the smugglers think that people are bricks or something ? 
  that they do n't need room or any human right ? 
  this migrant crisis has to be sorted in a civil way , a country could volunteer to take migrants in by sending planes or boats to the country where migrants come from ( mostly syria , they could be picked up for humanitarian camps or so ) and flown over to the country that volunteers . 
  everyone deserves to live in peace . 
  but sadly its not that easy ... 
  last time i checked krakow is polish . 
  yea . . i do think about this non-stop . 
  but its a lot more complicated than just `` war happened , give them a home '' ... 
  i mean immigrants and cool , i am one ( i live in the uk plz do n't kill me ) but immigrants turn uncool when they say they 'll kill anybody who is not on their side . 
  i think its origin . 
  poland and slovakia are both saying that muslim refugees would not feel welcome or at home in poland nor slovakia ( even less in slovakia because they have no mosques ) so poland is only taking christian refugees to not cause further religious conflicts between migrants in the west ( eg muslims killing the christian refugees / taking the located places ) . 
  'cause ` mericans . 
  i play a lot of the game counter strike : global offensive and in that community the swedish are seen as one of the best players ( just like us poles ) . 
  i watch this swedish streamer on twitch and i just fucking love listening to the language 2funny4me . 
  sometimes ... 
  its the british illuminati 's fault ... 
  they should of called it : * anti western orthodox-slavic exercise * but that 's not catchy .

  in my opinion we ca n't afford neoliberalism any longer . 
  artificially low wages , lack of safety nets and nonexistent job security for people under 40 are ravaging this country in a ways that we 'll continue to feel for decades . 
  economic model.based on cheap labor is unsustainable , and lack of capital among working people is smothering consumption , preventing creation of homegrown companies and plunging reproduction to unheard of levels . 
  without serious effort to significantly improve wages we will suffer very serious stagnation ( best case scenario ) or a demographic , social and political crisis of possibly massive proportions . 
  why are people getting so worked up over him recently , anyway ? 
  he 's not my political type , but he was n't a bad president either . 
  at least nothing like a trainwreck of kaczy\u0144ski . 
  and while i do n't really care about duda that much , i 'd rather not have him in a palace , on an off-chance that pis wins next year 's election . 
  big misconception in my opinion . 
  sld tried exactly that with og\u00f3rek and once her liberal ways were made public , her support tanked from ~ 12 % to ~ 2 % . 
  support for economic left is at about 30-40 % according to polls and studies . 
  not sure how much you are following the politics , but komorowski 's victory is almost certain . 
  and the fact that you have n't heard much of him is one of the main reasons he is going to win . 
  i bet you heard of his predecessor - kaczy\u0144ski . 
  president in poland has about as much power as president in germany , so after kaczy\u0144ski fiasco the top priority for voters is for him not to create problems . 
  komorowski more or less managed to do that in his 1st term . 
  decent enough . 
  i 'm going to vote for him due to a lack of half-decent leftist candidate . 
  well , maybe i 'll convince myself to vote for palikot , but that 's it . 
  well , one is babbling nonsense about jewish-freemason conspiracy , and other represents the connoisseurs of rabid nationalism . 
  what exactly is left for discussion here ? 
   you know , i 've been living in poland for a while now ; the man , your incumbent , is the one with cheerily orwellian ` accord and security ' slogan plastered all over his benevolently big brother-ish posters , right ? 
  slogan is worthy of condom add , and his campaign was pretty bad ( or so i hear ) , but he 's very much harmless . 
  exactly the reason people are voting for him . 
  and since he was polling close to 50 % from the get go most parties did n't even bother trying . 
  braun and kowalski , respectively . 
  have n't noticed anything like that either . 
  if i were to guess they do n't like american influence ( ttip for example ) , but do n't demonize it . 
  as in pro-putin delusions ? 
  not that i 've noticed . 
  the people involved that i know or know of , are as anti-putin as any reasonable person can be , as far as i know . 
  if it would turn out to be a semi-successful grass-root socialist party like syriza and podemos , but with polish view of russia , it could even be very beneficial eu-wise , by injecting this narrative into european socialist discourse . 
  yeah , i 'm not too keen on 75 % tax myself . 
  things like that tend to get unproportional attention and effort put into them , while are of secondary importance at best . 
  it just is n't worth it politically in my opinion , tho i understand where it 's coming from . 
  i assume it 's more about defending against a perception that the whole plan is about lowering taxes and reinforcing social net . 
  it would make it prone to dismissal on a grounds of social populism and wishful thinking , even tho they are looking for increased revenue in all the right places - changing tax law for international companies making business in poland and closing loopholes . 
  thankfully those more retarded ones ( like freemason guy and nationalist guy ) are waaaay below 1 % . 
  someone linked me [ this ] ( http://partiarazem.pl/program/ ) few days ago here on reddit . 
  it seems very interesting and competent . 
  as far as few pages of text go , that is . 
  i happen to know a few people involved in it ( via my fb friends ) and those are quite capable and smart individuals . 
  i 'm even thinking about getting involved . 
  and yes - i also wish sld a quickest possible demise . 
  have you guys heard of this hot , new invention called `` percentages '' ? 
  i hear it will revolutionize the way data is presented and spell the ending of silly narratives !, 
  that 's what it was designed for , but in some cases it ( like polish one ) it also smothers reasonable ( and reasonable-ish ) opposition parties . 
  problem is that she turned out to have more of a neo-liberal views and her candidacy is pretty much a pathetic trick and a slap in the face of left wing voters by left-wing-only-by-name sld . 
  almost all left leaning people i know do n't vote on her on principle and will most likely end up voting for komorowski , due to a lack of serious left wing candidate . 
  only semi-successful left wing party of recent years is slowly but surely falling apart creating new , even smaller ones atm . 
  candidates of those 2 smaller parties ( including one transgender mp ) did n't manage to get 100.000 signatures required to register their candidature in time . 
  so yes - our left is in constant disarray for ~ 15 years now , despite over 30 % of the voters having left wing beliefs ( according to polls and studies ) . 
  a bit more details for people unfamiliar with our political scene : candidates who can win : - [ bronis\u0142aw komorowski ] ( http://i2.pinger.pl/pgr137/d955569200251aa34c5bc251/bronis%c5%82aw_komorowski_rotcropped.jpg ) current president and a member of a ruling centrist-right party po . 
  only question is if he 'll win in 1st or 2nd round . 
  candidates who can get over 5 % votes : - [ andrzej duda ] ( http://andrzejduda.pl/templates/frontend/dev/images/png/aduda.png ) - candidate of main opposition party conservative pis . 
  he has a shot at getting to the 2nd round with komorowski . 
  - [ pawe\u0142 kukiz ] ( http://bi.gazeta.pl/im/f6/89/bb/z12290550q,pawel-kukiz.jpg ) - 80s and 90s rockman turned conservative-ish , libertarian-ish candidate running on a platform of implementing fptp voting system in parliamentary elections . 
  he managed to get quite a lot of youth votes and is polling as high as 9-15 % . 
  candidates who can get over 2 % votes : - [ janusz korwin-mikke ] ( http://cdn25.se.smcloud.net/t/photos/t/182698/janusz-korwin-mikke_19807720.jpg ) - hardcore libertarian maverick traditionally getting between 1 and 3 % of the votes , mostly from young voters who later grow out of it . 
  he 's polling around 3 % and popularity of kukiz is n't helping him . 
  - [ ma\u0142gorzata og\u00f3rek ] ( http://i.wp.pl/a/f/jpeg/34382/pap_magdalena_ogorek600.jpeg ) - an academic teacher without previous political experience ( or interests as it seems ) brought as a candidate by post-communist , `` left-wing '' sld . 
  she was polling close to 10 % but then she started talking and it turned out that she has rather neo-liberal views and little to no understanding of politics and governing . 
  she is polling around 3 % . 
  most of the left wing voters will most likely vote for komorowski instead . 
  - [ adam jarubas ] ( http://bi.gazeta.pl/im/20/b4/10/z17514784q,adam-jarubas.jpg ) - candidate of rural psl party , a coalition partner of po . 
  presidential elections are traditionally to no interest for them and he is most likely going to get around 2 % of the votes . 
  used to poll close to 10 % , not he 's somewhere between 1 % and 2 % , despite growing approval of his party anti-conservative massage . 
  the rest : - marian kowalski - represents nationalist fringe . 
  under 1 % - grzegorz braun - represents anti-semites and conspiracy theorists . 
  under 1 % - pawe\u0142 tanajno - not really sure what he 's about . 
  liberal left , i assume . 
  under 1 % - jacek wilk - another libertarian candidate , apparently . 
  under 1 %, 
  the what now ? 
  never heard a thing about that . 
  so it 's almost the same as ours . 
  every * wojew\u00f3dztwo * ( sort of as your * land * ) has different lists of representatives to vote for . 
  those lists that get past the treshold ( controversial 5 % as well ) get a number of sits that are assigned to people on the list based on amount of votes their got . 
  i 'd say that dropping the treshold to 2,5-3 % would make it a very solid system . 
  while most of us ca n't help themselves , but enjoy ukip 's demise , the fact that 12,6 % of votes turns into 0,15 % of representation is a democratic failure of massive proportions . 
  what brits think of their voting system ? 
  what others ? 
  hardly a big issue with 649 other mps to stop her from apparently ruining the country . 
  she may yet prove very competent , despite young age . 
  what he said is confirmed in the 2nd bloody sentence of the damn article you linked . 
  you are absolutely the worst kind of stupid . 
  one who is sure of the opposite . 
   i read the programme , and while most points of it are the exact opposite of what i support ( and i almost asked myself if this is for serious a few times ) not on all counts , i hope . 
   it would be nice to have such party as a constructive opposition instead of the current left . 
  good luck . 
  compared to the bloody sld they sure seem like a second coming of ~ ~ marx ~ ~ kuro\u0144 . 
  75 % is for those earning over 500.000 pln/year with 15 % for the poorest and with tax-free amount equal to 12 times `` social minimum '' - an amount of money required per person to function for a month . 
  at this point it 's ~ 850-1050 pln/family member depending on the size of said family . 
  hmm , that 's not bad . 
  not bad at all . 
  only few ideas i did n't like were limited office terms and referendums and some bits about public employment , but that 's more of a caution than disagreement . 
  thanks a lot - i 'll keep a close look . 
  hell , if they prove competent and realistic enough i may even get involved in something like that for the 1st time in my life . 
  more like 20-30 % , but yeah . 
  it 's ridiculous .

  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/volhynia_experiment )  while in soviet union those were soviet republics with their own governments ? 
  yeah , the generalgouvernment in german-ocupied poland also had `` its own government '' . 
  could you remind me how many ukrainians died in an artifical famine caused by soviet policies - holodomor ? 
  i 'm sure they were thrilled that at least it all happened under `` their own government '' . 
   small areas , except wilno , in which case it was condition of lithuanian integration to the soviet union . 
  `` let 's conquer this ethnically polish area . 
  we will then give it to another country ( we plan to conquer next year anyway ) so nothing to see here . '', 
   so we burn it , then we rebuild it and it ours ? 
  cool . 
  lithuanians were stil pagans back then , and were not polish allies until 30 years later . 
   while poland while taking what never was theirs = not aggressor . 
  if russia-muscovy conquering lands that 400-500 years earlier belonged to * other * east slavic duchies conquered by golden horde , then by lithuania and ultimately inherited by poland counts as `` retaking what is ours '' , then conquering lands that 120 years earlier were integral parts of the commonwealth definitely surely also qualifies this way . 
  oh , i forgot about the special russian perk , my bad . 
   kill the rurikovich local dynasty , occupy land , funnily enough , the last duke from the rurikovich local dynasty was killed by his own nobles , after he seeked cooperation with the kingdom of poland . 
  he died childless , and the king of poland was his direct heir . 
  while the local nobles who killed the duke in the first place probably had a different succession plans , the polish army secured the lawful succession . 
  completely regular medieval politics . 
   in any case do n't compare russian-polish border wars considering that those `` russian-polish border wars '' ended up with poland completely ceasing to exist for over a century , and russia brutally occupying the core part of our country including our capital for all that time , i would n't consider it to be the most faithful name . 
   what a salad must be in someone 's brain to say that there were slaves in soviet union . 
  yeah , those millions of innocent gulag prisoners worked to death in siberian taiga were clearly on vaccation there . 
   indeed you were . 
  pilsudski troops even took kiev and minsk and were n't meant to stop there . 
  and he did it while fighting alongside belarusian and ukrainian allies . 
  ( soviet ) russia does not have a monopoly to be a sole ally of those nations , despite what your internal propaganda could lead you to believe . 
  of course , after you have almost conquered our country again a few months later , and then we somehow managed to push you back we have unfortunately settled for a limited-victory peace treaty , thus betraying our ukrainian allies . 
  that 's indeed a dark card in our history , but sadly after summer 1920 i doubt we could beat soviet russia decisively enough to secure both ukrainian and belarusian independence . 
   you can even overlap modern borders of ukraine and belarus and see that those are the same of the 1939 ` invasion ' which in fact was retaking land populated by ukrainians , russians and belarussians . 
  you can also notice that the 1939 borders included significant areas which had a marginal population of ukrainians , russians and belarusians , most notably wilno , \u0141om\u017ca and bia\u0142ystok areas . 
   warsaw , \u0141\u00f3d\u017a or lublin were not disputed by soviet union . 
  yeah , though i wonder how could they possibly until that point experienced about 100 years of russian rule , from which they were liberated only by the armies of the central powers a few years earlier . 
  a great mystery indeed , though it definitely does not include any russian invasion at any point . 
   actually lvov was founded by russian/ukrainian prince daniel of galicia . 
  the town itself had important polish majority , but all the villages around it were ukrainian . 
  it was also completely burned down by a lithuanian raid in 1356 , and then rebuilt from scractch as a polish city . 
   the border never was stable . 
  is just in 1667 poland reached it maximum of russian lands conquered and after this point you just shrank . 
  we reached our maximum in * 1618 * . 
  in 1654-67 war you were already the agressor , and in 1667 peace treaty you have reconquered everything poland ever took from russia/muscovy , and a significant part of lands inherited by poland from lithuania which never belonged to russia/muscovy ( even if they were conquered by * lithuania * from * ruthenian golden horde tributaries * 400 years earlier ) . 
  considering that latter is indirect on * both * sides of the conflict , it 's stretching the idea of `` reconquest '' so much , that the polish 1920 kiev offensive could also easily qualify as such . 
   lvov was part of poland ( after you assassinated it 's heirs btw ) and stopped being in 1794 . 
  well , it would be hard for it to remain being a part of poland considering that thanks to intensive russian efforts ( with prussian and austrian cooperation ) poland kinda ceased to exist . 
  as soon as we regained statehood , lw\u00f3w again became a part of poland . 
   in any case it is disputed land , you can not call this invasion . 
  yes , you `` can not call it an invasion '' because it was a land * inherited * 600 years earlier from a * ruthenian * duchy . 
  on the other hand fighting a war of independence on lands that were a part of your country 100 years earlier before it got conquered is clearly an invasion . 
  apparently this is russia 's special perk - even the most bullshit of their claims remain valid for eternity , while the opposite is true for anyone fighting with russia . 
   edit : did you just rewrote all you original message ? 
  kind of . 
  i have a broken keyboard and it was sent before it was ready . 
  i initially tried to fix it ad-hoc , but the changes were big enough i decided to delete it and post it once more . 
  i wrote this one in notepad to avoid such problem again . 
   1919 polish newly reborn state was the aggressor of course we were the agressor !, 
  we even dared to take such `` historically russian '' cities like warsaw , \u0141\u00f3d\u017a or lublin !, 
  it 's hard not to be an `` agressor '' in an independence war . 
  and , of course , pressing 500 year claims ( and accidentally conquering a bunch of land which never had anything to do even with those weak claims ) is perfectly alright when you are russia , but when you are poland ... even figgting for your independence seems to be `` agression '' . 
  poor , poor russia . 
   1939 those territories were simply retaken . 
  yeah , especially the city of lw\u00f3w , which never had anything to do with russia before that point , or area of \u0141om\u017ca and bia\u0142ystok which was about 100 % ethnically polish . 
   the border was swifting to one side or another since 1300 's to 1794 , not 600 . 
  the border was completely stable ever since 1667 - after finishing your succesful invasion that year you even signed the `` eternal peace '' with us . 
  fast foward 100 years and you are completely eradicating our country in cooperation with prussia . 
  but no-no , you are * totally * not an agressor . 
   the 600 years talk is non-sense . 
  sure , it is . 
  for example the lw\u00f3w area was a part of poland since 1340 , and never had anything to do with any russias , ruses or ruthenias until ussr conquered it in 1939 . 
  the average might be a bit lower , about 400-500 years though . 
  i knew you would try such bullshit excuse , that 's why i have selected the wars which were primarily about destroying the existence of the polish state . 
  conquering lands lost 600 years earlier by a country whose connection to russia was loose at best was somewhere between a convenient * casus belli * and an added bonus in all of those cases . 
   curiously it was another way around , western europe invading russia at all historical points . 
  yeah , those [ 1792 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polish%e2%80%93russian_war_of_1792 ) , [ 1794 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ko%c5%9bciuszko_uprising ) , [ 1919 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polish%e2%80%93soviet_war ) and [ 1939 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/soviet_invasion_of_poland ) western invasions of russia ... oh , wait . 
   poland being attacked with or without us soldiers is ww3 whatever way you look at it . 
  i would n't bet on it . 
  russia attacked ukraine as recently as last year , and the only reaction was a collective shrug of shoulders . 
  now , if some allied soldiers would be the ones to die in an unlikely invasion of our country , that would make a much stronger safety guarantee than even a dozen of ( ultimately ) worthless treaties . 
   'd just rather not make ourselves a target by hosting missile sites before hand as i already said , we are not * making * ourselves a target , we already were a target all along . 
  russians have military bases and missiles targeting our cities stationed 300km from our capital . 
  that 's * precisely * why we are inviting americans here , not the other way around . 
   zero benefit , us army stationing in poland makes it more likely that they will deliver on their alliance promises . 
  after 1939 we are kinda touchy on this subject . 
   congratulations you became a target ? 
  we 've been a russian target since 1600s , so nothing changed . 
  at least we are a target * with american soldiers * on our soil , that 's better than being a target without them . 
  oh , sure , but fortunately for us all russia is not even close to the soviet union in terms of power and potential , and they do n't occupy and pillage half of europe anymore . 
  `` new cold war '' ? 
  with such diaproportion in power it would barely affect us . 
  the sooner russians realize they ca n't keep up with nato , the better , but until it happens i 'd take american bases here anytime just in case . 
  i also find the fact that you mentioned `` blowjob jokes '' incredibly ironic , because ( in context ) they referred * precisely * to the american prolonged inability to deliver on their missile shield bases in poland promise . 
  well , we are by far the biggest country in the region , so it only makes sense that most foreign companies planning to sell their stuff in this general area locate their factories and distribution centers in our country . 
  they already promised us the missile shield a decade ago . 
  glad they finally delivered on their promise . 
  at last . 
   us trying to neuter russia oh no , russia wo n't be able to threaten everyone so easily anymore :( the more russia is neutered , the better . 
  that does n't contradict my initial point . 
  yeah , our industry would simply go bankrupt then instead of being sold for pennies , because either way nobody would want to buy the outdated , overpriced , low quality crap produced by it . 
   exectly , you think ireland feels all warm from it ? 
  well , it turns out that * united kingdom * did the exact same thing about the lands where people indentyfying with their country lived , that you explicitly said they * would n't * . 
  interestingly enough , it even happened in the exact same time period the whole wilno conflict . 
  on your other points i agree with you . 
   the only reason they supported it to maintain less balance in our country . 
  it 's their strategy and it 's still going on ( e.g.

  - it seemed to be well with us they feel they indeed said so , and here a great surprise when we found an empty apartment even without a farewell letter . 
  although it 's been a few days , i see that many parishioners can not recover from this situation , that we opened our hearts , and they disappeared . 
  you can see the sadness in the parish - he adds . 
   they should n't be poles anymore , they are born in and live in lithuania . 
  i 'm not sure if you are trolling . 
   or the poles should maybe start integrating after decades of living here . 
  you know how all of this ' - ization ' is hard to conduct . 
  we tried with you for hundreds of years and you can see the results . 
  poles living in lithuania did not migrate there . 
  they are living there for generations . 
  it was the answer to [ glinciszki massacre ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/glinciszki_massacre ) made by lithuanians . 
  some historians claim that it was an independent decision of the local commander , not a command superiors ak . 
  but yes - killing innocent people is awfull . 
  and killing 30 people is not the same as killing dozens of thousands . 
  but can you provide any link from reliable source ( not describing it ) that claimes your thesis :  it did as much shit as ukrainians , if not more . 
   there 's culture differences in many more occasions than you 'd think . 
  could you give some examples ? 
  just curious . 
   well , dzier\u017cy\u0144ski was 100 % a polish noble ... oh please do n't give him yet another ammo for his personal war . 
   just wait ; soon pis history textbooks will be praising them as heroes while vilifying bartoszewski or edelman . 
  this is not a gw forum , please try to keep the level . 
  imho this article is biased . 
  if you know russian or ukrainian language you can find many movies about life in poland made by them in youtube . 
  imho they are just fine . 
  the ukrainian buthurts is about the resolution of the polish parliament concerning volhynia masacre . 
  keep going that way  and i was talking about current migrants and not people living there for generations . 
   i love the irony of how eastern europeans keep insisting on free movement so that millions of them can move to western europe but their own countries are actually extremely xenophobic . 
  we have few hundred of thousends of ukrainians in poland . 
  and they are fine . 
   so it 's even not his memories . 
  just third-party stories . 
  cool so it 's a lie ? 
   as any freedom fighters or army . 
  there were casualties among civil population . 
  so all armies are genociders now ? 
  they were goal not a casualties of fight between soldiers . 
   he is talking about 1942 . 
  it 's over one-hour video - where exactly he is talking about 1942 ? 
  it would be easier if you have any written realiable source . 
  there is no rajmund rajs ( bury ) street in poland on the other hand . 
  and they are not worshiped in history manuals . 
  one / u/ruzhanovskiy is active here like 100 poles , 
   how many do you remember pre-3 years old ? 
  he is talking about his parents and family memories . 
   nope upa did not kill children , woman and villagers ? 
   you can start from this . 
  he is talking about 1944 and you claimed , that  that massacres of their people [ ukrainians ] began earlier , in 1942 , when poles wiped out thousands of ukrainian villagers in the predominantly polish areas of kholm have you got any reliable source about your claim ? 
    there are tons of written memories  bullshit [ here ] ( http://natemat.pl/138643,miroslaw-hermaszewski-ocalalem-z-rzezi-wolynskiej-nie-ruszac ) you have momories of miros\u0142aw hermaszewski - the first polish cosmonaut . 
  he survived the massacre . 
    volhynia massacre  you mean volhynia liberation from polish nazi collaborators and occupants . 
  by killing children , woman and neighbours - only becouse they were poles . 
    have you got anything about your statement ? 
   sure than write it here . 
  there are tons of written memories of volhynia massacre . 
  have you got anything about your statement ? 
  for me , underrated factor in the collapse of the rzeczypospolita was the swedish [ deluge ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/deluge_\\ ( history \\ ) ) . 
  the invasion by the swedish army and its allies ( brandenburg-prussia and transilvania ) , resulted in the loss of 25 % of the population in four core polish provinces . 
  lesser poland lost 23 % of population , mazovia 40 % in villages and 70 % in towns , greater poland 50 % in villages and 60 % in towns . 
  royal prussia lost some 60 % of its population . 
   there was a need for reforms . 
  [ constitution_of_may_3 , _ 1791 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/constitution_of_may_3,_1791 ) . 
   as far as i remember there is some religious stigma and taboo in jewish religion concerning removing dead body from the ground . 
  hope we are secular country . 
   ukrainians claim that massacres of their people began earlier , in 1942 , when poles wiped out thousands of ukrainian villagers in the predominantly polish areas of kholm any sources ? 
  the jedwabne issue is controversial imho . 
  discussion in poland started after publication by gross . 
  he claimed that it was 1600 jews burned in a barn - which was physically impossible . 
  there were more controversial statements in his book . 
  then ipn ( polish historian institute ) started their investigation . 
  during the archeological works some of the bullets ( locals have no arms ) and big statue of lenin was found in the barn . 
  after that , the exhumation works was forced to stop on demand of chief rabbies of poland . 
  the ipn continue their investigation , but can only base on statements of witnesses taken by communist regime police in 1946 . 
  i do not understand , why we can make a full exhumation in cases such as katy\u0144 or srebrenica but not in the case of jedwabne . 
  imho it would help to find the objective truth . 
  i showed only few possibilities to show , that e-currency would not get rid of corruption . 
  of course you can fill the list with more examples . 
   that would be the end of 95 % of all corruption . 
  corruption can be done in many different ways - diamonds , gold , etc. 
  and electronic currency has its own disadvantages . 
   better women you mean more ` open minded ' , ` progressive ' , ` modern ' , ` undemanding ' , ` direct ' , ` uninhibited ' . 
  do you know any other synonyms of ` easy ' word ? 
   what the fuck mate ? 
  do you mean it 's overpaid ? 
  maybe he took a red pill . 
   `` hey , must have been a muslim right !, 
  watch out for the muslims , all of them are potential terrorists ! '', 
   `` this poor guy , he looked like a middle eastern men , he should not be treated differently ! '', 
  according to [ this ] ( http://wiadomosci.onet.pl/trojmiasto/gdansk-mowil-o-zamiarze-uzycia-bomby-urodzony-w-armenii-mezczyzna-musial-opuscic/pns6j4 ) a passenger accused him to talk about ` intention to use a bomb ' . 
  hope you are a minority . 
  and if any of poles living in lithuania from centuries is reading this - please be sure that we know and care about you . 
  according to [ this ] ( http://wiadomosci.onet.pl/trojmiasto/gdansk-mowil-o-zamiarze-uzycia-bomby-urodzony-w-armenii-mezczyzna-musial-opuscic/pns6j4 ) a passenger accused him to talk about ` intention to use a bomb ' . 
  both were questioned , then they were released . 
  the man was apologised . 
  what would you do , being on duty at the airport , if a passenger accused someone of suspicious behavior ? 
  check him or let him go ? 
   now imaging poland with 600k net immigration from a poorer country each year . 
  [ ukrainian ] ( http://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-europe-migrants-poland-ukraine-idukkcn0uy2bn ) ambassaor in poland :  `` taking into account the number of visas in previous years , and the dynamics of the near-border movement , i suspect that over the course of a year there could be up to a million ukrainians on polish territory , '' and we have no problem with them . 
   mickiewicz considered himself as lithuanian and lithuania as his homeland , you mean the first verse of his ` pan tadeusz ' poem or was it more examples ? 
  i read about mi\u0142osz , that some of lithuanians and belorussian scietists considered him lithanian/belorusian too . 
   [ the prosecutor 's office takes criminal investigation against two of the portuguese perjury , of which one of them had to be in rzeszow victim of a racist incident .
